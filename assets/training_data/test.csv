0,"EDIT: I wish I could give these zero stars. I used them about 5 or 6 times and the last 3 times, they cut out more than they stayed solid. In the middle of my run last night, I chunked them into the local garbage dumpster. When I say &#34;cut out&#34; I mean stopped connecting and playing for a full second or two, came back on for a half second then back out for one or more seconds. Continuously. After 30 minutes of it, I gave up. Don't waste your money on these. There are many options out there for less money that have perfect verified purchase reviews.<br /><br />I've only used these twice, but I love them so far. I've had no issues as have been mentioned by some reviewers. They were easy to charge, easy to pair with my Samsung S7 Edge and fit great and stay put through my workouts which include jogging and weight/bench/core work. The bass sounds really good and the volume offers quite a large range (HINT: if it's not loud enough, turn the volume up on the PHONE and the earbuds will follow suit). I love the carrying case; it's perfect to keep all of the goodies in (you get the ear buds, several replacement tips in different sizes, two charging cords, and the case. I've never tried any of the expensive buds but since I've found these, I don't need to. I can't imagine that the $200 ear buds would sound any better than these."
1,"Excellent product and guarantee, after 6 months the battery died, I call the phone to the guarantee just a few questions and they sent the new replacement"
1,"Pretty big for my small ears. Don't always connect well, switch to phone sound when call comes in while listening to music. Cord is long between buds and the piece to shorten them falls off. But it does an OK job for sound, better than without them on my iphone 5s."
1,They fit great . I think I will be very happy with this purchase. Received on time.
1,Great quality and sound.  Comfortable fit.
1,"I've enjoyed better sound acoustics with other corded earbuds, like Beats, but it is still very good, especially for wireless. The sound quality is better than some expensive earbuds I've tried and not too far below the better ones I've used. I waited a little bit to test durability and so far, it's holding up well. The ear hooks are a little too floppy but having a hard hook would probably be uncomfortable. I've used it at the gym and so far, it's kept up with me. You will get static if it is too far away from you. Despite, what it says in the informational booklet, you do not have 3 feet of coverage. I don't believe it gives you the full 8 hours of playtime but I do fast forward and answer calls frequently so that may take up some life. I can go through the day without having to charge, which is about 3 hours of play time; however, I would not be able to go through 2 full days, maybe 1.5. It gives you some choices in size of silicone ear pieces, depending on whether you want more bass. Only 3 choices, but that's enough for me. I do highly recommend them, especially for the price. This is now my go to buds going forward. I find no need to go back to corded sets. If they last over a year, I will consider them fantastic as some of my expensive buys have not even lasted a full year."
1,"So I've bought these and they did pretty well at the beginning. Still kind of hurt your ear but not to bad. Now they just say power on but nothing happens at all. I loved having bluetooth headphones for my workout, now i can't use them. Had less than a year"
1,"They sound great. They work at a good distant. Only reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 Is because if you have small ears like me, even with the small Barbuda, They fall out of my ears a lot if I'm working out."
1,work great! i use them everyday.
1,Best beats knockoffs I've tried.
1,Lasted exactly one year.
1,This product is amazing for the money. Worthy of 5star.
1,"Only had a couple of days, but am enjoying quality sound in an inexpensive,but useful package."
1,"I had purchased another brand but returned them because the earbuds would not stay in my ear. These headphones are a much higher quality, the sound is clear and the case to store them in is a bonus."
1,Great!! long battery life. Use these everyday!!
1,5 star service all around .. happy I decided to try Senso out GREAT decision!
1,Awesome extras
1,"They just don't loop around my ear, not even my boyfriends ears and the right one with all the buttons, it pops in my ear every time i put it in its really loud and it hurts so i just don't use that one, other then that they work alright, i like the case it helps not to lose them In my bag. But what more do you want from a brand you've never herd of i think its alright for now."
1,"Amazing sound, great bass, great battery life, MUST BUY for a great sounding budget bluetooth earphones!"
0,"Stopped working after a few weeks, won't charge. Tech support answered the first email with instructions to do a factory reset. After that didn't work, support stopped responding."
1,Operates better than expected and they are very comfortable even when I am running.<br />April 2020: Still work great and I use them as my work phone as well as running three times a week.
1,High amounts of wind noise when on a bicycle and bass level is subpar for ear bids
1,"First off the quality of this product is phenomenal, I love these headphones and would highly recommend them to anyone in the market that is looking for a inexpensivehigh quality product! Secondly their customer service is 100000 percent! A glitch in my headphones prevented them from turning on and they sent out a new pair through the 1 year warranty immediately! Love this product and would buy again!"
0,Even the slightest movement causes these to fall out of your ears. I have to constantly push them back into my ears while I was running and because the on and off button is right where you have to press on the unit is constantly being turned off when you press it back into your ears. very frustrating; don't buy
1,"First day Impressions: For 30 bucks, this is really a decent product for a headphones. It comes with nice packaging that includes headphones, 3 pairs of ear pieces for different sizes of ear fittings that fits snug without any discomfort and stays still to wide range of everyday physical activities like running, workouts or any sports. Also includes a short USB cable for charging and a nice zipped case for easy carryon (even in a pocket) and bonus is an additional pair of USB cable that has both android and iphone supported AND a car charger. Will post an other one after some regular usage of the product."
1,"Excellent headphones, everything was held to high standard, just some common sense stuff for usage here, if your rubber buds are not the right size make sure you use the right size for your ears and these headphones will work excellent, I had my AC and my fan on and the headphones worked so well they cancelled out the noise of both, highly recommend"
1,Easy to pair with Bluetooth. Fast delivery and like the 1 year warranty
1,"Sound quality is good ear comfort is good, but sound quality for people I am speaking to on the phone is bad. My friends complain when I'm speaking to them via the headset that it's difficult to hear me and the reverberation is bad."
1,"These are fantastic for the price, can't go wrong.  Super comfortable and good battery life.  The extra stuff that comes with it is great also."
1,Item as described. Fast shipping as advertised. Good sound quality. Only one drawback: wind noise captured by mikes while running against it.
0,I actually like these headphones but the first pair I bought the left side stop working around the 6 month point. The second pair barely last 2 months. I'm not buying a 3rd.
1,"These are great! However, it's better to use these in the gym, there's a lot of wind noise outdoors but that didn't cause me to return them. They are so good that they've been hijacked by my boyfriend. I'm going to order another pair."
1,These earbuds are awesome I like them some much that going to order some for my wife
1,"Average product. They are flimsy, but are comfortable because of the limp ear loops. I don't think anyone who exercises would want to wear these because they are loose. As for sound quality, they are not horrible, but they are certainly not great. If you're ok with average stuff at a relatively low price, get them, they're ok."
1,"I like them at the price point, but the connecting line is very annoying; it's too long, can't be adjusted, and it sticks to my skin since it's slightly rubbery in texture. This is especially annoying if I use the headphones for working out. The manufacturers should design it so that the length can be adjustable and the texture won't catch on skin."
1,"The sound is great for these, but the part that goes in your ear is a little bulky. I don't know if I have smaller ears than most, but I usually have to readjust a few times when I run to keep them in place. Otherwise the sound and voice are great."
1,Excellent product
1,"Have not had opportunity to use microphone yet. When inserted, and you get a good seal, the outside world disappears."
1,"These are the best buds I've found , excellent battery life,  and sound great . I can get almost 2 days out of one charge.  I bought a second pair so I don't have to wait for them to charge . I highly recommend these . I never had any problems with them and I sweat a lot"
0,It doesn't fit properly in to the ears while running and was under a different impression after reading the review before purchase. Thanks
1,"I have been VERY satisfied with these headphones. The connect to my phone almost immediately went turned on. The battery lasts much longer than I had anticipated! The case, cords and car adapter are great and very innovative with microUsb and Apple lightning connector on the same cord. I use the red foam pads which are most comfortable for me and I even used the headphones in the shower to test out the IXP7 water resistance rating without any issue whatsoever. Directions and manuals are clear and straight forward. Overall, you can tell that the product and care taken with packaging and everything that comes with the headphones, this company is doing a great job and delivering a superb product that is well worth the already reasonable cost."
1,"These earbuds have a great sound, I have a couple of Bose earbuds and these bead the Bose sound in my opinion. The only problem I would see if you wear glasses the ear piece goes around the front of your ear and would make wearing glasses difficult."
1,"I purchased this Senso headset for my wife as a Christmas gift and this one is a hit!  We are both amazed at the quality of this product, right down from the packing that the unit came in, to the build and sound quality, and all the accessories like the carrying case, extra ear buds, etc.  My wife uses the headset on a daily basis and she notes the battery lasts for several hours on a charge, and I’m thankful for the noise isolation when I’m sleeping and she’s watching a movie.  Lastly, their customer support is just AWESOME!  The carrying case had some stitching issues, which was no big deal, but I decided to contact their support.  I gotten someone to respond back within minutes, and was shipped a replacement case instantly!  Overall, just AMAZED with this product and service!  :)"
1,Very happy with this item. It can be a little bass but I found using the Equalizer on my iPhone took care of that good noice cancelling I have Three of these. Good case charger etc great value and quality. Enjoy highly recommend
1,These perform as advertised and were very reasonably priced when on sale. Would buy again.
1,Wonderful! Can't believe all you get for the price.
1,I have only had these for one day but I have to say that I tried many earbuds over the years and these are the only pair I have been able to keep in my ears.  The others always fall out but these are so far so good.
1,"After a couple of false starts buying in-ear headphones, THESE ARE THE ONES! For the money, they are the best out there. They produce enough base, at a reasonable cost."
0,These head phones pause when I'm walking let alone running. I have another set of Skull Candy wireless that rarely skips.<br /><br />It is a real problem. Buy better quality headphones.
1,They sound wonderful but they fall apart and leave pieces everywhere this is the second pair of had to take on not like it even though they do sound wonderful
1,"I've had these for about 5 months,so far so good! I use them to mow the grass, and work out, It feels like the battery last for about a week.<br /><br />update: My Senso's ear buds finally gave up after over 3 years of everyday use. Even though I'll have to buy more earbuds, I'm very satisfied with this purchase."
0,"Thought these were great, until they stopped working six months after I bought them."
1,"The Bluetooth Senso Headphone works great, the sound is really good even when running on my treadmill. I have no issues with it since I bought it 8 months ago."
1,Well worth the money.  No bulky headphones and I can answer my phone if necessary.  Love it.
1,Good product but at low volumes or paused music or video u can hear high pitched buzzing in the background. May be a defect.
1,I'm pretty impressed by these. I had a pair of Bose earbuds that I'm not too impressed by. I also have some Jaybirds that are awesome but my wife stole them from me. So I figured I'd try these since the price was great. They sound amazing and are very comfortable. Its not nearly as compact at the Jaybirds but for the money they are very very good.
1,Work great!  My son loves them!  He will probably have hearing damage in no time!  Lol. Kidding... Sort of.
1,"work well, fit pretty good. If there are lights on the earbuds, they are so dim I can't find them, but with the audible confirmations they are probably not needed that often."
1,Shipping was fast and quality seems excellent! Great sound!
0,Terrible...they kept cutting out after 2 weeks of use. I had to order a new set (different brand) because they were so bad.
1,I giving them to my son for Christmas. I'm hoping he likes them.
1,"Good clear sound quality! Battery Life is great! Can beat the quality of this product for the price, highly recommend."
1,My first out of box experience is great. Will update if needed. Paired up to all of my devices without a problem. &#34;
0,Do not buy these. They’re not worth the low price. I’ve purchased two sets of these and had trouble with both. Bluetooth disconnects frequently even within arms reach of the device! Batteries don’t hold a charge very well. Serves me right for buying the second set I guess.
0,"besides being big and clumsy, they paired once only to never pair again to my iPhone 6.  I have tried many times and have reset them to factory settings, reset the connection on my cell, but the message always comes back that they are off or unable to connect.  I was able to use them once for 10 minutes before they disconnected, never to be able to connect again."
1,"I just got these a few days ago but I am absolutely floored by the sound quality, ease of use, comprehensive packaging including cords, chargers for homemamd car, and hard case for protection, and amazing customer service. I will update as needed but I intend to get another pair for my son, who's iPhone 5 has a broken headphone jack and hasn't been able to listen to music QUIETLY (😬) For about a year!<br />So pleased."
1,The sound is clear and loud which is what we were looking for.
1,Great sound at a great price! Wife and I both have a pair and like the Senso more than any other pair we have had in the past.
1,great headphones for the price.
1,Not perfect acoustics but for the money and for use in a gym I think they're great.
1,"Best Wireless Headphones Ever Tried. When I first put them on to test them, the sound was so good that I didn't take them off until the battery died."
1,"I picked these up to be a pair of comfortable budget wireless headphones for relaxing when in a bath, shower or just allowed to wear relaxed when working out. I bought these to compare to the Plantronics BackBeat Fit which also has a IP rating for waterproofing and I must say between the price and quality of everything these were the way to go. At a Price of $32 you get a great pair of comfortable and loud waterproof headphones for every scenario that I have found that has a very average microphone but still better when working out then the Plantronics BackBeat Fit. Between the better mic, louder sound and more comfortable design while still being waterproof and half to a third of the price this is a definite buy for your workout or relaxation at the beach/pool days.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Loud but Clear Sound<br />Very Comfortable<br />Truly Waterproof<br />Buttons are Crisp to Press<br />Lots of Accessories included for Everything You'll Want or Need<br /><br />Cons:<br />Microphone is Okay Quality at Best<br />Material of Headset can Feel a Bit Cheap"
1,"Overall, decent for the price. Limited features, but not unreasonable for the price. Battery usually good for several hours. Biggest disappointment is that the only way to know the battery is getting low is when the intrinsic voice notifies you, and that's literally thirty seconds before they die. If you don't have backups, be ready to finish up your workout like right now."
1,"These have great reviews so I bought them. But they didn't fit my ears very well - fine, but returned."
1,Good headphones for the price. Sound quality is also good. The only thing that bothers me is the loop around the ears is flimsy rubber and it doesn't stay on my ears and they fall out. It would have been nice if they had a metal wire in the loop for adjustment. Other than that they are worth the money.
1,These are the best ear buds I have ever used!! Deep bass crystal clear mid range !! They rock!!
1,"Very good quality headphones, arrived on time with good quality package."
1,"So far so good!  Excellent features and accessories, easy to use and good sound for a wireless headphone.  I'd expect to pay much more for this"
1,Enjoying the earbuds ... Even bought a second pair as a gift for me daughter.
1,Nicely packaged and appear to have all functions I need at a great price.
0,"Bought two - one for my son and one for my husband. They both love them!<br /><br />Update: my son has had these headphones since Christmas. He uses them when he warms up for a wrestling match, so they don’t get beat up or used continuously. Recently, they broke. I’m very disappointed in their longevity. The return window has closed, but I’d love to hear from the company."
0,"I bought these for running.  They only work if I'm holding the iPod ridiculously close to the headphones; when I put it in my pocket, I get nothing but static.  This was a waste of money."
0,"Great wireless headset. Works perfectly. Long battery life and respectable range.<br /><br />Edit:<br />After 5 months of minimal use, the power switch failed. They sounded great while they worked, but manufacturing process must be slipshod for the power switch to fail after only 5 months. Very disappointed here..."
1,"I liked the ease of setting up, the quality and sound is great!"
1,"Had a pair for several years but the plastic covering the wire started to break/peel away, so I bought a new pair. After three months of use, the left ear bud now has a faint rapid beeping sound. Every five seconds or so, it beeps really quickly (almost like the sound of the phone ringing when you call someone) but it's faint. I don't really hear it when I listen to music, but if I'm listening to a podcast or TV/movie where there isn't constant sound, it's very distracting and annoying. I didn't have this issue with my first pair so maybe this is just a fluke. Otherwise great for the price."
1,Very comfortable with great sound.
1,"I use these headphones walking around the city to get to work. The sound quality is fabulous, but these headphones aren't the most secure. I would not use them while exercising."
1,"Love em, used them a lot. Also great customer service. The free accessories are also very nice especially the car magnet holder"
0,Sound was good but when I went to charge it through a USB port on my iMac and a standard USB cable the end of the cable plugged into the headphones melted! Completely fried. The cable was fused to the headphones and they are completely useless. It was burnt enough that left me worried it could cause a fire.
1,Great wireless headphones.
1,"Very happy with these after using them at the gym for a week.  Well made, good sound quality."
1,I love them the plastic bar that actually turns them on and off over time breaks but for the price you cant beat. Also the new gifts I don't understand them magnet ven holder sticker cardCVholder for phone a no no
1,Great headphones.
1,"These are more bang for your buck than any other wireless headphones I have ever owned. I highly recommend that if you are shopping for a pair, look no further."
0,Great for 2 months then the button stopped working and no longer turn on. Buy something better.
1,Thank you for a quality product and exceptional customer support!  My son loves the headphones.
1,Love these headphones! I run in them daily and have no issues. They stay in place & also the battery life is great.
1,"love the fit, sound quality is great, last over 12 hrs playing movies and youtube standby"
1,"I've had these for about 14 months and am not the least bit careful with how I use them--I wear them while working out (and get super sweaty), stuff them and rip them out of my bag, and sometimes accidentally leave them on. Considering that, these headphones have held up exceedingly well! I just bought a second pair for my husband to wear running. They DO NOT come off during weightlifting, handstands, gymnastics, etc. The audio quality might not be the same level as bose, but they are crystal clear for bluetooth headphones (and especially for the price). The bluetooth works great within about 25-30 feet, even with a case on my phone or if it's in my pocket/bag. Easy to pair, and holds charge for quite a while (can usually get through a week of workouts, which is about 8 hours). Get these!"
0,If you need to submerge the headphone it will not resist. Used only once to swim and the product does not work anymore.
0,"Every two weeks or so the headphones switched to Chinese. Took me a while to figure out how to switch back to English. Power off button works about half the time. Eventually overheated and died, after owning for just a few month. Tried three pairs, switching to another brand."
1,The sound quality was great but it started to sound really weird with bass. Noise cancellation is okay but when you have them like right inside your ear but it never really seems to stick well. I always feel like I have to adjust them for some reason. It feels odd wearing them. The part that goes over your ear is very flexible but feels weird. It seems to always be mois or oily I guess it's just how my ears are especially when working out it can be hard to adjust and stay on.
1,Good sound and good battery life.
1,I am truly amazed at the sound quality and battery life for this price.  Great product!
1,The sound is pretty good; one major complaint I have is how loosely it fits my ears and I have to constantly mess with it during running or exercising to keep it close to my ears.
0,"Unfortunately, they cut out often.  It is not consistently, but enough that I am looking for a new pair of Bluetooth headphones.  I do appreciate how comfortable they are, however."
1,Very comfortable. Surprised how well they stay on ears.
1,2nd pair that I've bought...1st was for my husband. We both loved them so I had to get myself a pair.
0,"I was looking for a good pair of wireless headphones for running, and I liked the over-the-ear loop on these, which helps keep them secure.  The carrying case is also a handy place to store the headphones.  Unfortunately, I found out that these are also somewhat bulkier than they look.  The part that each ear bud is attached to is a fairly large rectangle that houses the battery.  It sticks out further than you would think, and I found that it creates distracting wind noise simply from running.  The airflow seems to catch on the rectangles with the Senso logo and the noise then goes into your ear.  If there is also any actual wind, the headphones are  pretty close to unusable.  This would be fine for gym workouts or just listening to music, but they are not good for running."
0,Terrible sound quality. Pure garbage.
0,"Started out working well, but recently it disconnects and then reconnects randomly. Thought it had to do with the phone switching back and forth from wifi to cell service, but they did the same with downloaded music. Now they are only good for annoying me because I'm stuck with them."
0,"It's falling out every time I try to run, it's bulky and can hear the wind when I run. I will return it after a few days if problem still persists"
1,"Believe it or not, this head set is much better than a lot of other sets worth over 100 $, I bought 5 of those and i still couldnt find one that would be as loud as this one."
1,"I used these headphones EVERYDAY for about 7 months straight.I use them in the gym, going to class, on my bike and skateboard. They sound great, are easy to fit in my pocket, and connect to my phone (OnePlus 5T) really fast. They work well with my iPad too! The main feature I like is the battery life.<br /><br />However after using them for 7 months or so, the right earbud randomly stopped working :(<br /><br />Unlike many other companies, this company stood by their warranty policy and sent me a new pair to me and I got them 4 days after originally contacting them.<br /><br />GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE. This is why even though they did break, they are still getting a 5 star review."
1,Comfortable and they stay on. Great value for the price and they even come with a car charger.
1,"These are quite good headphones! All around so far a good experience. The only gripe is that they don't handle very high volumes as well as some of the more expensive options. But for $30, you can complain!"
1,"If you are undecided about wireless workout headphones, highly recommend going with these. You will be pleasantly surprised with out shelling out the $100's for other headphones With questionable durability. Only thing that caught me off guard were the ear hangers are &#34;floppy&#34;. No impact to performance just different than expected. Highly recommend!"
1,Great headphones and superb customer service. Had a little issue with pairing. Sent an email and received instructions for reset within 2 minutes.<br />Nice sound and options included for adjusting size of earbuds.
1,"Great sound, very comfortable. They work very well!"
1,&#34;2nd time purchased. Have had no problems. Good product.&#34;
1,"Amazing product, fall in love with these headphones, and the price and quality amazing, and the customer service is excellent, they respond to any questions in minutes, i really recommend this product, these guys are amazing.."
0,"Not very good for boxing on the heavy bag. My gloves kept making contacting with the hooking ear loops when I pull back to guard/cover up the sides of my head. So the ear buds eventually came loose and popped out of my ears, even with the foam pieces. It works well on the treadmill and jogging only, but I bought it for heavy bag work and I wasn't satisfied with the hooking ear loops."
0,"I like the sound and battery life<br />I purchased 14 months ago and could no longer take a charge<br />Called manufacturer who attempted to walk me thru it, but to no avail.<br />He responded , sorry but 1 year warranty is over .. Nothing more he can do<br />I pressed him a bit and he offered a whopping 5 % discount if I ordered another set from him !<br />I will not do that"
1,Works great
0,stopped working the second time they were worn in the gym
1,"Definitely worth it's price! It wasn't that expensive when I bought it, but it came with a charger, a case, and some extra buds. The wire is nice and thick, really high quality for the low price. Also easy to use. However, the fit is not good around the ear. I like to listen to music while I work out (usually jump roping), and they start to fall off. Not sure if that's a personal problem or a defect, but I think it's just me."
1,yeah baby!
1,"I ordered these Headphones after my THIRD PAIR BEATS BY DRE just flat out DIED!!!<br /><br />I use my Headphones primarily while at the gym, so I like to get a good workout and I sweat like a water fall. Keep in mind I'm not swimming while working out, just doing cardio and lifting weights.<br /><br />I like do drown out annoying noises while in the gym and when I'm midway through my workout and my headphones died it was truly annoying.<br /><br />As of right now these SENSO Headphones are great and no issues!! Great sound, light weight and easy to operate.<br /><br />I got the great quality set of Headphones and not pay BEATS BY DRE prices. I actually bought a second pair the next after my first pair.<br /><br />I encourage everyone who has had issues with BEATS BY DRE and were thourghly disappointed you have to get a pair of the SENSO!!!"
1,"The time I got my aux cord, it wasn't working. Maybe because of the delivery. But I rated it 4 stars because Senso team made an effort to replace it after a week of communicating with them. The new cord works now and I am enjoying my headphones more."
0,Broke after 2 months of use.
1,"Easy to use, good sound quality, ear buds stay in ear, very comfortable- easy to forget you're wearing them between calls"
1,Product was good customer service was better
1,"High quality design, haven't tried them yet."
1,The headset sounded great. I purchased it for an in-ear system used for live music performance. The issue is the latency was to great. By the time the click track was heard it was about half a beat behind.<br /><br />For general listening they are great.
1,"These are amazing they work wherever I go, in the pool, out hiking, when studying or just relaxing."
0,"Bought these to use while I run- but for whatever reason they seem to be designed to actually amplify the sound of wind rushing past your ears. Like to hear music or Audio Books, while you jog? Nope, all you'll hear is the sound of wind like you're on the phone with someone in a wind tunnel. Sorry, these are going back.<br /><br />Honestly, I didn't find much else to like. Even while not running the audio quality is noticeable worse than another set of bluetooth earbuds I own in this price range. Putting them on is awkward at best and after an hour of exercise my ears were begging to get them off  due to a lack of comfort.<br /><br />I guess if you only want to use these earbuds indoors and are used to cyborg-esque headsets maybe give them a look."
1,Great
0,"Within a month they started having connection and static issues. I've used them once or twice a week. Even the built in voice (&#34;Power On&#34;, &#34;Connected&#34;, etc) has static. Low quality."
0,Worked great at first but after charging it the first time it stopped  working.
1,I completly satisfied with the headphones. They are what I was specting when order them.
0,"I gave them away after a week. I tried every bud like I was instructed and they still fell out every five seconds while I'm jogging. they fall out even while I was double shooting just sitting. the loop that sits above the ear is rubbery and doesn't not have wiring to help mold to your ear. the sound was good. it connects easily, I never used it to make phone calls. I didn't not like them at all I almost threw them away on my last run out of frustration."
1,Really nice sound for the bucket. Highly recommended so far. Not suitable for calls as it doesn't have nice MIC (people still hear me but far... far away)
1,I 've had many blue tooth headsets. I got these because of the price point thought I would give them a try. I got the two days ago and I must say I love them so far sound is great and they hold a charge for a long time something I was looking for. A pleasant surprise. Like I said so far so good if they last me 6 months working like this i6will be happy. Stay tuned
1,"obv not the best sound quality but good price, descent sound quality with descent bluetooth capability.<br />I'm glad i bought these, so I can carelessly use them whenever i want, but i can see these lasting at least 3 yrs without a problem"
1,"Easy to connect,  the sound is really good.  The customer service is AMAZING!"
0,Fabulous headphones until about a week ago when the right &#34;speaker&#34; became almost inaudible.
1,I am very impressed by this product. The sound is crisp and headphones are comfortable. The charger allows for iPhone charging which is a plus. Highly recommended. No need to buy expensive headphones. I bought the Bose quietcomfort  wired but cannot run with it. This would work well.
0,Would not pair with my phone!
0,Didn’t work for very long
1,"These are hands down the best headphones for the price. I sweat, a lot, and they have never fallen out. They come with the car charger and a case. I've been recommending these to all my workout buddies!"
1,"I buy it because of the long  battery life but is not even lasting 6 hours the quality of the sound is excellent  , but I'm needing something the it last at 8hours to get me by ,I'm sorry but I'll be returning them.  I like the 30 days no question asked ."
1,"I LOVE THESE EAR BUDS! I am so happy with this purchase! The sound is fantastic! The buds have several different sizes and they fit my ears! They stay on when I work out. This package comes with so much stuff... usable case, car charger, device charger, and follow up from the company. I am  so happy with these I will be buying them for Christmas gifts!"
1,Looking for cheap bluetooth headphones? THIS IS IT. They are awesome for the price and I have been through about five different types of &#34;cheaper&#34; bluetooth headphones.
1,I have owned these headphones for over a week now.  Ive been trying to find the best headphones for the price and these have been pretty good.  I would buy it again.
1,Excellent quality! Quality sound and easy to use. Long battery life. Excellent price point.
1,"I loved how the sounded and felt, they didn't irritate my ears. The only problem I found with these head[hones is they only lasted 6 months?"
1,"Ive had them for a few day no and so far they seem to work pretty good. Decent sound quality. The extras including the charging cables, car charger and carrying case are a nice touch and appreciated."
1,"These headphones are great for being active. The best thing about them are the mold-able foam earpieces.<br />Sound: These headphones really have a nice sound. They don't sound as good as some multi-hundred dollar headphones but better than anything I've heard in this price range.<br />Stability while moving: The ear hooks help to keep these in place while running, jumping, doing yard work, etc. The mold-able foam earpieces go a long way to keeping these in place as well.<br />Noise cancelling: These are passive noise cancelling (not noise cancelling at all) but the mold-able foam ear pieces block out an impressive amount of outside noise. I will often wear these while mowing the lawn. I will also wear them while running the weed eater... I can't hear audio over the weed eater but they work great as general ear-plugs.<br />Note - There can definitely be a bit of wind noise in high wind situations.<br />Bluetooth range: These seem to do as well, or better than most Bluetooth devices I have.<br />Battery: The battery life on these is great. When I'm not using them much, they'll last weeks. When I'm using them heavily, they'll only last a day or two. I would presume they get about 8 hours of battery life, but they hold battery quite well when not in use.<br />Overall, I have been quite happy with these headphones. The one item that seems to stand out the most though, is definitely the mold-able foam earpieces."
1,Sounds is clear - Easy to connect and disconnect. Battery lasts a long time (much longer than expected). For the price these are the best wireless Bluetooth headphones money can buy! I have recommended this product to others especially when asked where did you buy those.
1,crystal clear and they stay in place once on
1,"Great buy!  Use them riding my motorcycle. Also, amazing battery life"
1,Product bats way above its rating. Outstanding sound quality and ease of use. I’m buying extra for the family. Extremely pleased with these earbuds.
1,Ive used the headphones for less than 24hrs and I have not had any issues. The noise canceling part works really well. The is the first time I have bought wireless headphones and I am satisfied with these headphones.
0,Decent but cutout if any other bluetooth device is near it. Cannot be more than a few feet away otherwise they start to cut out. If you wear a fit bit you have to plan what side your phone is on otherwise these headphones will not work.
1,"Great value, good sound quality, and comfortable."
1,Good quality product. I love it.
1,I quickly charged and jump on my lawnmower... sound quality was awesome.... and I was surprised when I got a call.. it read the number to me and was able to answer with no problem... NICE PRODUCT!!!!! oh also got rid of my BEATS... these are way better...
1,Some of the best I have had. They are the longest lasting pair. Very comfortable to wear. Good sound quality
1,I needed headphones that fit Snug in my ears and that dont have all those messy wires. I move around a lot when working out and these are awesome and perfect. The volume is great as well. And I love the case they come with. Great buy!
1,"Awesome product! Love the cool charger. Company was super quick to respond to a question. Definitely recommend, easy to give 5 stars."
1,"I have only had the SensoBluetooth headphones for about a week and I am very satisfied. The delivery was very quick, the sound quality is great, they fit well, very easy to use and stay on during my workouts."
1,I'm still getting use to earphone. Only problem is when I get to my car the car Bluetooth kicks in which is ok but when I get out my earphones don't connect.  They did the 1st time but not now. I have to shut off and turn back on.
1,Best pair I have tried priced undeer $200!
0,"Terrible product, only worked for 2 months. On/off button stopped functioning, disconnects by itself from your phone. Tried to get in touch with seller, no response."
0,"A little high in the sound, not much bass like Beats 3, that I bought second."
1,I bought it for my husband and he loves it. Sound quality is amazing. I am giving it a 4 star because the microphone does not work very well.
1,"these ear buds can nicely boxed.  At first I was put off because the cord was flat conecting the two ear pieces; I quickly realized that they were less likely to tangle than the small diameter round cords.  The ear buds are light weight and stay in place.  I am trying out the different rubber tips to find a comfortable pair and haven't been disappointed with any of them.  I think the noise cancelling is probably best achieved with a pair that seems a little like memory foam, rather than from the silicone pairs.  Since I do a lot of walking outside I really do not want them to be completely noise cancelling so I am very happy there are choices.  I wish the charging cable was longer, I think mine is about 6 inches long.  There was a car charging adapter with a nice lounge USB cable for charging my iPhone but I would have rather had the longer charger. Once I figured out how to pair them they worked beautifully with only minor little blips and I attribute those right now to having my phone constantly moving around. I guess I need an arm band for holding the phone somewhere other than my pockets.  My biggest problem; and this is with most small electronic items, is that the directions were in microscopic copy and a bit difficult to find in all the other small type on the booklet; making it necessary to go online and find a YouTube video on how to pair them with my devices. This was also true of the wireless speaker I purchased the same time.<br /><br />So far I really like them and they were priced affordable and stay on my ears so I am not constantly pushing them back into place.  They are way more comfortable than my apple earbuds but also a bit bulkier.  They are still lightweight and I like the ability to change tracks and use the volume controls on the ear piece.  I would recommend them to anyone looking for a well made inexpensive pair of bluetooth capable earbuds."
1,"The headphones are solid. Good bass, good sound. The battery life is to be expected. The buttons feel really good to press and the connection boots up great with my phone. I have tried a few other brands but these ones are the best ones on Amazon for the price. Other brands with the over-ear design have not fit right, slightly uncomfortable or sound worse in loud environments but not these."
1,Great lightweight Bluetooth headphones so far. Very comfortable for running and they quickly pair each time with my Ipod. My 16 yr old bought a pair too.
1,they are good for riding motorcycles BUT is there anyway in the future putting the controls in the left ear bud. It is hard to let go of the gas control on the right  hand side while riding.
1,I love these headphones!  This is the third pair I have tried.  They stay in place when I am running (I am a female with a narrow head).  They work when swimming at surface-level and just below the water.  The sound is at the top-end of good.  Best at this price!
0,"They did not work underwater as they were supposed to. Music could not be heard<br />Once underwater they no longer worked at all.<br />I was horribly dis satisfied,"
0,"this is my 2nd Senso earphone. I returned the first one because of poor sound quality. 2nd one last longer, had issue with one of the ear buds, I was told to reset the unit, it should after that. I did reset per instructions, but problem persist.<br />I bought square trade insurance for this one. no response yet from Square trade."
1,"Stereo sound quality, excellent buy. Love these sound is clear and crisp."
1,Great product. Works great even beyond stated range. Wish battery lasted longer than 6 hours but still pretty good battery life
1,The sound is 8/10 but it works very good.
1,"Bought these for my wife after she lost her beats wireless, she loves them, works great for cardio and 5k"
1,weird fit
0,"Product worked for a month and they would turn off by itself and I would have to turn it on, then it would again die."
1,"The earbuds work really well when I'm not moving too much, but when I'm on my bike, it'll cut out sometimes. I noticed it more when I was moving fast downtown. The noise cancellation is decent, the bass is better than I expected, and it pairs easily. The adjustable ear attachment rubber works well, but the housing for the electronics will pick up a lot of wind when moving fast or in windy conditions, and I wouldn't expect any amount of noise cancellation to be able to deal with that."
1,"Great headphones for even better price. Bluetooth to my phone for music. Works great for that but when phone calls come thru, the sound and voice coming thru isn’t very clear and hard to have a conversation using this headset"
0,Doesn’t work after some time. Don’t purchase.
1,Best headphones ever. Very light and comfy I will recommend this product to everyone .
1,"They came with more accessories than I was expecting, and the material and sound quality is excellent. They block external sound very well, and fit and stay in my ear better than my countless previous headphones. For the quality to cost ratio I would recommend these to anyone, especially those who would use them sports/fitness."
0,"I have never been a fan of bluetooth earphones in general because it just seems like there is more that can potentially go wrong, but I figured I would give these a try just in case. They worked pretty great initially: sound quality was fair for the price, bluetooth was responsive and connected quickly, and the battery was actually as advertised at 7ish hours. My only complaint was that the flap covering the charge port was very difficult to get open, even for somebody with very average sized hands. After a few weeks of use (maybe 3 full charges) it started to not connect to my phone as quickly as it initially did. I'm not factoring this in to the rating because I'm not sure if it was an issue with my phone or the earphones, but it is something I noticed. The major issue is that these completely crapped out mid-workout and wouldn't come back on. I paused it to talk to somebody, then a minute later I hit the unpause button and it didn't resume; in fact there was no beep or any noise that indicated I was even hitting a button. Even after holding down the power button, there was no response. They were freshly charged, so it wasn't that the battery died (the earphones will give you a warning probably about 20 minutes before they're about to die). While tempted to give these 1 star, I acknowledge that I could have just gotten a faulty set, and I actually really liked them when they were functional. But they died about 4 days after the return window closed, so I feel a little bit cheated"
1,Great sound and very loud! Also very comfortable and they stay in your ears while working out. Great headphones?
1,"Great price, great quality"
1,"These work. For the money, they're amazing. Sometimes when I run they cut out, as if they can't stay connected even though my phone stays in one spot on my body, but that's only happened a couple of random times. The charge lasts the perfect amount (airplane trips long). Try them!!!!"
1,The Bluetooth headphones are comfortable and profide a pretty good sound quality given its price. Should anything ever happen I would definitely buy another one. It also comes with a magnetic adhesive metal plate to connect to your phone and a fan magnetic thing to connect to your fan so your phone would hold up.<br /><br />My only issue with it is that after a day or two of using the adhesive metal plate it came completely off my phone case and didn't work anymore as the adhesive didn't maintain the amount of sticky ess as initially
1,"Fantastic for traveling. And awesome for jogging. They're comfortable, it's easy to control the music on them, and they're waterproof! Only complaint is that i sometimes hear the wind howling in my ears when I'm wearing them while running. But then I realized it's because I run cheetah-fast. So I just slow down and the howling wind subsides. :) Love 'em. Definitely recommend!"
0,"I bought these headphones primarily for the purpose of running outside and the gym.  These headphones are good for indoors, but if used outside the wind noise is so terrible that it makes them useless.  I've tried using the different size earpieces with no improvement.  I will be returning these in favor of a smaller in the ear headphone."
1,"Sound is great, battery lasts forever and they ALWAYS connect. Great product."
1,"""Exactly as described"""
1,"I have had these headphones for 4 months now. I am so impressed! They have great battery life,1 hour is enough to make it through an 8 hour day. The sound quality is different from a wired headset but not enough for my (admittedly untrained) ear. At this point if they stopped working tomorrow I'd buy another pair! At this price they are unbeatable!"
1,Great deal. Sounds nice. Good quality. Everything is right. One start off probably because I personally cannot get used to Earbud headphones.
1,Work really well!! Sound is great and easy to use.
1,"So far so good, just got them 2 hrs. ago pairing was a breeze with iPhone 6s. Sound is extremely good, price is extremely amazing. Very good product. I like how the charger for the earbuds doubles as a charger for your iPhone as well...pretty cool. Comes with 3 different sizes of earbuds which is great because as everybody knows, your ears are different sizes. The best value I have spent my money on this far. Even if you don't like them... it's $36 ... I mean C'MON that's a great deal. Needless to say I'm very happy with them so far, highly recommend at least trying a pair."
1,Work as I expected. I'm happy. Very easy to deal with/ connect with my iPhone7. Tiny case which is always an issue for me- space in the purse. The sound quality leaves me dancing.
1,Love them
1,"Received these yesterday & love them! Such clear, crisp sound! Fit comfortably & securely!! Thank you!!"
1,"Been very happy so far, instructions say charge lasts 8hrs, and it is spot on, good price, good product"
1,"Great sound, even at volume.  Better than some of the more expensive competition.  A little more cumbersome than most but secure."
1,"Great Sound Quality, very comfortable, easy to use."
1,I love the noise-canceling effect; they are way better than the headset that has been using. The earphones are also light for running and PERFECT for walking. The only downfall is that they look big on my ears
1,"I love these earbuds. I've had the first pair since 2017!! Just ordered another only because I stripped the wires on one side. They still work awesome. Almost 4 years of abuse sleeping with them and mowing, weed eating, leaf blowing. Couldn't hear anything but my music. Excellent sound, loud!! Clear and no problems with pairing to 4 devices. The instantly connect. They do keep sound out and music in. Definitely a great deal!"
1,"Wow, these headphones are AMAZING!!!!!! The price is UNBELIEVABLE as well, great product!!!!"
1,Died after 2 months. Chucked them
1,Very nice set of headphones for the price. Paired up quickly to my phone with no issues. Sound quality is excellent....equal to brands costing much more. Accessories that came with them are very good quality and rounds out the package. Highly recommended.
1,"Sound great!!!! Well worth a try, you won't be disappointed."
1,Good earphones. The sound quality is just about than what I expected at this price point. No complaints.
1,Sound quality is good and Bluetooth connectivity was very easy.
0,I dislike this product because it volume not working
1,"This was my first purchase of a wireless headset. I wanted it for the gym and as a replacement for a hands-free device. The sound quality is great. I didnt want to spend the money on beats, so this was a great alternative. Love the carry case and all the size options for the ear buds as well as the different types. Cant beat the price and the quality."
1,"I just started using the product for about 1 day now. I have received phone calls, listened to music from my phone and listened to sound from videos on YouTube. So far I am impressed, from the connectivity with my phone to the quality of sound. However, I have not used it long enough to assess the usage time before charging and also the subsequent degradation on that aspect. In the meantime, I am satisfied with the product and I did like the magnetic clip car holder for my phone."
0,"Great sound, but bought them last December and they only lasted to June. They are charged but don't respond to the power button."
0,the left ear bud already quit working I only started using them &/24/19
1,Great sound and very comfortable! Love them!
1,Better quality than the most expensive Bluetooth headphones in the market.
1,"These headphones are fantastic. Sound quality is great, beautifully packaged, and comes with a great universal charger that I can use on most of my devices. I got them at the reduced price and feel I received an incredible deal."
1,"I use these every day.  They don't fall out of my ears on my runs.  The sound is adequate for my needs.  I am not an audio expert by any stretch of the imagination, so can't say &#34;oh the sound is wonderful, blah blah blah,&#34;  They stay in my ears, when I talk on the phone people can hear me.  I don't have to charge them all the time either.  Serving their purpose with no frustration which gets them 5 stars."
1,"These headphones worked fine for several months and then one day after charging it wouldn't turn on again. That's it, doesn't work at all. Hopefully my next pair (and yours) will work longer..."
1,Really like these headphones. They fit the ears well and sound great. I also like the length of time they hold a charge.
1,"I'll make this short and to the point. lost my $150 wireless ( blank bird, brand), bought these. could have saved $120 if I knew about these before. 1. best for running, don't bounce, hurt my ears or fall out and are super light. 2. love the small zipper case to hold all the stuff in. 3. comes with 2 chargers ( a 1 foot one and 3 feet one) the 3 feet one has the android or flip the head to iOS charger ( 2 in 1 amazing) 4. comes with 2 port USB car cigarette charger. 5. super loud with minimum background noise. 6. has a bright light indicator to show when charging and charged and easy Bluetooth sync. going to order another one to keep at my gym."
0,Summary: Has a strange hum all the time. Has a weird fit for small ears. Can’t recommend this product to anyone from my experience.<br /><br />I’ve had the headphones for only a couple days. They have a really annoying humming sound that is very noticible at any level of volume. I’m not well versed in headphones but I’m pretty positive that they aren’t supposed to have a a constant hum to them (the Apple wired headphones don’t have it). The box came with a few soft ear pieces so finding a good fit was pretty easy - that said I have somewhat small ears so the headphones looked pretty bad on me and had a really weird fit.
1,"Easy pairing w IPhone.<br />Over the ear piece is a lil flimsy and falls off of ear during any physical activity more than walking,<br />Poor balance of treble to bass. Too much treble. I’m not a hip hop fan needing lots o bass.  Product is worth the $20."
1,Great product for the price you pay. Fits in just perfect and the sound quality is good. I love the pouch to store my ear pods!!
1,"Again, great buds.  The sale price is a steal."
1,Great sound for the $.
1,Great sound quality. Light weight so you don't notice the hooks over the ears but keeps the earbuds in place which I've always had a problem with on other products.
1,"Pretty happy with this purchase.  They are easy to use, sound acceptable and pair with my phone quickly."
0,"I've had these headphones for a few weeks, and they simply died on me. Not sure what happened. It could be that I received a defective pair, but now they won't charge or turn on.<br /><br />Defectiveness aside, I experienced a lot of the same negatives that other reviewers of these have: the headphones disconnect from blue tooth quite often, and virtually no noise cancellation. Additionally, the power button for these headphones is really sensitive, and if you throw them in a purse or a pocket to bring with you somewhere, oftentimes they will turn on of their own accord, and then run out of battery life when you need to pull them out to use them. Very disappointing."
1,"Lightweight, comfortable, and good fidelity with music and phone calls. Haven't tried then running yet, but they are light enough that it is easy to forget they are there.  Good choice of ear buds, and has a micro USB port similar to many Android devices as well adapters for iPhone ports."
1,These are perfect. Way cheaper than beats and honestly just as good.
1,"I love my new SENSO Bluetooth headphones. The sound is awesome, and they are easy to use. I have small ears and they are the first that I have found that stay put without constantly playing with them."
1,I'm surprised by the sound these put out.  These came with many nice extras.  Easy to set up and use. Very happy with the product!
1,Sound quality of my Audio books.
0,Quit working after one month
0,"I was attracted by the &#34;Best Seller&#34; and high reviews. DON'T BELIEVE IT.<br />The first time i put them, the sound seemed to have miss a lot of range, too dim and bassy.<br /><br />That noise mitigation they promise is really NOISE AUGMENTATION.. in very little wind you hear it immediately, and noisibly.<br />The mic is really bad outdoors.<br /><br />I had wireless earphones that cost around $20 and were way better."
1,"As long I stay in the house or back yard (phone always on me) these are great. But in the front yard, they cut in a out constantly. I've done the factory reset and they still have issues when I'm in the front yard doing yard work. I don't know what in the front is interfering, but it's annoying. I reached out to SENSO and they have been nothing short of amazing in trying to fix this by sending me another set. Stuff happens and I'm glad they are taking care of it."
1,"Love the headphones, great sounding, awesome accessories came with it."
1,Have to admit pretty good quality for the price
1,I am into these headphones. I got a great deal through amazon. They are small enough to keep in a pocket. Charges with a cell phone cord. Charge last atleast a week at the gym working out 1 hour per day. Easy enough to pair and use. the red ear pads that come with it have a memory foam feel and are really comfortable. Unfortuantely I lost one and the spare pads that are included are silicone and not nearly as nice. Be careful as the soft covers do come off.<br />- Great for at the gym when you want to be wireless<br />- Gets much louder than my iphone ear buds<br />- Battery last a fair amount of time<br />- Sound quality is pretty good given bluetooth and ear buds<br />- Only negative is that the covers that cushion your ear can easly be lost.
1,They stay on my ears throughout my entire workout. I workout for about an hour or 2 depending on my schedule for about 3 days a week and it can hold a charge for a good week. Turning the volume up and down can be a little cumbersome but nothing major. And I wish it got a bit louder. Overall great product!
1,"good volume, good bass response, great fit. I have small ears so in-ear wireless buds tended to fall out, especially in the midst of a heavy workout. The SENSO headphones sound great and stay in, even in sweaty summer workouts."
1,"I bought them as a gift for a friend, he reports that they are very good.  He is extremely happy!  So am I..."
1,Headphones work well and sound clear.<br /><br />Bead on the back falls off & can be annoying.  Usually leave it off
0,"These seem identical to an old, cheap pair of MPow headphones I have - I couldn't tell any difference in sound, and they suffered from the same anomaly with my phone - if I turned my head sideways, they'd start skipping and losing connection. Other BT headphones had no problem maintaining the connection. Returned."
1,"Works much better than most of the other brands on Amazon. This is probably the 5th one I've had to purchase and didn't have to return for being defective or having lack luster battery life. The only other company who had one this good was LetsComm but they are longer on Amazon.<br /><br />It's cheap, resists water and oil and sounds decent. Also has a decent amount of range when away from the phone. If it can last atleast a year of abuse will definitely purchase more from this company."
1,i bought this for my 13 year old daughter and so far she seem to love it
1,"The headphones paired easily with my Eleston 8GB Portable MP3 player. I had read a comment that it didn't, but you have to pair and play underneath the Bluetooth menu. They work very well and sound quality is good."
1,I love this head set . Senso is a great company. Support is awesome.
1,"These are a great pair of wireless earbuds for the price. The battery, build quality, and sound is very decent. After trying out several of the top reviewed for this price range, these are my favorite. The only issue I've had so far was one of the hooks came slightly bent, but it wasn't difficult to straighten back out. I would recommend these to anyone shopping for a set wireless earbuds under $50"
1,High quality headphones! Really the best I've had. They feel like quality. They are comfortable. The ideal headphones for someone who is very active.
1,"Nice product! I bought these for running as well as normal use. Soft ear hooks stay securely in place. Works flawlessly with my iphone 7+. Microphone has clear, good quality sound on phone calls. Controls include music play/pause, volume, phone call connect and disconnect."
1,Love these headphones. They are really comfortable to wear and do keep background noise out.
1,Don't expect good mic quality. Other than that they are great.
1,"Real nice.  Exactly what I was looking for in sports headphones for running.  Built real solid, sound great, buttons easier to press than the smaller ones on other headphones.  Also the price is perfect for something that gets sweated on every day.  Very pleased."
1,Great sound and easy to use.  Would buy these again!
1,Good quality love them only wish I bought them sooner
1,They seem like pretty good earphones. And a fraction of the proce of the similar Beats.
1,"I use these for exercise, they are the first blue tooth headphones I've used and I have been very happy with how well they are working for the price."
1,Good sound and can play pretty loud. Fit nice as well.
1,"This is even better than my Jaybird. Quality of sound and how easy it was to pair with any device is already worth the money. The only downside is the range compared to my jaybird but that crazy to compare from this price point. I love this and will not buy any more of those high end brands morning forward. This is all I need, quality you can trust!"
1,"I've purchased several headsets during the years and I have found this one to be the best of them all. There comfortable and easy to use, I've only had them for a few days now and I love them already. This was definitely a good choice."
1,"I’ve read many reviews before buying this, and after getting it, IT’S WORTH LEAVING A REVIEW! Ok so I don’t know where to start on how amazing these headphones are, great sound quality, a great carry case that fits charger plus headphones and extra pieces, it has a magnetic cellphone car mount, a cellphone card wallet, wire tie pieces, a charger, and 3 EXTRA PAIRS OF EARTIPS! Best part is? All that for $30, I Connor believe that! Usually these type of headphones are annoying, but these ones stay in perfectly and are really comfortable, they also have volume up and down keys on the headphones, I’m not good with figuring out distances but it’s a great distance that it can still be commected, again, great quality AND lastly, waterproof. WORTH THE MONEY."
0,"They're pretty okay earbuds, nice sound. However, I noticed that if I put my phone in my back pocket, just the pocket of my pants (not a case or a purse or anything), the earbuds stutter so much that the quality is just completely gone. I don't have this problem if I hold my phone in front of me or in my front pocket.<br /><br />It just doesn't quite make sense to me that a pair of bluetooth headphones would have this downside, I don't recall any previous pair of headphones with this behavior :("
1,Excellent product. Great sound!
1,Great for the price.
1,"Finally, I found decent Bluetooth headphones. I've owned several expensive ones that broke in a week. These guys have been holding up thru everything i put them through either on the runs outside or at the gym. Great set! You won't be disappointed."
1,"These headphones feel cheap, but they are cheap. The sound is mediocre, but not bad. They don't look good on your head, but they don't look terrible.<br /><br />The battery life IS good. They connect quickly and without issue. The range is OK. They actually stay in my ears pretty well and they don't feel like they are strangling your ear holes. They rest on your ears not in your ear canal.<br /><br />After owning them for 6 months, I'd say worth the $29 for sure."
1,"Sounds is OK, but buds are pretty heavy and don't stay in ears very well."
1,best sound and quality FOR THE PRICE
1,"Great customer service! - i had a small issue with the headphones, contacted the manufacturer and had a new set at my door within a couple of days. No problem with the second headset - works and sounds great, comfortable to wear, stays in my ears and maintains a charge for a long period of time. The price is fair compared to what I have paid for other bluetooth headphones.<br />I highly recommend it!"
1,Great product and great service. Thank you!
1,Awesome headphones! I had beats and replaced with these.
1,these are awesome headphones for workin in for 20 bucks.  the noise cancellation does work for the person you are talkin to. while mowin my friend said he could hear the tractor but could hear me just fine.  love these things.  they could be cheaper if it didnt come with the sticky wallet thing and phone mount for car vent. lol.  great deal for a good pair of heafphones for workin/gym.
1,"Best headphones for the price. Easy to use, great connectivity and quality of sound"
1,"So far, I've used them once at the gym. Paired with my iPhone 7 Plus. I went as far as 10 feet away from the phone and no dropouts.<br /><br />The reason this isn't getting a 5th star...<br /><br />1) The sound isn't crisp. A little too bassy. Not enough high frequency. Sounds a bit muffle.<br /><br />2) The ear loops are flimsy. They're not as stiff as I thought they'd be. I was jump roping in the gym and the left earbud kept coming off. I haven't switched to another earpiece that it provides you with but usually the ear loop helps keep the earbud from falling off your ear completely."
1,"I've had these over a year an I am very happy with them.  These replaced my second set of Motorola S10D.  These are very llght weight, more comfortable, have very good fidelity and the batteries last much longer.  I get at least 2 to 3 2 hour sessions in the gym with them- even now after more than a year of use.  The earpieces are very soft and fit very comfortably, and block out outside noise very well.  I like the controls in the earpiece to pause, play, track forward and back, and volume.  The phone reception also works well.<br /><br />My only complaint is the logic of the track forward and back buttons which are also the volume up and down buttons.  The forward facing button controls volume down and track back, and the back facing button controls volume up and track forward.  Intuitively what they control should be reversed; ie forward button to go track forward and volume up and back button to go track back and volume down."
1,"Excellent product, they don't mind sweat and abuse. Bose quality at half the cost."
1,Works wonderfully in the Data Center where I work.  Sound quality helps with noise reduction and makes the working day go faster.
0,"I should have known the price was too good to be true. These headphones looked nice, the case was awesome, and they paired quickly with my watch. Then the positives ended, I took them to the gym and tried to put them on, they immediately fell off. I guess I have abnormally small ears, as the hooks to go around your ears sat way too high to stay behind my ears, I had to shove the bulb part in my ear to have them stay in (very uncomfortable). Then I had to turn the sound to max to hear my music which was disappointing. After that load of discontent, one minute into my stretching, my music cut out, this happened every 10-20 seconds, followed by an annoying voice saying “connected”. Needless to say I was furious, the only thing these were good for was to piss me off so much I was throwing weights around with anger and ease due to my instant rage trying to listen to my workout music.<br />Let’s start with the positive of these headphones<br />- They come in a nice case<br />- Easy to use<br />- Quick connect<br />The cons<br />- They are way too big (kept falling out of my ears the hooks were too big and high to wrap around my ears, I wish they were adjustable)<br />- Pretty bulky in design<br />- They never stay connected, every ten seconds the song stops and it disconnects from my device"
1,Sound is good but not the best in noise cancellation.  I bought these to use for cycling but unfortunately you get a lot of wind noise.  The ear clips are ok but are extremely flexible and don't hold in place well... these are probably good for walking but not for more aggressive activities...
1,"These earbuds sound fantastic for a bargain price. They are packaged beautifully and come with way to follow instructions. Also in the box you will find 2 different charging cord, an adapter for charging in your car, different sized ear tips and a very nice case to hold the earbuds and accessories. The earbuds are very comfortable to wear. The hooks that keep the earbuds securely in place are soft and don’t hurt my ears!"
0,"These are really comfortable, and I really liked them until the battery life started declining. I use them primarily at the gym, and each use has less time. After about 1 dozen uses, the current life is 40 minutes."
1,"Wow these headphones are awesome. I’ve owned the Bose soundsports, jaybird x3, jaybird freedoms, the beats, wired boss head phones and many more headphones. These headphones (for the price) are amazing. The sound isn’t quite as dynamic as jaybird but they’re louder and that makes up for it. I haven’t played with any of my EQ settings yet either. I would rather buy these than ANY of those major brands i listed above. If you’re on the fence let this be a testament. I will update if anything goes wrong on these. These rock."
0,"Worst headphones I've ever had. Will not stay connected to iPhone, iPad or computer. Useless."
1,"My first pair lasted me 3 years. I loved them. I bought the newest version, they ended up being trash. I just bought a 3rd pair and they broke within a week. Im buying another pair, but after this im gonna consider that first purchase a fluke"
1,Great product at a reasonable price!
1,"One of the best purchases I've ever made on Amazon. Comfortable, great sound, surprisingly long battery life. They stay on with no problem while exercising. They even come with a nice little zip up hard case for storage. Sometimes connecting them to my iPhone can be a little tricky, but nothing that can't be fixed with a quick switch of Bluetooth on and off. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Edit: Just wanted to add that you can also pause, adjust volume, and even skip forward/backward (used on Spotify) with the buttons right on the headphones. I believe they have other functionality that I've yet to use, as well. Very convenient."
1,After getting the iPhone 8 Plus I quickly tired of the dongle needed for my monoprice earbuds. Took a chance on these based on the number of positive reviews. Have never used wireless earphones before. These are outstanding. I’m a value shopper and don’t need name brand earbuds. I’m considering a second pair just as a backup
0,I thought these were great at first. Then I forgot them at the gym and they got stollen. I was obviously super irritated I had to buy more but when I paid less money for better quality headphones at Walmart I realized losing them was a blessing in disguise. The sound quality is mediocre and they didn’t stay on my ears very well.
1,"Bought these for my wife but she opted for the &#34;name brand&#34;. So I gave them to my son who like me has music playing 24/7. He loves them!! They sound great!, Battery life is awsome and the warranty and price can't be beat!! Would definitely buy again and will definitely recommend to friends!!"
1,Exactly as expected
1,"Sound quality is great for the money.  They tend to have a problem &#34;pairing&#34; with my iPhone.  I often have to delete the headphones and re-add them to the bluetooth.  They fit well and do block out noise.  However, they are NOT noise cancelling, so don't buy that marketing BS.  Also, the build quality is only so-so.  I'd give them a four or five if they got rid of the &#34;noise cancelling&#34; claim and built them a bit better."
1,They're great for the price... I still wanted a little better sound than most reviews say they have... but still awesome headphones.
1,"Top notch headphones!  Sound quality if great with good base.  Plus, you can't beat the price."
1,"These are a gift, they look nice"
1,HD Sound and clear<br />Excellent !!!!!
0,"just a flat out piece of crap.... very disappointing, wont take a charge, wont turn, wont do nothing!!! In the damn garbage it goes!! tried of wasting money on crap products like this... don't buy this product"
1,"These seem to work well so far, 1 workout completed. The rubber cord does stick on the back of my neck a bit, but under the chin works great if you need it (such as the squat rack). The sound is a bit base-heavy, but at this price point I'd expect it, as most people like extra base. Overall I'd say a good buy. Comes with lots of extras, including a nice case!"
1,Won't fit under my ski helmet (mine anyway)
1,Great headphones and excellent customer service.  I had an issue after a month or so with the car charger.  I wasn't too concerned but they reached out to confirm my satisfaction and after hearing about it they sent a replacement.  THANKS!!!
1,awesome sound great price
1,"Have had them less than a week<br />Easy to connect to Bluetooth, sound quality is good. If anything they are too loud (my family says I always complain about that) and I cannot turn them down one more notch. Craftsmanship is good, again only had for a few days."
0,"They won't stay in your ear, the sound quality is just above bad, and the battery life wasn't great. Wish I had returned them. Invest into a more expensive pair."
1,Great headphones! They stay on my ear and were an amazing price.<br /><br />I had a problem with one of the rubber wrap around piece so I contacted the seller. They emailed me and were very responsive. I ended up getting sent another pair at no cost. This is a great company with a great product.
1,"I bought these for use when cycling. I wanted headphones that would stay on, sound great and last through my long rides. In every respect these far exceeded my expectations and far outperformed other much more expensive headphones I've owned."
1,These headphones sound great and are very comfortable to wear.  They have happily replaced my more expensive wireless headphones that were never comfortable and never sounded as good.  They held up well at the gym as well.  For the price you can't beat these for blue tooth wireless headphones.
1,"Love these head phones. Got a pair for the gym and they need charged once a week. I'm typically there for 60 to 90 mins 5x a week. Range is very good. I typically leave my phone on my gym bag when I go to get a drink from the fountain. I've never lost signal going prob max of 35 feet. Sound quality is good. They haven't been damaged from sweat. They were very easy to get going on the Samsung S7,<br /><br />Loved them so much, I got a second pair for my PC. I also get this bluetooth adapter (I'm using Win7 Pro) since my PC didn't have native bluetooth: [[ASIN:B009ZIILLI Plugable USB Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy Micro Adapter (Windows 10, 8.1, 8, 7, Raspberry Pi, Linux Compatible; Classic Bluetooth, and Stereo Headset Compatible)]]<br /><br />Installed drivers for both and everything works with no issue. For the price, you can't really beat these."
1,"I absolute love these earbuds. I was using a pair of LG Bluetooth earbuds. On comparison, the Senso beat the LG pair hands down on clearness and bass. I will but another pair as back up. These are a wonderful buy for the cost and quality of sound you get."
1,"I am so glad I decided to purchase these Bluetooth headphones. At first, I was worried about paying so much and then having to return them, but these things are worth so much more. I needed a pair of headphones or Bluetooth that I could turn on and off easily. The multifunction button on the right ear bud made it easy for me, despite my disability. I also thought they might be uncomfortable to where, but again, I was wrong. They are so much more comfortable that I was expecting. Not to mention, these things don't seem to budge once they are in.<br /><br />I also love that I was able to switch between my cell phone and my laptop without needing to put in a new set of headphones. I will definitely order these headphones again, just to have a backup pair."
0,"I loved these headphones, but after 3-1/2 months, they quit taking a charge and no longer work."
1,"They sound good enough for running but they have a slight problem staying on my ears. They have not fallen off, but they just don't feel as secure as I would like to around the backside of the ear."
1,These have been great!
1,"Fast delivery, great price, great quality and sound."
1,"I can't hear any outside noise, listening to music. If I'm listening to an audiobook or podcast, outside noise is only dulled. My phone and my headphones are always within a foot of each other. So distance between the two are not the issue.<br /><br />There's also no way to adjust the earbows. Which is a hassle, if like me, you have smaller ears that rest closely to the sides of your head. Wish I would have saved my money and stayed with my Apple earbuds."
1,"These headphones are amazing. Customer service wss off the hook too. Great sound, bass and comfortable."
1,"The earphones are awesome at downing out backgrounds noise and amazing for all instruments, vocals, and other facets of music and audio I used then for. The issues that I had were apparent when I first got them in that they would cut in and out and sometimes Bluetooth wouldn't hold.  I had problems before the headphones stopped working altogether and tried calling the 24 hour number that comes with the product but was rerouted to the same person each time I called and he went from saying to yelling at me the same thing that they cannot and will not replace the damaged product and that the warranty basically just acts as a receipt for an already damaged product before it gets to your door (that is absolutely useless and betraying to any customer who thinks a warranty should replace a damaged product that comes in barely working as is, what's more if you read the warranty it is absolute garbage). Also when you're on hold they have a person repeating the same message of please wait and we will get to you when we can with no time stopping whatsoever.  Having heard this nonstop I was on the verge of hanging up just so I wouldn't be irritated for the 20 minutes until they finally answered. I don't know if they did this to divert people from calling or what, but absolutely the worst customer service for over the phone. As for why they got so many stars they got that for their email services that I would assume are not apart of their phone customer service because they actually listened and were willing to at last see the product. In the end they sent out a new pair of earphones to replace the originals. They deserve 5 stars but the over the phone quality customer service is what deserves the 0 stars. If the new the one work well and don't have the same problem then I see one less problem in them deserving 5 stars and being recommended."
1,"I’d give 5 stars if they really were noise cancelling.  It’s merely the fit of the headphones that kinda reduce background noise.  However, for the price, FANTASTIC purchase.  Great sound quality.  A little light on the bass but that is to be expected with buds.  I like the fact I can put them on and walk around my entire house and yard.  Range is much better than advertised.  Easy set up and connection with my devices.  Very nice semi hard case to store and plenty of charging options/cables included.  Small/med/lrg buds to fit your ears.  Overall. For the price point, I have no real complaints."
1,I am an old lady and these sure look funky on me but they are awesome! Sound is fantastic and so light weight that you do not even know that they are on!!!
1,"These have held up to travel domestic and internationally. As a runner they stay put for the most part and periodically need adjusting,  through all the sweating. I highly recommend these!"
1,Great sound and very comfortable
1,"Worked for 8 months, approx 100 hours use,  then stopped turning on and now won't charge."
1,"I don't usually write reviews. But I have to say, these are the best headphones i have ever used. The sound quality is great for my needs, which is mostly phone calls and listening to lectures. They are light weight. I forget that i am wearing them. I am not technical, yet I was able to pair it easily with my iphone 7 without any issues. They arrived promptly. And all the added accessories (which I did get with other headphones) came in a convenient smart looking round case. They come with a 1 year guarantee and great customer service. If they broke or were lost I would definitely buy them again."
1,I bought these headphones  7 months ago and then one side stopped working. The company is good they replaced the headphones. The replacement headphones sucks!!! They are cheap with no bass. they are not the same headphones. Was happy now I’m disappointed.
1,"these are great headphones.  I have a pair of BOSE Quiet Comfort headphones that I use every day in my work.  So, know good sound.  Even though these SENSO headphones aren't the same as my BOSE, they are excellent headsets.  They sound great and very easy to pair up with my Samsung S8+.  I've tried using them to make phone calls and really like how it sounds.  And then I used them for music and am impressed.  For the price, these headsets are really nice."
1,Suprised how well these hold a charge
1,"Had these for many months and I couldn't understand all the hype about them because to me, they didn't sound anywhere near as good as my other much more expensive headphones.  That was.. until I finally figured out that they have to be literally 'pushed' into your ear canal.  I was just hanging them by the hooks and letting them rest in my ears, but then I randomly pushed them a bit harder, and lo and behold, WOW factor kicks in.  These headphones are spectacular.  Complete noise-isolation, clear soundstage, and simply mind-blowing bass!  Add to this the hours of playing time on a single charge and a featherweight form-factor, and I have to say this is a beautiful diamond to own."
1,"I've had this almost two years now, and they still work really well. Good, affordable head phones. I highly recommend these!"
1,"When I first used these, I was very happy with the quality--especially for the price.  But after about 5 uses now, I am not as pleased. I mainly use them when I walk my dog outside and for running--I love the fit, and they do not fall off of my ears even when I run.  However, after the first few uses, the sound has started to cut out regularly.  Even after fully charged, they connect just fine, but when I am listening to music they cut out and back in.  I have tried them with a different device to make sure it was not just my phone, and they do the same thing.  I will likely be purchasing some higher quality ones instead."
1,Great headphones! Connected very easily. The extra sizes were great since my wife needed the smaller size. My wife has been using them everyday since we got them. Sounds very clear when talking on a phone call. Sound quality while listening to music is awesome.
1,"these are the best cheap wireless headphones you can get. It stays in my car all the time so it goes through different temperatures all the time and yet, the battery is still holding strong. On Max Charge I believe I tested for 5 hours of life time? This was just leaving it on so it may vary with music playing."
1,Wow.. these are great! Don’t fall out of my ears and came with extra ear puds
0,"Nice packaging.... has a nice carrying case. Product came defective,  the volume button is broken/ not working like it should.... sounds from it is not up to par with beats at all, the ear loop is way to soft and doesn't support as well as my beats.<br /> Need to keep it since 1) I lost my beats at a jobsite and I need ear protection, 2) I was not going to send back a $20 Item and waste resources and greenhouse gas all because the volume button didnt work( I can still use my phone to turn down the volume."
1,I had beats that I paid $200 for and they broke so I got these and I honestly like these better.
1,These headphones and edelin are virtually identical.  Edelin have better range these senso seem to have better waterproofing.
1,My wife loves these headphones. She said very nice sound that stay in her ears while jogging
0,uncomfortable
1,Great sound
1,Loving them so far but have not had a chance to check the battery life.  I liked the case and the extra charging cables which will come in handy.
1,"I love these headphones and you get alot for your money...for example a caring case, charge cord that excepts  both android and apple devices, car charger, and extra ear buds. They are also well made and very easy to use."
1,"Well, they pair nicely with my phone and my computer. They do feel like they are falling off my ears when I run on the treadmill at the gym."
1,"Didn't want to spend $200 on the 'name brand' headphones.  These got great reviews so I decided to give them a try.  I have to say that I am extremely satisfied with these headphones.  Sound quality is great, easy to use, and very comfortable!  And all the accessories they come with only adds to the greatness!"
1,Otherwise great
0,Use it with iPod nano 7th Generation and I can never complete a full workout without it having a spotty bluetooth connection.  Really bothers me when my songs just skip midway.  Wish these worked as advertised.  Maybe I have a lemon product since my brothers works fine with his android phone.
1,"I was hesitant about it because I need headphones for running so they must be sweat resistant. Luckily these truly are, plus I like the aesthetic aspect of it. Very satisfied!"
1,"Linking to my iPhone was quick - no code number is needed!  Very comfortable, sound quality is very good.  One small quirk - the lowest volume level, other than mute, is not really very quiet - more like #5 with wired earbuds.  But, unless you are in a very quiet setting, it's not really a problem."
1,Nice
0,"I bought a couple of bluetooth headphones to try them out. These are the worst. If the volume is at max and you press the up button it makes an incredibly loud screeching sound. After a year the battery won't hold charge anymore. They don't stay in as well as my other headphones, either."
1,great but
1,"I've been using them for a couple a days now and I love them, they are a great quality brand. Easy to sync with my phone and I'm loving all the lil extras that came with my headphones."
1,I love these so much. Light and easy to use. Sound quality is very good. I lost my first set and ordered knew ones immediately!
0,I have owned these headphones for less than a year and they already do not work. I used the headphones about twice a week. The headphones will not turn on even though they indicate they are fully charged. Very disappointing. Do not recommend.
1,"I have used these headphones for a couple of days now, when I walk and exercise.  I listen to music on my phone while I am walking.  I found these headphones to be about as good as the ones I have been using for the last year that only cost me $15.  These headphones are of the same design that my other ones are and have the same performance issues as well.  I can't wear them with the connecting cable behind my neck as the photos have shown because the sound cuts out, so I wear them with the cable in front, on my chest.  The cable must not be shielded at all, as the sound cuts out whenever I turn my head to the right.  The sound quality is good, but certainly not great as they are advertised to be.  I rated these at 3 stars out of 5 because they do work, but they would in no way be worth the stated retail price of $169.99.  At the sale price of $36.97 I really don't see them as any better than the headsets I only pay $15 for on Amazon."
1,I needed a new headset for working out at the gym. First I purchased an armband to hold my s9 so I wouldn't loose it. My next step was a headset. The Senso was supposed to be one of the top 5 price wise. I agree!!
0,"I previously owned an older set/model of Senso headphones that lasted about 2.5 years. Once they stopped working, I decided to buy another pair of Senso headphones since I liked my old ones. However, this new pair is much larger in sizing with regard to the part that wraps around the ear lobe. So, it is much harder for these headphones to stay on my ears while I am running. This second set stopped working after 6 months."
1,love these headphones - lost the 1st pair and immediately ordered a replacement pair!
0,horrible headphones - they don't stay in my ears when exercising and are super flimsy. waste of money!
1,Works great & Fits great!
0,"The fit was not comfortable. They are marketed as waterproof, but stopped working as soon as I wore them in the water. Will no longer charge up and turn on. They were worn for literally 10 minutes and now they are useless."
1,"I have not had a chance to wear these during a workout, but so far my opinion is that these are nice, and the sound quality is remarkable. My only issue with them is the piece you wear behind your ear is large... too large for a petite female. I generally have issues with earbuds falling out, so I ordered these for the behind the ear piece, but it is too big for me and unable to be changed. These are a better fit for men than women.<br />As for the service, the seller was great and the product was exactly as described."
1,Great headphones!  Already ordered a second pair!
1,Got these for my boyfriend and he loves them haven’t complained yet
0,Had these for like maybe a month and all of a sudden the other day they just stopped accepting a charge (the light wouldn’t even turn on) and just never turned on again. I’ve seen some people comment about the seller being good about refunding them so I certainly hope that is the case this time and I don’t have to fight another amazon seller who’s product is faulty
1,I bought this for my husband and he loves it. It has very good sound quality and it keeps the charge long as well.
0,"If you're moving, these are not great. I mean moving AT ALL Not sports, not &#34;noise canceling&#34;. They are 8 hour and have great sound when they are in your ear. But they don't stay their."
1,"These wireless earbuds have been great since I purchased them a year ago. Customer service has been excellent also, when I lost a soft ear tip they sent out two new ones. Unfortunately at this time the left side has been inconsistent with connection. I've tried a factory reset and still having issue. It's been a little over a year and the warranty is now up. I don't think I'll purchase these again based on the fact that I don't want to pay full price with the possibility that this may reoccur. I've reached out to the manufacturer and they offered a 5% discount but that's not going to sway my decision to try a brand that carries a two year warranty. Hope this is helpful."
1,Sound quality is fine. Very comfortable fit. So far the battery life has been long. Great value
0,My headphones will not connect with my cell phone. I am disappointed.
1,"Fit well, work great, priced right, what else can I say?"
0,When  I was using  and same time if reciveing email or message . Headphone stops and cellphon speaker  start to work
1,"These are great. The sound is clear, and it connects fast. I needed these because I kept yanking normal ear buds out of my ear and it was annoying."
1,"The sound on these is good. They stay seated in my ear pretty well even during vigorous exercise. I occasionally have to drill one side back in, but it's pretty rare.<br /><br />One design flaw is that the pause/off button is on the outside of the right earpiece, so if you try to push that earpiece into your ear, you end up pausing the music... Also I could do without the slowly blinking blue light during normal operation--it's pretty distracting in a dark airplane cabin, especially to fellow passengers.<br /><br />Battery life is fantastic. They are comfortable for long use. Overall I'm very happy with them."
1,"I had problems using hiking, for some reason, even with the battery fully charged, the sound was failing. I use the headphone together with Google Pixel XL."
0,Sound is not good.<br />Quality of surface very good.<br />It's value for money. But is not a deal. You get what you are paying.
1,"I work out 5 days a week and these ear headphones are great!! Battery last a good week and charging doesn't take long.  Plugs in to car charger makes it easy.<br />If you run,  they are great!! You don't get the line chaffing noise at all.. Great product for the right price!!"
1,"Amazing product. They don't hurt my ears at all, the padding on them are actually really soft! Comfortable to wear. Wish I got them sooner!"
1,"I'm very happy with my earphones.  They were delivered early, and are perfect for my needs.  I work in a noisy area, and the noise cancelling feature is awesome. The sound quality is very good. They are comfortable, with different sizes of the earpieces. Carry case and car charger included.  I highly recommend!  My brother and my niece bought a pair too!"
0,Did not stay secure on runs and only lasted about 2 weeks before failing
0,"These are not sweatproof. I used these when outside mowing the lawn and doing yard work (I live in FL and it’s summer). I also used them when I work out. I work out hard and sweat a lot. They worked the first 10 times or so, but now they continually cut off (with a full battery) and won’t turn back on until they’ve dried out. I bought these as a cheaper alternative to the Plantronics Backbeat Fit earphones that I had previously (which died after a few years). I bought these in July; it’s only September and they’re already malfunctioning. Spend the extra $25 on the Plantronics earphones. Superior sound and actually sweatproof!"
0,they're comfortable but the sound quality and call quality is terrible.
1,"These are great and connect easily. They stay in my ears when I run and have very good sound quality. Battery life isn't an issue unless I forget to turn them off, because I'm pretty sure they'll stay connected to your phone unless you leave range of them. I wish there was no connecting cord because it doesn't sit against my neck very well when I run. I have to adjust the cord somewhat frequently to keep it from tugging on my ears. They're fine for walking, biking or weight-lifting though. I cannot speak to the longevity, but I have no complaints in the two months since I got them. They come with a case, which is nice because I tend to lose things. They also include some extra earbuds, but I haven't had to use them yet. I paid around $40 for these, and I think you'd be hard-pressed to find anything better for that price."
1,"Too bad I lost the directions, am not tech savvy, so it took almost 1 day to figure out how to get them working right.  I like the fact that once they're in ears, they don't fall out while I'm on the elliptical.  Easy to change volume, but remember to adjust the volume on whatever you're watching (I watch Prime Videos and it was very loud from when I had no earphones).  I don't know how much the person who gave them to me paid.  So far, I've used them once, so I don't know how long the battery will stay charged."
1,"Son loved them, had them for almost 3 yrs. Until he ripped on off the wire. But get the warranty they replaced, credited us with out questionm"
1,Using them while doing yard work mowing building fences and listening to music
1,Not as loud as I like but they are loud enough. I like music stupid loud and then some people have said they are too loud... so I’d say my rating is more based on my preferences but the battery lasts for around 7-8 hours so best headphones I’ve had so far and I’ve had alot
1,Only problem is the bit that wraps around your ear - it is not strong enough and too flimsy. Otherwise good product with good sound and nice packaging.
0,Had to hold my phone next to my head for these to work. Even when fully charged. Returned them.
1,Awesome they are great
1,Very pleased with my wireless bluetooth headphones. They are the best I have ever bought. I have never listened to Bose so I cant compare but with these I do not need to even try. Thank you for the quality and clarity of music that I now enjoy.
1,Quickly shipped and awesome headphones for the features and price... you won't be disappointed in this purchase
1,OK good sound quality but distance reception not that great
1,Love them. Works perfectly.
1,"Have only had these a couple of days. Easily paired to all my devices, plenty of different size ear buds to customize fit. What I have listened to so far seems excellent in terms of sound quality, certainly equal to any wired ear buds I have. I will follow up after I have had more time using them. Not quite as good as my Bose noice canceling full headset, but darned close and much more convenient. Would give 4.5 stars, but not an option."
1,"Great sound, nice controls and perfect fit."
1,very good sound. convenient over ears.
1,"As other reviewers' mentioned, the headphones come with a lot of accessories. What I wasn't expecting was that they would be nice and high quality. Even the box they came in was sturdy! I am very happy with the headphones so far!"
0,CALLED COMPANY BECAUSE TRANSMISSION CUT OFF ALL THE TIME. THEY SUGGESTED DOING A FACTORY RESET (PLUGGING IN AND TURNING ON SWITCH)<br />IF THAT DID NOT WORK THEY WOULD SEND ME NEW PAIR.<br />THIS IS SECOND SET THAT THIS HAPPENED TO AND AM RETURNING TO AMAZON. THE HEADPHONES WENT OUT AFTER SENSO WARRANTY.<br />WOULD BE RELUCTANT TO PURCHASE THIS MODEL AS SEEMS THEY ARE NOT RELIABLE.<br />I SHOULD SAY SENSO WAS VERY NICE ON THE PHONE.
1,"Purchased these after having to send my Powerbeats3 back for 5th time to Apple for repair. The ear clip is not quite as sturdy, but the sound is great! I believe it has more options than the Powerbeats3. All of my training runs with them have been good. Battery still has 80% charge after doing marathon today. Definitely well worth the price!"
1,"Great sound, feels comfy, lasts pretty long on one charge, and really good sound."
1,"Love these!  First set arrived and, while they did work, when charging the red light never came on.  Contacted customer support and they said send 'em back and they would replace them.  Not only did they replace them, but Amazon sent the replacement set before the original had actually returned to them.  Gotta love that kind of support.  New set work perfectly.  I wear them when cutting my lawn.  Sound is great (not much bass, but what can you expect from such small speakers) and I have no issues hearing them over my mower.  I am very happy and would recommend these to anyone in the market for an inexpensive wireless headset solution!"
1,Excelente
1,"These are so good. They have good sound, fit easily in my ear, and I love that they have the flexible piece that goes over the ear. It just gives it a little better security from falling than just the bud in my ear. Plus, they don't hurt my ears if I wear it for a long time. Very easy to use. All I had to do was put my phone in pairing mode and it connected immediately. I would definitely recommend these."
1,These buds are well worth the price. Sound and construction are solid. Found adjustable ear hooks excellent at holding buds in place. Highly recommended.
1,"Amazing sound quality, great fit (I have fairly large ears), very durable. Have been using these for a year now and they're still just amazing. Do yourself a favor and buy these!"
0,"Excellent for the 2 weeks it worked, then returned. Do not buy. Only used 3 times. Product wasn't even subjected to sweat or active conditions, only light house cleaning."
1,Excellent product. Great price.
1,Excellent product. I'd buy again. Works great and fits great.
1,Luv em
1,I love my senso headphones.  They wrap fit my ear perfectly.  They cancel background noise. I highly recommend them.
1,"Very good sound, comfortable, very good"
1,Fast delivery and excellent product!
1,Great quality for the price. I get about a year out of each pair.
1,Great sound quality. Awesome 1 year warranty. Wish the charging cord was longer.
1,"Great sound. Works well for my workout, where corded buds were getting in the way. Use with phone in pocket."
1,I LOVED them so much I bought a pair for our teenage son and he got lots of compliments from his friends on his cool headphones =)
1,"I love these headphones!  The sound is very high quality and the volume and on and off switches are intuitive to use.  Ordinary earbuds don't stay in my ears, but with the over-the-ear flexible plastic piece, I have no trouble keeping them where they belong.  They paired smoothly with my iPad and iPhone, and I can't wait to use them on my looong flight to Europe soon.  The case is small and will fit into my suitcase easily, and I love that a car charger was also included for no extra price!  What's not to love with this deal?  Nothing!"
1,So far my Senso headphones have been great.  They are very lightweight and quite snug in the ear.  I would definitely recommend.
1,Good sound quality. Works with my iPhone. I like that there are different size of ear buds available.
1,Looses charge fast but works well for me at my work desk to listen to music and can charge my phone at the same time.
1,Solid product and exceptional customer service.  What more can you ask for?
1,"The sound quality is good, the noise canceling is better than I actually want, and the battery life is impressive. I have 3 complaints, and none of them are good complaints.<br /><br />1) The volume doesn't go down low enough. They're a little too loud when I'm in a moderately quite building on the lowest volume setting.<br /><br />2) They look ridiculous.<br /><br />3) They didn't make it through the washer and dryer, sadly. I had them for less than a month and put them through the washer/dryer. Only one side works and the volume is seriously reduced on it."
1,Delivered on time. Great comfort using prime with the return policy. Love the warranty. The extras that come with this package are very useful and a nice bonus. The sound quality and volume is great and they really do cancel out ambient noise as the earbuds seal really nicely. Connecting to devices was really easy and you can connect to multiple devices at once and when one source is paused the other source takes over automatically. The fit is comfortable and the silicone hook that goes on the outer ear is so comfortable you forget it's there. I have recommended these to friends and I would buy as a gift.
1,"Great. I use these every day. At the gym,  around the house, in the car. You name it. Thinking of buying another pair for a family member."
1,The headphones are great and sound wonderful. My only complaint is that the carrying case is poorly made and the zipper broke after the very first time I used it.
1,They work as expected and were easy enough to pair with my iPhone. The reason I gave these 5 stars is because they came with a dual USB port car charger which has been insanely useful for me since I spend most of my work shift in a vehicle.
0,I read up on other reviews and it seems it isn't just me having issues with these headphones. The first time I bought this product they worked for a little over 2 months. They wouldn't turn back on even after being fully charged. I contacted Amazon (who were really nice about the whole process) and helped me get new headphones. One month later while I'm using them they shut off. I figured they needed to be charged but they became fully charged after a couple minutes. I now have the SAME original problem in a shorter time period. Unfortunately I don't believe I will be using this product again
1,I would put these up against beats any day
1,These are excellent wireless ear buds. The quality of the sound is excellent and they are very comfortable. Well worth the money if you are looking for outstanding wireless ear buds!!
1,I use them when I go walking and also while I am working around the house.  They sound great and stay in place! The on/off and volume keys are easy to use.  I absolutely LOVE them.  I will totally buy them again.
1,Bought these for my wife. She says they have great sound and work well in her gym classes that she takes. Product is just as it is described in the listing.
1,Excelente
1,Love it!
1,They work great as expected
1,"Muddy sound and very bad battery life left me regretting paying $30 for these. I would rate it lower, but they ARE value entry level IEMs and do more or less what they should. Not worth more than $20."
1,Those headphones has not noise cancelling!!! I bought the same many months ago and after many time using it I broke it so I had to replace it buying for the same brand and model and everything is the same.<br /><br />Otherwise I bought it because I really like the sound of those not for noise cancelling
1,"Great earbuds, great sound, with powerful bass. Battery life is great."
1,Great head set and very reasonable price
1,good headphones but they totally have connection problems when running and theyre in my pocket.
1,Arrived just in time. I liked the other accessories incl. Like the magnet/fone holder. Pretty good sound. The earplugs are good 4 ppl w/tiny ears & can be adjusted so they sit snug on your ears.
1,"I sweat a lot, so I need headphones that won't slip out during my workout.  These are awesome and the sound is amazing!!  I have searched high and low for headphones that can withstand my intense workouts.  These fit the bill to a T.  After about four months, they just stopped working.  I called Invotek customer service and they are sending a replacement pair.  Awesome product, awesome customer service!!!"
0,"Worked great for 3 months, then the battery completely crapped out.  Would not buy again."
1,Came in a timely manner. The service/follow up from the seller was very good. The product is good but I am unable to walk more than 10 feet away from the phone before I start to get the mechanical interference. Not what I was hoping for - I don't like to be tied to my phone.
1,"Easy to use, good sound quality, and competitive price."
0,These were great initially however I bought these on June 29th and by mid September they were shutting off mid run and now not pairing at all.  I have tried multiple solutions offered and these are out of commission.  Bummer.  Update I bought another set and still the same issue. They last for a couple of months then die.  Don't wast your money
1,"Absolute unbelievable sound!! better than any high price earbud; However, the silicone ear straps that go around the ear are very flimsy and do not hold the earbuds in place when working out.  If these ear straps could be more rigid, this would be the top wireless headphnes on the market"
1,"In the 5 days since these headphones arrived, I’ve tested them in a series of situations, & my conclusion: they’re a very good product for a reasonable price. My one beef is the ear loops, which don’t adjust down for those of us with smaller ears. As soon as I unboxed them & tried them on, I resolved to send them back because the ear loops were a deal-breaker. Upon further consideration, I decided to trust the many positive reviews (even from small-eared buyers) & try them out before returning them.<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, they arrived fully charged & ready to use, & they paired easily with my iPhone 6. I’ve worn them on a long but easy walk, on the subway, on a very long & extremely sweaty uphill hike, & around my apartment. In all situations, including the all-important challenging hike in the hot sun, they stayed in my ears & sounded great. I made a phone call indoors, & they worked fine. I’m not sure how phone calls would work in an outdoor, windy situation, though, because the passive noise canceling lets in lots of sound, such as wind & subway din. That’s okay with me, because I like to hear if somebody’s coming up behind me when I’m walking.<br /><br />Now, about those ear loops, which are a significant design flaw & lost the headphones two stars. They are useless for those of us with small ears, & they get in the way of hats & sunglasses. When I wear these things (see photo), I look like a kid wearing dad's headphones. Luckily, the small earbuds keep the earphones in, but having properly fitting loops as a backup would be ideal. Senso, please wire the loops or find some other way to make them fit different ear sizes. Even if doing so raises the price a couple of dollars, it’d be well worth it."
1,"So generally, I have to say I really like these headphones, especially for the incredibly affordable price I paid for them. The sound is great, with the caveat that they really have to be right in your ear to get the good sound, otherwise it sounds a bit hollow. This might just be a me problem as when I've gone to try to purchase more expensive wireless headphones in the past, I always have to tell the retailer that my ears are small and shaped much differently than the ""standard"" ear. They never believe me, and then are surprised when it falls off. The hook on these headphones helps mitigate that issue, but it's still a bit of a problem for me. The hooks can adjust, but are too big for my ears. Nevertheless, they do the job. Hold charge for a few days and work for what I need."
0,Did not last for even 30 days with sparing use.
1,Its good
0,Don't go out in the wind or run/bicycle at over 2mph because you won't hear a thing but static.
1,These are a great value and hold a charge for a long time.
1,"UPDATE: After wearing these for a couple of weeks I've gone back to using my over the ear noise canceling headphones...  The noise canceling is weak at best.  I love the controls, but I have to say the most disappointing aspect is signal interference.  Before buying these I had a set TAOTRONICS canceling buds, the noise canceling was great and the bluetooth signal was strong and I don't ever recall anything interrupting the signal.  I had to replace them after damaging them while wearing the stiff cable in front rather than across my neck.<br /><br />With these senso's using a Stihl trimmer if I got the trimmer near the phone the signal would cut out, it was also interrupted when I was walking by my electric fence after trimming the fence line.  Further if you lie the phone down and walk away and no lie turn your head the signal will cut out.  Once I find a new alternative I will give these to one of my children...<br /><br />FIRST POST: Fast shipping, nice packaging and accessories.  Nice fitting, comfortable buds.  Cable is light and soft and not noisy compared to other wireless buds I've had.  Range is lacking and the Bluetooth signal can be completely blocked at approximately 10'-15' with nothing more than the turn of your head.  This is very disappointing personally.  Noise cancellation is good considering they are buds. I would recommend these but don't wander far from the broadcasting device."
1,They work well if you are within 75’ of device. Sound fine but they lose connection through wall.
1,"Great set of earbuds ,there comfortable and work good , they are very loud with some good bass. I didn't realize that a set of wireless Bluetooth headset could get that loud. Thanks for the great deal."
1,This was a replacement shipment as the first headphones I broke by pressing the MFB too hard I guess.  Communication was good during this process.
0,"Earlobes too loose, if I bend them, then the cushions pop out, too loose. Sound is OK."
1,Love the music listening functionality. Unfortunately when using the set for talking on the phone they can hear me but I can't hear them. Disappointed.
1,"These wireless headphones are IMO are just as good as the higher priced ones. I struggle with the EarPods that just stick in your ear. They are always falling out and the ones with a cord are worse because I'm alway yanking them out of my ear every time I turn my head. With these the hook keeps them from pulling out and the soft ear pads are very comfortable for extended listening. Coupled with the fact that they are wireless, you don't have to worry about them being yanked out when you turn your head or get too far from you phone.  I'm very satisfied with my purchase."
1,very good quality absolutely love them
1,"Received product within time stated and was very simple to pair with phone. So far I've used these on 2 runs and worked perfectly. If for some reason they don't work or problem(s) occur I'll edit this, but for now 5 stars."
1,"The Amazon vendor was outstanding. I callled about an issue fully expecting to get the run around, assuming I would be able to get any response. Are you kidding me? Not only did I get a live person, but that person was extremely helpful. In just a few minutes, we determined what was needed and a very satisfactory solution was aschieved. WOW! All of my concerns about what would happen if I had to call an Amazon vendor were dispelled. I am amazed at the level of service.<br />The senso Bluetooth headset is perfect. They are the best. I now believe; however, that the vendor’s service is good."
1,Very happy with these headphones!
1,No need to be redundant. High Quality. Lots of handy Extra's. Excellent value.
1,"Exactly what I needed when working out. If it wasn't for the music coming through them, I could forget that I'm actually wearing them."
1,"I bought a pair for my husband and myself after my son did a research and found the SENSO headphones were the best.  We are very happy, the sound is clear, easy to adapt on the ears, what I like about them is that they are waterproof so we can use them with confidense while workingout in the gym. We are very happy!!"
1,I was so excited to receive my wireless headphones.  My phone is kinda funky sometimes and it is wonderful to have wireless headphones while I am talking on the phone as well as when I am working out.  These are amazing headphone except for one issue.  They rub the insides of my ears.  So I end up using one for a while and then changing to the other side.  I almost never use both at the same time because it will seriously limit how long I can use them.  That is the only reason for the 3 star rating.  If it wasn't for that issue they definitely would have been a 5 star item.
0,"Lot of air through it while talking. I bought several senso headphones before, they used to be better. I was so disappointed in the last one."
1,Wireless my husband loves them. He is definitely pleased with the quality of them
1,Best investment in a set of Bluetooth headphones. No more dangling wires at the gym and I can walk well over 30 feet away from my phone.
1,"Work well, the battery life is good, and they fit good in the ears. They are a little bulky then other brands but so far they have lasted a good while."
1,These are comfortable to wear especially considering that they are ear buds. It was simple to sync the Bluetooth. I just had to make sure they were fully charged first
1,Best headphones ever!!  They fit well in my ears. Connection is solid and has a great sound.  Love these Headphones!!
1,Great headphones. Great sound. Way better than beats earbuds or the JBL Under Armour headphones for 1/4 the cost. Highly recommend. Best deal on Amazon.
1,It was easy to pair with my iPhone 7 plus. Also keeps charged a few days. I like it very much.
1,"Incredible headphones to be honest. Lasted me 2 years of almost daily use. Used them in the gym, while traveling, while driving, and while cycling and never had any problems with this product. I accidentally broke mine by sitting on them. But other than that, GREAT BUY!!"
1,"These work great while working outdoors in the heat, very comfortable.  I did have an issue with it charging no longer, and when I contacted the company they agreed to replace it immediately no questions asked.  Great Customer Service!!!"
1,"These are perfect. Exactly what I was looking for!<br /><br />I use these primarily at the gym, & I regularly go in the spa or steam sauna following my workout.<br /><br />The number one thing I was looking for was waterproof. These are just below full submerging swimming, so that's perfect. Sometimes I actually wear them in the shower if I don't plan on washing my hair.<br /><br />They have proved to be perfect for working out in too. They are Bluetooth, & I didn't realize how tethered I was with regular plug-in headphones until I got these. The range of the Bluetooth is good as well. They are super comfortable. They faith well into the ear canal, & the wrap around piece that goes over and behind your ear is flexible and comfortable. I never notice it when I'm wearing them.<br />The headphones are great too because once I put them on and adjust them to how I want them they stay put.<br />The buttons are super easy to use. They actually come with a card that's kind of a quick notes guide, which did help at the beginning as I got used to them. One of my favorite things is that these actually tell you when you turn them on, & tell you when they are connected. Same for turning them off. This is great for me; no trying to figure out beeping indicators or having to take them out to see lights flashing or whatnot.<br /><br />I'm not sure if they are specifically noise cancelling, but since they fit snugly it does dull the noises of the gym to some degree. Also on the plus list.<br /><br />They come in a nice neat box. Inside are directions, the card I mentioned before.<br />There is a sturdy round case with a net pocket on one side to carry a cord. It comes with two cords: a short micro USB and a long flat cord that converts to have both a lightening plug (for Apple products) and a micro USB.<br /><br />After looking at a lot of headphones I'm really glad I decided to go with these. They are really great."
1,"My headphones stopped turning on, I emailed SENSO customer service and they replied almost immediately, asked me to try a hard reset and provided step by step instructions to do the reset. Reset did not fix the problem, they verified my address and immediately shipped out a new pair. Best customer service I have experienced in a long time."
1,"I bought these to use at the gym, work great. I also use them while cutting grass.  Bought the daughter a pair for her birthday."
1,"Great sound,  great fit,  battery life seems great<br />Bought a second pair for my wife.<br />Comes with a nice case and both pairs I received had a nice little extra gift!"
1,They work great for hands-free talking while driving and exercising.
1,Outstanding headphones! I love how they feel and the sound quality is very good. Excellent for the price!
1,My ears are so hard to fit. Previously I've only been able to where beats. These have better sound quality and are wireless and were less expensive!  I haven't heard sound quality like this since I had those huge speakers of the 80's!
1,So far we are pleased with it
1,Best headphones for best price! I mostly use this in the Gym and I am extremely happy with the quality and features. Car Charger and dual charging cable inclusion is a big plus!!
1,"Great sound, but lots of wind noise when on a bicycle."
1,Didn’t like cause they shut off while swimming thought they were for swimming but not apparently.
1,Airplanes
1,These are amazing! Came with a case and chargers. The sound is nice and loud. It's a total steal for only 39$!
0,"OK, where do I start? I read all the reviews which prompted me to purchase this set.  initial use I found the headset lacked bass response. I contacted the company and they asked me to do a reset.  The reset seemed to address the bass somewhat to an acceptable level.  I tried using these in the evening to sleep with and found that the blue blinking power light was bright enough to notice it in a darkened room.  The only workaround I discovered was got place a small piece of electrical tape over this light. The final issue that forced me to return these was that several times after powering these onI would press the play button on the headset and the music would simple come out of the iPhone and not the headset.  The headset buttons were controlling the volume and pause the music coming out of the iphone speaker no sound was coming out of the headset.  Maybe I received a faulty set?  especially since there seems to be some many good reviews.  But this has been my experience."
1,Great so far. When I first turn them on and link to my phone there are clicks for about 5-10 seconds before I can clearly hear the music on my phone.
0,Once I got the headphones everything seemed great. They were already charged so I listened to my music right away. Once they died I put them on a the charger until the light changed from red to blue but once I started listening to my music they kept turning off on me. I kept trying to charge them only to get the same results.
1,"The earphones fit very well, are very light, and the sound quality is quite good.  The volume is loud, almost too loud at the lowest setting.  A couple of knocks: there is no way to mute the microphone from the headset while on a call (must use the phone's mute button), and some callers have complained of hearing their voice echo when I'm using the headset."
1,Works great nice clear sound and fits perfect. Comes in a nice little case and connects no problem
0,Poor quality. Left side went out after 6 months of use. Wouldn't recommend.
1,so far the headphones are working out great for my husband. Sound is good and battery life is perfect for his long hour days. I've had a bad experience with another purchase/vendor so i'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop. Presentation of the device is pretty good for the price.
1,"I am not a techy person but I did like the sound these have. Also I have really small ears and the part that goes around my ears can be pinched tighter so they stay in my ears pretty darn good, even when i ran."
1,The headphones paired very easily with my Pixel2.  It is so much easier than my wired earphones. The battery last forever.
1,"I've had these for a month and a half now. The headphones were a little uncomfortable at first but I quickly adjusted to them as I did not use the around the ear style previously. The foam earbuds wore out rather quickly and showed serious wear and tear within 2 weeks, but the other earbuds provided (rubber) have held up well so far and are comfortable for extended periods of time. The volume on these is excellent and I have not had to max the volume between the buds and phone once, even in the car with the windows down on the freeway. Excellent purchase for the price. Will update in the future after further use.<br /><br />Edit: These died after 5 months. Simply would not pair to any device even when fully charged and a factory reset used. Looking at the other reviews, it appears this is a common problem. I've attempted to contact the seller by phone but haven't had any luck so far. Will update if I hear back, but I have to reduce my score. There's no reason these should have stopped working and I made sure to never immerse them in water (sweat is as bad as it got) and never used a fast charger.<br /><br />Second Edit: The seller has contacted me via email and agreed to replace the product with minimal frustration or issue. I should have the new paid by Friday. I've adjusted back to 4 stars due to the company quickly and professionally honoring the warranty."
1,It had a great sound quality and great noise cancellation. There was little to no noise bleed when at full volume. They were great until they stopped working out of the blue. Bought something similar to these before and the same thing happened. Looks like earbuds like these have a life span of around 6 months.
1,"it's ok to use, but the price is cheap. I use it for gym exercises, and it works well."
1,I’ve had these for a year now and still no issues. I love them. The bass heavy songs aren’t the greatest but they are still nice
1,Great value for money
1,Great product when it works
1,Excellent headphones!
1,Product looks reliable. It came with a car power supply which was a bonus.
1,I bought these after I lost  to my PowerBeats 2 and I absolutely love these headphones they are perfect for any activity. I plan to buy another pair to keep as a backup.
1,This was a gift and the receiver is pleased and that is what was important.
1,"I bought these after breaking a few bluetooth headsets. My previous headsets would just suddenly stop returning, probably cause I sweat on them or I'd try to shower in them without knowing its waterproof rating. After my last ones, I've decided I wouldn't buy something really expensive and tried these out. Apparently these used to be expensive but have been marked down when I bought them. I was skeptical, but these really surprised me! At first I didn't like how bass heavy it was, but then I adjusted equalizer settings on my phone and it now sounds better than any of my previous bluetooth headsets hands down! It's so good that I had to take time out of my day to rate these! Good job Senso! Never heard of the company, but awesome product!"
1,Elegantly designed product with all the extras u might need. The case is very well designed and unobtrusive. Earbuds paired flawlessly with my iPhone 7 and sound is great. Several different size ear tips to ensure comfort. Includes car charger and cable. Will be getting a pair for my husband too!
0,"I don't understand how this product has so many glowing reviews. These were the noisiest headphones I've ever worn. They'd rustle in the slightest breeze, like say the air moving across them when I started waling. When I went for a run, they'd squeak, loudly. Too loud to hear anything at all."
1,Great sound and fit nicely the silicone piece that wrap around my ear are way too big and there's no way to adjust them. But the still stay in my ears  without needing their support.
1,"They work as you hope they would. They paired easily, stayed in contact and delivered satisfactory sound. They don't sound quite as good as the ear buds that came with the iPhone, but they're definitely worth the money. I've worn them at the gym and gotten quite sweaty with no issues. They also last all day at work to block put the distractions. The mic even works on phone calls."
0,"I bought these with lower expectations due to the price.  These are not even worth the $36. I had a pair of original beats wireless earbuds that finally dies after 3 years.  I should have just gone back and got the new beats 3, but I saw this and decided to give them a try.  When they arrived I opened them and charged them, tested out the blue tooth and all seemed well.  Tonight I went to use them, and after 10 minutes I threw them in the trash.  The first indication all was not well was when I put them on, the part that goes over your ear is extremely flexible and didn't want to stay in place at first.  After that, I discovered just how weak the blue tooth was if you have your phone/iPod on your left arm, it doesn't keep a solid connection to the earbuds.  The blue tooth control for the earbuds is in the right ear, and as I started walking every time I would swing my arm it would loose the connection and skip. Like a bad dream it took me back to my CD walkman days.  When my arm was aligned with my body, it would skip, as my arm moved forward it would connect.  Save yourself time and aggravation, and just avoid these."
1,"Great sound, easy to use. I use them when I run and they stay in place and don't fall out or move. Very pleased with these."
0,Does not work!
1,"I like the idea of these, but they don't really conform to my ears. It's also hard for people to hear me when I take calls with them."
1,My daughter loves them. She says great sound and they have a good range.
1,Great product.
1,Great performance and excellent customer support as well.  Highly recommended!
1,"I bought one for myself when I hit balls at the range an ride my bike.  My wife liked them so I had to buy another one.  That said, she gives them 5 stars but I give them 4 because they just don't seem to stay in all the time, and pushing them in more hurts, but maybe my head\ear are just too big...LOL"
1,Great headphones for the price
1,Performs as advertised
1,These headphones are a great deal. The sound quality is very good and they are comfortable to wear working out inside or out.
1,"Great sound, but the the silicone that straps around the ear is to flimsy, on intense exercises the headphones will fall out of your ears easy. They are also more bulky than the powerbeats2."
1,"Great little set of head phones for the money.  Had a couple of dollars discounted, so I paid a little less than $30.  The sound out of them are awesome for a Bluetooth and when I'm in my small apartment, I can just set my phone anywhere and walk anywhere without the hassle.  Love them!!"
1,"I had been using a Samsung head set, and was very happy with the sound but had problems with the  ear plugs.<br />The Senso has better sound and fits better in the ear.<br />Only thing that needs improving is the strap that is used is too flimsy, gets caught under collars and sticks to my skin when working out.<br />Very happy with product so far.<br />Mike Taylor"
1,I did like it but something was wrong with the left side of the headphones but still good i hope every saler has there item seal up not open that how some costumers complain and other but still it was good 4 stars
1,They seem to stay in pretty good when I run I have to try and more and I will re-rate in a little while
1,"Buy now!!!!<br /><br />Wow.  These earbuds are very impressive.<br /><br />I recognize many, many frequencies by name, and let me tell you,  I hear near full (hearing :p)spectrum accuracy with these.  I received these Monday and used them all day yesterday - I couldn't stop going through all of my trusted reference songs, just to hear them through these magical little drivers.  I joked with my wife that I would never be taking these out and if she wanted to talk to me when we're working in the garden together, she'll have to call me :)<br /><br />Some notes:<br />They were scary looking size wise...but I thought perhaps this is the reason why they had such good reviews for their sound quality...true dat!<br /><br />They are soo comfortable!!! It's like finding &#34;THE one&#34;.<br /><br />Much like finding &#34;THE ONE&#34; it's not without it's super duper tiny, yet endearing flaws:<br />1. Dey UGLY.  I bought the red/black ones, maybe other color/s are better in this department<br /><br />2. This is more of a device issue by a certain fruit computer company that shall not be named...i can hear the less than desirable &#34;coil noise&#34; from my version 7+ phone - more predominantly with spoken word tracks, less noticeable with music.<br /><br />In conclusion minor flaws, half of which have nothing to do with the earbuds themselves and the other half subjective.<br /><br />P.s. If something should break due to device failure, or some other issue arrises, i WILL update my review.  This is a supersecretcel guarantee.  I mostly rely on  reviews for my purchases and i want to contribute where i can, too.  Cheers!"
1,"Very comfortable, high quality, great sound.  If I had a complaint it would be that they are actually too loud!  On the lowest setting they are still too loud to hear what's going on around you - which is what I need when listening to music while I work.  But, just taking one out fixes that issue!"
1,"Okay, do I have had these for only one day, took them on a bike ride and I love them!!...Fits good in my ear, cuts out the outside noise.  Recommend this to any active person to wear."
1,"Use them all the time , they work great"
1,"I use it while jogging,cancels surrounding noise quite well.I love the sound quality,price and delivery.I would recommend it to anyone"
1,The headset fits very comfortably and the sound is excellent. There's actually two charging cables in which one of them converts to an fast USB charger.  Invotek  customer service is hands down one of the best no hassle customer service experience you wiill have. Good Job Invotek!!
1,Great product. Works as advertised. Probably will order a 2nd pair!
1,Not bad.
1,"I'm really surprised by the way these headphones have done their job, because despite being economical, its operation is on a pair with some of higher value. I'm not going to compare them with beats earphones (I have those and they are great) but based on price and performance on what i use them they are excellent. I use them every day to exercise and never say no. The battery is excellent too, in conclusion they are highly recommended. A +."
1,"These are amazing! I went from apples regular headphones to these. Let me tell you, i can’t hear a thing around me! I enjoy watching netflix while i’m on the elipitcal and hate trying to tone down the music and chatter around me! These have done that! I couldnt be happier with my first wireless."
1,"Use them everyday at work. Great battery life, fast charge and Excellent sound!!!!!"
0,These sucked.
1,"Addition: Sorry, forgot. They sound great. Stay connected at over 50 feet in open spaces. +30 inside a building. So you see, this is more of a tablet use review than a phone. If I had a smart phone, I'd still recommend.<br /><br />I've had these for 6 months now. They worked fine for a couple of weeks then, for whatever reason, they stopped pairing to my mini-Ipad. I contacted Senso ActivBuds and they cleared the problem. It was less than 24 hours. I have not had a problem since and I would recommend these to anyone. I've included the procedure for &#34;repairing&#34; the earbuds. Enjoy.<br /><br />The Senso ActivBuds headphones are designed to seamlessly connect to any Bluetooth enabled device.  The issue you have described happens to all Bluetooth devices as the connection between the two devices gets &#34;corrupted&#34; and needs to be re-configured.  In order to do that, please `Forget the Device` on your mobile phone for the Senso headphones and try pairing again.  In your Bluetooth settings on your phone, you will see all detected Bluetooth devices.  Click on the Senso ActivBuds option and click on Forget this Device.  Next pair your headphones to your mobile device once again as shown in the instructions manual.<br /><br />I am very certain that this will resolve the issue you are facing with your headphones.<br /><br />Although you have already performed the factory reset before, there may be a calibration issue with the headphone you received and I would like you to reset them just one more time.<br /><br />Here are the instruction for resetting the headphones:<br /><br />1. Reset the Senso headphone to factory settings (while plugged into a power source, press/hold the power button for 7 seconds).<br />2. Unplug the headphone from charging cable and power them on.<br />3. Enter the earbuds into the pairing mode and follow instructions for connecting."
1,"Wow, totally surprised by what you get for the money.  As an avid Amazon consumer and one that has been duped by knockoff's on various purchases these are the real deal.  They sound great and they last all of the 8 hours as advertised.  I tried the &#34;flexible&#34; rubber earpiece but ended up choosing the memory foam earpiece for all day comfort.  The charging port cover is a little tricky to get off (would recommend and &#34;larger&#34; nubins for future runs of these headphones).  I am hoping they hold up.  For the price what do you have to lose, and for a change these surprised me."
1,"So far so good...I am really happy thus far with the sound quality and ease of use of the Bluetooth Headphones by Senso.  I am highly impressed with the sound definitions. They sound amazing. Customer care and follow up is outstanding as well. When was the last time you heard from one of the owners of a company checking on your purachase??  Well, I did. And I love it. Also, these babies come with a 1 year warranty. Like I said,&#34;so far so good&#34;."
1,"I love the sounds on this headphones. It can be very loud and has great bass. The only con is I bought it at $35 last week, and it's sold for under $20 this week =/"
1,Amazing head phones.. how customer service should be.
1,"I am very active with hiking and working out and these headphones stay in my ears and are comfortable the entire time. The company is more than generous with their package- providing a caring case, a car charger, and charging cables with extra earbuds as well. my headphones broke after two months of use (don't know how), but within not even a day their customer service hooked me up with new headphones right away. Great headphones, shows battery life level on iPhone 7, awesome customer support. Would recommend."
1,"Finally, a pair of earbuds that fit comfortably in my ears! They sound great, look great, and the charger cable that comes with a lightning cable attachment is a neat little bonus. I love them!"
1,So far so good! I ll recommended to buy
0,This product is now not working. It is terrible that the product life cycle is so short --I would think it should at least work for a year -- I need a refund or something
0,They broke. I have actually ordered these both twice. They just stopped working with no explanation.
0,"not made very well.the hooks break off very Quickly. Warranties pretty good. Would I buy another maybe for my child but not if you want to work out.and ,be active"
1,Loved this product!!!
1,"So ever since upgrading the cellphomenand now having a phone with no audio jack for corded headsets, I have been trying to find the best bluetooth options for myself. I bought a few that were more expensive(ex beats 3). These headphones are just as good , if not much better than the beats 3. When I first received them, I put them through a few of my own personal tests. Not one issue. They survived getting wet, prolonged use of music listening and phone conversations.<br /><br />My only issue is the 3 foot cord does not seem to fit the charging port. The mini charging cord is fine and will just get a two sided usb extender cord."
1,Only had them a week but the sound is great and they stay in my ears while I am on the elliptical.  Paired with my I phone easily.
1,"I was looking for new bluetooth wireless headphones to wear for my Star Wars 10K and Half Marathon this past weekend as I was getting tired or wearing the wired earbuds that came with my iphone and these SENSO Bluetooth Headphones caught my attention because of the reviews and the price ($30+ when I purchased them). Here's my review:<br /><br />PROS:<br />-  ACCESSORIES: The accessories that come with the bluetooth wireless headphones already gave me more bang for my buck!<br />-  BATTERY LIFE: The battery life is great. After wearing them for 4 hours total (not continuously), I had only burn through less than 1/4 of the battery.<br />-  COMFORT: After all the sweat I had during my races, not once did it make me feel uncomfortable (thanks to the waterproof technology!). It did, however, cause it to slip out of my ear on more than one instance (please see CONS below for more details).<br />- CONNECTION: The bluetooth connection between the headphones and my phone did not drop. This is was important for me because during my runs, if I am in my zone and the music keeps dropping in and out, I lose focus. Not once during my 10K run and Half Marathon did the connection drop nor did the music fade in and out. The music played continuously during my runs. Overall, the connection IS GREAT!<br />- WEIGHT: It was lightweight on my ears. It did not irritate my ears nor did it feel like it was pulling on my ears during my strides on my run. One of the accessories that comes with the headphones is a clip that can be used to change the length of the cord between the ear buds, which I used to decrease that irritating sensation of the cord bouncing up and down on the back of my neck when running.<br />- CONTROLS: Everything you need to control your music (volume, skip track, pause/play) and answer your calls is located on the right earbud! Talk about convenience!<br />- WARRANTY: 1 YEAR WARRANTY! Can't beat that!<br /><br />CONS:<br />- SOUND: This is where it loses it's star for me. The sound quality isn't great. It's decent and tolerable (it has A LOT OF BASS), but for those who are &#34;audiophiles&#34; and like the crisp high tones and the mids, this bluetooth wireless headphone isn't for you (I know, because I also have BEATS). But I was willing to overlook the sound quality for all the PROS I stated above and keep these headphones since they performed well for me.<br />- SIZING: What I mean by this is the size of the silicone caps on the tip of the earphone that goes into your ears. You're provided with 3 sizes (small, med, large silicone pieces). I wore the headphones with the medium silicone caps. It stayed in well until I started to sweat heavier during the race and the right headphone had slipped out of my ear on more than 1 occasion. Not that it's a bad thing, but it can be annoying during a race. It would be nice if they provided at least 2 other sizes for the silicone caps.<br /><br />That's about it! Overall, it's a pretty good bluetooth wireless headphone. I would definitely buy one again and would recommend to family and friends."
1,"I love these, I have the expensive gear circle so I bought these for travel, these are awesome and I will use them all the time."
1,"Very good seller, great product."
1,"These are handy, easy to use, have great sound, and resist sweat. I use them to exercise outside in hot, humid, San Antonio, TX, and I have long hair - so they get WET - and keep on going. The only con is that I am petite, with a narrow face, small hat size, and small ears, so these are a little big for me, but the over the ear portion keeps them on and is comfortable, so it is ok. If you are not petite, these will probably fit perfectly."
1,"This is my second pair. I bought a pair for me a couple years ago and they still work great. The last pair was for my wife. She has only used them a couple times but so far so good. For the quality and the price point, you can't beat these headphones. Both of ours our the older model but I may buy the newer model just to try them out as well."
1,"High quality. Accidentally washed them and they came out fine. Great, deep sound. Highly satisfied. I use them for the gym."
1,Excellent product for the price.
1,I have super tiny ears and the ear buds always fall out. These are amazing. They stay in my ear and they're great for working out or just listening at work. High recommend.
1,I’m very happy with my bluetooth headphones. I walk 7 miles a day and they provide a excellent sound. They hold a good charg for three days of walking.
1,I have had about 10 pair of Bluetooth headphones in the last few years and the Senso is by far the best I have had. Great sound with good bass. Also very comfortable and stays on the ears. I almost never review products but these are a winner.
1,"As described, works well."
1,I use the headphones for running.  I have owned very expensive brands and really cheap brands...with a blind sound test these headphones match up with the more expensive brands.  Really clear sound but not extreme bass...for running this is  sufficient.
1,"Best 30 bucks you can spend on head phones. They are not Bose or Beats, bit for 30.00 dolaars, you know that's not what you are buying. The sound quality is grat and they fit comfortably. The bluetooth is easy to set up and I had no connection issues. They come in a nice carrying case with cords and a car charger. They just don't have a wall outlet for them to charge, but you have 10 laying around because of all your phone chargers."
1,"*UPDATE/BOUGHT A NEW ONE (lightning deal for only $22!) 1/30/2018<br />Alright, I'll keep this brief and keeping my stars the same (3 stars)<br /><br />Pros: Sound quality and fit<br /><br />Cons: Bluetooth connection time akes 4 - 8 seconds, sometimes even 20 seconds. Battery life = wow, I'm not sure if I received a bad pair, but I'm having to charge my lightning deal senso twice a day and that's with only 2 hours of usage time! I guess i received a lightning deal version?<br /><br />*UPDATE (gift bought Xmas for my cousing) :: 12/25/17<br /><br />No update to stars because he does make a good point on the cons. Bought this for my cousin since he and I will be running a marathon on May 2018, and he needs a sports bluetooth buds instead of the cheap $5 earphones he's been using for years. According to him:<br /><br />Pros: Sound quality and noise isolation. He said he can sleep in the bus even when there's no music. Battery life is superb, and he said that he showered with it before so props for it being real nice and water resistant. Blueetooth connectivity takes only a second.<br /><br />Cons: his ears are SUPER small that the little ear hook thing for the ear doesn't even touces any parts of his ear. he wishes that it's adjustable or changeable.<br /><br />*UPDATE: 11/15/17 -- 3 months of usage almost everyday and it died<br />Alright. Lowering my stars to 3 now. As the update title say, it died.<br />Here I was all stretched and foam rolled, about to do my 5 mile run.<br />I tried turning it on and nothing. Nada. I tried to charge it but there's no red indication light that it's charging, so I figure maybe the LED light died. I went about my run using a wired earphones instead. An hour later, thinking it's probably somewhat charged...still nothing. Pressed hard on the on/off button. Still nothing. Threw it away and will try out a different brand, but I may come back and purchase a new Senso again, though not now.<br /><br />*UPDATE: 10/26/17 --- 2 months of usage almost everyday<br />It's still holding up. However, bringing my stars down to 4 now. See reasons below:<br /><br />1. Bluetooth connectivity to my phone isn't so quick anymore. I mean it DOES connect, but it takes a while and a couple turning off and on of the earphone before it actually connects. One time I thought it connected (since the robotic lady AI voice said &#34;connected&#34;), but my music was blasting for 2 minutes at my cubicle! Finally my coworker joked and asked if I'm trolling them, letting me know that my music is on cranked up speaker mode! So embarrassed! Not to mention, I was new to the company too!<br /><br />2. The battery doesn't last as long anymore. As soon as I hit 50% (which is supposedly and probably 3 to 4 hours of usage) the battery drain becomes ridiculous, and it will only last for at least 1.5 hours of usage.<br /><br />Overall though, it's still good and splash (and maybe water) proof. Used this when it was pouring out one time while I was running for 8 miles training for my marathon and it survived!<br /><br />Original Review: 8/18/17<br />AMAZING!! Wow, I was a little skeptic at first since I've purchased similar bluetooth earphones like this but of different brands and the sound quality wasn't good. I decided to take a chance because of the reviews and I don't regret a single thing. Hands down the best and most affordable (and durable) Bluetooth earphones. I received it right when I was about to head to the gym to do my lifting and 5 mile cardio. Decided to test how good these are by putting them on my most intense and sweatiest workout and it held up! Here's my breakdown after a couple of days of using them.<br /><br />IMPORTANT: These do not have an ACTIVE noise cancelling while listening to music, meaning it doesn't have capability for blocking out noise from the outside. The noise cancelling is for the calling only, similar to our smartphones' noise cancelling capability when on a call. However, the earbuds will be able to block out SOME noise--but that's because they're the in ear tip that goes in the holes of our ears. If these have an active noise cancelling, it will cost hundreds of bucks as those are of a different technology that requires extra engineering (mic for listening for outside noise/audio frequency).<br /><br />Pros:<br />Sound quality--mind blown<br />Comfort--impeccable<br />Secured to the ear--it won't fall!<br />Battery life--more than 8 hours for sure...been using it for 3 days now, 3 - 4 hours each day and I'm only down to 60% according to my iPhone<br />Comes with bonus 3 ft. lightning cable and car usb charger and carrying case with extra different sized buds<br />Call quality is HD<br /><br />Small Cons:<br />- At pitch black, dark room, wearing my glasses, I noticed that the blue Bluetooth light blinks every 10 or 15 seconds--this is located at the front of right side. Not that big of a con, but maybe have dimmer steady light or have it off? It's a little distracting when I was watching my movie on my laptop.<br />- I wish I have the ability to change up the loop thingie for the ear (i.e. remove it or change it to a different color), but this just my preference<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend to grab one or two of these! Great quality, superior sound, and affordable price compared to those branded ones *cough cough* beats or bose *cough cough*"
0,"Sound Works ok when still, but when I used it while bike riding the wind noise was louder Han the music.  Tried other ear pieces with no luck.  Had to return"
1,"I have had these headphones now for a little over a year. I have used them almost everyday since I got them, whether it be for music, youtube, etc. As of writing this review, I have noticed the first sign of deterioration a couple days ago. The glue keeping the cable in the left side has given, so every now and then I have to push it back in. Other than that this product has been worth my purchase and I when my current pair eventually give, I with most certainly buy another."
1,3rd set iv got. First 2 were mine and the last was for a friend at work. You can't go wrong at the price!
0,"After 5 months they stopped working properly, comfortable but keeping loosing connection"
1,A+
1,I took these out for an hour bike ride and was very happy! They stated in my ears with no issues. It was easy to connect to my iPhone by pressing the quick connect button for five seconds and it paired with my phone quickly. Audio quality was great and clear. I recieved a discount for my review. An extra bonus was the two charging cables it came with. One is a standard mini usb and the other is an awesome cord the will charge both lightning and mini usb! The packaging was great. Comes with a hard case and extra different size ear buds along with a two port car outlet charger. Overall great headphones for the price!!<br /><br />I have wireless beats and now I use these just as much!
0,"They worked fairly well for 10 months, then without any reason stopped connecting by Bluetooth to my phone and now work at all except for showing that it’s charged when I plug it into the charger. Bummer."
1,"Feel pretty solid and fit very nicely in/behind ear.  Only thing that kind of bugs me is they sound muddy (low end doesn't sound like it should)<br />Being an audio engineer, it doesn't quite sound the way i am used to but for cheap workout in ears in not too worried about that for now.<br /><br />i am currently running them through a burn-in playlist to see if after some hours of music, the sound will change.  I will update my review and rating after the burn in process is finished."
1,Love them. Not tight enough in my ear.
1,Like The best I purchased.
0,I am unsure why there are so many positive reviews for these headphones.  A key to using headphones these days is noise cancellation and a fit that allows you to hear the music without outside noise.  After years of using Klipsch earbuds that I accidentally cut with my hedge trimmer I decided to try a wireless option and I am so disappointed.  The sound quality was better on the Klipsch along with the fit and outside noise reduction.  I will be moving back to Klipsch due to the fact that I need to turn the volume up so much on these Senso headphones to help drown out my mower that I end up with an ear ache when I take them off.  I tried all of the provided fits and they just compress to muffle the music as they are pushed more into my ears.
1,They have excellent quality for the price.
1,"I've had these earphones for about a week and so far so good.  They are much better than the Altec Lansing earphones they replaced.  They have no problem syncing with my iPhone and do so whenever they're turned on.  Sound quality is good and they fit securely over the ear.  The only small complaint I have is that they don't seem so work well with Siri. Siri's generally low-end-of-mediocre performance seems to become poor when I'm using these headphones.  Otherwise, I would recommend them."
1,"""I had read that these were excellent earphones for the money and that is correct! The set up is easy, sound is crisp and clear and they fit well, with several earpiece options. I work a lot in a wood shop and a pleasant surprise with these is the noise canceling earpieces that are also comfortable. I can not recommend these enough!"""
1,These headphones are comfortable and the sound is excellent.  Recommended!
1,Good set for the price.  I  would definitely buy again
1,These headphones are comfortable to wear and the sound quality is great! I'm pleased with my purchase.
1,"Well my son loved them, until he let them go through the washing machine. This is not conducive to survival of the headphones, I am sad to say."
1,Great product!!!
0,"These worked really well for about two weeks, and now they just won’t turn on. The LED light is solid blue when plugged in, but I get no response when holding the multifunction button for 2 seconds as instructed, or indication of what might be wrong otherwise."
1,"I've had these for six weeks,  so far they are performing great, with an over 8 hour battery life, and good sound quality, I'm actually thinking about purchasing another pair. UPDATE : 11-3.2017: Original set failed after about 5 and a half months of regular and possibly sometimes extensive use. I contacted Senso , and they replaced them within a week. They have made improvements to the earpiece and the charging port since I ordered my first set. They basically fixed everything I had an issue with. As far as the headset failing after 5 months, if they're willing to replace it, and it lasts a year, ITS WELL WORTH 36 DOLLARS !!!...YES, I paid 36 BUCKS!!!, and back then they only had 9,000 reviews, I just received today a brand new pair but apparently they're only 20 bucks now, so I'll be buying a pair for everybody I know for Christmas."
0,"For a while the headphones worked great, but now they start disconnecting from my phone after around 30 minutes. They won't reconnect until everything has been turned off. Trying to see if i can get it replaced."
1,"I liked it, its a nice gift for my friend."
1,"I do like these and would buy again. The sound is pretty durn good for $20! The fit is good, I don’t even notice the over the ear clips and they help in keeping buds in place. If your ears move when your facial muscles move (watch - my ears move!), try this: place buds while you are smiling. Works for me. Bluetooth range is up to 30 ft with no intervening walls. Buy these, and I doubt you will be disappointed."
1,Impressed with the quality and ease of connecting to my phone and tablet.
0,"Easy and quick to connect.<br />The fit doesn't work for me, part of the problem must be my large ear-canals, but the hook is too flexible<br />Sound quality is good enough for exercise, but not for muisic. I have bought this headphone for exercise, so not a problem.<br />Biggest problem for me is the wind-noise, which is so loud, I have difficult to hear the voice in this headphone.<br />So, I am not using this headphone anymore."
1,Great product for the price.
1,For the price they cant be beat. Easy to use and robust.
1,"Great sound , comfortable to wear and you can't beat the price."
1,Excellent<br />Perfect for tri training
1,"My first pair of headphones had an issue such that callers' voices were caught by the microphone, and they could hear themselves talking with a one second delay. I contacted Invotek, and they helped me get a new pair. These ones do not have the same problem. It's a great product for a surprisingly low price."
0,The Item was a gift and unfortunately it doesn't work there is a problem with the sound worked for 30 minutes and stopped working<br />unfortunately i can't return it due due to return policy
1,"Maybe the best Bluetooth earbuds I've ever had, I use them every day, they're light, link up quickly,  nice battery life, quick charge, and excellent sound...yeah maybe the best"
1,Best headphones EVER!! Especially for the price! I've had BEATS headphones that look exactly like these and they are absolute crap compared to the senso ones! Just goes to show that the more expensive items aren't always better than the cheaper ones .
1,Simply the best.
1,"Works great, fits nice and great battery!"
1,"Very happy with my headphones, I use them for running and they stay in throughout my whole workout. They are light and very easy to use, I like not having the buttons and microphone on the cable but on the ear piece.  The sound is great and they are perfect for my needs."
1,"I wore these today for the first time.  Love them!!! I clean for a living and listening to audible most the day.  I took calls with the headset.  Easy to use fit great!  The price is great for all you get!  WOW it is Dec. 2019 and I'm still wearing these headphone, they work AWESOME!"
1,"Pretty decent quality all around. Good range on bluetooth. Mic is a little quiet, have to talk louder than normal for people to hear you clear. Comfortable and good overall design. Been using it around the house casually and I've enjoyed not having to carry my phone around."
1,This was for my son-in-law and he loves them.
1,Headphones are great.  Fit snugly in ears & easy to operate.  Great product for the price!!
1,"Great Quality. Great Sound. So far extremely durable. I'm able to run without having to worry about the headphones dropping out of my ear. The cord from ear to ear is a decent length - some seem to be entirely too long, this one feels just right. I'm completely satisfied, simply can't beat the price with the quality of these wireless headphones. I would recommend!"
0,They either become loose or fall off after running for a few minutes. The new wire in the ear hooks begins to droop after repeated shaking while running. The earlier models did not have this wire and were perfect. I put these new ones back in the box. Very disappointed.
1,I like everything about the earphones but the piece that covers the charging port on the ear piece.  It is hard to remove so the earphones can be charged.  Other than that the earphones are the best I have ever used.
1,Great product for price.  Use at gym.
1,Just got my Senso wireless headphones yesterday and have charged and paired them easily! They play music great - especially for the price! I will likely get a back up pair if they hold up and don't feel loose or like they will fall out on my first run on the treadmill (the reason I got them for indoor summer runs here in Texas).
1,As described
1,Great sound for product price.
0,"I loved this headphones, had them for about 3 months with no issues, excluding the minor bug here and there; however, a few weeks ago they stopped working randomly for no apparent reason. I'd love to recommend these but 3 months of regular use should not have broken these headphones, it's most likely a hardware issue. The headphones might have good reviews, but be cautious and shop around."
1,"I am very pleased with both the product and Senson's customer service.<br /><br />When the earburds first arrived my first impressions were good build quality, comfortability (the default earbuds can be a bit snug, but the kit comes with different types of earbuds for your choosing), and nice design (cord has no controls, and therefore no uneven weight, on it. Controls location on right earbud which I like).<br /><br />At first I think the sound was alright... but somewhat muddy, like I was listening to music from another room. The bass was impressive, but mids and hi's were muddled. I reached out to customer service and they fixed my problem as so:<br /><br />&#34;We are sorry to hear that you are not fully satisfied with the audio of your headphones. We care about your experience with us, and we are committed to ensuring your satisfaction as one of our valued customers.<br /><br />The Senso ActivBuds are designed to produce a high fidelity HD sound with balanced bass accents. Please make sure there is no signal interference around the areas where you use your headphones from other devices or equipment. Signal interference can deteriorate the Bluetooth signal which may cause the audio to deteriorate.<br /><br />Also, there may be a calibration issue with the headphone you received. Let's try a factory reset for your Senso headphones which usually fixes most similar issues related to the issue you are facing with your headphones.<br /><br />Here are the instructions for resetting the headphones:<br /><br />1. Reset the Senso headphone to factory settings (while plugged into a power source, press/hold the power button for 7 seconds).<br />2. Unplug the headphone from charging cable and power them on.<br />3. Enter the earbuds into the pairing mode and follow instructions for connecting.<br /><br />Also, the headphones may not connect to your devices after you perform the reset. The previous connections that you had established between the headphones and your devices become &#34;obsolete&#34; after the reset and needs to be re-configured. In order to do that, please `Forget the Device` on your mobile phone for the Senso headphones and try pairing again. In your Bluetooth settings on your phone, you will see all detected Bluetooth devices. Click on the Senso ActivBuds option and click on Forget this Device. Next pair your headphones to your mobile device once again as shown in the instructions manual.&#34;<br /><br />Fixed it right away, thanks Senso!"
1,So far so good. My husband liked them so much I ordered a set for myself! I can't wait to get them.
1,Are great for working out and stay in place and handle sweat well. Battery holds a charge and are comfortable to wear. Would definitely recommend!
1,Very happy so far. Love to relax  to music in the Hot tub. Went through a few pairs of regular ones before buying these.
1,I found a pair of these in the smoke pit area in Qatar and when I tried them on they were so much better that BOSE or the BEATS.  In my opinion they do the same thing and snug on your ears.  They have adjustable ear pieces which is perfect for personnel that are active.  I love these headphones.  The only thing I wish is it had a longer time span instead of 8hrs.  but they still good
0,"Ordered these headphones after my AYL BT headphones quit charging after a year of heavy use in the gym. It came in a fancy box with some nice additional products and was easy to operate and connect. However, they continued to fall out of place while running, which wasn't too big of a deal, and after a month of light use they've stopped connecting to my phone (iPhone 5s). I believe it comes with a 1yr warranty so I'll be trying to return them, but I was hoping they would have lasted a lot longer than that."
1,"They sound great, even have a little bass, wasn't expecting bass so that's a plus. Just wanted something to listen to while I'm at work moving around all day. They charge fast and I play them around 8 hours at a time, phone on full volume and ear buds at around 2 below max, still haven't died on me. The wire piece to keep from tangling is the only thing I see as useless, but hey, I didn't pay for that, that's something they threw in for the ear buds. All in all, great product for great price."
1,"I do have to say that the product stood up to what it was described as, very happy with my decision battery life is phenomenal really easy setup! Along with Amazon the seller of this product was fantastic."
1,"Been using a pair of ear buds while I work and the wire is always getting in the way. Tried the blue tooth headphones but leaning over they never seemed to stay put. These are perfect, the sound is great and they stay put without any cumbersome wires."
0,Broke after 3 months
1,dope product
0,"Bought these headphones in late November as a Christmas present for my husband. As of March they no longer will charge. I've tried the video tutorial to resolve the issue, multiple chargers and cables and nothing. Their website for product support won't even let me submit a request for repair, warranty, ect. They are cheap for a reason. Do not buy."
1,Love them.  So comfortable and awesome sound....and you can't beat the 30 feet/8 hours!  ;-)
1,"Excellent product, highly recommended, the shipment and packaging also was outstanding. Light, easy and comfortable to wear even when you're working out or jogging."
0,I've only had these headphones for a few weeks (very light usage - maybe about twice a week when I go biking) and the volume/skip track controls have already stopped working. Completely defeats the purpose of wireless headphones if I have to bring my phone back out every 5 minutes. Terrible quality.
1,The SENSO Bluetooth Headphones are absolutely the best headphones I have ever purchased!!!!! Love them!
1,Very nice headphones - good sound and works on all conditions. The customer service is excellent - had a minor issue with the headset and they sent a replacement within a day.
1,Works great for me with I just use it for music. The speaker option in the car doesn’t work so well for me. The recipients usually ask me to repeat myself.
0,It just stopped working after 6 months. Won’t hold a Bluetooth connection.
0,"I bought them to use them in the pool. After the first time I used them, they did not work after that. Returned them"
1,These earbuds are extremely durable and fit well and the sound is excellent and I can't wait to use them while walking or mowing my lawn
1,GREAT headphones. no need to spend big bucks on other bluetooth headphones. Long battery life. I use at the gym for 1-2 hours a day and they are comfy and have great sound.
0,"Wanted to love these. The sound is OK, however, the Bluetooth signal just isn't strong. Would cut out during almost every stride while running connected to my Apple Watch for music. Disappointing."
1,"I love bluetooth headsets, but have been very frustrated by poor battery life in a set of ear buds lightweight enough for workouts.  Most that I've had would only give me 2-3 hours of solid use.  But these are amazing.  Very comfortable (the ear clips are soft rubber and you don't even notice them there), and the battery life is excellent.  I charged them up on Saturday, and have used them for an average of two hours a day, mostly for listening to music and a couple phone calls.  It is Wednesday morning, and I have a 50% charge.  Sold.<br /><br />Just dealt with a service issue after buying my wife a set. After about a month, they just stopped working. Customer service was outstanding. Responded to my email inquiry in less than 12 hours and shipped out a replacement set same day. Sold again."
1,"They are easy to use, fit well, and battery last very long. Also a very short time to charge."
1,You start to lose signal quick after short usage but considering the cost they are a good deal.
1,"These are great. Right out of box, easy to pair with several devices, simultaneously. Great sound quality, too. They are so good, I purchased another pair."
1,"I have been enjoying my new bluetooth earbuds for a week now. I use them for audio books, podcasts, video and some light music listening. I answered the phone once so far with them on.<br /><br />Right away I am glad there are 3 earbud sizes that come with the product. Oddly enough I used the medium in my right ear and small in my left. If they wear out that fact will be helpful because I can switch them out. I wonder how you would get new ones?<br /><br />I was able to follow the simple directions to charge and set them up without any trouble.<br /><br />I am able to hear clearly. They begin to cut out when I am three rooms over...not bad in my opinion. I am disappointed that the volume does not go very low. I was hoping I could listen at a lower volume level.<br /><br />Unlike other devices, I was able to switch between my phone and iPad without having to turn bluetooth off and disconnect from the first device.<br /><br />I was disappointed that there is a flashing light while the headphones are in operation. I was watching a movie with the lights out and they periodically flash light which I find annoying. Also, if someone else is trying to sleep in the dark while I'm using them, I don't want to disturb them with the light.<br /><br />The charge has lasted about a day and a half with moderate listening.<br /><br />Overall I'm happy with the purchase."
1,Wow. Excellent quality. Easy Bluetooth pairing.  Multiple ear size options
1,"Haven't been able to get a great fit for an earbud yet, but will try more. Connects easily via to phone. Overall happy with them as they are comfortable to wear."
1,"This is the 6'th pair of bluetooth earphones that I've owned. Easily the best sounding, with a big dynamic range. The highs and lows are better than phones that I've paid $140 for. They are also very comfortable as they are made of soft rubber over the ears and connecting wire. Changing to the smalles earpieces made them most comfortable for me. Very nice cables and case included. They have a great range and battery life. I haven't used them for more than 4 or 5 hours at a time, but they have not yet gone dead on me between charges. I waited to write this review due to the rubber band style being a concern for quality. So far, they have held up very well. I wear these to bed sometimes, something that I couldn't do with other phones. Have no complaints and recommend. If any quality issues arise, I will update this post. Great price. Buy"
1,"I love these earbuds! The sound is amazing! I kind of assumed the part that goes around your ear was hard, but it was flexible and stays on very well."
1,"I love these wireless headphones! They are perfect and I didn't even have to charge them right away. The sound is almost as amazing as the Bose wireless headphones, but for the price they do an amazing job! My bf got the Bose headphones and I can only tell a slight difference with the bass. Totally worth every penny!"
1,"I use them primarily at the gym, so was not looking for high end.  These seem to work fine, connect easily and seem durable."
1,"I give 3 stars because...<br />1. They stated that it came with a 3' charge cable, and a dual car charger. It didnt.<br />2. The charger port cover is loose, if you brush on it lightly it will open. So it's not that water proof.<br />And 3. It has a 15 second delay( the sound is distorted) when linking up to Bluetooth.<br /> NOW THE GOOD..<br />the sound quality is awesome. good, clean, deep bass, and good mid tones, tones down the hi's.  It still clear. I love the sound of these headphones. They stay in your ears. Weight balance is good. Charge time is good. Play time/stand by time lasts two work days(as a painter). I'd say buy these if you like good bass, cause they thump!"
1,These are great.  The sound and quality is great and easy to use.  They also come in a nice case to throw in your bag.
1,Very good sound
1,good!
1,"These are good for the price<br /><br />First the voices of the music is crystal clear but the bass is flat and just tries to hit to hard and muffled..which can be fixed with Apple's built in eq or a third party app for Android, I used equalizer and bass booster..see photos for my settings...the battery last a really long time and it came fully charged. They are more comfortable than my beats and lightweight the foam tips are great and they do not fall out...however due to the size protruding out when I'm biking they pick up allot of wind noise..I can pause answer the phone and skip songs with them..they are loud allot louder then my wired headphones and maybe even my beats....I would say fix the base and the size of these and they would be my go to every time...even if they cost $100....I like that they say power on and power off when turning them on or off...their is a flashing blue led of the front of one of them that I could do without...its a little annoying when I use them to watch tv at night..but not a deal breaker...for the price with a couple tweeks you can't go wrong..my comparison are based off power beats and and Jay buds..."
1,"Not only do these sound great, but the fit is perfect. I didn't receive my order as described. I let the seller know and very promptly sent my missing accessories."
1,they work very well
1,"Decent audio quality, great battery life.  As one would expect, the bass is fantastic, but the highs and mids are a tad bit washed out. Very solid quality for a set of bluetooth headphones though, and so far I have really been enjoying them."
1,"Arrived right on time. Very easy to setup and use. Lightweight and comfortable. Only had them for a few days and haven't had a chance to really test battery life, but I'm confident as long as I'm diligent with charging they will work out great. Happy with the purchase."
1,Great product. Even better deal. Customer service answered my email immediately with troubleshoot ideas when my bluetooth connection got all screwed up. Senso seems to have their act together.
1,sounds great comes with a bunch of extra goodies at a great price.
1,"I work out. A lot. I run, I lift weights, and I Crossfit. These are THE best headphones for an unbelievable price. Better than beats. Better than any countless headphones I've tried. It also comes with several kinds of ear buds and a interchangeable charger for Apple or Samsung users."
0,"The headphones are pretty bad.  They repeatedly have a very bad connection to the devices and you constantly hear the sound breaking up.  I know this distortion can happen on any bluetooth headphone set, but this by far been the worst.  The charging port is difficult to open and they are not very comfortable."
1,My rating would be higher but for two factors: 1. I find it hard to keep them in my ears; 2. The battery life is less than I expected but I’m not well educated in this area.
1,"I purchased this product to replace a pair of Powerbeats 2 wireless that broke.  The SENSO headphones are just as good if not better than the Powerbeats.  They connect quickly to my phone, the controls are easy to use, and the sound is great.  The mic works well for phone calls, family has said they cannot tell I am using the headphones instead of my actual phone.  Overall great product and good customer service.  I am going to purchase another pair for a friend.<br /><br />Update:  Have now bought multiple pairs as gifts.  Family and friends love them!  These are great headphones at an amazing price."
0,Sounded wonderful until they sounded no more 😭
1,My grandson had no problem setting the headset with his phone.  He was listening to his favorite music within 10 minutes.
1,"I have purchased a total of 4 Senso Bluetooth headphones. They are actually earbuds. I had a random issue with one set. Warranty fulfillment was hassle-free. The associate was professional accommodating and apologized that I was having an issue with their product. I spoke with him on a Friday evening. My earbuds replacement were delivered Sunday morning!!! The quality of sound for music is crisp, deep and tight. It can handle any genre of music. Mine happens to be metal- loud and heavy. When using them for phone communication features the sound quality on both ends is excellent. The mic does pick up wind background noise. It is highly sensitive. You can manage how much background noise is received by cupping the mic your hand. The unit is comfortable with a variety of bud sleeves and styles to choose from to fit your ear. The connective cord is tangle free and feather weight! It comes with a clever carrying case. Simplicity is the design. Thumbs up to whoever designed the case inside and out! Simple, small. Sharp, clean and classy looking! It carries everything you need in a case no bigger than a drink coaster. I have used JBL units in the past for my Bluetooth speakers and earbuds. They are a equality company with quality units THAT ARE HIGH PRICED! JBL does not even come close to the level of humble customer care that received on every purchase through Senso! The Senso company can officially put my name as a loyal, happy customer! I love being able to afford to have the perfect gift time after time for my friends and fellow metal heads!😋<br />Thank you Senso for your attention to the things that matter the most in any size business! Good customer care and a good product!"
1,Haven't used it much yet. But can't beat the price and warranty.
1,Awesome sound quality. Was not disappointed in any way. Thank you for a great product!
1,"I have only been using these for a couple of weeks, but so far I am very impressed with how well these work. Pairing was straightforward and the sound quality has been very good. I use these headphones whie I am working out and the coverage area seems to be as good as advertised. They are lightweight and so far the battery life has been very good too."
1,These were a gift and were well received and came quickly.
1,Senso Bluetooth headphones are really comfortable. And the sound is awesome! I also like the fact that they're sweat proof.
1,Very comfortable with free items
1,Pleased with delivery time and the quality of the product. I would highly recommend it.
0,Very cheaply made.  Mine broke within 1 month.
1,Missing wire tie
1,"Great headphones, the sound quality is outstanding with first class accessories and case. It connects almost immediately, they are comfortable to wear for long periods of time. The battery last a long time and recharges quickly. Call reception on both ends is clear with plenty of volume. One function that is missing is the capability to advance 30 seconds and rewind 10 seconds, a function I have used a lot with podcasts. Other than that they are outstanding."
1,"I use this when I workout. Sounds good, a little bass heavy though. I can easily fix that with the equalizer on my player. They stay in my ears no matter what I'm doing during my workout, running very hard or bending over upside down. The battery lasts about 4-4.5 hours and if you haven't used it in two or so weeks the battery will be dead even if you left it fully charged. The battery life is why I'm rating this as 4 stars. I'd buy it again."
1,I use these headphones while running. They are comfortable in my ear and I like that I can adjust the ear strap behind my ear where I need it. They are great for someone that enjoys listening to music or podcasts hands free. I like that I can accept and decline calls all from the earpiece as well as control the volume from them. Sound quality is very good and Bluetooth pairing was simple.
1,Great headphones  I usually have trouble keeping ear buds in my ears but this design solved that problem. Glad I chose these what a great purchase!
1,Perfect for my 11 year old who kept breaking the apple earbuds off in the iPad.
1,"I read many of the reviews and my main buying points were: sound quality, comfort and ease of use.<br />They score a 5 on sound quality - it's what you want, full bass, clear pitch and you hear all the good thumping sounds of house music (my choice for workouts). Comfort - I'm still working on that.  Once  I finally get my earbuds in (I always have to use a mirror to figure it out which kind of annoys me, if not I always miss putting them on right) they fit pretty snug, don't hurt and seem to stay in well.  I have now used them on  several long walks, hikes, and at the gym doing all kinds of workouts. It beats not having the wires hanging from your ear but sometimes the one that is attached feels funny, like if they made it shorter that might work, or have it  toggled so you can adjust the length to your comfort level.  I don't need all that extra wire hanging around! That also falls into the design aspect of which I have some wishes for future development.  Shorten or toggle the wire.  Is there a way to make the black ""box"" smaller so it looks less conspicuous on your ear?  It's kind of detracting to have these black boxes protruding from your ears - something flatter and  smoother looking would be nice.  As for the battery life - well there is no signal or warning to let you know the battery is low which is a bummer, so I'm making a habit of just charging it all the time to make sure, so an alert mechanism would be really helpful.  Like on my Fitbit, I know when the battery is low.  Also make the opening to the charging cable bigger and easier to see - I have to put on my glasses to see the microscopic opening and every time I feel like the flap is going to tear off it's so thin.  I guess it's a lot to ask for the price but hey in today's super hyper technical age, these requests just seem like they would be natural and easy to fix..  I think I will keep them - but the jury is still out on the above mentioned technical issues.  Not enough to return them but that's why I didn't score them a 5"
1,"comfortable, light-weight and great sound"
1,Bought them for my wife and she loved them tremendously. That's all that matters to me. I may purchase another pair for backup since she loves them so much.
0,Very good up until they stopped working. Will not turn on or connect. They worked for about a year and a half.
0,The first set of Senso earbuds I purchased was superior in design and sound quality.  The latest sets purchased were less impressive overall in sound and comfort.
1,i like them
1,Purchased a pair for my wife on her birthday. I received them on time. They worked great for two days. Then I had some problems with the pairing to Bluetooth device. I contacted SENSO and explained my problem through email exchanges. They were very helpful in directing me to try several troubleshooting steps. That did not work. After 5 email exchanges they agreed that I had a faulty pair and sent me a replacement according to the warranty. I just received the replacements and I am very hopeful that I can enjoy many years of good music. The sound quality is good. I like them and will purchase another pair for myself if the replacement ones do better than the original pair.
1,These are fantastic! Great sound and noise control. They are comfortable to wear. They come with a lot of extras for the price. I take them everywhere with me.
1,Very nice. I like the quality
1,"Best 35 bucks I ever spent! Got them right away, was blown away with simplicity and sound quality!"
1,I have owned these for over 2 years now. They have great sound quality and battery life at a fraction of the cost of some of the other name brands of the same type. give these a try and you wont regret it.
1,I thought the sound was fair.  Easy to use but the battery stopped holding a charge after a few uses.  I would like to replace or get a refund but I can't seam to find a return button.Changed from 1 star to 3 stars.  I was able to get a return label and refund worked out.  These were OK but not great.  I really miss the 1/8 jack my old phones had.
1,Love the sound...just wish they were a little smaller.
1,I didn’t like that we had to turn off Bluetooth on 5 other devices but oh well. I love the sound quality. I use them intermittently throughout the day so I never know how much battery life I have left. It usually quits when I’m taking the dog for a walk the next day after I charged them☹️  I’m fairly certain they hadn’t been used for a total of 8 hours but who knows?! I love the freedom they give me to do my activities around the house. I can still listen to my audio books but not be tethered to one spot.
1,"I do like these, they removed the cord version from my cycling.  I have to ride with one in my ear and the other out, when on the streets.  Wwhen on bike paths I can utilize both ears.  I have recommended these to my friends and family<br />6/24/18 I initially thought these were good wireless headphones, but though further use, this is not the case.  I have had issues with the music fading in and out.  It was apparent when turning my head right or left it was most notable.  I tested wireless speakers on a bike rides and have not had the same issues.<br />I bought these for activity purposes but they do not seem to function well in that environment.<br />6-24-18 follow up.  I reached out to Senso and they gave me directions to reset the headphones, which thus far fixed the issue.  I will further test them in the environment I was having issues and give a follow up.<br />I gave them 4 stars because of the prompt response and the issue seems the be fixed.  The response was even on a Sunday&#60; Which shows they stand behind their product."
1,"fantastic, sounds great and super easy to setup/ use!!"
1,Really good sound from these. They don't fall out as you run the way most of these do. I would definitely buy them again
1,"These are my first pair of Bluetooth headphones that I have ever owned. Not only are these headphones sleek and good looking, but they are so easy to use! All of the functions that these headphones offer are more than normal headphones. While at the gym, I was able to stream Spotify from my phone (which was in my gym bag, in my locker) seamlessly. My headphones never once shifted or tried to fall out. While I was working out, I was able to skip songs, turn up the volume, answer calls, and have the surrounding noises of fellow gym-rats working out around me dampened enough to where I didn't even hear them anymore! These headphones are the best pair of headphones I have ever owned.<br /><br />When I received them in the mail, they were charged and ready to go! I linked to my phone in seconds and started streaming music immediately. If you are looking for wireless headphones for working out at the gym or running in your neighborhood, I strongly recommend these headphones!"
1,"I am not an avid runner, but when I do, I like to listen to music. I had been looking for some headphones that were Bluetooth and somewhat economical. This set was right for the price, however, I had an issue when it came to jogging/running. They did not stay in place and kept slipping. This was so annoying. I used them twice and tried them on with different size ear piece (small and medium). It was no use. For walking or casual listening they are fine. The price is great, but they did not work for me. I bought a plantronics set instead. Those, Plantronics, are great. A bit more expensive, but they are worth it."
1,"I am enjoying using these headphones while I work out, in the car, around the house.  I needed a lightweight set with a solid mic and good sound quality and these fit the bill."
0,"Not a bad cheap headphone, only issue I have is it will loose BT connection randomly."
1,Great pair of head phones top quality and defiantly come as advertised. These are one of the best head phones I have ever bought.
0,"They're cheap, battery life is great, bluetooth connection is fine. Sound quality isn't something I care about much when I'm running/exercising, so it's not really relevant. It's fine.<br /><br />The reason I keep buying them is that they keep dying. These are not effectively waterproof and I believe sweat has ruined the charging on all three sets. They last a few months, then the charging connection gets sporadic and has to be in just the right position, and then they stop charging entirely. I tend to limp them along for about 12 months, but it's annoying and I'm not doing that with my 3rd pair. I'm ordering something else so I don't have to wonder if my headphones will be charged in the morning or not.<br /><br />When they work they're fine. They just need to seal the charging port better and they would stop dying. Then again, if they did that right they'd have only gotten 30$ off me for my first set instead of 70$ for buying 3.<br /><br />I know I'm basically buying the cheapest thing I can find, but the charging situation is obnoxious. There's no way these can be submerged for 10 seconds much less 30 minutes when I know my sweat is corroding the charging port after 3 months."
1,"I bought these headphones in the original black and red for myself and black and blue for my wife. We enjoy these headphones very much and it's very convieniant even while I'm at work. They are comfortable, loud, and I enjoy watching my videos and movies with it. Very easy to use. Never gave me any problems. Just what I wanted and with a better price. Very satisfied. Also my wife loves it just as much as I do so it's a win win."
1,"I've used these several times since purchasing in 2018, but I used them yesterday (9/04/19) under a full charge while doing yard work. They lasted greater than 2hr45min, stayed in my ear and maintained a great full range sound. I was able to push-mow, weedeat and use my leaf blower and still hear what I was listening to with clarity."
1,"Awesome product, great sound quality, and priced cheap. Highly recommended! Wear when working out I love em"
1,Have only used a few times but seem to work very well. They have a heavier cord that hopefully will hold up better than my last pair
1,So far I love them. Really comfortable.
1,"I opened my Senso package yesterday. I did used it today connected to my iPhone for my early morning 40 minutes walk .  When I opened the package  I found so many wires that I did not know what to do but then when reading the instructions carefully things calmed down. I just plugged the black wire in my Mac to the headphones and the charge started and when full I just paired it to my iPhone and presto. However, I still do not understand the other (white) wire as it does not match with the headphone port. At any rate, the headphones themselves worked just fine while I was walking listening to Radio Venice the classic internet station I prefer and also to my music in the iPhone. The quality was very good for an exercise walk and do not want any more.  When I want superb sound then I have my top quality home equipment. At this point I am very pleased with the results of Senso. Hope it will last for a long time."
1,"The sound is great, the weight is lite and easy to wear.  The over the ear fit is not as snug as would have expected so far but will give it some time to see if they fit better over time.  Very easy to change songs and volume which is a plus.  I have not taken a phone call yet but the button is easy to reach and sensitive to touch.  Let's hope the over the ear becomes a closer fit as it might be difficult to keep on when jogging, which I have not year done as I have only had them a few days.  One day at a time."
1,took some minor adjustments to get these working good and I'm glad i did....they are great earbuds...recommended.
0,"Sooooo I recently posted a raving review upon buying these. Sound was/is great--great fit.  However after one month of owning these, the battery life has completely bottomed out.  A full charge only last all of 20 minutes.  Extemely disappointed.  I saw reviews indicating this but I assumed it was just bad luck.  Looks like a pattern.  Just bite the bullet and by Beats.  You get what you pay for."
1,Never falls out perfect for a high intensity workout
1,The work good and are comfortable
1,"This review is rather early but so far I like them. Paired with my cell phone rather easily and sounds great, in fact better, louder than the OEM pair that came with my Note 3. Like the way they hug my big ears and don't expect them to fall off. Haven't tried them on the treadmill yet & may update this review if my sweat causes them to fall off. Havent tried any other wireless headphones but the sound compares to my wired beats at a much better price."
1,Fit great sound great and comes with a lot of neat stuff. Totally worth it! And to put the cherry on top they give you a 1 year warranty!
1,"I work in the consumer electronics industry and bought headphones and earbuds for years, so I've seen and listened to many brands.  I will say I was skeptical about these being as good as the reviews state they are, especially at such an aggressive price point.  However, I was SO IMPRESSED!  The sound quality is great and they are comfortable to wear (extremely light).  The offering is such a value with the accessories that are included and even the packaging is top notch!  I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase and would recommend these to anyone!"
1,"Clear bluetooth connection.  I can wear these while lifting weights, running on treadmill, or using ellipcal.  If I wear them outside to run, or if I'm walking outdoors and the wind is blowing, all I can hear is wind blowing.  I tried all 3 sizes of ear buds to ensure proper fit, and even with the largest buds (ie tightest fit) I still hear wind blowing."
0,These hurt my ears after wearing them and I found the buttons on the earpiece annoying. I would frequently hit them when putting them on.<br />I lost them 2 weeks ago and wasn't sad.
1,"Sound quality is excellent. I like how you're able to switch between songs with the volume buttons, it's highly convenient.  They stay on great when I'm doing anaerobic but they kind of fall out when I'm doing aerobic exercise such as running."
1,"These work great. No problems whatsoever. I haven't had them on out in my kayak yet, but I think a little splashing will be fine."
1,"The earphones were really comfortable to wear and convenient to use. The package came with great accessories--I especially like the carrying case and the cool long charging cable. The only thing I had an issue with is that the sync/power button became permanently depressed after just a couple months of use. I was pretty disappointed, but after I contacted Senso, they replaced the entire product immediately! I would give four stars because I would have expected more durability from the product, but the fifth star is definitely for the service. I really hope these new headphones prove to last longer."
0,I bought these earbuds to be something cheap use while running and sweating. While they look in your ears and stay in place pretty well they sound pretty good and they've held up to sweat after about five months of using two or three times a week my battery no longer holds a charge when I turn them on they say they're at 80% 20 minutes later they're dead and won't stay paired to my phone not too bad for the price I guess but I'm going to keep looking for something better
1,"Great product, great warranty, great customer service. Buy these over higher dollar brand name earbuds on market."
1,Sounds great and awesome for workoutouts
1,My husband loves these!
0,"I bought these for running. They stay in we’ll and fit people with small ears. However, if it’s super windy, it impacts the sound quality considerably. Also, I only used them about 15-20 times and one ear bud stopped working. Disappointed in the overall quality."
1,I was worried that these would hurt my ears or fall out with movement. I was pleasantly surprised as the piece that goes behind your ear is silicon and adjustable and makes for a good comfortable fit. Overall a great product for an active lifestyle.
1,"These headphones fit snugly in the ears which keeps a lot of the surrounding noise out . They also stay in the ears really well when moving around and they have a long range and excellent battery life. The microphone on these things is terrible though. Even in a quiet room people can barely hear what I am saying. This is because the microphone is all the way up by the ear, which makes it difficult to pick up sound from talking. For the price there are better options with better mics. Get these only if you plan on listening to music, and never plan on talking on the phone with them."
0,"One of the sides melted while charging, it started to smell as plastic burning, I had left them on my night stand, I am happy nothing else happened but this is a potential cause of fire- pics attached"
1,"I love the headphones. Shipped quick, great product. I use these every day at work. I even bought a 2nd pair for when I finally wear these out.  I would buy from this seller again."
1,I love the earbuds! They stay out during rigorous walking and running. Sound is great. Extra goodies a plus!!
1,The headphones arrived quickly and they were extremely well packaged. They came in a box with more accessories than I expected so I was happy about that. I have been using them this week at the gym and the sound quality and weight have been perfect.
1,"Wow!  excellent quality for the price and I am impressed with the offer: car charger, 2 charging cords (the long one charges an iphone too!).....Nice company."
1,"First time I wore these someone asked me if they were knockoff beats, at first I wanted to say no, but then I realized they actually were a perfect knock off. Generally the term knock off has a negative connotation, but here I think it is high praise. SENSO was able to sell a pair of headphones a fraction of the price of a big name brand that does the exact same thing. I normally lift weights during my workouts and these things stay out of my way, offer great sound quality and last for at least a weeks worth of workouts (5 days @ ~1 hour each). My ONLY comment is that at higher volumes the bass distorts pretty bad, but the sound canceling/isolation is so good that i don't have to crank my music to hear and enjoy it. On top of that that &#34;distorted&#34; sound is what beat's owners seem to love, so I bet they were just trying to copy it. Overall, definitely worth the ~$30 I paid for them and I will be purchasing another pair should these ever stop working."
0,Very disappointing - reception can be spotty depending upon how i'm sitting or standing and it's so annoying that i tend to not use these at all.  I wish I loved them but instead I'd recommend avoiding these based on my own experience. Too bad.
1,They showed up. They work out of the box. Way too early to tell if they do more than that.
0,"If you're a petite woman (I'm 5'4&#34; and small built), these may not work for you because the hooks are HUGE. While the inserts are adjustable, the hooks are not, so I found it impossible to make them stay in my small ears. The sound quality is OK, but nothing to get excited about."
1,Perfect for workouts and does not fall off the ear. The sound quality is okay for that price.
1,Delivery was great. The product arrived in good condition and the product package was good along with the instructions and parts that came with the headphones is great. So far I am happy with my purchase.
1,It’s ease of use and being comfotable
1,They're definitely a good set of headphones and are very durable.  You will find yourself looking for wireless earbuds.  I very rarely have both headphones in at the same time. As a person that rides bmx and is always in the woods they have been able to hold up for 5 months.  You can be about 20feet tops away from your phone then starts to cut in and out.
1,Good for the price keep that in mind
1,"I've been hunting for a perfect set of wireless headphones for a while and have gone through many different offerings from Amazon.<br /><br />The different headphones I've tried are Canbor, Phaiser BHS-530, Senso, BFOX and Phaiser BHS-430. I won't go into the pro's and con's of each of these but I will write a review for each of these in their respective listings.<br /><br />The good thing about these headphones were that they were probably the most comfortable of all that I tried. They are very light weight and the rubber is very soft and flexible. They seem very well built and come with some very nice extra wires for charging.<br /><br />What I didn't like about these was the sound. It seems there are a lot of very good reviews for these headphones, so perhaps mine were duds, but it sounded like I was listening to the music through a pillow. It was very muffled, which I assume was because of the IPX7 waterproofing (which pretty much means it they can be submerged and remain functional). On top of that there was a lot of wind noise while running with these, which when mixed with the muffled sound made it difficult to hear. Increasing the volume only made the speakers buzz during bassy songs.<br /><br />I can imagine that in a windless environment such as a gym or workplace these would work great. Unfortunately for me the pro's didn't outweigh the cons."
0,bluetooth stopped working after several weeks.
1,They are very good quality.Amazing.Perfect.about 8 hours Playing.
0,I got these on July 8... by August 15th they quit working ... they will charge but they will not turn on. I am beyond disappointed in this product. I followed all of the recommendations on how to store them now i have to get another pair ... thanks a lot :( also right after getting them the wires were exposed ...
1,"Easy to use, lightweight and incredible sound.  For the price I highly recommend these headphones."
1,Actually i got these for my wife. I am glad to say that she enjoys using them. Its easy to use and and she likes the round case that came with it. Thank you!
1,So far these headphones are great. Nice sound and bass. Money well spent
1,"I have a couple pairs of headphones and am pretty happy with these. The sound quality is a little tinny, but considering they are Bluetooth it's surprisingly good. I wear them in an office at low volume and it blocks out co workers pretty effectively 😉"
1,Works great and sounds good.
0,"First of all, it is not noise cancelling as advertised.  Second, they make a light breeze sound very loud.  The way it is designed makes a nice wind blowing across your face irritating."
1,"Would not recommend. Packaged well and comfortable on ears, but sound quality is painful. Calls aren't clear and at loud enough volume some sounds are sharp and painful."
1,"Pleasantly surprised at the quality of these cost-effective headphones. This brand came recommended by a running friend and they definitely produce quality sound, cancel noises and are stay completely in place while running. I would definitely recommend."
1,I run a lot and the Bluetooth headphones work better than what I had previously used. They are good quality and very simple to set up and connect to my IPOD music. I am very pleased so far.
0,"Product works well, for a month. After only a handful of uses the bluetooth fails to connect to any device."
1,"Comfortable, high quality sound and easy to use! Stay on your ears while exercising- which is a problem I've had with other models. Great customer service, as well! Highly recommend!"
0,"I don't want to spend too much on headphones since they're pretty much ""Here today, gone tomorrow"" whether they are expensive or cheap. I had a similar set that lasted almost a year. These were great, until one day they just stopped turning on, even after having charged them up. Lesson learned: stop buying these kinds of items from Amazon. They last long enough that you cannot return them, but two months is ridiculous."
1,"Seem to work well in the hot tub the were bought to be used in. The range is questionable. The signal breaks up when just a few feet from phone, like just  across the hot tub. But it could be my old phone (will update if improves with new phone). Also the sound quality on calls is not great, but seems fine with spoken podcasts. So far, worth the price, but not overwhelming."
1,Solid product...why did I spend almost $200 for a beats headset that didn't even last a year?? This senso wireless headphone far exceeded my expectations. Very pleased customer and I never even really write reviews
1,Sound is great pairing was very easy no problems and range is very good. The extras that came with it were a great addition.
1,Great headphones for the price!
1,"I've got a tangled-up pile of various earbuds and other assorted in-ear headphones around here somewhere that's a gordian testament to my general dissatisfaction with poor audio quality and having cords dangle from my facial region. As a bass player I'm innately poor so buying anything that costs over fifteen bucks is an agonizing experience for me. But not as agonizing as not being able to hear the bass when I'm listening to music... Every few weeks I'd find myself standing in the checkout line at the gas station with yet another pair of ten-dollar promises in hand, hoping to find the Magic Set of Affordable Doohickies That Would Make Me Happy. And every time I'd end up throwing them onto the pile of disappointment with all the rest.<br /><br />What I wanted when I found these on Amazon was a good set of true wireless earbuds (headphones? is there a difference?) that would stay firmly implanted in my bean, have good bass response, have enough battery life for me to get the mowing done without going dead, and be my bestest friend forever. When I sobered up the next day (&#34;Oh crap, I was drunk shopping online again? Gaaaahhh... What did I buy this time?&#34;) and reviewed my purchase I was not happy with myself. I really had my little heart all set on buying true wireless earbuds (headphones?) that wouldn't snag on things and get ripped out of my head (I hate mowing under that tree - it grabs at me), but these are quite obviously wired together, and they're quite a bit chunkier than what I had in mind. I was so upset with myself for ordering these that I swore off beer for two whole days!<br /><br />The third day the doohickies arrived. Morosely, without much hope, I pulled 'em out of the box and stuck them in my ear-holes, fumbled with the &#34;how do you connect this thing anyway&#34; button for a moment to hook it to my phone and OH MY GOD I LOVE THESE!! (Happy dance, happy dance!)<br /><br />They fit my ears very well, stay planted in my head much better than any other headphones (earbuds?) I've ever owned, but best of all - they have great sound! The bass is sooo much better through these than other headbuds (earphones? whatever...) I've tried. They've been my go-to set of doohickies for nearly a year now, in daily use as I putter about. I've only had the battery in them go dead on me two or three times - they really do last a good eight hours or so. They're starting to show a bit of wear now though (mostly through rough handling and pilot error) so I'm planning to buy another set.<br /><br />The only downfall with these is that they do take a few seconds to get them screwed into my ears properly, and invariably as soon as I get them firmly plugged into my head I'll see my wife waving her arms about trying to talk to me so I gotta pull 'em back out to hear her. As noted by others, the speakers aren't noise-cancelling per se, but they fit tightly enough in your ears that you really can't hear the outside world much at all. Which is a good thing!"
1,"LOVE the sound quality, easily adaptable to fit my ears, good battery life charge."
1,"I really wanted to like these headphones, but I'm afraid that the lack of a clear high-end has me disappointed.  Perhaps its just my pair, but the lack of treble is problematic for me.  I'm returning them."
1,Good sound quality at an excellent price. The little voice prompt that confirms on/off and other actions is a nice touch.
1,Pretty good for the price. Has about a 8 to 10ft reach. Good bass for the size.
1,"Amazing!  This is my first set of bluetooth headphones and I love them.  No more dealing with a cord attached to my phone.  Simple function with the buttons which is great!  I even forgot to hook the ear part around the ear and they stayed in just with the ear plug part.  I noticed only after running for 20 minutes because I brushed some hair behind my ear, chuckled after realizing it stayed in even without the ear-hood-around-part (whatever it's called lol), hooked it around my ear and kept on truckin'."
1,Very easy to use out of the box.  Was charged when I received it. Looking forward to using it.
1,Love these ear buds! Wonderful for workouts or just enjoying music on your phone. Great deal for the money!
1,"I've bought several of these as gifts, after reading the reviews and everyone who received these headphones are very, very happy with them. The reviews were right on and I'm happy to join them in giving these headphones 5 stars."
0,Not sure why I bought these again. They're absolutely trash. They've gotten worse. The plastic they're made of is crap and the battery life is only about 8 hours. Not worth $25.
1,"I love them, but they stopped working after less than 4 months. My last pair lasted two years (longer than any headphone I have ever owned), which is why I purchased another pair. I think I may just have a bad set and will need to use my warranty."
0,"Terrible fit, won't stay in the ears. Terrible tincan sound! The quality is so low, if you turn your head to the left, with your phone in the back pocket, you'd temporary cut the connection between the headset and your phone."
1,"Great sound, very lightweight and easy to set up.  After my disappointing and very expensive Beats purchase (I could hardly hear anything), these Senso wireless headphones are awesome and worth every cent.  I highly recommend."
1,Ear buds a little large.
0,Not what I expected. Probably a bad order. Would buy again and hope for a better product.
1,"These are the first set of bluetooth headphones I've owned, and I'm very pleased with everything so far. Great product, great value, excellent customer service.<br />If you're not sure which set of ear/headphones to purchase, you can't go wrong with the Senso ActivBuds. They are a very popular item at Amazon and for good reason."
1,Good quality/ hands free
1,"Sound, fit, messages and battery are very good.  Ordered one for my wife so she doesn't have wires hanging out of her IPHONE when she takes her walk.  Most of the time I run listening to music coming from my IPhone.<br />Rob & Cathy"
1,"Small, great sound, no slippage from ears."
1,"Super good,love them"
1,Very comfortable. They stay in place well and sound great ! Well worth the price.
1,"I just received these headphones this weekend, but so far I've got to say I'm very impressed. The sound quality is amazing, and being able to control the volume and song selection from the ear buds is great. The package included chargers for both the headset AND my phone, which was also fantastic. Charging the headset was quick too. It took less than an hour to get a full charge. I did read in the instructions to be careful not to over charge the battery as it will cause the battery to lose its effectiveness. Glad I read that since it would not have occurred to me. Bottom line here is that I love this headset, and the fact that it doubles as something I can answer my phone with with one easy touch just makes it better. Truly a great item. Hopefully it'll last for a long time. 5 star rating was a no-brainer."
1,"Good design, lightweight, great sound, good price.  What else is there to like? (Also I like the packaging)"
0,"Used the product few times. Sound is distorted, Absolutely poor quality, cheap, waste of<br />Money.  This product is not even worth the plastic is made of."
0,last 3month
1,Very good headphones for the price. Way superior to a pair of cheap flimsy LG headphones I bought a month ago for double the price. These senso headphones are perfect for running and have more volume capability than I need. 5/5 would but again.
1,Headphones work great. Fit nice and snug and look good as well. The mic seems to be good as well. It also came with a pleasant surprise. It had extras on extras that I don't think were mentioned in ad. It came with a car charger and a multi charger cable for both Android or the new Apple. And it seems to be of good quality. Also came with a nice case and wire ties. You deserve a extra star guys thanks.
1,These headphones are work well so far I have no issues.
1,"For whatever reason, the left piece keeps falling off. The sound is great but too bad the earpiece does not swivel - would be great if it did."
1,Sure beats the wired headphones. Lacks some bass quality. Somewhat cumbersome when wearing but does allow me more freedom when doing outside chores and shopping to drown out noises made by rude ankle-bitters. Nice comfortable feel when placed into my ears.
1,Purchased for daughter. She loves them. Thank you.
1,I love these headphones. They are super comfortable and very resistant to water and perspiration due to the rubber that covers them. Baterry life is excellent (almost 4 hours) and sound quality is even better. The case they come with is super cool.
0,There is significant white noise to the point of giving me a headache.<br />I do like the packaging and the accessories are very good.<br />Also the fit is good.<br />I was hoping for a better result. I like the product but they are just unusable.
1,The battery life is very good. Sound is good. Have been using this for a while and still works well. over the ear design holds well during workouts.
1,Very happy with these.<br />I run with them and they don't bounce or move around.
1,"Fit nicely, very light weight, 3 different ear canal cushions, home charger and car charger too.  Sound is very good and battery life is much better than expected.  Great item, at a super price."
1,The service for the return is excellent. When The ActivBuds worked they are an amazing product.
1,"The headphones are working great, the bluetooth connected right away with no problems, I also like the USB cable with the double end connector for Apple and Samsung, I might buy more to give out as presents."
1,"I use these for the gym mostly and they are my favorite I've used so far. They fit great whether I'm outside running or inside lifting weights. And they sound better than just about any other headset I've used. Battery life is really good and the 1 year warranty is a nice safety net. My only gripe is that they don't sync with my PS4, but that is a Sony issue, not a SENSO issue."
1,To be honest I have only used my headphones once. I just opened them yesterday and took them out for a walk.  So far so good.  They are comfortable to wear.  Gave just 4 stars only because I don't have much experience with them yet.
1,on time works good connects fast
1,"The product is fantastic. Great price. It has exceeded my expectations. Great battery life, and really good sound quality.<br />Seller was also very great. Item was quickly shipped and received on time. I would definitely use them again."
1,Great headphones for great price.  I'd been looking for affordable Bluetooth buds.  I think the sound is great. Comfortable fit.  Easy connect to both my iPad and Android phone.  Liked them so much bought 2 more for husband and his employees.<br /><br />Delivery was fast. Great follow up customer service.
1,"These are great.  The sound quality is good, and they’re comfortable - especially with the changeable ear buds.  Just what I was looking for."
1,"Great for running, the sound is adequate but for the price it is unbeatable."
1,"I've only used them twice but they are easy to use,comfortable,the sound is very good,it's rich a sound."
1,"My husband purchased these for his Father's Day gift.  He is very happy with the product.  A retired coach/ principal, he walks every morning, plays golf, works in the yard and is involved in other activities.  He reports that the sound is great, the ear buds stay in the ears during ALL activities, they fit comfortable and they are easy to set up and use.  He is pretty picky with the electronic devices he uses!  He said the Senso Headphones and price are excellent!"
1,These headphones are great. Bought them as a gift for my BF and am thinking about getting myself a pair.
0,Making an annoying buzzing sound
1,I bought these headphones because they were recommended for small ears. I really wanted them to work but sadly they kept falling out of my ears while running.
1,great deal
1,love them and works great!
0,"I do not normally leave reviews, however I feel the average number of stars for this product can be very misleading. My review does not reflect the sound (which is good), but rather the fact that I cannot use them at all for the purpose I intended them to, which was working out (I'm not even talking about high-impact work-outs, but simple ones like riding a bike). The piece around the ear is so incredibly flimsy, it does not adjust and does not hold around my ear, and the pair just keeps on falling if I don't readjust them every 30 seconds. It is quite frustrating, so I just stopped using them and unfortunately missed my window for return. I do not use them at all. My boyfriend does have the powerbeats, so I had that sturdy pair to compare these to. If you plan to use them for anything other than sitting still while listening to music, I suggest to spend your money on a sturdier brand. At the very least, physically try on a pair before you purchase online."
0,They were great until they stopped connecting to my phone 3 weeks after I got them. They still turn on but when I try to connect my phone tells me it is not within range but they are next to each other.
1,Love these headphones.  Very nice sound.
1,Great product worth the money. The sound quality is great and battery life is great 6-8 hrs per charge. I have nothing negative to say and all this plus 1 year warranty.
1,Great set of headphones...delivery was quick and the sound is great!!
1,Great product
1,"I haven’t had them long, but so far I love them.  Easily paired with my iphone and a MP3 player.  The range is great.  I can leave my device on the first floor and hear quite well all over that level and the basement."
1,great product and  customer service
1,Overall a great pair of earbuds for the price. The customer service is excellent.
1,"I tried the ActivBuds on the strength of the ratings here. I have not been disappointed.<br /><br />The sound quality is quite good for an earbud this size. They fit in the ear well and the over ear hook is soft and comfortable. It holds the earbuds in place. I have no suggestions for improvement.<br /><br />My pair suddenly stopped playing in the left bud and cut in and out in the right. I went to the Senso site and left an email for support. I was quite surprised to have a response back the same day. The suggestion was to reset the buds to factory settings then re-pair with the devices. This worked perfectly. The response promised to replace the buds if the reset didn't work. The instructions were concise, well-written, thorough, and easy to follow. I was surprised by and well pleased with the quality of support."
1,"Light weight, soft rubber ear hooks, very nice sound."
1,"Very comfortable, acceptable sound quality for exercising and listening the music. Excellent product support.<br />Comfortable, you do not need to push them in time after time. They stay in by hanging over the ear.<br />For the money I pay and using during activities sound is good enough. Buy Bose if you need to enjoy the music and relax.<br />When I found chucking noise while outside and factory reset did not help, I received a new pair in two days.<br />I hope they find the noise source when outside use and improve. Never had any issues using inside."
1,"These earbuds live up to their description.  The battery life lasts long and they charge pretty quickly.  The range is great.  It is convenient and easy to set up.  The warranty is definitely worth it just in case.  The case is hard and durable.  I expected the hooks to be hard plastic, but like that they are comfortable.  They stay in your ear and block out all noise.  Great bass in them as well!  Very pleased with these and hope to keep them forever."
1,I like this headphones. Excellent sound quality with this price.
1,"TL;DR - Just buy them.<br /><br />Senso... never heard of them.  In fact, I'd never have bought a set of earbuds from this company had it not been for my wife who took a chance on a rather inexpensive Christmas gift.<br /><br />Best. Earbuds. Ever.<br /><br />For the price, this is an absolute steal.<br /><br />AUDIO:  The audio quality, which is excellent for a set of earbuds, out-performs my wired Bose earbuds and only underperformed in the lower pitches (as a physician, no set of earbuds is safe if they have good bass - no room for the sound waves to escape and only damage your middle ear).  I wouldn't use these earbuds to record audio (I do podcasts and digital recording), but I wouldn't recommend ANY earbuds for that.<br /><br />COMFORT:  I hate earbuds.  They HURT.  The only set I can use for any extended period of time (on an airplane, for example) is my Bose earbuds.  However, Senso's set is a close second and doesn't seem to cause the residual pain other sets (Apple) causes.<br /><br />NOISE CANCELLATION:  I'm not certain how the noise cancellation works... I believe it's passive.  Nevertheless, I have an Autistic daughter that only I seem to be able to calm and when she's screaming, I can plug these earbuds in and drown out her painful screams without completely drowning out all noise. When I'm playing music, it really does seem to work better than my Bose earbuds.  I'm not sure how it works, but it does.<br /><br />VALUE:  How is this possible?!  HOW?!  This set came with two charging cords (one micro USB and ONE WITH A CONVERTING LIGHTNING/MICRO USB!!!), a car charger with TWO PORTS (1.0A and 2.1A!), replacement ear pieces, and a hard clamshell case.  Did I mention it was only $30?!<br /><br />The closest to this I can find on Amazon is a similar set (eerily identical) by Blayz (RobinTronics is missing several items [car charger]).  HOWEVER, that set does not come with a convertible Lightning/Micro USB cord and, while it is currently $3-4 cheaper, this cord more than makes up for it.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:  FIVE STARS -- If you want a decent set of earbuds, get this one now.  It is well worth it."
1,Works great for under $40!
1,Freedom from wired ear buds at last!!
0,It said it had you bass it had none.
1,Great quality sound. My apple earplugs used to come out during workout . These are lightweight and after messing around with the interchangeable cushions inside i was able to get a better fit with the big red sponge. Only dislike is the U shaped over ear support is too big for most ears and is not adjustable. If it was this would be a better product.
1,Nice buds. Installed easily. Good sound.
1,"I purchased the SENSO Bluetooth Headphones. They worked very well in all sorts of conditions. Unfortunately, they stopped working after about a year. I informed the company who were terrific. After attempting a  reset, they agreed without any difficulty to send a replacement. The company's response to my issue was immediate, I mean within seconds, and the entire process took less than a few minutes. I recommend the product and the company very highly from my experience. I am sure that the replacement headphones will arrive shortly and will work just fine.Give these headphones a try, they are very good and the company backs them up!!!"
1,Great headphones! The sound quality is great!
1,"Hey,thanks for your concern on my satisfaction of your product, seems like most companies really don't care that much after they make the sell ,love the headphones, love the package it came in and the accessories the only thing is they are a little bulky could be more streamlined pluses 1 year warranty seams like you guys really care..THANKS!!"
1,Very good wireless earphones
1,Rating is accurate. Headphones off hut in ear I have to take off to hear someone properly.fits well doesn't fall of during a Sprint or other work out movements. These bad boys are definitely water and sweat resistant!
1,Love them. They are great for the price. Had bought $200 ones before and these are better.
1,"Hi everyone.. just received my senso blutooth headset. I was so excited to get my first blutooth earphones.. Amazon packaging was good which dont have any damaged items.<br /><br />So far i tested every functionality  of this product and everything works fine. For the cost of 37 bucks i never imagined that we get this amazing headset. No pairing issues, easily paired with my phone. It already came with full charge.<br /><br />Blutooth range is around 20 to 30ft, after that you can here some descripency in the audio, which can be ignored.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Cost wise this headset is an excellent choice. Better than other popular brands in the current market. I am sure that you dont get disappointed.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Previous track was not working properly, which can be negligible.<br /><br />This is my first review. I wil post my full review after using at my workout."
1,"I ordered these first as a gift, having reviewed them/many others extensively before buying. I was impressed by their reviews, especially for the price and bought a pair for myself. I am so glad I did. The bass, sound, and microphone quality are excellent!"
0,"Terrible. Had to return them. Left earbud was cutting in and out. Sound has way too much bass and sounds clouded, though for $30ish dollars, I guess I should have seen this coming."
1,Love these work great at the gym and hold up even in the sauna .
1,This headphone is incredible... I thought it wasn't that good.... I like it....
1,"Great head set , sound is great , noise  canceling"
0,These do not work at all.....no consistency
1,Great headphones for the price.  I listen to jazz and this headphone has great sounds for jazz. Good bass.
1,Great headset
0,"I've had these over 6 months now. I run with them every other day. They cut out constantly. It may just be that the bluetooth remains permiscious while connected to my cell phone, which would be idiotic. There have been a couple times when the cutting out was so bad I had to just pull them off and run the entire distance without them.  Outside of cutting out, the bass is very limited. The fit is nice though, and the controls for switching songs is easy enough to not be intrusive. But that all doesn't matter if it is cutting out too much to be able to hear your music/audio book/audio course/podcast."
0,Sound is good but distance is horrible..... definitely not 30ft. I have my phone in my pocket and it cuts off all the time.... if I could return these i would.... i figure I would test them out thoroughly and it would cut here and there but now its just annoying.
1,"These are very comfortable earphones that have stayed in place while exercising. Even better, they deliver excellent sound."
1,Got them for my daughter for Christmas i listen to them for a bit and they was great
1,"Read so many reviews trying to find a pair of wireless headphones for the gym.  I did not want to pay Bose prices,  just wanted a reliable, good sounding pair of wireless headphones without the hard plastic neck piece that gets in the way when I do squats.  These headphones were not only affordable, but work great, good sound, long lasting charge.  Very happy with my purchase."
1,Easy to set up and they work great!
1,"These have awesome sound quality, range and functionality. However the length of the cord is way too long. I feel like I'm walking around with one of those grandpa glasses with the string attached to it. In addition, the ear buds really stick out from the ear and are bulky, unlike other products that offer the earbuds that are flush."
1,"Sound quality, 3/5 - Doesn't overdo fake bass, doesn't rattle the ears. Obviously not for audiophiles but passable for someone who isn't picky with their audio. Gets plenty loud, needed to turn down to about 40-45% of my Android's max volume before it became too much.<br /><br />Battery: The battery life is short on these earbuds, I would say about 3-4 hours with the volume pretty high. Between work and the gym, I was charging them every day.<br /><br />The rubber cord holding the two buds together is rubberized and I would prefer them not to be. If the rubber rests on the bare skin of your neck and you aren't profusely sweating, the band will stick to your skin and one of the buds will come loose if you turn your head. Very annoying.<br /><br />I left these charging on a 1.2a car charger overnight and they melted, which also melted end of the charging cable. I used these for about a month and a half, probably about 30-35 1 hour+ listening sessions before this happened. If this was the fault of the cable or charger, the fuse would have likely popped in the cigarette lighter. Cannot recommend unless you can remember to yank the buds off the charger after an hour or so."
0,Stopped working after couple of months.<br />The lights keep blinking and i am not able to connect to bluetooth
1,"They’re ok. I give It a 4 Star and not 3 because of all the accessories that came with the earphones. Based on the previous reviews, i was Expecting a  mind blowing experience. You get what you pay for but nonetheless, decent sound. Not sure how potent these will be when i use Then while riding my motorcycle. I’ll come back and update the review if they drown the highway and engine noise."
1,"I wasn't sure I was going to like the over-the-ear style, but the parts are so soft and flexible I forget they are there!<br />The ear bud itself fits perfectly in my ears.  It is so wonderful NOT having to constantly push them back in.<br />The headphones paired quickly with my iPhone, and the controls were very user friendly, and have worked well both on calls and listening to music.<br />Lastly, the sound doesn't bleed out!  My co-workers will be thrilled!!"
1,Work well and connect well with the phone or TV.
0,They're worth the money if they wouldn't have stop working 3 weeks after purchasing them. Thought it was just a flawed set but a friend bought the same headphones after I recommended them and his stop working a few weeks in as well (Amazon refunded my money no problem). If you do luck up and get good set then they're ok.<br /><br />There's no very low volume and but sounds good on a full charge until turned up then it gets very muddy.<br /><br />The range from my iPhone is incredible. I can leave my phone in my truck on Pandora and stay connected through out most of the gym.
0,Mine are about a month old and the right side is not working!  No sound at all.  Can hear on left side fine.  Are they trying to get you to buy a more expensive set?  Not happy!
0,On-off switch broke first week
1,"I received the headset as a present and had an issue with the connection to my iWatch being choppy for 10 minutes and then worked fine.  I reported the issue to Senso support and within minutes received info on how to reset and what to try to correct the issue, it did not.  The next day after reporting that it did not work, they confirmed my address information and sent out a replacement headset.  The replacement headset is working with out any issues.<br /><br />I appreciate the attentiveness and the customer service provided."
1,A great product for the price..
1,I think they are both Excellent!
1,"easy to charge, nice accessories (carrying case, extra silicone earbuds, etc.), and good quality sound. Looking foward to using them more."
0,The sound of these is great. But! I purchased these to use while running. They sit well dont slip and are comfortable. The down side is that despite changing the ear pieces i can hear wind noise. It is really bad. When standing still sound is awesome. But as soon as i start running i need to turn up volume to over come the wind noise. I can cup my hand over earphones sound stops but who can run like that. I will use these for indoor use only.
1,wonderful product!! I just ordered a second pair for my wife.
1,I have just used these twice and I'm really impressed.  They sound great and are impossible to notice while running.
1,"These headphones are amazing! They are boxed so nicely, all the extras are very useful. The sound is so clear I can hear each instrument. I usually blast my headphones on max volume at the gym and these aren't even at 50% and they sound clear and loud. The Bluetooth comes in very clear and unlike other Bluetooth headphones, the other person on the other end of the phone can't even tell I'm using headphones to talk to them. They are very lightweight. I love how all the controls are on the right earpiece versus on the cord. I purchased two, I would definitely buy again and recommend to others."
1,Excellent sound quality.  Really enjoying these earbuds!
1,"Bluetooth calling does not work because the other person hears the sound echoing. Otherwise, this is a great set of headphones at a reasonable price."
1,"So far, these work very well. Comfortable, with different size buds for different size ear canals (my left is much smaller than my right), and seems like good sound. Haven't had a chance to test battery life or waterproof claims yet, but very happy so far."
1,"I'm not an expert on bluetooth headphones, but they are comfortable and the sound is great.  I am pleased with my purchase."
1,"These are amazing! They sync to your phone easily, the charge lasts forever, and they stay in your ear. Highly recommend."
1,"Just got them on Jan 30th. Deliverd in 2 days as advertised and the delivery person didnt throw them in the snow so thats a plus. So far they sound really clear ,good bass and volume.  Easy to pair and skip music in my library . Came with a car charger port, and two charging cables and silicone replacements with a case.  Worked out with them on and so far so good . Will update a little later on about battery life and any issues that occur. If they last longer than a month will be 5 star rating .<br />Update .<br />They are still working well. No complaints here"
1,Very easy set up.  Has a good fit and feel.  Sound quality is great.
1,Battery Life Last long. very comfortable. overall bang for its buck. would greatly recommend
1,"This is my second pair of Senso headphones. And after two years of almost daily use at the gym, the left side is going out. Not sure if others have the same experience, but I loved these and didn't find anything negative about them. I guess a $20 investment for two years is not bad."
1,"Great product, easy to use and fast shipping, thank you"
1,They stay on good while  running on the Tread mill.
1,"With the first set I ordered, the battery would not hold its charge.  Once I notified Senso, not only did they provide a quick response to help troubleshoot the issue, they offered to send me a pair.  The tips they offered did not help the issue, as the earbuds' battery would not stay charged.  But, the team at Senso sent me a new pair free of charge three days after I notified them that they still did not work.  The replacement pair is working great.  The earbuds are an excellent value and the customer service is even greater."
1,So far I couldn't be happier.  Great charge.  Pairs immediately.  Great sound and feel.  Half the price of more name brands.  Instructions and accessories are a really nice accompaniment.
1,Headphones come with a lot of extras. They work and sound great. Noise cancellation technology is amazing.  The sound is equivalent if not better to my wife's JBL headphones.
1,Good
0,"When I first got they were great. But then reality set in. I haven't used them all that much and never in wet weather. The connection to my iPod continually breaks up even though I wear it on my upper arm as close to the headphones as possible. Batteries are fully charged. I don't see any resolution, but to get another brand. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE!"
1,"These headphones are very comfortable! They stay in place and seem to be great quality. Charged quickly, sound is excellent."
1,"They are lightweight, don't hurt your ears, and the music quality is beyond what I expected. Great product!"
0,If you like listening to music that sounds like it's playing through a pillow these are okay. Very bass heavy headphones that produce a muffled sound. Besides the sound the bluetooth functionality works well.
1,"Good set, good sound, works well, occasional issue with taking a phone call then returning to music."
1,Nice presentation
0,The ear bud took a charge and went from red to green but still will not work.
0,"These sound awful. The music is muted, bass is muffled and high tones sound squeaky. The are reasonable comfortable and stay in place while running."
1,Best workout earphones i've ever used!
1,Great product. Like these better than my AirPods and a fraction of the price. These are my 2nd pair (jumped into pool with first pair) and have also bought a set for my daughter. Highly recommend.
1,I purchased this for my daughter and she loved them so much she purchased a pair for me. My issue is they will not charge for me any longer. I wish they charged still because I really enjoyed them.
1,"UPDATE August 5, 2017: Bluetooth connectivity was suddenly gone one day but I am still keeping a 5 star review. The quality of the headphones were phenomenal. I contacted the company and see if my warranty covers for it. Honestly, if it didn't I would have bought another anyway. It's an inexpensive technology that produces sound quality and comfortibility. I would glagy buy again. Customer service were very kind but most importantly, very helpful.<br /><br />UPDATE JUNE 5,2017: still working!! Make sure you don't over charge it.<br /><br />UPDATE: I did jump ropes, burpees, and jump squats and these stayed on my ears. These really help me stay focus on my workout, so I highly recommend these to anyone who wants hassle free headphones.<br /><br />I just got it today and I already love it!<br /><br />WEARABILITY: Doesn't sound like an actual word, but this headphone does fit perfectly around my ear. This does come wit 3 diffen't size eartips, so if you have larger or smaller ear there are alternatives. While wearing this, I jumped up and down, danced and did a handstand. It just won't come off. Best of all is that I can't feel it. It's like i'm wearing nothing while listening to music. If you're a runner or you want to go to the gym without the hassel of wires, this is a good choice.<br /><br />AUDIO QUALITY: Not muffled like my old headphones (Bluetooth). Bass was good, sound clarity was good. And the noise cancelling is wonderful! I can say it is as good as Beats, but opinions vary. But this is a very good Bluetooth headphones! I am seriously excited to take it to the gym.<br /><br />COMFORT: It's very comfortable to wear. Unlike smooth plastic headphones, these are soft to touch and wear. I usually get a rash or itchy feeling when I wear other headphones around my ear, but this is just comfortable! But it would be nice if it's not flimsy in order to hold the shape of the ear a bit better.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great product and I highly recommend others looking for light Bluetooth headphones to try this one."
1,Best wireless headphones for the price!! I love them and they wont come out during exercise!
1,"The sound is the best I've ever had with an in the ear headphone.  The ear pieces stay in place during exercise, but I would still like the hooks to be a little firmer for ease of use.  The only negative I've found is caused by wind while outdoors.  This is my first try at wireless headphones, and I think that I've made a good choice."
1,Works like a dream!
1,"No problem connecting to bluetooth.  The sound is very good.  I use these connected to my TV while walking on the elliptical.  Sound is clear.  Before, I would have the TV volume loud and still had trouble understanding voices."
1,"Although I've only had the set for one week, I've had the opportunity to use them in a gym setting as well as running and cycling. To date they have worked superbly; it is incredible to no long be hassled with a cord. Keep in mind, they're not Bose, but the quality of sound for the dollar is excellent."
1,I would say these are worth the price. Good sound quality and they have nice volume. Excellent for the gym! I can usually go about a week of workouts before needing to recharge them. Only downside is that the little flap to access the charging port is pretty flimsy and hard to open.
1,"My inner ears must be the smallest of anyone ever.  This is my third set of earbuds.  These are closer than any others but they still do not stay in my ear.  When I push down on them, the sound is amazing, but they won't stay down. The hooks over the ears are a little tricky also.  I wear glasses so that interferes with the hooks."
1,Great value for Bluetooth headphones. I've ordered these a few times over the years and I'm always happy with them.
0,Can’t use with phone microphone does not work
1,Great!
1,"These are very high quality earbuds, well worth the money. Remember to charge the fully before using so you can get the optimal playback time. High Fidelity sound and Excellent Workmanship. Has a nice embossed hard-shell type zipper case with 1 flat wire USB charger cord and 1 shorter USB charger cord. Includes different sized buds to adapt to your ears. No problem pairing them with my new phone either. Buy these before you go and spend a lot of money on something more expensive."
1,Really love it. Very easy to pair and start using it. Love the sound quality and talk back. Happy with my purchase.
1,"I am so pleased with these headphones and bought a pair for a co-worker after they heard my own.  They work flawlessly and the sound is very good without being overblown.  Not too tinny and not too much base with very little distortion at higher levels (don't go deaf, please-listen at a decent volume) which is a good all around sound.  BT pairing is done quite easily.  Quality unit. Well done."
1,Excellent product and very wonderful recommend to buy it
1,The sound is really clear. The earphones fit without irritation.
1,Speedy delivery. Sound is incredible. Very comfortable. Paired with my iPhone quickly and so easy. They are going to work awesome for my workouts. Thanks Senso.
1,I had issues with my set and needed to do a factory reset. The customer service was great and the pair is working again!
0,"Not a huge fan at all, the buds arent a comfortable fit, the cord is too long and not easy to wrap up, the part outside your ear is huge and makes it shift upon running. Will probably be returning."
1,My three older kids really like these headphones. They don’t go anywhere without them!!  We did have a problem with one where it stopped charging after 5 months of owning them. The customer service was OUTSTANDING!  Within an hour my problem was resolved with the up most respect. I’m looking into headphones for myself and husband and these will be on the top of our list.
1,"Great noise cancelling wireless ear buds.  I have had many wireless ear buds...these are by far my favorite.  Only complaint, need one size smaller earbud...I have tiny ears!"
1,"So Geniales, lastima que no esten en Colombia los productos Senso."
1,This is a great Bluetooth headphone.  The price  $35 (and other reviews) were the selling point but the reliability and functionality is what making me keep it. It connects to my phone quickly and has a good 30 to 35 foot reception in my house (through walls and floors).
1,So far so good; sound good for earbuds; very nice packaging; car charger a bonus.
1,Great for the price!!! Very good sound and surprisingly deep base sound.
0,This has stopped working and looked at all options online to troubleshoot and and get it working with no luck<br />I will be returning it as I see other folks complaining about it not working after some time<br />Best to avoid
1,"It was ok, but tooo bulky for me.  I thought I would like the &#34;around the ear&#34; concept, but it's just not me. The sound was really good though.  It's just the bulkiness that I did not like."
0,"Great head phones for 6 months or less and dont get your Hope's up when they work well for a short time.<br /><br />This is my 2nd pair of the ear plugs breaking and senso wont issue me a replacement for either of them.<br /><br />They only give replacements for malfunctioning defects not any type of accidental damage.<br /><br />Even tho the ear piece is due to poor quality, just like their customer service."
1,Awesome sound and fits great
1,Bought these back in January of this year. Excellent pair of Bluetooth headphones for the price. No complaints here!!!<br />*Update: These things just survived a full wash and dryer cycle lol still going strong!
1,Good sound quality when it's not cutting in and out.
1,"So I've gone through several bluetooth headphones. I work out pretty hard, and sweat a ton, and headphones don't hold up to the pounding I give them. These have a great sound, easy to control the music, and so have made it past the first day, something other devices haven't done. I like the way they look, and more importantly feel in my ears."
0,"The noise is okay and they don't fall off my head as much as other earphones. However, the parts that go behind my ears do not stay on too well and even bounce a little and I can feel them bumping against the backs of my ears while I am running. I also hear weird noises in the left one sometimes, hard to explain but electronic sounding noises. They're okay but probably not worth the price, I haven't found the experience to be much improved from my last earphones which cost me like $8.<br />UPDATE: I purchased these in November, it is now April and they will not turn on. I didn't do anything to cause this. Do not buy these."
1,Great sound and very durable👌
1,The head phones stay true to their description.. Great price for great quality!!!
1,"These are legitimately the best deal on the internet for headphones. My dad has a $200 pair of bose wireless headphones and these top those in every sense. They stay in the ear great, and the hook is extra insurance so you don't have to toggle them at all, even when sprinting all out. The noise cancelling is great too, as it really does drain out background noise. Quality seems amazing but I'm not an audiophile and don't really care/cant' tell the difference between great and amazing sound quality anyway. Overall, these are a steal, and are better than most $100+ headphones out there."
1,I love these buds!!!  Can turn up volume and fast forward songs.  Lite and easy to set up.  Love that they are waterproof.  The price is excellent for this quality product!  Cost with its own high quality zippered case.
1,"I like to run, but I Earbuds don't fit in my ears properly and fall out at inopportune times. So I took a flyer and bought these. I have to say I'm impressed. The sound quality is really very good--especially considering the price. Another thing I was amazed by was their customer service/tech support line. They answered immediate and helped me sync these with my phone. For around $22 these are a very good deal, and a very good pair of headphones."
0,"So I look for 3 qualities in in a set of earbuds quality, comfort, and sound. I’m happy with the quality and comfort but the sound sucks. If you like any sort of base in your music then these are not for you. The high range sounds ok but the base distorts with even a medium volume, forget about listening to loud music. I’m hoping that with a full charge they will improve (I’ll update if they do). Anyway I guess you get what you pay for. The magnetic mount and card sleeve are nice little additions."
1,"The overall call quality is good.  They are comfortable to wear.  The over the ear hooks are soft and comfortable as well.<br />Callers have said the road noise is loud when I use them in the car, but that is the only complaint I have received."
1,Personal use and they are great
0,I bought those headphones a while ago but the mic quality wasn't so good since I bought I bought it.
1,"I’ve been working out and researching great gym headphones for over 20 years and every now and then you come across a real deal. These headphones are pound for pound the best overall sounding headphones I’ve owned in the past five years . They are as loud as you like it, clear, good battery life and they stay in my ear where they belong"
1,"Best ear buds I've purchased. Easy to set up, charges very quickly, great sound quality."
1,Great for the gym!
1,Bought these to replace a set from another manufacturer that died on me. My first impression is that these are much louder than my last set. I wear them at the gym and the sound is great. They also seem to stay in place which is really important during a hard workout. So far I am quite pleased.
1,Great sound. Great fit. Awesome headphones.
1,Great Bluetooth headphones.  Sound quality is fantastic.
1,I really haven't had a chance to use these headphones very much since I purchased them. I really like the &#34;memory foam&#34; type earpiece that is offered in the sizes of ear pieces. They are really comfortable! The sound is good & I believe I will be happy to not have to have a wire to deal with.
0,"I bought these a while back and they looked nice when I unboxed them. Appearances can be deceiving, these things were trash. I always had connectivity issues(bluetooth) all the time, and it wasn't my phone. Trust me I don't recommend them. I only used them about 10 times in the span of 4 months and they stopped working. They would charge, (the indicator would light up) but they wouldn't turn on anymore. Don't waste your money on this garbage."
1,Great sound!!! Like surround sound in your ears!! Awesome comfort too!! Necessary accessories included for runners too!!
1,For the price these headphones are amazing. The quality of sound and the last of the battery are very good for its uses. I use them for my podcast and interviews.
0,"The quality of audio is very low, even the least expensive wired headphones are leagues ahead of these. Using it to talk on the phone is impossible."
1,Great ear buds but I get a lot of wind noise while I work outside. I've tried the other ear bud sizes still the same...
1,Thank you for your attention. The ear buds are great but unfortunately I will be returning them because I don't have a smart phone. I wanted wireless buds that I could walk miles with and these have to be in close proximity to the power source. All I have is this iPod and it won't work if I leave my house and get away from my modem. So sorry.
0,Sound is fine but way to big and you can't bend the ear hooks back at all so they don't stay on at all
0,"After about a month had issues charging and connecting via Bluetooth. Sending back. On positive note, noise cancellation was great."
1,Great sound. Charged fast. Fits perfect in my ear. Exactly how described.
1,"Impossible to wear outside when there is wind, you won't hear a thing."
1,"Battery life, controls, and control volume (on/off, paired, etc.) could all be better.  I stepped on these and broke them and bought a similar pair for half the cost.  I'm happier with the new pair, hence the 4-star rating."
0,"Bought it and use it. It works really nicely at beginning. But suddenly it can not connect with my phone. I charged it, did whatever as whoever suggested........ Can not pair it........Really sad......"
1,"So far Im very happy with the earbuds, work very well, and such a cheap price."
1,super amazing the way i use it in gym wo and the copmany team just super amazed me really helpful
1,Had a minor issue connecting to phone but customer services was excellent with a quick response time.  Thank you
1,Excellent product arrived in great shape. No complaints.
1,"Sound is great and stays in place, also includes different size ear pieces. Really like it. Excellent for the gym."
0,First set was defective. Replacement didn't work either. Seller Tektron is a joke.
0,"short life span, it wont charged after a few uses."
1,Very comfortable and they stay in place
1,"these stay in my ears & are comfortable on my walks in the Tampa heat.  Had trouble pairing and their customer service was able to help me.<br />When they failed, 21 months after purchase I bought a new pair, which are  even better!  5/10/19"
0,Worked great for 3 weeks. After the third week the Bluetooth connectivity was hit and miss 20 minutes into my workout.  I tried them again this week and the Bluetooth connection didn't even last 5 minutes. Do not waste your money!
1,"These headphones and one of the best purchases I have ever made- let me explain. Incredible sounding headphones with every accessory included ie case, Numerous ear piece attachments in diff. sizes, as well as 2 charging cables(one even converts to an apple charger even though it doesn't take a lightening charger) This is the rare product/company that delivers a high quality product and then gives you even more for your money than you expect!!!"
1,"quick connect, good sound. Use them to work out. Plenty of volume, bit fat in the bass, but I'm working out, not listening critically. Still trying to figure out the fit by trading out the tips. The hooks are much less stiff than I thought they would be, almost floppy, but they keep the buds on, if not in, my ears. Good price for bluetooth headphones"
0,"For some reason if I insert them into my ear too far the sound is completely blocked and you can't hear anything. To use them I have to keep them loosely in my ears. It's really annoying, and it doesn't make any sense as to why they would do it but they do. I've tried everything and keeping them loosely in my ears is the only way that it doesn't do it. Other than that they are pretty good. Good sound, pair easily. I just wish I could wear them tighter so they don't fall out."
0,These advertise to be water proof. I went in the water with these and within 10 seconds they stopped working. Super disappointed
1,I love my wireless headphones they are awesome.
0,I have issues when I am running and listening to Jango. The music is not fluent and jumpy.<br />I am using Iphone 5S
1,I've had these earbuds for about 24 hours now.  I've used them for two runs and so far they are great.  They stay in my hears while I run without issue.  I sweat like crazy and have had no issues at this time with sweat.<br /><br />My only concern right now is the right earbud is heating up to where it is noticeably warm in my ear and to the touch.  I'm not sure if this is a normal thing or not.  I will be reaching out to support and will update my review once I find out more.
1,"Best headphones I have used for exercise so far and at a decent price. The sound is a little too deep, but when I'm busy trying to not die while running, I don't care that the sound isn't perfect."
1,"Received these on Thursday. First off, I was totally impressed with the quality packaging, then amazed by what all you get! I am an executive assistant who is on my phone a lot and these are absolutely perfect for my job! I highly recommend them! Sound, comfort, voice all excellent."
0,Worked well for a few months.  Good sound.  Decent battery life. Began to disconnect and then reconnect randomly.  Now it won’t connect at all.  I think the final transistors in the Bluetooth radio went bad.  I would love a replacement since it has been less than 1 year since the purchase.
1,"My man loves these headphones, uses them all of the time."
1,"I'm am probably the least &#34;techie&#34; person on the planet and as such I'm always a little hesitant to try new technology. However in this case the directions on these head phones were clear and concise (and surprisingly the illustrations provided actually made logical sense) and after charging the head phones for the recommended hour, I was able to pair them up with my I-Phone 6 in less than 10 seconds. The headphones fit well over my ears, the ear buds fit without pinching and the sound quality is amazing! I took them with me on my morning run and had no issue with them slipping or sliding and the click off feature right on the ear piece makes it possible to also hear clearly without having to remove the ear buds.<br />I bought this set as they were less expensive then another well known and hip brand with the thought that if I liked them I could always upgrade but I am delighted to say that won't necessary as these headphones not only met but exceeded all of my expectations. Fantastic quality and reasonable pricing!"
1,"Very nice product.  Good quality sound and easy to use.  Had some difficulties with pairing item to right source - must make sure there are no other blue tooth devices in immediate area, otherwise wrong device may be paired."
1,"I really like these headphones!  I use them for running and talking on the phone. The connection is quick. Very happy!  The hard part is hiding them from my children, because everyone wants to use them now!"
1,"I have been enjoying playing around with them!  I haven’t had much experience with connecting devices Bluetooth technology, so this has been a learning experience as well.  The audio quality is great!"
1,These were a gift for Christmas and told they work great
1,"I love these headphones for working out at the gym! Even when running or jumping whole sweaty they stay in my ears and have the best sound quality I've experienced in a wireless earbud. I tried the Tao Tronics for a while but those fall out. The ActiveBuds are great because they have the bendable arms that keep them on your ears, stay charged for longer, and connect faster to my phone. The others had issues with disconnecting. Not these!"
1,"The SENSO headphones I purchased are faulty 45% of the time I turn them on after charging.<br /><br />They skip. I know it's the headphones and not my iPod, because I've used 10+ headphones with this iPod and the Senso headphones are the only pair to ever act this way.<br /><br />I have to turn the headphones off and then back on, pray, and hope it works after restarting. They usually do work after that and stop skipping. It's just really annoying. I won't buy these again and would not recommend them."
1,Enjoying the buds. Came in a timely manner as promised and in the quality promised.
1,"exactly as described, good value"
1,Excllent great sounding product
1,"So far, these headphones are just what was needed.  The sound is fantastic.  They fit in/around the ear easy and comfy with very little weight.  Recharge time is fast and the operation is easy.  The only negative is the microphone quality, but that's not what they're primarily made for.  The person on the other end of the call hears some miscellaneous noises, like frequent clicking, that is a little distracting.  However, they can clearly hear the speaker's voice even with the microphone all the way up in the ear.  The bonus charging cords and dual car charging plug are a definite plus.  I would buy them again if another family member needs a pair."
1,Bought this as a gift for my husband...he loved it! Totally recommend these earbuds. Thank you!
1,I am very happy with these earbuds they work really really well so well I had to buy my wife a pair of so she would stop stealing mine. I have one of those very high dollar headphone ones Witcher falling apart three times now these things are amazing the sound quality is phenomenal in my opinion. They are also lightweight and not bulky taking up a lot of room and come with multiple different earbuds sizes I highly recommend them
1,"These ones, I tried after a full recharge. It paired up quickly without any issue. The manual says it all clearly what needs to be done. The LED is also clear enough to indicate what stage you are on during pairing or usage. The sound quality is also great for this price. Not so detailed fidelity, but I don't think anyone would find a complaining sound. They re light-weight, they don't hurt ears, they come with a lightening cable and a car charger with 2.1 V which is really useful even for phone charging. Built is also sturdy enough for sports maneuver. I haven't tested the water-proofing yet, so can't comment on that, but seems that it will hold up to its rated specifications. Product came in as described and is working as described. They also look trendy and sporty. I would say it is correctly identified as #1 Best Seller on Amazon in Electronics &#62; Accessories & Supplies &#62; Cell Phone Accessories &#62; Bluetooth Headset.<br /><br />I in fact ordered another pair for my cousin as a gift."
1,"Well I’m probably not the best critic for these ear buds since I have not ever had or used wireless ear phones, but I really like these earphones. They have as good sound quality as my apple XR ear phones. Best of all, they are wireless which makes it so much more enjoyable at the gym. I have to charge them every night though."
1,Easy to set up and they work great!!
1,"Great product! Quick to connect via Bluetooth, very comfortable to wear, they stay on your ears, who could ask for anything more!"
1,Headphones are great love it
1,"The earpiece fits well, and it is easy to use.  Just what I was looking for, as the set I had previously did not work so well.  I like the small carry case that came with it also."
1,The sound quality is decent for the price it has a good bluetoth reach i can be two rooms away from my pc and still listen to music.
1,"Great sound, comfortable fit, easy pairing.  Great value, would definitely recommend"
1,My husband uses these every day. Thanks for a great product.
1,These headsets rock!  Really top stereo sound. Lite as a feather!  So comfortable that and not bulky like those over the ear headsets.  Great for the gym or while working around the house!
1,Just received these.  They are comfortable and have great sound. Love to get rid of the cords.
1,I just received my headphones and went for my first run with them yesterday. They were very comfortable and sound great. The controls are taking a little getting used to. I had Beats before these and the controls were on the cord. Overall I think I'm going to like these. For the price they sound as good as the Beats.
1,Best wireless earphones ever
1,Bought these expecting a little skip or white noise due to the reviews as well as streaming on a poor connection from sprint. I have more issues with the phone and app then these. They were better than expected and last hours. I use them to mow lawns and they held a charge for three weeks being used 4 hours each Saturday before the &#34;low battery&#34; went off (never let them die).
0,These had ok sound - were not near as good as stated. Calls were pretty bad - music/video playback was decent. .
0,They worked great at first but now they  always have static. I’ve tried everything the trouble shooting suggested. They are now useless.
1,Awesome easy to use and great battery life!
0,"Not quite 8 bit midi, but these headphones suck. Wind noise is amplified 1000x making these completely unusable while running, or any sports, or moving in general. Went to run half a block and had to tear these things out of my ears. 11000 reviews? 7800 of which are 5 star? Biggest bogus I've ever seen.<br /><br />Pros - Wireless, easy to pair, decent fit<br />Cons - being the Best Wireless Sports Earphones"
1,"Well worth the $35+ from Amazon.  Pairing with my iPhone 7 Plus was a snap.  I use it for hands-free calling, and I couldn't be happier.  I got my headphones within 2 days - Amazon Prime.  I would buy these again and recommend it to you.  I got a really nice case, car charger, charging chords for headphones and an iPhone cord."
1,Best product. I can listen music for hours.
0,"Started out great, but looking at my history with these earbuds, they're only good for six months at a time...3rd set in all"
1,"Love these!  Comfortable, stay in place, and the sound quality is amazing!"
1,"It took me a few uses to get used to the ear pieces, but once I did they are really awesome!"
1,Good product but only lasted me about 8 months and stopped charging. But there was a one year warranty and the company was very easy to work with. They sent me some info on resetting the device which didn’t work. After that the quickly sent a replacement.
1,They work great.
1,Ear hooks are too flimsy.. constantly had to adjust. The connection cuts off (in and out) while running. This is my second one ..the first one lost sound on left side.
1,"Great headphones! The noise canceling buds work the best for my ears, but all sizes are comfortable. No issue connecting and the battery is suprisingly resilient."
1,So far they stay on! Always have a problem of them popping out of my ears. Sound is great.  Easy to use!
1,What I expected
1,"They didn’t ship the charging cord with the headphones. I let the seller know and they wanted me to send a picture of everything I received with the package. I just decided to use a cord I already had.  It came with a car magnetic phone mount. I use and love that. The headphones worked great, but only lasted 4 months."
1,Great for the treadmill
1,"As described, working great."
1,Best wireless Earphones I got so far and I’m a geek when to comes to earphones
1,These are awesome! It is so nice to be able to step away from my desk and still be connected to the music playing on my computer.
0,"Junk, bought to use while running. It took 3 days to get it to take it's first charge. Used it about 10 times and it is dead. Will not power up or charge."
1,The sound quality could be better but you can't beat the price.
1,The loops keep them on my ears while working out.
1,"I like these headphones a lot with exception to one fatal flaw. The headphones have a tendency to fall out, I believe that this is because the piece that goes over the ear is too flimsy so when I am running and the earpiece is bouncing around there isn't enough lateral support to prevent the headphones from sliding out of my ear. The beats Powerbeats are much more rigid over the ear. If it wasn't for this issue I would give easily give these headphones 5 stars.<br /><br />See the attached image to see how the weight of one headphone is enough to bend the piece that goes over the ear"
0,The product was great at first but when I tried to workout with them they cut out with every move that I made.. I have not had them long and on a phone call people can’t hear me..
0,Bought in November.  Stopped pairing in February.  I recommend you look elsewhere.
1,Works great
1,This is the first pair of Bluetooth headphones I have owned. I love the sound. I have worn them to workout and do things around my house.
0,"Got these headphones and used them nearly every day. Very good overall, the connection can be a little spotty but never anything too frustrating.<br /><br />But then the plot twist - 5 months in, these suckers kick the bucket mid-use. They won't turn on; I try to reset and nothing happens; plugging them into charge does nothing. I email SENSO, they respond quickly, saying they will replace since they are under warranty. That was nearly 3 weeks ago. I never received confirmation and have followed up 3 times and they will not respond. They also do not have a phone number I can find anywhere...<br /><br />Perhaps my review will change if / when they send the replacement."
1,"First off, the ear wrap pieces are very flimsy and do not stay in place very well. Sound quality is decent, but not great by any means. Do not compare to other brands sound quality. Easy to use and set up, but overall not any better than average at best."
0,Bought 2 and they both died after moderate use in 4 months. Waste of money. And the customer service number listed on the packaging is disconnected. Total scam.
0,I cannot review the sound quality of the earbuds because I returned them as soon as I received them.  I did not receive the Cable Management Clip or the two bonus items listed in the ad (Dual Port USB Car Charger or 3ft. Charging Cable for Apple (Lightening connector) and Android (Mini USB connector) Devices) but that wasn't the main problem.  The main problem was that the ear clips are not adjustable and were too large for my ears.
1,"Comfortable, stay in my ears (which was a problem with other wireless headphones!), sound great, come with cute case and a lot of accessories. The pairing to my iPhone was simple and they charge very quickly. What a great deal! I would recommend these to anyone who is looking for comfortable wireless headphones that stay put. (Written in April 2017)<br />UPDATE TO THIS REVIEW:<br />It is now July 2018. I noticed that I was having more and more difficulty connecting to my iPhone and iPad; they finally stopped connecting completely. Too bad. They are comfortable and sound good. I guess at this price over a year's worth of use is not unacceptable, but I'll be shopping for another brand."
1,Motorola was crap.  JBL was too.  So far SENSO is treating me well.  There is a one year warranty I hope I won't need.  I'll be very happy if I get a year out of them.
1,Clarity of these headphones are outstanding.
1,"Sound quality is OK at best.... but you get what you pay for, I didn't have high hopes for a $35 pair of bluetooth ear buds. Build quality seems decent and they are comfortable."
1,"I bought my first pair several weeks ago. I listen to my books on audible and<br />the sound is so clear. I love them, so I bought another pair!"
1,"These are amazing. Thinking of getting them for friends for Christmas. Comfortable, excellent acoustics. Stay in the ears."
0,"I returned the product. Not sure if it was defective or what. When i first got it i was amazed with the product.<br />Pros:<br />Music played good, fit in my ear nicely, didn't fall out during workouts. Buttons were great.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Music played like it was a scratched up cd. Thought it was the song when it first happened, checked the song, nope it played good without it.  then it happened again. So i assumed i was too far. But even when i was close it kept happening.<br />I didnt like how it hangs when i only use one side.<br />Also, being on the phone, the other line barely heard me.<br /><br />Product returned and refunded same day."
1,Have to careful of the charging port. The cord does not fit completely into the port and if you push hard it will come loose.
0,Stopped working after 3 weeks power button stuck
1,"Very impressed with neatness of packaging, clarity of sound, and adaptability of earbuds. Simplicity of setup and pairing was also easy even for a non-techy. Time will tell about durability, but looks good so far."
1,"Don't let the inexpensive price fool you - these are great headphones.  Very easy to set-up and sound was much better than I expected.  As far as reliability it is too soon to tell, after they have been through a few of my workout I update my review."
1,Sound isn't the best but for the price and purpose works very well. I go to the gym and do cardio  5 times a week and they always stay in my ears.
1,"Great set of headphones and the package came with some extras (car mount system) and wallet attachment. Both of which I needed and am tickled to receive."""
1,"I haven't had these for a long time--and this is my first experience with bluetooth headphones, but these seem quite nice and convenient.  If everything is still working this well in six months, I would give it five stars.  And I haven't had a chance to run in them.  I am really glad that I purchased them."
1,These sound amazing!
1,so far so great!
1,Excelente lo recomiendo son muy cómodos y prácticos para llevar a todas partes.
1,"Nice sound quality, nice battery life, very lightweight. Only negative is the cord that ties the two ear pieces together. It is flat and because of that increased surface area, it tends to stick to my neck when it gets sweaty. As a result, i wear it under my chin rather than over the neck. Otherwise i would buy it again."
1,Al tiempo se pela el cable y queda expuesto hasta el cobre. No comprare otro.
1,"These headphones are fantastic. Customer service is wonderful as well. I wear them when I'm running,walking my dog, grocery shopping etc. Love them!!"
1,work great
1,"Great sound for the price. I was worried about comfort and fit, but I barely notice them. I use them to listen to Brain.fm while I work. These headphones eliminate the element of frustration and insecurity that comes with standard earbuds. I'm still getting used to the fact that I ndon't have to move around like there's a dangling cord that could get snagged on something."
0,"I didn't like these.  They wouldn't stay put hands free in my ears for running, or even walking for that matter.  They just kept flopping out.  I contacted the vendor and was told to try different sized buds, but trying to find a specific bud that stuffs so tight into my ear not only seemed unlikely since the whole ear device piece was so big and clunky, I just can't see it staying in there for a run with that size and nothing else hanging onto it other than a smoosh in the ear if you can find the right size.  I also had a lot of trouble just doing the basic function of connecting the bluetooth to my device.  I had to repeat it about 10 times before it would connect.  I have never returned an item on amazon, this was the first time I've returned something."
1,These are very good for the money. I would recommend these.
1,"We've only had the headphones for a couple days but so far so great. They look and sound awesome, come with a cool little case and lots of accessories. Pairing was easy. They feel like they're solidly made."
0,"I bought these about 6 months ago and decided to hold off reviewing until I have had a chance to use them. At first these headphones worked very well, they paired quickly to my iPhone and help about 7 hrs of charge.  I am very dissapointed because they have stopped pairing to my devices, iPhone and iPad. My Bluetooth on both iPhone and iPad is showing senso s250 when I press connect, it gives me the message that the pairing was unsuccessful. I have tried rebooting both my phone and charged the earbuds the entire night to make sure they are fully charged. I have followed the instructions that came with the earbuds but still the pairing is unsuccessful. If someone out there can help me pair my devices please let me know."
1,Great headphones for the price you can't beat it and the material is quite sustainable overall great product
1,"Great headphones,great sound with music or phone calls,very handy carry case,really protects the headphones while not using them. Delivered in a timely manner"
1,Love it
1,"First pair of bluetooth headphones. My ears don't fit earbuds very well so I didn't want to spend a lot of money. I very much like the three different sizes of earbuds that come along in the case. I use these exclusively for running and they stay in place pretty well. I do get some wind noise on blustery days. They charge up easy and quick, they pair with a smartphone without much hassle. They met my expectations."
1,"I cannot live with out these headphones! After having several different types of bluetooth headphones over the years, I have found the perfect set! I have purchase 3 sets of these, to have at home and work and a friend. The sound quality is excellent, they are so comfortable, and nicely made! I wear these eveyday at the gym and at work. I have used them in the park on walks and for phone calls. THE BEST!"
0,"After using these at the gym for about 3 weeks, the music started cutting out while I was listening to them. I made sure they were charged, tried them again and still had some crackling, and then the next week they started to automatically shut off about 45 minutes after using them. Even with a full charge, they did this every day. I asked about returning them and it was conveniently 5 days after the return window closed. So basically, if you have any issues with these more than a few weeks after you get them, you're screwed. Save your money and do not buy these."
1,excellent!  very good headphones
1,Mother’s Day gift.  Wife likes it.
1,"I haven't had my headphones very long, but they're great so far."
1,Works great
0,Lasted 2 months. I was going to charge it and then the charger port broke. Tried to contact customer support and no answer. Sound quality was OK.
1,"These headphones are a good deal for the money. They pair easily, the sound quality is good and they hold a charge for a really long time. I didn't think I'd like the noise cancellation initially as I use them for running outside and it doesn't seem super safe to not be able to hear what's going on in your surroundings, but that isn't the case. I am still able to hear enough to feel safe but it blocks some of the sound that would make it hard to hear my music. Overall a win in my book."
1,Sound quality is much better than expectes doe the price. Lightweight and easy to carry.
1,Nice and light Bluetooth Headphones. Had to go buy a magnifying glass to read instructions.
0,"I was very excited to get these headphones because of all the positive reviews. I got them and everything appeared to be made well and read the instructions to get them started. My first issue is that it said it only took 1.5 hours to charge, after 2 hours it was still not fully charged. It was plugged into my iPhone cube. After about 4 hours on the charger it finally got a full charge and then I went to connect to my computer and nothing. My xbox, my computer, iPhone 8, roommates iPhone 6 and roommates iPhone X all could not even discover the device let alone connect to it. Tried doing the factory reset to no avail. Further research online shows that there were almost 500 questions on this product on how to connect it and reset it. All the question responses were to reset it, half the other questions were ""I reset it, and it stopped working again what now."" From my experience and the quality of customer service don't expect to ever get these to work if they don't."
1,Best running/workout headphones I have ever tried!
1,Use it at gym and around house regularly.  Fits great and if my wife decides to borrow than their are additional earbuds for her.
1,These are really great.  Easy to use and very clear.
0,Item does not work or breaks up audio when you are moving (bike riding and running). Purpose of sport headphones are defeatef as a result
1,"This is my second order of the same earphone to connect my smart watch exclusively.  I has had the first one for 4 months for my phone. Sound quality is superb, actually better than the $150 ones that I tried. I typically do not review product unless I am pissed off but I am not this time."
1,"I have been using these wireless headphones since October 2017 while running in all sorts of weather and am very pleased with the quality and sound for the price.  First, some background on me.  I will run (or as I age, I call it the “old man shuffle”) at a local university on both paved roads and trails so the run is both smooth and rough at the same time.  I will run for up to an hour or 5 miles “ish” and have run in heat of 90 plus degrees (lots of sweat), below freezing (lots of shivering), winds, thunderstorms, and all sorts of weather.  The headphones stayed in place and worked without issue in all of these circumstances.  I have even run with a “loose” fitting hat over my ears to keep my ears warm while wearing the headphones without issue.<br />The amount of items you get for the price was a nice surprise.  It came with a very nice compact case, charging cable, car charger, and many extra earbuds.  I have actually tried the neoprene and foam earbuds in different weather and find that I like the neoprene in the heat and foam in the cold.<br />Sound quality was surprisingly very good and these earbuds can get very loud.  Paring with my IPhone was simple as well as learning how to use the headphones.  I have never had an issue with the charge running out.  I have run for 5 of 7 days without the need to re-charge the headphones so I typically charge them on the weekends.<br />I will admit that putting them on took a few tries.  First, it is highly recommended that you put them in the correct ears (I first tried them backwards and it took me looking in the mirror to realize I was doing it wrong – uncomfortable too!).  Make sure the black plastic cord that connects them is over your back.  The first time I ran, I had the cord in the front and it kept bouncing up into my face.  (I guess common sense helps!)  Now, I have learned that I insert into my ears first and then rotate the headphones to slide over and lock onto my ears.  Once on, I have never had an issue with them slipping off.<br />My only complaint, although minor, is that the connector to charge the earphones is very small.  There is a “tiny” cover that has to be opened to insert the charging cable.  Again, as I have aged, I have to find my “reading” glasses to get the cover open and charger connected, as I can’t see small items anymore!  Not a big issue unless I can’t find one of my many pairs of reading glasses that always seem to be missing.<br />Overall, in my opinion, these are a great pair of headphones and it comes with many extras.  I was so pleased with these that I bought a second pair for my son who is using them for running as well.  I would definitely purchase again.  Great Quality at a Great Price!<br /><br />Reviewed by G. Swanson"
1,"I got these headphones because of the outstanding reviews.<br /><br />The Good:<br />These are value for sure. With all the items included, good luck finding anything else on Amazon that is comparable. These aren't noise canceling, but it's fine. The bass is strong and the sound quality is better than my wired xiaomi headphones, so it definitely feels like I got an upgrade.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />I am getting skips in my headphones if I have my phone in my pants pocket. I am 5'11&#34;, so the distance between my phone and the headphones is less than 3 feet. If I keep my phone in my jacket pocket (roughly 2 feet distance), the skips disappear. I'm pretty sure my pant pockets aren't lined with lead, so my guess is that anything beyond 2 feet allows for skips. Also, sometimes when I turn my head, there's a skip or two that occurs, so there might be some wiring issue.<br /><br />Overall, I can't complain for something that I spent $30 on."
0,They were ok until suddenly the left earbud came unglued and broke off from the base. I don't even know how it got loose.
1,"Easy to connect with devices, clear sound.  I have very small ears so the ear loops are very helpful for me."
1,easy to pair<br />good instructions
1,"Great value product with a very high quality sound. Fantastic support team, fast responses and happily replaced my headphones when they broke after almost a year of everyday use. Used constantly for gymming, running, commuting, for a mix of music and podcasts. Great battery life and come with a very handy case. Would highly recommend."
0,"Initially these headphones were great.  Then, I started to use them for workouts, these headphones are JUNK & service is about as terrible as the headphones.  If I could give it less than 1 star I would!!!!  I bought these headphones in September of 2017, in December of 2017 the first pair quit charging.  When I called tech repair (the first time), we went through the normal, do you have them plugged in sequence.  Yes, yes and yes!!!  So they ask for my order # and they send me a new pair.  Fast forward to today....SECOND PAIR, SAME PROBLEM!!!  So I call the tech support, same thing which cord, which charger. YADA, YADA....He tells me to send them back and they will check them out.  He doesn't look up my order, no history, even though it is STILL inside a year.  DO NOT BUY these they wont last!!!  My bet is these people know they have an issue and"
1,For personal use
1,Fits good and sounds great.
0,If I had to use one word to describe the sound it would be &#34;muddy.&#34;  No detail and everything sounds buried.
1,"Let me start by saying that I am a Crossfitter and an obstacle course racer. I have had many pairs of headphones that I have blown through because of sweat and maximum use.<br /><br />I have been searching for a pair of wireless headphones that were easy on the bank account but had great sound and were sweat/waterproof. I stumbled upon these and after reading the reviews, decided to give them a shot.<br /><br />I will say I was a little worried when I got them out of the box because they were a bit bulky and the piece that goes around the ear is very flimsy. However, the additional items you get are awesome!<br /><br />I wore them to Crossfit and we had a pretty intense workout (running, tire flipping, kettle bell carries, mountain climbers, tire jumps and sandbag work). Not once did they come out, feel uncomfortable or bother me.<br /><br />Even more so, the sound is incredible! The noise cancellation is so good that even with music off, I could barely hear my coach. The bass is deep, treble is loud. I would compare the sound quality with that of the Beats.<br /><br />The change song, volume, pause and other options on the headphones were surprisingly easy. The only thing that I would say is a bit of a downer is the controls are on the earbud portion and not on the cord so it is a little harder to use vs having them on the cord.<br /><br />Overall, these are a steal for the price. I look forward to wearing them in my races and hope that they will last!"
1,These headphones were great; I used them for 6 months without a problem. And when there was a problem - the left ear went out unexpectedly - they responded so quickly via customer service and sent a warranty replacement immediately. All around excellent;
1,Great piece
1,Best ones for the price. Love them. Thanks
0,Absolutely the worst for phone calls. I cant hear the caller and I have to almost yell for them to hear me
1,"Excellent set of ear buds, they are very powerful and I got a fantastic deal on the price"
1,"This is worth it buying, clear sound and not background noise. Seller fulfilled a replacement with not questions being asked.<br />5 star seller.<br />Love it"
1,Llllllllooove them!!!
0,This is now my second pair in the past 90 days. Both pairs have stopped holding a charge after a few months of use. I spent about an hour before just giving up and ordering another brand.
1,"I like them, but they are bulky and they don't stay in my ears while working out."
0,"Worked fine for about 2 weeks, connection fast. Voice quality fine (used it for podcasts only).<br />3rd week, vocal confirmation of connection remained fast but was delayed, would kick in 10&#34; after it said it had connected.<br />But after about 3 weeks, it stopped taking a charge. There is a pinpoint red/blue light which indicates power on/charging - stopped coming on, and no more sound :-(. I would periodically check it ~2x/week over past 3 weeks - same result.<br />Same power failure happened with a green Sennheiser I had, but that one lasted ~1 year (and cost $100)<br />The nice thing about bluetooth is I can use it in the pool with my iPhone.<br />The search continues..."
1,Nice fit. Great sound. Really comfortable to run in.
1,"Bluetooth connectivity is excellent, however, the earpieces do not stay in place (at least for me) while running or vigorously walking. Wind noise is also an issue. Should work very well for inside use if activity is limited."
1,"Great headphones, love them. So happy I found them."
1,"Music skips frequently for the first few minutes after connecting with my android devices and my PC. Usually settles down and works fine after the first few minutes.<br /><br />It does, however, work nicely with my work iPad (2017), so it earns 3*"
1,great sound! I traded out the beats 3 for these and am so happy I did. now I don't have to hear the guy next to me sucking air while I'm working out!
1,"I've given 5 starts all around because my first time had been a great experience,  today I will be exercising with them for the first time.  Let's see how it goes"
0,Great sound..kind of bulky. The cord connecting both headphones is too long so it tends to get in the way or pull headphones out of ear
1,"Great headphones, affordable, sleek, and come with a lot of extras"
1,My son loves them the sound is just like a Beat but cheaper
1,Very pleased with the product
1,"GREAT Headphones, I found what I was looking for :)"
1,Gonna do a review on my YouTube channel look up armandomobilefixerZ to find it. It's a great product for the price id love to do more reviews on senso
1,Sound on these is great.. Never a problem..problem lies with the construction... Threat piece are too flimsy.. Any real movement and the ear pieces come out of the ears...
0,"Bluetooth range is so poor that when my cell phone is in my pocket, they cut out about once a minute.  Factory suggested resetting the headphones to fix the problem. That did not help at all. Still getting horrible reception. The headphones will cut out five or six times per song. These are garbage. I'll be purchasing something else."
0,"Like: Easily connected and good sound. Long playtime<br />Dislike: Not fitting well , not secure well and not comfortable. Feeling heavy on my ears."
1,Didn’t stay in ear camel tight enough and kept falling out anytime I moved my head.
0,These were great.....until they weren't.  Now dead and the won't turn on.  Uss d the very little over a period of about a year.
1,"Very good product for this price, sound is clear and loud, easy connectivity, battery life as described."
1,"These are the absolute best headset I have owned. I have a higher end set that does not compare to these. The sound clarity is awesome and the bass is spot on. I would recommend these to anyone. Had a problem with connectivity after using for 6 months, contacted the company and they were very helpful with a simple reset to original default. They come with other goodies such as a dual android/iphone charging cable that acutally works, dual plug car charger and different size ear bud rubber. Great product"
1,"To put it simply, they're amazing. It's been a couple months and they're still running strong."
1,Great value for the money. Outstanding sound.
1,They are worth the money.  I use them with my watch and if my arm back I lose the signal.  Other than this problem they fit well and stay on.  Very useable.
1,Really nice sound for the bucket. Highly recommended so far. Not suitable for calls as it doesn't have nice MIC (people still hear me but far... far away)
1,comfort fit and quality sound thx
0,"It keeps disconnecting, I thought it was low on batteries but it still has the problem after a full night of charging.<br />I've only used it 4 times because each time after about 10 minutes it starts disconnecting every few seconds."
1,"Great quality sound, easy to pair with phone... my only regret is not getting these sooner! I listen to music while I work and love being able to pause my music with a single touch to my earbud when someone needs to talk to me. Get these now!"
1,"Loving ‘em! They came charged so I wasted no time in using them. They are an excellent product for the price Heck, they’re an excellent product at twice the price. If you’re considering making this purchase, rest easy and click the button. You won’t regret it."
1,Drowns out the noise while mowing or running an air compressor. Pairs easily and lasts long enough while talking and/or listening to music. Will update if anything arrises.
1,The sound is pretty good and you cant be the price
1,Love them.  they work wonderfully and hold their charge.  I use them to walk with for exercise.  the time flies by listening to the crisp sound of my favorite tunes!
1,Great ear buds!
1,"They stay on while I’m moving around.  The sound is great, better than my previous headphones I paid four times more for.  I would definitely recommend these and I do."
1,I got these to wear while I run. They were listed on a best of 2018 as the best for the price and it has certainly been the case! I love them. They are comfortable and I can hear my music great. They don't block out all outside noise which is fine by me as I like to be aware of what's going on around me when I out on the trail or doing road running. I am very please with the fit and performance of these headphones and would recommend them without reservation.
1,"Great, inexpensive.  Gets the job done while I am running."
1,So far so good!! Powered up right away connected easy. I enjoy the sound!! Cant really comment on battery life haven't really stressed them long enough yet. Very pleased. These replaced a pair of Jaybirds which I was not the happy with. I would happily recommend
1,So far so good. Sound is excellent and they stay on my ears well. It's so nice not having to mess with wires.
1,Absolutley love these! I workout 2 1/2 hours a day at 6 days a week and they work great everytime. I believe I have been using these for 8 months now and they still act brand new.
1,"Very good sound, had a bit of problem at first but customer support was very helpful and walk me thru the issue.  Not like other blue tooth headset, will only work with one device at a time."
1,"After about 6 months I experienced some issues with them, contacted their customer service and I got a replacement in a timely manner. I think the entire process took like 3 days.<br /><br />All in all if you're like me and just looking for bluetooth headphones for casual use, don't shell out more money and just get these.  I wasn't expecting to be blown away when I got bluetooth headphones, I just needed something to get the job done and these do just that. I don't notice anything off with the audio quality, the battery life isn't annoyingly short (it's probably around 8 hours), the controls/connection works well. etc."
1,"Nice headphones, practical for excercising."
1,Very nice product.
1,"They are perfect, the block out mostly all of outside noise and very easy to use, highly recommend"
1,the headphones are great and have great sound but they are not adjustable.  I have a very small head and the part that wraps around the ear is too big.
1,"I've been using these for a few months now and I have to say they have good sound quality, battery life, and I have yet to have a technical issue with them. I do however have issues with them failing out while excising which is a huge bummer. The earbud sizes are nice and all and do indeed help keep them in better or worse, but the real solution given their size would be adjustable ear hooks in order to give them that extra bit of support. The gel flex ear hooks should have some internal hardened yet flexible material like what glasses use to better conform to each persons ear. They always fall out just enough to get caught by the hook, but constantly having to push them back in is annoying. If the ear hooks were not just flexible enough to be comfortable, but also rigid enough to actually be useful I would rate these 5 stars."
1,Great choice for the money.
1,Great headphones! Sound is amazing! The only thing i had to do was use bass reducer on my iPhone for it to sound really great in my opinion. Even though I love bass in my music.
0,"Music cuts out frequently.  I have tried every possible configuration and I can still not keep a good bluetooth connection without these headphones cutting out.  I have tried Iphone, older ipod, new ipod, etc... ipod in left pocket, right pocket, back pocket, etc.... I still have signal loss numerous times during every walk.  It is extremely frustrating.  Unfortunately, because of my stubbornness to make these work and reading all of the amazing reviews, my return window has closed, so now I am stuck with them.  I am not sure how these things are getting so many positive reviews."
1,I was able to run and jump rope using the headphones with no problem. I am able to run longer since I don't have wires interfering.<br />Buy these headphones you won't be disappointed.
1,"It is ok, but not great. Price was good and I heard that the sound was quite good, but it isn't. It sounds muffled. Not awful, but not really clear as well. I understand this is not top-of-the-line, but counter to other reviews the sound is not very clear.<br /><br />As well the case which comes with it, which looks good, fell apart in first week with very little use. I am referring to the zipper coming undone nad not closing. So had to chuck that part."
1,"These are okay if you're in a bind and just really need some wireless headphones. I use headphones all the time for listening to audio books, talking on the phone, running, and working out. These stay on pretty well. The sound quality is okay. It's not the lame $10 walmart earbuds or anything like that.<br /><br />My main issue is comfort and ease of use. These can be a real bugger to get on if they've been in your pocket and the rubber prongs get bent out of shape. The prongs are plenty flexible, but it's difficult for me to remember how to position them so they fit &#34;just right&#34;. It generally takes me a few sessions of wearing to get things back in position. Also, having the actual ear bud piece in your ear is okay, but not immensely comfortable. I can handle it for a few hours so that's not a bad thing I suppose.<br /><br />With all of that said, it's the cord that gets me. It gets tangled up in weird positions and is very hard to untangle. It's almost like you have to train the cord. It's like the cord from one ear tries to bend and wind around the cord on the other ear, but it does this up high and not down below where the slack is."
1,I was very pleasantly surprised with the sound quality and noise cancellation but the earpiece is very big/loose and doesn't fit as well as I would like.
0,"I’ve owned two pair of these senso Bluetooth headphones and each died after nine months. Suspect product quality where both devices failed to take a charge.<br /><br />To the positive, the fit, sound quality and ability to stay in place during my workouts was entirely acceptable. But to fail so quickly— twice — is unacceptable and leaves this product rated 1 star. (First pair 1/2/2018, second pair 9/23/18)."
1,"sweat proof and water proof, these are my new favorite workout tool!!!"
0,"Purchased primarily for use with Apple Watch 2. Paired flawlessly with my iPhone 6+. Sound and comfort are pretty good for the price... the only problem is that they would NOT PAIR WITH APPLE WATCH 2! I tried everything in the troubleshooting guide. When I contacted them for assistance, they responded with a link to a discussion forum on other earbuds that have difficulty with the Apple Watch and a reminder of their return policy. They are obviously aware of the issue, but choose not alert consumers before purchase."
0,They intermittently connect and disconnect from the source.
0,"I bought these because so many people have had great luck with them. The packaging is awesome, they look and feel well made and they give you some great accessories, but the headphones sucked for me. The bluetooth connection is absolutely terrible. Some days they work better than others. Most days I have to keep my iPhone in my pocket for them to stay connected. If I left my phone by my workout bench they would start disconnecting and skipping if I walked a few feet away to grab a weight. If I leave my phone on the gym floor to do pull-ups, they will skip at the top of the pull-up..... These are seriously HORRIBLE and the sound quality is something that you would find in $5 gas station headphones."
1,"For the price, these phones have been very reliable. I bought a pair to work out with for myself.  A month later, I bought 2 more.  One for my wife and the other for my son.  The sound quality is pretty good.  Battery life lasts me a good amount of time.  The chord is the perfect amount of rigid and not rigid. It doesn't get tangled like chords that are two thin. I haven't had a problem with them yet.  Plus, the price for these is very reasonable."
1,"These are great earbuds.  Good quality sound.  Deep base is a little raspy, but good overall quality, especially for the price point.  Very little issue so far with connectivity or wind noise, but I wear my phone in an arm band when working out.  My only concern is the cover for the charging point seems loose and flimsy, I am concerned that at some point t will fall open and sweat will invade the space which is fatal flaw in all wireless earbuds I've ever owned."
1,"""Walking and cutting grass love working in the yard they really fit great """
0,"The sound in this earphones is not like a thing it is gonna be, sorry."
1,Absolutely great!  No outside sound gets through and they’re a great quality!
1,Fantastic.  Tremendous value.Equals competing products 2 or 3 times the cost. Well done
1,Great service and great sound. I love my new earbuds!
1,Worked as expected
1,The SENSO activebuds are great a great pair of earbuds.<br /><br />These sit perfect in your ears. They sit tight and with the piece that goes over your ears the don't flop around while your running. I just tried several different earbuds and I'm going with these. I would recommend these for anyone active or not.
1,"That'll do, Pig.  That'll do."
0,These were never left out of it's case but yet the area where the charger goes was bent making it impossible to charge and renders them useless.  Wasted money.
0,"I wear headphones most of the day at work, and needed a bluetooth pair because i can't have cords getting in the way.<br /><br />this pair was GREAT for the first few weeks; great sound, controls were easy to use, loved the buttons on the right ear bud for controlling music and answering phone calls. BUT the battery life dropped significantly after just 3-4 weeks of use. The buds were comfortable, easy to use, and exactly what i needed. but the battery went from holding a charge for 6-8 hours of use, to barely holding for an hour."
1,I have zero idea how these can be so inexpensive! Literally the best headphones I've EVER purchased!
0,I like the quality of the music but the music keeps on dropping. I have been using it for by outdoor runs and the issue exists in all routes that i take. Issue also exists in the gym where I use wifi. Not a great product returning it.
1,"100% satisfied and happy with this purchase, everything is great..... I liked the feeling on my ears and the quality of the sound and the charging time and the batteries life and the Bluetooth coverage area as well."
1,"I had never tried Bluetooth earbuds before and I love them.  It was easy to connect my iPhone to the earbuds.  There are two charging cords, a short one and a long one, and one of the two cords has a very clever micro plug and also a lightening plug. There is a nice carrying case and various additional earbud tips.  BTW, the tips are comfortable gel and not hard plastic.  The controls are big enough and easy to feel with the buds in my ears.  The sound is very good and the sound separation is good.  Even though the earbuds have a battery that lasts around eight hours, just in case you are out at a picnic and the charge runs low, the box has a duel port car charger so you can re-charge in your car.  There is nothing else I could want from a little box of Bluetooth earbuds.  I am very happy I bought this specific set for my first try with Bluetooth buds."
1,"These headphones are worth the price you pay and have both good things and bad things about them. Let me first start the review by saying I have owned these headphones for a year and they just completely died. So when ordering, please keep in mind that this purchase might be annually based upon my experience.<br /><br />The Good: Easy to use and setup, didn't feel too awkward when wearing, sound quality was good, battery life was pretty good<br />The Bad: Ear straps do not help support, buttons will break or get stuck at times to prevent usage, additional items included in purchase are a waste<br /><br />These headphones died when i was using them at the gym one day and I heard this loud noise like a fire alarm going off for a brief second (sound came from headphones). Once the sound stopped, they never turned back on."
0,The fit was nice but the sound was way below par. Bass distorted badly once it was set above mid volume.  On the high volume setting it sounded like a broken car speaker with the amount of crackling.
1,"Great packaging, quick delivery, and several extras! Oh, and the sound quality is fantastic along with a comfortable fit for a reasonable price!"
0,"These headphones are great. They last long on medium volume and the sound is pretty good. Phone calls work good on both ends through them as well. I use these at work and they don’t move or fall off my ears, even when I’m upside down. The only problem I have is connecting with my phone sometimes. They are paired to my iPhone but sometimes it doesn’t show up on Spotify to listen through them. The headphones will control my music but won’t play it. I then have to go to settings and disconnect then reconnect them to get them to work correctly. I know it’s not my phone or my music apps because my more expensive headphones didn’t have this problem before they went out. Besides this, everything is great and this is the only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars.<br />Edit: 4 months later the headphones turn off randomly and disconnect once in a while. Every 1-10 minutes. Will be purchasing a different set for more money to try them out. Dropped the rating to two stars because of this."
1,"Amazing for the cheap price especially, but in general as well. Audio quality is great, the fit is snug, with size adjustment pieces that come with it if you need a different fit. Also a nice, stylish, easily portable case cones with them too.<br /><br />If you don't care about the Beats name (And really, why should you?) I would go with these little babies."
1,"I think I finally found the Bluetooth headset I was looking for. The earbuds fit my ears perfectly. The sound is great and my iPhone and it get along beautifully. The phone answer, pause, track advance and.... are just great!"
1,Great product and fast service.
0,Horrible connectivity. Bigger and bulkier than I thought they would be and they’re not a comfortable fit around the ear.  Continuously had to put them back in my ear. Not fun during a workout.
1,"I've used these headphones for both audio books and music and the sound quality is excellent! I love the volume, play/pause, and on/off controls right on the earphones. Phone calls can be answered and handled through the headphones. The battery charges quickly and lasts for several hours. The Bluetooth wireless feature is so convenient. The only problem I've had is that they occasionally fall out of my ears."
1,"They are great for listening, but the protrusion from the ears is really awkward."
1,Amazing sounds for the price!
1,I looked at a lot of Bluetooth headphones before I purchased these. The reviews were very positive and I decided to give them a try. Very happy with this purchase. The earbuds are very comfortable and although I don't usually use and eat hook these are very comfortable. The volume is great anf I love that you can pause and advance songs.
1,Works good easy to use. I work at a factory and can get about 55-60 foot away from my phone as long as no machines are in my way. Could be a little more comfortable still haven't tried all the ear pieces yet.
1,"I have had these headphones for over a week now, (maybe 2 idk) and I can say they are amazing! At first I thought 'why was the part that goes around your so flimsy?' well it's actually way more comfortable. The sound quality is always of utmost importance for me, so when I read others review saying the sound quality was great I had to jump on board. Also, they almost never fall out of my ear even when i accidentally pull the cord or have one hanging out. Overall a must buy.<br /><br />P.S. I have tried many known wireless earphone brands, this trumps all."
1,"Great headphones, great build, and best of all inexpensive compared to similar build quality headphones. Reccomened 100%."
0,"After 5 months of use, they stopped charging. The red blinking light is dim and after 24 hrs of being hooked up to a charger, they still won't turn on. I would have sent the company an email , but found no contact info.."
1,"I have used three other brands by LG and Samsung (necklace types) and by Sony mini headset type. This one is much better than the other three because<br />1. The price is a steal. I bought them because I felt like I have a little to lose as the other three products cost me twice as much.<br />2. Clear sounds. I see negative reviews here, but I have no complaints rather compliments to give. Also unlike another negative comment about 'taking a while to connect,' perhaps the first time? I have not noticed such as soon as I turn the device on, it is already connected to my phone before I even put on both ears.<br />3. Easy to carry pouch: it came with a cute little round black/red pouch. When I had those necklace types, they were convenient to have them around your neck, but when I had to take them off, I had to throw them in my purse, and the lines get tangles with other items in my purse, how I got to get rid of my LG ones to find this one.<br />4. Great during workouts: I really liked the necklace types,but I could not use them during my workouts because I like treadmill (running) or stretching, how I got to use the Sony one.<br />5. Works as earplug: it comes down to my Sony one, the mini headset type. If it doesn't look to noticeable to wear it to go with professional outfit, I could hear all the other noise when I am at a coffee shop or even at a public place - too many loud noisy people everywhere. I love SENSO because they work for me like earplugs!<br />6. Accessories: in that cute little pouch, other than its own mini USB Android phone charger, it came with an addition set of a cigar jack USB connector, and a universal USB charger for both iPhone and Android. We keep it in our family car because my husband has iPhone and I have an Android phone. And they are not some cheap accessories they threw in for you as an obvious bonus, but rather nice looking good quality pieces of accessories.<br />7. Service: I usually don't write product review for obvious reasons - perhaps too lazy, but I decide to write one for this product, because it really is a great product. By seeing how this company conducts business, it shows that they care about their customers.<br />I would have been just as happy with the bluetooth headphones alone because again this one works better than other ones I have used in three other named brands in a price range of $70 - $120. Then to get the all the other extra ones, I figure I drop this review for them as my way of courtesy. Thank you for the great product and a great price!"
1,They work well and the service was quick. The headphones don't have the best sound quality I've ever heard but for the price it's good enough.
1,"Love them. The only difficulty i have is sometime they will say they are paired when they really aren't. Besides that they have good sound pay off, they don't fall off/out when you're doing vigorous exercise. They're all around great!"
1,I take these on a run every other day and only issue I have is losing connection between my phone and the headphones during some of the runs. The battery charge lasts all week.
1,"easy to use, good sound quality"
0,Headphones sound great but they keep dropping.  They will connect for 8 seconds then disconnect for 4 seconds.  This process will keep repeating until I cycle the power. Also having issues with just cutting out every 6 seconds.  Not sure if these issues are associated with the percent charge.  I will continue to investigate and update accordingly.
1,pretty good
1,"They arrived the next day, the packaging was good. Really liked they came with their own case and car charger included. They are really comfortable, I usually stay away from over the ear earphones because they tend to hurt my ears but these are extremely comfortable. 3 stars because there is a lot of static (spotty Bluetooth connection) when I put my phone in my running belt which goes around my waist. My belt isn't even thick... I got these earphones especially for running so it sucks especially paying so much for them."
1,"These are the best quality headphones  ( for the price) I have ever purchased. Easy to pair and charge. Can even charge in your car. The sound is great . I would highly recommend this item , as well as seller."
1,"Bought these to wear using heavy machinery and listen to music on my phone. Excellent sound quality, comfortable to wear. I can leave the equipment and step away (open gate, etc.) and the headphones stay connected to my phone. Phone call sounds are clear.<br /><br />Will have to see how they hold up under use."
1,Fall off uncomfortable the part that goes in your ear doesn't move the only part that moves is the part that goes around your ear... how can anybody jog with these. Sound quality is good that's about it.
1,You must be wearing both at the same time or else they fall off constantly.  If you don’t clip it to your clothes you can’t wear one side Easily
1,"I bought this headphones for my everyday work, I use a lot my cell phone and they work great, good value good product."
0,Don't do it l. I have tried it twice  and it does not<br />Work
1,"These headphones are decent for the price. One design flaw is that the on/off button is located right on the earbud so it is very easy to turn it off when you insert them into the ear. I find them to be very comfortable. The range is pretty good but I am not sure it goes 30 feet in my house. I also have not been able to figure out how to tell how much listening time is left on a charge. There is no companion app and my iPhone does not include this device on the battery widget.  As a result, I feel compelled to keep them on the charger so I know they are good to go if I need them for a long stint. To spite the flaws, I would still recommend these as a solid option for the money."
1,"Great sound, can connect multiple phones. Only down side is that they are VERY noticeable. Great buy."
0,"Poor battery life. Sounds good, but the battery life bothers me."
0,"If you're buying these headphones to answer your calls while cycling, don't buy these. Where I live the wind is usually not even strong, but the other.person cannot hear me"
1,I’ve been using these for about a month. So far all is great. I use them while on the treadmill. They stay in and work great. Good price!
1,Great headphones. Definitely loud enough and comfortable. Love all of the features it offers!
1,The Senso bluetooth headphones work great!! These are my 1st bluetooth headphones. The sound is excellent and I like not getting my headphone cord hung up somewhere between my MP3 player & my ears! with the old headphone connection the cord would often get pulled out of my ears.
1,"I give five stars for both sound quality and customer service. I have purchased two pairs of these headphones and have recommended them to others as well. Had a little connection issue after having them for about a month, contacted Senso who provided me directions on how to resolve the issue. This worked well for about 4 days then the issue came back. Contacted customer service again and they proved me a brand new pair, no questions asked. Phenomenal customer service and really good headphones. For the price you just can't go wrong. I use these daily for both leisure and exercise. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good set of Bluetooth headphones."
0,"Do not buy these headphones if you plan on using them to have phone conversations. They are somewhat comfortable when you have them both in, but they are awful when it's just 1 for talking to people on the phone or for use in your car.<br />They are heavy and will pull on the one in your ear. They also don't hang around your neck well. Almost lost them a couple times. The ""C"" that goes around your ear has a thin wire inside that let's you form it to your ears. It catches on everything. Can't put these anywhere without them catching on something and getting all bent up.<br />Save yourself the money and don't buy these unless you're just going to run with them and that's it.<br />On another note, these are Beats knockoffs in case you didn't know. Almost the same exact design and color."
1,"I have oddly shaped ear canals and it is always difficult for me to find ear buds that stay in my ears longer than 2 minutes when I go for a run. These headphones manage to do exactly that and I am very happy with them. I only took off one star because the sound quality on these is meh at best. They are overly bass boosted which makes some types music sound somewhat muddy. However, given the fact that these earbuds actually stay in my ears while working out and their great price, that is a very small gripe. I would definitely buy them again."
1,"This is the second pair I have purchased because I loved the first pair so much!  Durable, decent battery life, and fit my ears well."
1,"For the price you pay, these are absolutely amazing. And all the extra stuff that comes with the package makes it that much better."
1,Work great! Very pleased. Thanks. Gordon.
1,"I like these headphones, but I really wish the sound quality was better. I bought them to replace an ancient set of original Moto S9 headphones I wanted to retire.  I like this form factor better.<br /><br />Good<br />- battery life is good, I like the indicator shows up on my iPhone<br />- Comes with multiple tip sizes and carrying case<br />- easy to use<br /><br />Negative<br />- Sound quality isn't that great, need a tight seal for any sort of bass response. Not sure how much of the overall sound quality issue is due to bluetooth vs, these headphones.  Same content on wired headphones is way better though.<br />- Bluetooth range in my experience isn't great (tested with iphone 6S, 7, and 8), very prone to interference. Signal would breakup with my phone in my pocket on walks.<br /><br />Overall these do what I need them to do.  I just use them for listening to podcasts or music while walking around the neighborhood."
1,"For the price point I wasn't expecting much but I must say these headphones sound good, are comfortable to wear and have all the features I need."
1,"Was running/walking with headphones and the chord would always get caught in my arm or bother me.  I finally gave in and got these headphones, didn't want to get Bluetooth ones, since I thought they would fall off or bother me while I was running..  They are awesome.. Sound is great.. and they fit perfectly. You can adjust them to your ear. I ran great with them.  never fell off or felt like they were going to fall off.<br /><br />Really happy with them. I think im going to get a second pair for my son, since he always has issues with iphone chords falling out of his little ears. these would be perfect!!"
1,Comfortable and good sound.  A good value for the price.
1,Awesome headset. I've gone thru a few types of wireless headsets similar to this one in style and this particular one is very good. sound quality is amazing. Bass response hits fairly hard but rarely do i notice any distortion. i can be two room away (drywall) and still have solid connection. Eartips sizes are ok. they never fell off my ears but i did have to readjust them from time to time. overall for the price its pretty decent. i definitely recommend this
1,"Just used them twice while working out.  This is the first set of ear buds to stay in place for me while I'm on the tread mill.  The foam bud covers really do adjust to size of the ear canal and they adhere better than the rubber ones.  The sound is great.  Outside noises are blocked fairly well.  The louder the volume is turned up, the better the ambient noise is kept out.  If there is any drawback, I found that once the sweat accumulated on my neck, the rubber covered wires stuck to my neck.  No big problem when I think about the plusses and the price I paid."
0,Pops out
1,"Good for their price. The connectivity is good. One down side is that their min. volume is still pretty loud for a quiet office setting, and the max volume will cause you to go deaf in an hour. No need for the crazy amount of volume. Sound quality is 5/10 also... Looks like they went for loudness not clarity. Actually.. its kinda garbage now that I think about it. Too bad someone stole my beats out of my car.. I just dont have the money or need to spend 100+ on an actually good pair. But you get what you pay for"
1,"Product arrived sooner than I expected. I was looking for a decent sounding, light-weight, bluetooth earbuds that were reasonably affordable that also have a decent low end bass response. These earbuds far exceeded all of my expectations. Love them."
0,Didn't work out of the box. Charged up but then wouldn't turn on.
1,....no problems here & highly recommended....of course...
1,Clearer sound at lower volume than wired buds. Comfortable to wear.
1,Very comfortable. Good quality sound
1,"I had trouble initializing and charging the phones, but the customer service was excellent."
1,"Great quality headphones for what it includes and the price. Great for hands free calling as well.<br />Only con is they will hurt your ear if worn for EXTENDED periods of time, but that's with just about every pair of headphones as well.<br /><br />2 MONTHS LATER - the main button that controls everything got stuck in the pushed in position. still worked for a week or so then it continues to call the last person that i called on my phone and also it proceeds to turn on and off, very annoying. I don't see them working again.<br /><br />I tried popping the button out and it got worse."
1,"Easy to pair to my iPod Classic 120GB player.  Senso's are comfortable, excellent audio quality, Great price too."
1,"I love these ear buds!!!! They are easy to set up and have good sound. I wouldn't say they have Bose sound but extremely good for wireless headphones! Now I can charge my iPhone 7 while watching Netflix or listening to music. It comes with all the accessories you need and a nice carrying case! Buy it, you won't regret it!"
1,"wireless headphonesI just wanted to tell everyone that these headphones have the best sound out of any headphones I've ever owned and I have owned the Q 25 Bose ,  Studio wireless beats headphones and this has blown them all away so I recommend them I have already recommended them to my friends because of the best deal I've seen on Amazon !!!!"
1,"These headphones stay in my ears well, are fairly comfortable, and the battery lasts for several days for me."
1,Cool --- have purchased two - very satisfied!
1,I love these so much! I am an avid runner and I was killing every single pair of earbuds I had from the sweat. These are sweat proof! I have tiny ears and earbuds usually always slip out while I'm running but these are pretty snug as long as you have them in correctly. Battery lasts quite a long time. Pretty good quality sound. Could be just a tad louder. Connects to my iPhone really easily. Only downside is the speaker isn't so great for talking on the phone. I only used it once and the person said they couldn't hear me.
0,"Bluetooth connection loses packets between iPhone6s and headphones.  Sounds like a record skipping, for those of us old enough to remember such a thing.  Phone is in pouch at waist, so headphones are less than 3 feet from transmitter.  Use is outside while walking or running.  Music skips 2-5 times per song.  I like everything else about these headphones, unfortunately they fail at their primary purpose."
0,Battery dies quickly. Didn't last a six hour flight
1,"These headphones are very good ! I have really enjoyed the great sound and the silicon ear plugs are the most comfortable I have had.I definitely, highly recommend them to anyone as a high quality product and I would definitely purchase again !"
0,"I ordered a pair for my husband and they were wonderful! I loved how you could adjust the piece that goes around your ear because he has big ears and I have very small ears. I ended up using them so much, I ordered myself a pair but my ear pieces aren't adjustable. I'll be returning"
1,Used the headphones for the first time today. Very impressed with the sound quality and the overall design. They fit well and are my new favorite workout partner.
1,I use them everyday and listen to books on my tablet and switch to my phone when a call comes in. The price is incredible for the quality.
1,"This would've been a 5 star glowing report except for one thing.  Bought these a little over 5 months ago and have continued to use them even though I've begun having a small problem with them.  I've kept using them because the sound quality is good, they're very durable, the battery life is good, the charging time is minimal, and they're VERY comfortable.  The issue I'm having is one of connection.  About three months after I purchased them, I powered them on and heard the &#34;connected&#34; prompt as usual from the headphones.  However, the &#34;headphone&#34; icon did not show up.  I waited for five minutes and still nothing.  I restarted the headphones, same result.  I went into the Bluetooth settings on my phone, disconnected and reconnected, and the headphones came on line.  Since that day, I've had to follow this procedure almost every time I use the headphones.  When the headphones say that they're connected but the icon doesn't show up, the control button on the headphones will start and stop videos and songs and hang up phone calls.  But the audio comes through my phone speaker.  A little frustrating but not enough to give less than three stars."
0,"They constantly cut out. When I first bought them I thought maybe it was because I had an older phone. I just got a brand new phone and they still cut out constantly. Useless even for a walk. I can have my phone in my hand next to my ear and it still cuts out. Very disappointed, I need a good set of bluetooth headphones for walking and running."
1,"These work good, and come with many different ear pieces. Only 4 stars because I wish they were smaller. And not stick out so far."
1,"They seem to work pretty well until you start to feel some wind. They started out great but I enjoy exercising near water, and well they didn't seem to perform too great when the wind was blowing. I ignored a phone call because I knew the connection would be terrible. Plus, you hear the wind over the music. Not so sure they are noise cancelling either."
1,"I love these! They sound great, fit my ears comfortably and have great battery life so far. I do wish it had a mute button that was easily accessible, but other than that I have no complaints. I can do the mute from my phone which is no big deal. I'd definitely recommend this set for work outs or general phone use."
1,They are great if you don’t plan to move around. I use them to workout outside and i can hear the wind.
1,Christmas gift so ask after Christmas
1,Easy to use w/ iPad. Clearly states when turning on & off... no guessing.
1,"I've only been using these headphones for a week but I am very happy with them. They cancel noise very well, they fit in my 6' adult male ears comfortably and stay put during hours in the gym. The battery last a long time and it's pretty easy to set up with an iPhone. The Bluetooth range is good. I can lay my phone down and walk around to equipment a few feet away and not loose the music. The bass is a little too powerful for my taste and there doesn't seem to be a way to adjust that. I haven't taken calls on them so I can't comment on that. In the end, the reason for the 5 stars is you won't be disappointed with these earbuds for the price. I purchased a pair of Bose bluetooth earbuds for my son for Christmas and there is definitely a sound quality difference but for a pair of workout earbuds and saving $100+, these can't be beat."
1,These are awesome!!
1,"Will not pair or hold a charge, a replacement pair was sent and they only lasted a few months, they are not honoring their warranty and replacing them for the second time,"
1,best headphones hands down!!!
0,Just recieved these and tried them out.  First I found out the bluetooth will not link while they are charging.  Then when I tried them out the microphone was terrible.  People could not hear me as the sound was muffled even when in a quiet office with no other noises.  I will return them.
1,Another Christmas gift for my son. He’s 14 and loves them.
1,Sound quality
1,Good sound. Battery charges quickly. Battery lasts a long time. The microphone placement could be better.
1,I really like this pair of headphones.  I use them a lot.  I can even use them while I mow the yard.  The buds fit nicely in the ear and the ear hooks stay on and do not hurt the ear.  Very easy to adjust the volume and change songs.  The sound is awesome too. Recommended.
1,So far so good I’ll write more as time goes by and use more often
1,"Headphones worked great for a little less then a year with great sound and stayed in my ear through a whole work out. The battery life was amazing and would charge very quickly. Towards the end of the year I had a little issue charging and also one of the mesh covers on the headphone fell off. Luckily I was still covered with the warranty and the customer service was super quick and easy to talk too. Honestly the best customer service I have received from any company, they will take care of any of your problems if you ever have any, mine I feel was a rare case. I trust this company and the headphones they make, they work super well."
1,I only had to charge it once so far and I’ve had the headphones a couple weeks. Delivery was super fast which was nice and I really like the product. Definitely recommend them. And price was right.
1,"Now that I was able to have my IT Dept. remote in and load the drivers I needed, they work great with my laptop."
1,Comfortable. The case is great. wished it didn't say Senso on the side.
1,"I've been looking to buy a pair of bluetooth earphones since my last ones crapped out. After seeing all the glowing praise these received, I decided to give it a shot. This is a rundown of what I liked/disliked about them (Warning: whether or not these are common features/issues with wireless headphones, I wouldn't know since these are only the second pair I've owned)<br />Pros:<br />- Pauses videos, not just music (I'm used to buds just working on my music player)<br />- Package comes with a lot of nifty things in a nice case<br />- Clear sound (even a bit loud, be prepared to turn sound way down for first time usage)<br />- Wore them without problems, even with glasses on<br />- Sleek design, so you don't look like a fool while wearing them<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Ear hooks fit a bit loosely (not enough to be a detriment, though I do need to adjust every so often)<br />- Sometimes has problems connecting w/ laptop (I suggest deleting the file from computer then reconnecting if this problem persists)<br />- Muffles sound for non bass-heavy music or media<br /><br />All in all, I really enjoy these and hope they last longer than my old ones (less than three months). Seems like people start having problems after a month, so I'll give an update then."
1,"Although I have only used these earbuds for one day, I like the fit, the ease of use and the simplicity of pairing them with my iPhone 6.<br />They performed as expected while I was on the elliptical but while on the driving range I noticed that they frequently cut out momentarily. This is not a huge issue for me as every pair of wireless earbuds I have owned has had the same issue. I'm hoping that as time goes on this problem will work itself out."
0,"I have bought these a few times in the past.  Here is the problem.  This set I bought had ear holders that bend very easily.  You might like that, but I liked the standard fit of the old ones.  My real problem is that I have gotten more cold to products made in china.  This is no way to know if these are real products or ripoffs.  If they are real, where were they made.  Not everything needs to be made in the USA, but definitely not China.  Amazon could not care less."
0,"UPDATE: 10/25/17: Headphone on button stopped working completely entire outside case broke apart. I haven’t even had these for a year and they broke down on me. Very disappointed. UPDATE (8/17/17): I had to drop two stars down. Unfortunately it seems over time the battery life decreases. Additionally the battery life reader won't accurately calculate the remaining life span. The other issue I have found over time is that when you charge, the blue light won't come back on when it is fully charged so I have to guess when it's had enough time. This was my second pair purchased. Cannot stress how amazing these are! I purchase a lot on Amazon, but only really write reviews for products I believe are worth the time! The battery life on these still blows me away. I use them all day during work. The package they come with alone is worthwhile. These are so great I'm purchasing a second pair for my mom. If your looking for affordable Bluetooth headphones, that have a durable battery life and have the most bang for you buck. These are definitely it!"
1,These have great sound but make a lot of wind noise.  Not very nice for a walk on a windy day.
1,"Great for the price.  I use with my phone calls all day. I also use at the gym ,hot tub , steam room. They hold up good."
1,"Second pair - I lost the first pair and liked them so much, I ordered again. Love the new memory ear pieces that are like ear plugs - you squish them a little, put them in your ears, and then they expand to fill your ear canal. They are a little difficult to put on the actual headphones but worth the effort."
1,"Overall, this is a great product. The sound quality, clarity, bass, treble etcetera is great. However, I wish the loops that go over your ear were little more firm to keep it from falling out. For the most part, it stays in and on my ears, but I've seen same design with better fitting over the ear loops. It's just that the way my ears are shaped, I have to have really well designed headphones to keep them in place!<br />I will update this review with more info in future."
1,sure beats the old style plug in when bench pressing and having cords get tangled up
0,"I really like the design, alal the stuff it comes it and all. But the audio quality isn't very good. Which was a big turn off as soon as I put something on. I own an Ncredible One, which is a cheaper version of Beats, but the audio is just great. So buying this wasn't the best thing I did. I know it's a 35 dollar piece compared to 100 dollar headphone, but if like me, audio is a big deal for you, I wouldn't recommend it. Ah, the battery is also very annoying because it let's you know it's low when it's reaaaally low. So before you reach an outlet it's already dead and no more music for you."
1,"These headphones have performed better than expected for this price point.  They sound much better than any other ear buds (wireless or wireless) that I have currently.  They sync quickly and easily.  The range us excellent. The only issue I have is that if you are using them to work out, the band that connects the left and right bud tends to stick to moist skin in the back of the neck. However, I discovered a fix. If I allow the band to hang down in the front this ceases to be a problem. Overall, this was a great purchase. I got a great Bluetooth headset that functions admirably yet I won't be too distraught if they are lost or stolen as they are reasonably priced and I'll just buy another one."
1,"If you like to work out, these are a must have. They let you focus on your workout instead of fumbling with cords or ear buds."
1,"Good, thanks!"
0,Does not work
1,"These are easy to use and paired very easily. Pretty comfortable but as with most earbuds, they can hurt just a little (but I'll probably get used to it.) The sound quality isn't astounding or anything but if you just need something with a beat to keep you running, these will do the trick!"
1,Just got these and so far working great!! Great fit-did not fall out of ears while running and great sound.
1,They are great thus far. Problem I have had with others hasn't happened.
1,"These headphones are solid performers that could be absolutely perfect with a couple minor tweaks. First off, the good:<br />1. build quality is superb- they feel solid and the materials do not feel cheap.<br />2. Battery life is as promised. I use these headphones daily for about 60-90 minutes at a time and I charge the headphones once a week.<br />3. Sound quality is good.<br />4. Comfortable fit<br />5. Lightweight<br />6. Storage case and free car charger<br /><br />The needed tweaks<br />1. The lowest volume is relatively loud. If I could decrease the loudness a bit more at times these would be perfect<br />2. Sound quality is good but is a bit heavy on the mid range and lows. An equalizer might be needed to get your desired sound profile"
1,"Excellent quality sound, I never thought possible from Bluetooth headphones. Also, they are a good fit on my ear, perfect for running or working out at the gym."
1,"This is not a paid review. I am a college student who uses this practically all day: on my walk to/from/between classes, when studying, or jogging. That means I use it from 9 AM to around midnight sporadically. It lasts all day and I charge it every night. Great connectivity. This works exactly like it's supposed to and while it is not the best quality it is decent. It gets the job done and for 20$? Dirt cheap. It comes with a card holding thing to stick on your phone and a magnetic car mount as well as a case and charging table.  Best Value you can get in terms of quantity and quality."
1,"Excellent headphones, especially for the price. The sound quality is very good. Obviously it not as good as the top brands but it comes close. Have used while running in the rain and while sweating heavily with no problems.<br /><br />The headphones did stop working after a month and a half but the company shipped out a new pair very quickly, no questions asked, that are still going strong."
0,They lasted 3 months and now they will not even turn on.
0,"The battery doesn’t last long and it continually fails to connect with my iPhone, my iPad, and my wife’s iPhone. I don’t know if mine was just defective, but it wasn’t worth the money."
1,These headphones work and sound great
1,One Third of the price of Beats...Ive used these for a little over a month at the gym and they have held up very well. Bought a second pair for the Mrs. and she loves them as well.
1,"Just received the wireless headphones.  Setup was easy, the fit is great and love the sound. Would definitely order from them again."
1,My aging ears cannot distinguish between these and higher priced models. I like them very much. Comes with multiple ear pieces to fit most people. Long battery life. No complaints.
1,Great
1,"I bought these to carry in my purse, and they're great. Good sound, small size, good connection quality. We'll see how long they last, but I think they're a good value at this point."
0,one star are right I have an Apple watch and it will not pick up the Bluetooth in my wrist is down by my hip.i wonder where all the 5 stars came from
1,Works Well.  Came fully charged.  I do two workouts a day and they lasted me a week without a charge.  Comfortable.
1,"The sound volume is the most decent bluetooth I've ever owned, louder than all the previous earbuds I've had.  The bass is good but not what more can you expect from earbuds.  Hugs my ear pretty well and comfortable.  Now that being said, I don't like this cause I workout, work and train a lot.  The sound cuts in and out A LOT!  If I'm not moving from spot to spot the sound doesn't cut out, but if I walk around... then it clicks, cuts out like a scratched CD.  CD?  What's that?"
1,"Sound is just ok dog, the charge lasts pretty long though"
1,The ear buds work fine and sound fine. They are everything they are advertised to be. I’m most impressed however in the degree of customer engagement.  Seems like a good company.
1,The wire rubs against my collared shirt.. other than that they work and sound great.
1,I have had these headphones for about 6 months now and I absolutely love them. They are definitely sweatproof because I have gone through tons of headphones that have stopped working and the sound is amazing. I would not waste hundreds or even a hundred dollars on a pair of headphones when these are $30 and I am sure just as good performance wise. These stay in my ear and do not fall out during my workouts whether it cardio or lifting.
1,"I bought these for my husband, I have the beats version and I cannot tell the difference between the 2 great buy!!!!"
1,I bought these headphones in the summer of 2016. They were great for the gym and working out until this past week. The headphones stopped communicating with my phone and would not connect. I contacted SENSO support and they sent me another pair. They contacted me almost immediately after I emailed them. They were very helpful and understanding. They are a great company with great product!
1,I love these headphones they are of high quality. It's nice to not have all the wires connected to my phone. It's also great to make and receive calls through the headphones.
0,This was a pretty good product but stopped working entirely after about 2.5 months and is now outside of the return window.
0,Super bummed. The sound quality was great with these headphones. I kept them in the case and was never near water and they just stopped charging. I've had them just over two months. You get what you pay for I guess.
1,Comfortable and high quality. Has speaker built in that is NOT good for talking on the phone though.
1,"Update:  It was covered under warranty.  They are sending me a new one, because it never should have broke at the earpiece.  They assured me that their products go through a rigorous QA.  I just emailed a picture of the broken earned.  Great customer service!!<br /><br /> Worked great for 10 uses.  The ear piece that is attached to the base broke off after regular use.  It was comfortable and sweet proof worked good.  For the price I would recommend it next to beats or other more expensive wireless earbuds.  Only disappointed that the plastic broke so easily."
1,"Clear sound, comfortable in ear, and stay in place when running. easy to use buttons. The microphone either doesn't work or some apps don't recognize it but that's ok to me sense I bought it purely to listen to music while working out"
1,Thank you im planing on giving them as a Christ mas gift i might be ording some more<br /> Thank You again
1,I'm extremely happy with the sound quality and reception with the head phones. It was easy to pair with my phone. Lightweight and comfortable. I have purchased expensive headphones in the past that didn't work as well.
0,"Update from before -- now people are getting a wicked echo when I use them. These  are terrible, and of course  I'm 3 days past the return window on them. So disappointed.<br />---------<br />Mostly I'm happy with them and even forget I have them on. But twice now I  was on a conference call and others were getting echos or odd sounds. When I disconnected the headphones and turned them off, the interference sound stopped.<br /><br />I wish the charge on them lasted longer too."
0,"bad earphones, stopped working after 3 months. Don’t buy."
1,"Good sound, decent quality, nice investment. Only downside that i experience is the antenna that clips my ear, it doesnt fit right so i have to cut it out."
1,"I liked this headset. Functioned well, decent mic, comfortable and battery life good. But they only worked for 45 days. They wont even turn on now. Avoid this product as quality isnt there.<br /><br />-update-<br />Senso has replaced the defective set in a timely manner. Change from 1 to 4 stars. They have a 1 year warranty so we'll see how long this pair lasts. If i never update their working fine!"
1,I was looking around for some great earphones and I wanted one that go around the ears and BAM! I found these and I have to say they are pretty DAMN good. With everything that came with the earphones it is worth the price especially since it's on sale. I definitely recommend this to anyone for a great pair of earphones. I will be buying another pair soon.
1,The ear ?hooks are a bit large. Would make them adjustable
0,"The headphones are good but the microphone is not.<br />I was looking for a good headphone with microphone.<br />Also, there is an echo of my own voice which is repulsive.<br />Quite disappointed"
0,"Without having tried the product yet, my package did not come with the charger as stated in the description. It also took 45 minutes on the phone with Amazon for them to realize Amazon does not sell a compatible charger; therefore charger cannot be sent. Returning this item. Frustrating and guess I'll never know how the headphones work."
1,Gave this to my mom as a gift and she loves them
1,"Purchased these originally for myself, and mentioned it to a co-worker who runs, and was looking for a bluetooth that is sports appropriate with good sound quality. After trying it out and really liked it, he ended up taking it...he needed it more than I did."
0,"Stopped working on the 6th month, it was good and then it suddenly stopped charging"
1,They are the most comfortable headphones I have found! I float in my pool listening to books! The headphones have different size earbuds for comfort.
1,They are a little bulky but the product quality is great and they stay in the ear very well.
1,"They work well and are great for running. I had a technical problem with mine, the company was very helpful and answered me within the day. I would buy these again."
1,Great product and customer service
1,"These headphones are awesome! What a great value, they have terrific sound through both earpieces and really cut out the ambient noise. The battery lasts forever, I ride 2 plus hours on my bike, and I can take 5 days of walks and the battery is still strong. I like the fact that they secure around the ear and have a small cord, they stay securely in the ear no matter what exercising your doing."
0,The headphones worked trot the first 2 times and broke immediately. The sounds was great and wish They wouldn't have lasted more than 3 uses.
0,"I got these in August and after having them for only a little more than a month connecting them has become impossible. Just have to keep trying over and over - takes at least 5 minutes to connect every time. This pair has a super loud ""Connected"" and ""Disconnected"" voice for some reason - no way to turn it down or figure out why. Last, on this pair the ear hooks are so uncomfortable. Last pairs were flexible and wrapped easily around ears, until last pair became overly flexible and wouldn't stay on at all.  I missed the return cutoff by a week so now I'm out $30 because I have to get something else."
1,Durable battery and great sound
1,"I am amazed by the easy to use, sound, battery hours of use, case & accessories, and value for money of this product."
1,"I got this for my husband and he absolutely loves it! He was even more excited to see how the mic worked while receiving a call during his workout., his voice was really clear. What got me into buy this headphones was for the EXCELLENT reviews it had.. and believe me I am not disappointed at all :) I highly recommend this senso headphones :)"
1,"Good sound, comfortable, light weight"
1,"The earbuds have a tendency of slipping off of my ears, other than that , they work fine."
1,"Love the headphones ,sound great"
1,"As an ex-fitness model/trainer/competitor turned military Officer, I tend to workout a great deal. I took a chance on these wireless headphones at the suggestion of a close friend, and they did not disappoint. The battery lasts fairly long, rechargers quickly and the headphones are very resilient (extremely sweat and temperature proof). You end up paying a very low cost for an excellent product. Highly recommend."
1,"I do like them, they are a much more affordable alternative to the Beats but they have room for improvement. For almost $40 they aren’t bad at all. My biggest complaint is the calling feature, whenever I call someone they can’t hear me and I’m on the phone A LOT. They could also use an eq feature too, I looked in the manual for anything pertaining to the audio and found nothing...so I’m giving them 3 stars."
1,Love the included carry case!  They fit nicely and have good sound quality.
1,"Buy them , nice nice nice earphones , plenty of base nice sound . Won't iratate ears 😀"
1,"Great sound. Works without problems. Great price. Many extras come with headphones: Nice case, etc... Highly recommended."
1,"I have always wanted to buy beats but never wanted to spend the $200. I read the reviews on these and purchased and absolutely love them! Great sound quality, battery life lasts forever and easy to use. I have little ears and they fit well. Definitely recommend!"
1,Big sound and big sound and stays in your ear when you are working out. Can't recommend more!
1,These Headphones work great!
1,Comfortable to wear and the battery can generally make it through my work day.
1,Great. as described
1,Got these for my dad while he drives his tractor and mows for hours at a time. He needed something to listen to his ACDC with and still be able to answer calls from my mom. He loves them!
1,I got a set of Beats wireless buds but they stopped working after 18 months. Got these as a replacement. Have had no regrets.
1,"One week. So far so good. If they remain good, rating will go up."
1,"I wanted headphones for streaming and playing music. I tried regular earphones but no matter how cushioned they are they begin to hurt my ears within an hour. Didn't realize I could buy wireless earbuds, but then I found these. The price was right so I bought them and glad I did. The sound is very good, the distance is great (I can go anywhere in the house and still hear what I'm listening to) and they last a long time. They are very comfortable, there are several options to choose from to fit my ears comfortably. They also paired easily and charged quickly. Everything can be stored in the carry case. I definitely would purchase these again."
1,Work great
1,"It's a great product, easy to use, highly recommend!"
1,I have tried a lot of headphones for running and these are excellent.  They stay in place and sound great.  I highly recommend them!
1,"Fantastic sound from these earphones! Easy setup and they stay comfortably in my ears. I can’t speak on the longevity of the unit or its battery life yet, but it would be great to be able to tell what percentage of battery life is left between charging. I’m pleased with my purchase and hope to have them for a long time."
1,"I was a little nervous about buying my Senso headphones. I had never heard of the company, but the reviews were very positive. It took about a week before I pulled the trigger on the purchase, and I'm glad I did. They sound like much more expensive units then they are. Great sound quality, good highs and lows. Very balanced sound. Perfect for someone on a budget who still wants to enjoy their music. To make it even better, they charge fast, last long, and are very comfortable to wear for hours on end. I will definitely recommend them to anyone looking for good Bluetooth headphones."
0,"The experience with these headphone isn't pleasant, the sound volume was low and the headphone won't stay in. After a week or so the left side of the head phone went dead on me."
1,"As I contractor, I have been in desperate need of a pair of headphones with a mic for long time. The noise cancellation while performing tasks on the job is impeccable. Although my ears are a bit too small, Senso has a new and improved version on its way. Thank you Senso!"
0,Staticy and unclear when listening to music or would just stop working
1,"They're very comfortable and they stay in place during vigorous activity - even when drenched in sweat. The bluetooth range is great and the controls are intuitive.<br /><br />The one and only problem (and it's a big one) - the frequency response is definitely not flat (at least to my ears). Way, way, way too much bass - lacking clarity in the mids and treble - whatever, they still sound better than any other earbuds I've owned.<br /><br />Just don't expect them to match quality over-ear headphones (as in Sennheiser or Ars Technica NOT that Beats garbage).<br /><br />EDIT: The first pair of these that I wrote the above review for suddenly stopped working, and the company sent me a new pair within 2 days of making a warranty claim with no hassles."
1,"Apparently I have small ears, as the over-the-ear loop keeps falling off.  This is not a matter of the size of the ear bud.  I bought a second pair of these headphones because I adored the pair I bought a few years ago (and recently lost).  But for the too-large ear loops, these are great."
1,"The headphones are exactly what I expected.  They arrived when stated, in 2 days and are very user friendly.  The sound quality is fabulous and the extra ear pieces fit my small ears perfectly.  I highly recommend this product and the Senso brand.  5 stars!!"
0,"These lasted for two years of very light use. The company offered me a 5 percent discount to repurchase them. Why would I want to do that?  They said, these things happen sometimes"
1,"My only complaint is that they feel just a little uncomfortable at first, but you get used to them. I got used to them within the first day but it would be nice if they could make the actual bud more comfy, it's a little hard and feels bulky in the ear. Having said that, the sound quality of these are OUTSTANDING, especially for the price. They are my new favorite headphones, The bass is very robust but in a way that does not  ruin the other sounds. I am very glad with my purchase. I would highly recommend this product for someone in the market for wireless headphones with strong bass ."
0,"I guess need to forget this technology because I cant get it right. This is my third different set of wireless headphones and the most workouts I got out of any was this set 12...ran Saturday worked great, charged them and was going to use Sunday they wouldn't  turn on. So strike three I'm out!<br /><br />Danny"
1,My wife bought this headphone but hardly used it. I was looking for a headphone for myself and started using it since last couple of months. The sound quality is okay.  I won't say it plays best quality sound but reasonably good considering the price. The material quality is also solid. They also gave couple of extra buds. I had no issues with it until I used it on an overnight flight from kansas to anchorage. It has a blue light that keeps flickering ever since I play it and it was so annoying that I stopped using it on flight. It was a nuisance to the persons sitting next to me. The blue flickering light was really annoying and I guess it is not good for using in a dark environment or in a flight. Next time i will put a black tape on it if I don't buy a new one.
1,"Just bought 2 sets of Senso BT wireless ear buds....was a little skeptical at first but I must say im very impressed , so much so that the JVC I bought from Best Buy are going back also returned a set of Skull Kandy and Sony's. Mic is awesome, pairing ability was quick and easy, and sound is great too.  OTERO1 TUCSON!"
1,Loved it!  Just what I wanted!
1,"These things are awesome!  I can't figure out why people would spend hundreds of dollars on wireless headphones when you can get these.  They hold a charge forever, the sound is solid (maybe not for audiophiles, but just fine while I work out) with great volume, and the bluetooth syncs perfectly.  I love these things!!!!  And they're so affordable!!!"
1,Got the wireless headphones and they paired very quickly. But  the left head phone is not working. Disappointed. Will be returning.
0,They worked well for just over a month. The Power button got stuck down and now they won't do a thing.
1,I'm always hit and miss with earbuds because usually they get uncomfortable. These are not only comfortable but the sound quality is excellent.
1,These earbuds have quality sound. The volume goes really high and they stay snug in my ears when I run. Can't beat the price! Only negative is that the power button is easily turned on while it's in the case.
0,Product never worked. All the operating buttons too small to be usable.<br />Don't buy!
1,"It's not as I expected, they stay on my ears which is great because my ears are really small, but if you're moving at high speeds (biking or running on a windy day) you can hear it through the headphones. Not exactly what I was hoping for, but they work as bluetooth headphones."
0,This product works great with iphone and macbooks but does NOT pair with the apple watch.  i had purchased them so i could go on runs without carrying my iphone - - just using the watch - - however since it won't pair with the watch it useless for that task.  very disappointed in this as they work great on phone and mac.
1,"Great headphones for the price tag. Nothing to complain about it. It can simultaneously connect to several devices at once.  Most of the time, I was able to switch from my iPhone and iPad without needing to do any work. WHen it did swith, I just turned off the bluetooth from one of the devices. All and all it was great!"
0,"I love the high volume, specially when I'm running now the problem is the adjustable earpieces, its so weak, it keeps falling. I have to keep stopping my cardio session to adjust them back to my ears.<br />I'm not sure about the noise cancellation because my family always complains the noises and I hear it as well."
1,Husband and kids loves them.<br />I couldn't believe how many things come with it.<br />I will be ordering 2 more<br />I bought 6 total and my husband and kids are very happy with them
1,Purchased these with some hesitation based on rating and price. More than exceeded my expectations and best pair of headphones I've owned yet. Except for a pair of beats I had a few years ago. Love them and 10/10 would buy again.
1,"I bought a blue pair of these when they went on sale in the amazon day deals almost 3 years ago. I’ve used them regularly through out the years for working out at the gym, running, and cleaning around the house! For the price they are awesome! My blue pair have finally given out so today I am purchasing my second pair but in red! Hopefully there is some consistency in the making of this product!"
0,didn't like them.  the in-ear piece struggles with suction and crackling.  slips out frequently while exercising.  returned.
1,Wanted a wireless headset to connect to my desktop. My Dell Alien has bluetooth capability so I purchased the SENSO bluetooth headphones. Very easy to pair up and now listen to everything on the headphones and also talk on TeamSpeak. Great sound quality and affordable.
1,Use these all the time - during water aerobics and strength exercising these are my go to headphones - very comfortable and reliable!!
1,My wife bought these and I accidentally washed them with her jacket.  They still work!
1,"Lightweight, soft and great sound. Thanks, SENSO!!"
1,"The sound quality is perfect as well as noise cancellation. Battery life is on average also. The only concern when using this product is depending on size of ears. Smaller ears have a hard time fixing it. Because of the design of the product itself, it makes it harder to enjoy the music since it usually falls off my ears."
1,"I can't believe how great these earbuds are for the price. They are light weight, comfortable & have a great sound. They also come with all of the accessories that the high dollar ones have. I am completely satisfied & I highly recommend them."
1,Great ear buds!
1,Bought as a gift & got rave reviews!
1,"The headphones are a comfortable fit and the battery life is decent. Sound quality: The bass is awesome, however, towards the high frequency it becomes less crisp. Okay for listening during workout but not exactly for an audiophile like me."
1,"Fantastic product.  Sounds every bit as good as more expensive brands.  Comes complete with charging cords, replacement earbuds and in a nice little travel case."
1,Bought these after reading all the amazing reviews. I have to agree with everyone else. These are great! They come with a bunch of different bud sizes so you can find the ones that fit your ears best. They are very comfortable to wear and last pretty much all day at work. Bought these to use with my new iPhone X since the aux port is gone and it paired right away with my phone so it is definitely Apple friendly. Sound quality is pretty good as well. I use it mostly for movie watching and it has been great so far.
1,Service from Tekatron was great and the headphones arrived as scheduled. The sound quality of the headphones is just OK. I purchased these because a pair of Altec Lansing I had stopped working. The Altec headhones were less expensive than these but the sound quality was much better. These are not horrible but are lacking the deep bass range sounds.
1,"I wanted some Bluetooth headphones and knew these were the headphones requested by my 17 year old niece as a Christmas gift so how could I go wrong by copying?!  Well she was right. These headphones were simple to connect via Bluetooth, comfortable to wear, and the sound is phenomenal. Very happy with this purchase!!"
1,It's hard to believe that these headphones can be this light and comfortable and still produce the high quality sound. The built-in microphone is also very clear.
1,"These are rock solid and packed with power. they stay in place well with moderate activity. even though not what i intended them for, I found out they work really well for phone calls even in my car. Super performance for a great price."
1,Worked perefectly right out of the box.
0,Earpiece broke first time I used them.
1,"These were working perfectly when I got them. Then something happened, and they were reconnecting every minute or two. When I called Invotech, Bill very patiently walked me through the reset process and made sure that everything was working well afterwards. Since then I have not had any repairing issues. In retrospect I assume Apple must've had  an update to their software, and that was why I had problems. I'm using an Apple iPhone 7+. Anyway, thank you Bill for your patience, and your help."
0,"Overall Not happy about this product. I always read reviews about products before making a purchase, which is what I did before deciding on this headphone. I was impressed after reading and checking out a few videos on this model. Surprised to find that this headset failed in operation less than a year of use. Wont hold a charge. Connects to phone only to abruptly power off after a few minutes. Tried charging them again to find the blue light which indicates full charge, but again results in repeated abrupt shutdowns. Needless to say this was either a faulty item or this headset is not a viable option for someone who plans to use this headphones on a regular basis."
1,I just received my new Senso headphones.  The sound quality is amazing and they went above and beyond regarding the accessories.  Great purchase that I would highly recommend!
1,FANTASTIC
1,"These have performed very well for me.  I primarily use them to connect to my iPhone 6S and listen to podcasts while I'm exercising.  The ear cushions are comfortable, though they do tend to slip out when I start getting sweaty, but the ear loops keep them from falling.<br /><br />Regarding sound quality, they are perfectly fine for podcasts.  When I try to listen to music, I find the sound weighted too heavily to the bass end, but it's acceptable"
1,Excelent Headphones!! Great Sound
1,"Great fit, for me anyways, sound is good, but lacks bass a bit.  Kind of expect that from earbuds though.  Have paired flawlessly with all my devices.  Will be using them a lot soon for bike riding and working out.  Hoping the battery life is at least what is advertised."
1,Great earbuds. Perfect for the gym. Good quality.
1,"Great design, good noise blocking, definitely water resistant, easy to put on and use; they stay put."
1,I got them to use at the gym and they are perfect! Easy to set up. Comfy. Sound great!
1,"UPDATE 2: The replacement pair came in the mail and I have been using them for about a week.  So far I am noticing a marked improvement over my original pair with respect to reception.  Bad reception still occurs occasionally, though seemingly only when I have the transmitter (my phone) deep in my jeans pocket + I am walking + I put something else in the same pocket over/next to the phone (like my hand or wallet for example).  Other than that very specific situation, reception has been much improved.  I can even leave my phone on the counter in one room and still get reception in an adjacent room.  I am upgrading to 4.5 stars, but I will round that up to 5 stars because I'm such a nice guy (and Amazon doesn't allow half stars).<br /><br />UPDATE: Customer service responded almost immediately regarding my email customer service request.  They suggested a few things to try and when those didn't work they asked for my address to send me a replacement.  Customer service has been excellent so far.  I will update my review upon receiving and testing the replacement pair.<br /><br />I got these about 2 months prior to posting this review and as of this afternoon they are dead.  A few days ago sound in the left ear started cutting out.  Now the set won't even turn on.  I will contact SENSO about this.  Hopefully they replace them or refund me or something.  In the meantime, please see my review below regarding the headphones before they broke completely.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Decent sound quality for the price.  A little heavy on the base for podcasts (spoken word sounds a bit &#34;muddy&#34;), but they sounded pretty good for music.<br /><br />Good battery life (I rarely had to charge more than once every couple days despite using 2-5 hours per day).<br /><br />Comfortable and stayed on my ears.<br /><br />Easy to use (intuitive and simple buttons and an easy to access charging port)<br /><br />Packaging, accessories, and build quality all appear and feel excellent (like that of higher end headphones.)<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Bluetooth reception was inconsistent.  At times the reception would work fine, at other times I would need to take the phone out of my shirt pocket and hold it near my right earbud just to make sure the reception wouldn't cut out.  As you can imagine, it's pretty annoying to have to take your phone out of your cotton shirt pocket and hold it directly next to your earbud just to avoid cut out.  All I want to do is walk around and listen to my headphones without cutout!!!!<br /><br />The headset gives a warning when the battery is low by having a voice say &#34;battery low&#34; in your ear.  It seems helpful, but the voice interrupts whatever you are listening to every 1 or 2 minutes to remind you that your battery is low.  I'd rather just listen until the battery is dead without that irritating and unnecessary reminder.  Not a deal breaker though as you can just stop listening once you hear the first warning and consider the battery dead.  You would only be able to squeeze another 5-10 minutes of listening from the headset once the warnings start anyways.<br /><br />The charging light shines through a little pinhole that you can't really see unless you are staring at it from the correct angle.  Not a big deal, but it is annoying to have to right up to the headphones in order to tell if they are finished charging.  I would have preferred a light visible from further away.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />Given all the positive reviews and the quality look and feel of the headset, I'm guessing I may have been unlucky and received a defective pair.  Hopefully SENSO's customer service is good and I can try another pair before calling it quits on this brand."
1,"Great product for the price.  I have used these for months now and they just keep going strong. No thought they’d be throw-away garbage, but pleasantly surprised."
1,Nice
1,Great buy!!! Wonderful
1,For the price it is definitely worth it. Good quality and GREAT battery life. Lasts about 6-7hours if active music listening. However I used it only for a few month so it’s relatively new.
0,"These worked fine for about 5 mo and now they just shut off for no reason.  After doing the full charge multiple times,re-sync to phone, etc, I am giving up on this pair.  If you go ahead and buy, get the extended warranty because you will need it with these supposedly “waterproof” and “rugged” earplugs"
1,"If you're not rich, these are nice and give reasonable sound quality. If its between buying some Bose or other expensive ones off craigslist or offer up, I'd go with these and avoid the risk of getting a counterfeit."
0,"Fairly disappointed in these. I have problems keeping a good connection when I put my phone in either front or back pocket. And I can't get very far from the Bluetooth source before losing connection. I had really cheap set that I got for $14.00 at OfficeMax a few years, they didn't make it through the washing machine but they would sure keep a connection. I could 75 feet or so across the gym and still have clear music with those. I wouldn't say these are a total waste but I would search around. Won't buy these again when they get washed."
1,Super fast shipping and good quality wireless headphones
1,"Bought the for working out. I haven't gotten them wet yet, but my initial impression is good. I have smaller ear ways, so having bud size options is nice.  The sound is very good and definitely good enough for working out.<br />Bluetooth pairing was flawless and making and receiving calls while listening to music worked with a hitch.<br />I'll post an update after I get them wet."
0,Charger plug in did not fit the headphones.
1,Great product. Shipped fast with prime. Great sound. Great price. Easy to use.
0,"At first I thought it was just one pair that happened to get wet or something, so of course I bough a second pair. With in two months of using it the second pair also stopped working. Out of the blue will not charge will not turn on its crazy. This company should be banned."
1,"Can't get the volume low enough to be comfortable in quiet environments or in bed--with both phone and headset controls on lowest without actual muting, they're stll not quiet.  Otherwise they're quite nice."
0,"It's not good for running. You will hear wind sounds.  When it's connected, you can hear di di di sound, that sound may damage you ear.  Don't buy it."
1,"Great product, work as described!"
1,Use’em for my run in the morning. They work fine & seem to have long-lasting battery life
1,I ordered the headphones and they arrived in perfect time before my important virtual meetings. The sound is clear and sounds great when I play my music nice and loud.<br /><br />Monique
1,These have some of the best headphones I've had yet and you can't beat the price.
1,Good one
1,Great sound and connectivity but it takes too long to switch songs forward/backward.
1,The wife tried mine and loved them so we just ordered our second pair of these and so far they are working great. They connect really fast and reliably compaired to other headphones I've had in the past. The sound quality is very good and the bass is pretty strong.<br />Very happy with this product.
1,"I had the old version and it last me for about 5 months for the price sound quality and materials they were great after that one earbud stopped working so I bought another one but it was different from the previous one POS the charging button is not so har to open , the sound button is very responsive . Cons the thing that goes around your ear now is like a type of wire and is hard to ajuste, and the on off button doesn’t click no more like if it is stuck (but I still can use it , but one day all of the sudden they don’t turn on)"
1,"Great headphone and good quality!<br /><br />Second comment, I had to send it back as it hurts me because I am wearing a glass. I don't recommend for those who are wearing glasses."
1,"Personally loves these, they're loud and bass is perfect for me. When I have things paused I can hear people just fine and do not need to take them out of my ears to have a conversation. I got these on 12-20-17 and didn't need to charge them until 12-25-17 with 5-6 hours a day continuous use, that's pretty dang impressive. I'll update after a month of use to see how they stand up in the Pacific Northwest"
1,These earbuds sound great. For the price they are amazing.
1,They were kind of big for my ear... i am a jogger and had to put them back in place a few times.  I would say the volume is not as loud.
0,"These are ok headphones for the price. Was skeptical at first, but I gave them a chance. The only thing to keep in mind is that the mic seems to pick up a lot of different noises if you are in a busy area so I wouldn’t purchase this if talking on the phone is it’s main purpose (They can't hear you). I would purchase this again if there are major mic improvements.<br />Sound quality so ok, but needs major improvements on the noise cancellation.<br />I could've gotten a defective product as well."
1,Very solid headphones.  Happy with purchase.
1,"Got them as a gift for my boyfriend, and he says they are perfect, sound great and are very comfortable. It's also awesome that they come with so many extra accessories. Awesome value!"
1,"Very good overall. The sound quality is as expected for this price range: A bit washed out but definitely decent. Do not purchase these if you think you are going to get a great audio experience, but rather if you want something that's really good for around $30-$40.<br /><br />The reason why I have to rate it a 3 star and not higher is that the left earbud makes a static noise when you start playing music. It's audible until you  turn the volume up higher but if you do not like to listen to loud music then you constantly hear a sort of buzz. I do not know if it just mine, but that issue has been present since I purchased it. It did not really get worse, but it did not get better either.<br /><br />I would recommend these if you want a good, bluetooth earbud set for an affordable price."
1,Bought these as a gift and my brother loves them.
1,"It was great for 4 months and then multifunction button stopped responding. Since there is 1 year warranty, reached out to support and they have processed replacement for it. Overall, the sound quality."
1,Sounds perfect and all the package is very nice!
1,"Great sound and seems durable. Mic not so good. Great for use when working out, but not very good for phone calls. A bit uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time, or maybe I just have small ears."
1,"Sound quality is excellent. Perfect for the gym. Had an issue 11.5 months into the one year warranty, Tekatron replaced them immediately without question."
0,"These headphones seemed like pretty good quality at first with what you get. Water resistance, wireless, a case. What could possibly go wrong? A LOT! These headphones were great until the wire started to malfunction. When I'd turn my head to the side a little, the sound would cut out in the left ear. I'm assuming there was some sort of short that occurred because when the wire would twist, in a perfectly normal way, the left headphone would lose connection. I dealt with this, but it got even worse. One day, after just having the headphones in my pocket, they just STOPPED WORKING! Out of the blue! This wasn't a low battery, but hoping it was I went to charge the headphones and this didn't work. Now my headphones just don't work.<br />Moral of the story is this, you get what you pay for. Most headphones in the market with these qualities are much more expensive. That is what made this seem like a good value, and maybe my model was just a bad one. I just hope you take my story into consideration when considering purchasing this product. For me, this was NOT worth the savings (as the product broke after 30 days to the purchase date). I should have researched more and just gotten a more expensive, yet well-recommended pair."
1,"I could not believe that the product could be so reasonably priced, compared to others that I have used in the past.  I believed the reviews and purchased and could not be happier with them."
1,Comfortable to wear and good sound quality. I would recommend these wireless headphones for an active lifestyle.
1,Really good price-quality ratio. Will by again if I lose these or something.
1,Love these headphones!! They are easy to work and the sound is nice
1,"Good order and delivery, nice price, thanks"
1,These headphones are great and the sound quality is impressive for a relatively inexpensive pair. The fact that they're cordless is a plus.
1,Great headphones!  Great value!
1,Earbuds sound everything is great
1,"I admit I started with reasonable expectations for the SENSO Bluetooth Headphones when I purchased them. I had seen more expensive headphones, but I liked the price point for my first set of wireless ones. When I got them, I was surprised by their sound and how long they last on a charge. I am pleased with their performance as I use them for 3-4 hours a day, and they go almost 3 days on one charge. I paired them with my phone, my PC, and a media streamer with no problems. Whether it was rock and roll or a movie, they worked great.<br /><br />I like the simplified controls on the headphones. They have a small indicator to show their status (very useful), a power button and a volume rocker. I will be interested to see how durable they are for daily use.<br /><br />I would definitely buy them again."
0,Broke after 1 month
1,"These headphones are absolutely amazing. I have had them for a few months now and they still work great. I work outdoors in all types of weather; between extreme heat in direct sunshine, the pouring down rain and everything in between these headphones have held up perfectly and I haven't had any kind of issues with them."
1,Good cheap Bluetooth head set.  Good for 18 months easily every day 9 hours a day six days a week. I charged it almost nightly.
1,Very big fan of the headphones. The sound was solid. only negative would be the part that goes around your ear is not ver strong and doesn't hold onto ear.
1,Very comfortable and sound great.  Its a bargain for 30 bucks!
0,They do not pair well with my LG G4. They break up all the time.
0,"Very good sound, good easy controls, great price, but Bluetooth connection is not reliable at all and constant interruptions during playback makes this item unusable. I guess you get what you paid for. Would not recommend to anyone. Better invest more and get a solid reliable product."
1,These headphones are awesome!  Bought them for riding on my Peloton and they synced up immediately without issue.  The sound quality is great and they stayed on through the my entire workout - no more fighting with earbuds that fall out.  Great purchase!
1,"Great sound, easy pairing"
1,"Got it on time. Perfect package. Up to now, I like them very much. For me they are very comfortable and feel secure. I will test them and update in the future."
1,Excellent product.  Highly recommend.  Comfortable and easy to operate.
1,Excellent headphones. Easy to use.
1,NO LIE! Great Headphones..for the price Whaaaat! Definitely on par with high end earbuds. Just make sure you have a secure and snug fit and enjoy.
0,"Honestly, I'm really disappointed. I read the reviews and was really hoping this was be a great product at a great price. It has broken after one use. At first I though the battery was just dead, but after charging it for a full day, it still is not working and not responding. I would recommend just splurging and spending a little extra to get a pair of better quality headphones."
0,"Used very minimally to listen to podcasts, otherwise kept in their case. After only a few short months there is no sound out of one ear. I liked them while they lasted, sound was good and they fit comfortably, but essentially they are junk."
1,Ok
1,"My daily exercise regimen involves a lot of moving around and sweat outdoors. I was really struggling to find / sustain headsets that would meet these demands. This review is for my initial first experience with my new Senso headsets:<br />- Phenomenal packaging and accessories<br />- Easy to set up and use<br />- Ran 5 miles + 10 mile trail riding with headsets going the whole time ; earbuds comfy, Bluetooth connection synchronized; lightweight ; fits snug with my bike helmet; freedom with run ; battery life good.<br /><br />Next test is the durability -- so far super satisfied !"
1,Amazing.Better than beats
0,Broke after a month of minimal use. I'm extremely disappointed in the durability. I am now shopping for a replacement
1,I accidentally left mine in water overnight and they still were coming on over after a year of having them. After a day or so they work perfectly fine. I'm still using them today.
1,easy to use.. good stuff
0,hard to fit on the ear.
1,Very good product for the price. Very easy to connect and good quility! Will probably purchase a second pair as a gift!
1,"I bought these on deployment and the definitely made the second half of deployment better.  I would even wear them to sleep because they block out SO much outside noise it allowed me to sleep in a noisy berthing (loud people, gun fire, needle guns, etc.).  My wife is ALWAYS trying to use them or take them from me because they have such rich sound."
0,"Can't say I understand some of the glowing reviews about the sound quality of these buds.  While the bass is pronounced I didn't get hardly any of the mid or high tones.  All songs have a muffled sound, no clarity at all.  I tried all the different ear buds but they all sounded the same.  I returned these the next day."
1,Works well just wish they stayed in better.  I think I need to try the smaller ear cushions.
1,"Great ear buds, use them for running and reading"
1,"Decent connection and battery life for the gym. Good selection of ear pieces including a compressible foam pair. Sound is not great - not tinny, but a little muted. Works well for phone calls. Water resistance seems to be intact. Doesn't move during exercise once the ear pieces are put in properly. Like the fact that the cord between modules is flattened and does not incorporate the mic so it doesn't bounce around like my other one."
1,The sound quality is great for the price.
1,Product received on time and syncs perfectly with my phone. Everything is as I expect it to be.
1,"Nice headphones. Good charge time, fit, and sound. No problem pairing to my i7. Be sure to play with your equalizer settings to maximize their potential."
1,&#34;These sound amazing - so easy to pair. I use a new Galaxy S8+ love them.&#34;
1,"&#34; I've used OEM Samsung earphones /w mic that I use at work, but I cannot express how happy I am with these headphones. They do last about 8 hours of extended use, and they split on very comfortably. THANK YOU GUYS FOR YOUR Commitment to customer service. Note: The Volume never has to go beyond a quarter of the volume. I made that mistake and realized how loud these babies can actually be!!! LOUD!!&#34;"
1,"i got these to use while doing yoga. i wanted earbuds that would stay comfortably and securely in my ears while doing twists, bends and, of course, down dog. these are perfect! they stay put and sound great. more bass than i expected, which is wonderful. i’ve also listened to a bit of music through them and they exceeded my expectations. would recommend!"
1,Bought these for my wife.she loves them! Highly recommended
1,"I absolutely love these headphones. They are easy to use, the sound is darn good (it needed some tweaking through the EQ on my phone), and the customer service was great.<br />I had an issue with the first pair I received. A hard reset would not cure the problem. The company stood behind the guarantee. I returned the defective pair, and I was got a new pair. The new pair worked perfectly, and I have had no problems. I have been using them for over a month now. They are a similar quality to more expensive headphone. I'd buy these again."
0,"The sound is fine (not great, but fine), however the quality of the product itself is very very poor. In the one year that I've had these, I have had to order replacements 4 times...the warranty is now up so, that's the end of my run with senso. I can say that their customer service was prompt, and they always sent out replacements without question when my headphones would break. that's worth two stars for sure. i definitely would not reccommend these headphones though"
1,"My headphones worked and sounded great for almost a year while i ran daily on a treadmill, Finally some of the sweat must have penetrated and they failed to take a charge, i contacted the seller and got great results with absolutely no runaround.... they are sending me a new pair after 11 months of hard use ! Good product, great seller"
1,"UPDATE: Thanks to a quick response from Cathy at Senso customer support, I tried changing the ear tip to use the large one and it has greatly reduced the wind noise as it gave me a better fit (though not eliminated 100% but I guess that's expected of any in-ear headphone. Updating the review to 4 stars and ordering another on for my wife :)<br /><br />This is my first and only &#34;noise canceling&#34; Bluetooth headset so I have nothing else to compare this with. But here is what I feel after using it for a couple of months:<br />The good: The sound quality and the build quality is pretty good for the price. I am not an audiophile so didn't wanna spend big bucks on a headset and this one just serves the purpose.<br />The bad: you can't wear it for a long duration without getting the feeling to take it out. Also the cable length is kinda small for me and I keep having to adjust it.<br />The ugly: forget about using it outdoors while you are running/cycling or even walking in a windy area. It amplifies the wind noise instead of canceling it. Almost entirely useless as a &#34;sports&#34; headset. It does work perfectly in the gym though.<br />Recommendation: if you are looking for a headset you could use on your outdoor runs, this is not the one for you. Otherwise it's a great value for money"
1,"I bought these Bluetooth headphones after I read the favorable reviews online.  I use them to listen to audiobooks and music while I'm walking the dog and they work beautifully!  They come with two sizes of ear buds and since I have small ear canals, the smaller ones fit perfectly.  They are comfortable and when fitted properly in and on my ears, they block out most of the background noise.  I highly recommend them."
1,"Good sound quality and fit well. We're too big and bulky for my taste, and lasted less then 4 hours on one charge. Which was far less then advertised, would be good for working out. If you remember to charge them often"
1,Easily paired with my i-phone. Fit comfortably in my ears. The sound was clear and crisp with plenty of bass. The phone answering option was pretty nice as well
1,These are hands down the best headphones on the market. This is my second pair over the past 3 years. The first pair I own still works perfectly. I just wanted a second pair. I run 24 hour races and the headphones endure extreme conditions. I even washed them in the washing machine and they still work perfectly.
1,Controls easy to operate and the sound is very good.
1,I had a pair of these and they worked great.  Bought a second one cause a friend loved them too and I gave her my original set.  The new set worked for a couple of weeks then the Bluetooth quit working.  Gonna return and reorder hopefully just got a bad one.  Great sound and volume.
0,This is my second pair of these headphones and still I am having problems with the left earbud and some connectivity issues. I really did like them but quickly they began to show signs of issues. Its possible I just got some defective ones. the sound quality on these things however is very good I would give 5 stars but my pair was no good.
1,"I bought these headphones to replace the stock apple EarPods because I fly a lot for work and there was too much noise so I couldn't enjoy music or movies. These earphones cancel all that out while giving crisp sound with decent bass. I didn't want to spend the $100-$200+ for earphones and I'm glad I came across these. Even have a coworker who has beats and couldn't believe how good these sound for the price, even admitting they sound just as good at times as the beats. I've also had no problems with the mic using phone calls, everyone hears me clearly and I can hear them just as clear also. Highly recommend a set of these."
1,Great product and company
1,"So far, everything is working well, still need to jog with it"
1,These keep a charge very nicely.  They cancel noise very effectively.
1,This bluetooth headphone works very well for me.  I use it for treadmill running and it can be held on the ears without falling down during running.  I think it's well designed and has great sound quality.  I have old one of different brand but it fell down often from my ears during running.  Thanks for great product.
1,Great durable headphones. Put them through the wash at least 4 times with them still usable! Sound isn't awful and they cancel out majority of background noise.
0,"Not good. I have had these for a month and now it has trouble connecting with anything. I hold the power button and the &#34;Power on&#34; notification doesn't even sound. I hold it again and it shuts off, took me about 30 minutes just to get them to connect. I have had a much better pair before this that lasted for 6 months.<br /><br />Bad buy"
1,"I don't EVER write reviews unless I'm 100% impressed and I just have to say these are hands down the best headphones I've come across so far. I am a gym junkie so I go through my headsets quick and purchasing $$$ headphones is not something I look forward to lol. So I did my fair share of research and came across these. I read the specs, the reviews and I was hooked. NOW I SEE WHY. Yo, I am stoked! Can't wait to use them at the gym. Clean, clear sound, no fuzz, bass is just the right amount for me. Wear is comfortable, and material is soft. I am actually wearing them right now listening to Diplo all while getting the goosebumps! Lol I love music so hearing it this clear.. just awesome. GOOD JOB SENSO, several points to you, you have earned a new fan. Time for you to become one, you will not regret it!"
1,"Wow! What a surprise. These are a major upgrade to my last headphone. Sound, battery life, and ear fit are all outstanding."
0,"After two months of owning them, I keep having problems.  These don't connect well with my device.  Even within just a few feet (from my pants pocket to my head), the connection doesn't work well.  I would return but it's too late for that."
1,Easy Sync and loud and clear Sound..
1,Headphones stopped working but customer service is being attentive.
1,"Awesome, comfortable, and easy to use."
1,These are the best Bluetooth earbuds that I have ever owned. The sound is amazing and they don't fall out when I'm running
1,"Incredible Bluetooth headphones - so very impressive.  The ease of operation (excellent user instructions in a durable booklet for safe-keeping) is tops, the sound quality is symphonic, the charging and Apple-compatible charger cables are appreciated, the supply of spare ear bud covers, the Senso carrying case ... well, the list just goes on and on.  Senso headphones are remarkably designed and are an incredible value.  I own a pair of Beats (non-Bluetooth) and Senso's sound quality is superior.  The comfort of the ear pieces is comfortable and not being wired into a laptop or device is heaven.  Also noteworthy is the follow-up email from Senso's co-founder, inviting user feedback and assuring service should anything go awry with the headphones in the future.  I very much doubt I will need to be in contact - Senso has got this wired ... er ... wireless!  Senso headphones are superb!"
1,"So far, I have really enjoyed these headphones. The audio is extremely clear and they are very lightweight."
1,"nice product, works well.  light and comfortable.<br /><br />I like the dual configuration charging cord (where can i buy more of those?)"
1,I am very satisfied with my head phones. They perform as and better than I thought. Thanks
1,This is probably the best bluetooth headphones. Very lucky to have made a purchase after several trial and error from different brand.
1,"Originally I had bought a lightning connector adaptor to use my earbuds with my iPhone XR, during workouts at the gym the cord was just a hassle and I decided I would look into some inexpensive wireless blue tooth headphone options. Did not want to invest a crazy amount for what were going to be basically gym wear and found the SENSO's got good ratings and for the price $20.00 bucks I took a chance. I got the red one's and they have very good sound, great battery life and easy to use buttons to control volume, skip songs and have been a pleasant surprise and I recommend these for a alternative to the higher priced ones if your looking for something for the gym that won't fall out, hold in place on the tread mill or while lifting these won't let you down."
0,"Wind noise when I run, and my ear holes are not round.  They sound and work fine, but they don't stay put unless I jam them into my ear."
0,I don't like how they fit on my ears and I would like to return them. They connect well with my IPhone but I feel like my ears are too small for the straps
1,Have smaller ears and they fit great
0,"I purchase Jan 14 of this year. We Are in late April, and they just stopped working. I paid around $33. I use then 4 times a week, one hour a day. Suddenly it stoped working. what a waste of money. Plus if you sweat too much they would start to sly off.....Not worth the price...."
1,I like the Bluetooth because it easy to communicate and. The sound is clear while u listen to  music.
1,"I’m really enjoying these headphones. Shipped quickly, everything arrived as ordered, and they work perfectly. They include different sized earbuds for comfort and have a long and short charging cable, which I find very convenient. They’re easy to use and I’d definitely recommend them"
1,"The headphone's is really good, the sound is in very high quality ( compare to other headphones in this price ).<br />Bluetooth is connect fast and easily, and can connect from 1-3m, that is really nice !<br />The box came with some nice accessories (like pocket stick, magnet for car, case and more..)<br />After using for 1 week, order 1+ to my GF, seem's she wan't mean !"
1,"Although they lasted 2 years while my husband was wearing them he felt a pop in his ear, the battery pack flew out of the earbud. Luckily,  not injured."
1,"My husband reports that these work great.<br />He uses them all day long, so he can listen to his podcasts."
1,"Pros:<br />Nice sound quality.<br />Easy to connect to devices.<br />Buttons to control sound volume and calls on right headphone work well.<br />Mic seems to work pretty well.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The light that tells you it's charging doesn't show up half the time when I plug it in to charge. It also doesn't seem to charge when I use my microusb cable for my android phone and only charges with the extremely short cord that came with it. It's annoying to carry around both when they both have the same ends (usb and microusb).<br />When I disconnect them from my phone and reconnect them, the sound is super choppy and of bad quality. I have to turn off the earphones and reconnect manually through bluetooth for my phone.<br />It will also not automatically detect my laptop most of the time. I have to go into bluetooth settings on my laptop and unpair the headphones and then pair them again."
1,These are some of the best earbuds  i have purchased.. Very comfortable and sound great. I would buy again
1,I really liked these headphones initially. However I have had issues charging them and now getting my iPhone 7 to connect to them. I see the light flashing blue and red (meaning they are on) and my Bluetooth is on. The phone and headphones are right next to each other but my phone is unable to connect to the headphones. Yet my phone is able to connect to my Fitbit so I don't think it's an issue with my phone. The issue persisted after restarting my phone. I would try another option.
1,I can’t answer because are Christmas gifts for my grandsons.
0,Have had them less than 3 weeks....only use them Mon through Thurs at work....desk....and the right side is cutting out. Very upsetting.
1,Very sensitive to short distances.  Only get about 8 foot away. Don't think they are water proof.
0,"Have you ever been really excited for something and then the product you received was completely a waste of money? Well here it is, I bought and received these headphones quickly! I opened the box, read the directions and charged the headphones. Once the blue light indicated it was charged, I went to turn on the headphones and they wouldn't even turn on! Thinking maybe it was a lapse in my technical efficiency my boyfriend tried to set them up. THEY WOULDN'T EVEN POWER ON! followed by the power button getting stuck and the volume button COMPLETELY FELL OFF THE HEADPHONES!!!! Straight out of the box and never used. Returning product immediately. Throw in a little more money and buy yourself a nicer brand. That's what I learned!."
0,"My previous pair of these finally gave out after years of service.  Unfortunately, whatever the current version is pales in comparison.<br /><br />For one thing, the voice (on/off sound, etc) is unbelievably loud.  My advice is to not have these in your ears when you turn them on and off.  This voice is equally as loud even when the Bluetooth sound is all the way down.<br /><br />Further, I think they’re limiting the volume much more than they used to.  These new ones aren’t as loud as the others.  Additionally, the bass is extremely overbearing and makes the sound quality even worse.<br /><br />Long story short, I would avoid these until they address these issues. There are other wireless earbuds in the same price range that don’t have these issues"
1,Love these headphones. They sound amazing!!
1,Work great but do not stay in my ears...  Probably just me though...
1,"Super loud and sounds great,  very durable."
0,"They worked fine until they no longer paired with my iPhone and iPad. Even a factory reset would not fix the issue. So, they worked fine for about 18 months, then I threw them away."
1,"So far, I really like them. Very clear. Loud volume. Better than my Lg that I paid 100.00 for. Only had them a couple days. We will see"
0,"Disappointed because the connection with Bluetooth is cumbersome. I have to switch the headphones on and off several times. Also on occasions, it delivers garbled sound. Third downside is the earbuds, the soft ones have already fallen off while commuting.. and that makes the headphones unusable.<br /><br />The sound quality is good. But other aspects I mentioned are as important.  I am surprised by the ratings. Would prefer to return."
0,They were great for about a month until the charging port broke and they refused to fix or replace them. Waste of money unfortunately
1,I lost my first pair.  Had to have these again!  Great fit.  Amazing sound.  Had to call the 24/7 support because my Android didnt pair up(phone issue NOT earbud).  The support person was fast and very knowledgable.
0,"The only issue with these headphones is that they won't stay in the ear.  The sound quality is great, but that doesn't matter if they are constantly falling out.  I tried every size they had, and the headphones would only stay in sitting still.  If running, exercising at the gym, or even laying down, they would immediately fall out."
1,"Took them out of the box, the Bluetooth quickly synched with my phone, and off I go - that's what I want in a pair of wireless headphones and that's what I got.  Good sound quality as well."
1,The headphones work great. They have great distance. Very clear for a cheaper pair of headphones. I am happy with this purchase.
1,Finally ear buds that fit and feel great Thank you
1,"Purchased as Christmas gift. Item looks good and works great so far! Good buy for money, thank you!"
1,Would recommend before beats
1,GOOD SOUND NEED TO RESYNC EVERY TIME I USE THEM
1,"Good quality and good value.  My Sony Bluetooth headset finally broke.  This SENSO headphone works much better and about a third the price of Sony's.<br /><br />Update, 8/17/2017<br />I would like to commend the excellent support Senso provides.  (All my communication with them was via email as I was at work.)  First, their response is excellent.  They replied within 10 minutes.  After a few rounds of trouble-shooting over email, all within a few hours, we came to the heart of the problem.  Second, they honor the one year warranty.  Since my S-250 was still under warranty, they sent me a new pair on the same day.  You may find other sellers offering products with similar features at a slightly lower price.  But they are typically not backed up by any warranty."
1,"I needed a bluetooth headphone while I jogged, and I wanted to them to stay secure in my ears. This headphone works great! The buttons are easy to manage, and it was easy to pair it to my phone. It stayed secure during my entire workout and was comfortable to wear. I am very pleased with them."
1,Good earbuds
1,These are the coolest things. Very good sound and a very good price. Got a new iPad and now I love to listen to all sorts of things through these headphones  and it doesn’t bother anybody sitting next to me.
1,"Pros: Easy to use. Connects to other blue tooth devices easily.<br />Cons: Sound is OK, but the earpieces don't fit me well enough to function as noise cancelling. I tried two different size silicon/ rubber ear pieces.<br />The ear hooks bend easily & need to be bent around my ears each time I put them on. I'm concerned that they will break eventually."
1,"Love these headphones. I researched many options and felt these were going to be the most durable. I also love the one year warranty, I have not had great luck with headphones, excited to try these out."
1,Excellent headphones/earbuds. Comfortable with great sound quality!
0,"The headphones themselves are nice enough. The sound is good. But, they really aren't comfortable in my ears. They hurt after a while. But, the real deal killer is that these headphones stutter badly when connected to an Android device. Every fifteen seconds, they stutter for a few seconds. I've read that this is common for some Bluetooth headphones and Android devices and seems to be related to what version of Bluetooth is being used.<br /><br />I am using Android 7.0 and I have no stuttering problems with my old over-the-head Motorola Bluetooth headphones. But, these Senso ear buds and another Bluetooth headset I bought last year stutter badly. Whatever new version of Bluetooth they are using does not work with my Android. The Senso ear buds work fine with my laptop and other music devices I have. Just not my phone, which is why I bought them.<br /><br />My advice to Android users is to look for reviews that mention this stuttering problem."
1,Love them but the songs have been skipping on me and I find it's when the headphones are not fully charged.  Not sure if it has anything to do with that.
1,get a lot of Bluetooth interference for some reason
1,"Altogether I have ordered about 5 sets of these earbuds.  They are of good quality at a fair price.  After a few years of usage, my first set began to have some static problems, so I ordered another set.  My new set doesn't seem to fit my ear as well."
1,Excellent set of headphones.
1,"I've only had the headphones for a week, but am very satisfied so far. They deliver crisp, clear sound no matter what I'm listening to. They can also get incredibly loud and thus far I haven't had to listen to anything above half-volume, which is impressive.<br /><br />The right headphone houses the controls, including the power/sync button, volume up/down, and mic. I've tried one call using the headphones, and the recipient couldn't hear me at all, but I'm not sure if it was due to poor signal or poor placement of the mic. The volume controls work well and there is a cap that prevents you from turning it up past a certain point. The right headphone also contains the micro USB charging port which I haven't even had to use yet. It has a rubber cover on it to prevent dust from getting in, which I thought was a neat little touch.<br /><br />I've had minimal issue pairing the headphones with my devices. They paired seamlessly with my phone out of the box, but took a few tries with my laptop. Be sure to disconnect any other devices the headphones are paired with before pairing with another device, otherwise it won't work. It's all laid out in the pretty easy-to-understand instruction manual. There was one instance where I was using the 'phones with my smartphone and the Bluetooth was still turned on on my laptop, and I was getting some feedback amidst the sound of the video I was watching. When I realized what it was, simply turning off the BT on the laptop solved the issue.<br /><br />I tested the headphones with some videos in addition to music, with pretty good results. Something happened consistently with YouTube videos where there would be a few seconds of &#34;noise&#34; after a video ended, almost reminiscent of the empty noise you hear when playing back a cassette tape with nothing on it. It wasn't a big deal, but it wasn't quite as seamless as I had expected. When a video ends, I expect to hear no sound coming through. I'm not sure what the source of the feedback was, but I had no other BT devices connected and it happened with multiple videos from multiple channels.<br /><br />Despite this odd occurrence, the sound quality seems really good. Highly impressive for a pair of sub-$40 headphones (wireless headphones, no less). Biggie smalls' voice boomed as it should and the thumping bass from &#34;hypnotize&#34; sounded pretty authentic. Furthermore, guitar riffs from &#34;Losing my Religion&#34; were crisp and each note shone through. Stipes's wail wasn't muted or tinny and I could clearly make out the fluctuations in his voice.<br /><br />As a package, the value doesn't get much better. The sleek packaging comes with the 'phones, a case to hold them, a bunch of replacement earpieces of different sizes, TWO charging cables (including a really nifty lighting and micro USB in one) and a car charger (and of course an instruction manual). Everything is packaged nicely and works well. It gives me confidence that the brand is high on their products. They advertise 24/7/365 customer service on the box, and I got an email from one of the company's &#34;owners&#34; asking how I liked the product, and notifying me that they were there if I needed anything or experienced any issues. Impressive.<br /><br />The final thing I want to say, and a partial reason behind rating 4 and not 5 stars, is how these headphones look. They look clunky on the ears, and while they feel good, they aren't exactly discreet,  and honestly look kind of silly when I looked in the mirror while wearing them. Also, it's really hard to use them with only one earpiece in. I was getting ready before work but was anticipating a phone call and I was using the sink, so I didnt wanna touch my phone with wet hands to answer the call, and figured I'd take the call with my headphones. I just wanted to have the right one in, so all I'd have to do was press the button on the side to answer the call and be able to finish my routine. However, it was near impossible to only have one in my ear, because the other one dangled and is weighty enough by itself to drag the other one out of my ear. It wasn't a huge annoyance, but with standard headphones I never had a problem having only one earpiece in at any given time.<br /><br />The takeaway I hope you get from this review is that you should by these headphones. From a value perspective, these are 35 dollar wireless headphones with massive sound and a whole host of extra goodies that make you feel as though you should be paying more. They aren't the most visually pleasing things in the world, and connecting via Bluetooth isn't completely seamless all the time, but they are a really good pair of headphones that are easy and fun to use."
1,"Perfect, cant tell the difference between these and my friends $200 beats"
1,So happy I got these for Christmas I ordered them for my husband and son too! Lightweight and great sound they are perfect to take on a walk a run or to the gym.
0,"not good for people with small ears...can't use, but also can't return."
0,"This is the 3rd time I bought this wireless headset.  First ones lasted about a year.  2nd set I lost.  This last set work for about a month, then all of a sudden none of the buttons work, it would lower the volume without me touching it, and would skip head constantly when listening to audible. I could no longer use it to talk on the phone either.  Also I do not like the adjustable part that goes around your ear.  Its like a pliable gumby.  Always having to adjust them to fit, and they don't stay on as well.  After awhile they are just too pliable to hold it's shape.  Very disappointing this time around.  Guess it's time to try another brand."
1,"I hesitated to purchase ear buds over a head set but I needed something small and portable for travel. The other reviews sold me and so I add my own.<br /><br />Pairing, super easy and works on multiple devices. Sound quality listening is fine for me, abet I am not an audiophile and I mostly listen to videos and make calls. Making calls and my voice quality, I have no complaints and I've asked most of my first 12 calls how I sounded. Charging time is much longer than I've allowed. I've gone 5+ hours and I'm sure I could have gone longer. Accessories are everything you need, which is amazing to me for the price.<br /><br />I haven't tested the waterproofness but I have no doubts since other reviews rave. I'll add my two thumbs up for this product's value for the price."
1,"I got these for my husband for Christmas. He said this is the best present he's ever gotten, SCORE!"
0,"I received these as a Christmas gift, the sound quality is poor and the connection keeps breaking up even with the phone within 12 inches of the headset. The materials seemed good quality, but definitely would not recommend."
0,"I really liked the product, fit well in my ears, sound was  good but after 3 MONTHS they quit working.  Wouldn't charge and the last day for product review was 2 weeks ago.  What a waste of money."
1,"Sound is good. Sweat resistant for certain. Quality is good. I HATE how they fit in my ear, they always come out, and then they force my ear to open and give me headaches. If you have small ears these are not for you, even with the small insert pieces. Otherwise they are good for the money!"
1,"Excellent buy for the price and the battery lasts longer than many other wireless headphones. I have not any problems working out, they stay in comfortably. The sound quality, for being Bluetooth, is impressive."
1,"These headphones work very good. They come in a box with a neat carrying case, car charger, USB charger, another charger with a 3ft cord as well as ear pieces small, medium and large. The quality of the sound is also good and they are quite comfortable. I had problems with other wireless headphones as they would fall off my ears but these stay there and hold good. I definitely recommend them."
1,Everything you want in headphones and then some.
1,I was very skeptical of buying another pair of wireless/bluetooth headphones but as my current ones were dying I was looking for another pair.  These headphones are great.  The first time I put them on I was VERY satisfied with the fit and quality of sound coming through them.  They cancel out the surrounding noise and deliver the highest quality of music.  Great job on these headphones.
1,"I love these headphones and have bought them twice now. However, right around the 3 month mark, something always happens to them. The first time, the entire earbud actually fell out of the headphones, exposing the wire. The second time, a large amount of feedback started and the headphones started to overheat to the point where I couldn't wear them without risk of burning! These are great short-term headphones, but if you're looking for something more long term, I don't know if I would recommend."
1,Well worth the price.  Sound better than ear buds that cost 4 times this low price..Sound Amazing..
1,"I use these at the gym and when i'm out for a run and they work great, they stay in my ears the whole time with out have to keep pushing them back in every 10 seconds lol, the sound quality is clean even at high volume some bass adjusting may be necessary on the phone to get the crystal sound at high volumes but all in all i think they where a good buy and i would definitely buy them again."
1,"good, clear sound.  Fits comfortably, battery last around 8-10 hours (charge once a week)."
1,Great headphones for running. It fits well and does not create problems falling off or produce extra noise inside ear. Its light weight and comfortable. Thumbs up.
1,My go to replacement after my dog chewed up the Jarv headphones I had. Very good fitment and comes with multiple earbuds to fit just about any ear. Run time on these could be better though. One charge lasts me about a day or one gym session (about 2 hours of the volume close to high). Quality of the buttons seems cheap but what can you expect. Had these for 3 months and so far the only complaint is the battery.<br />Pros<br />- Fitment<br />- Virtually cannot be tangled<br />- Won't come off after a good sparring session<br />- Comes in a cool carrying case<br />Cons<br />- Batt life (big one for me)<br />- Looks too much like Beats but thats just me
1,"The package came 2 days after I ordered it.  It was in a nice box with all the accessories.  I have extremely small ears and I have trouble finding headset that not only stay in and on my ears, but work great too!  Theses are a keeper!"
1,"Great sound, good fit, amazing price. Very pleased."
0,Ok... stopped working after 5 months.
0,Love these headphones- bought a pair 3 years ago & couldn’t be happier- my old ones got a little funky with the blue tooth connection when the battery was low so I thought a new pair<br />- same quality<br />- great fit - doesn’t fall off when running or exercising<br />- buttttt my right ear piece : there seems to be something loose in it because when I run it’s a very obvious noise- so I might send it back: trade it in
1,"So I have had these for about two weeks now. So a few take aways from my experience with these.<br /><br />Positive:<br /><br />1.  Great Sound.  Even though I have not actually owned the Beats Wireless Ear Buds (Power Beats3 are the best comparison), I had the chance to check them out for a few minutes a few days prior to receiving these.  I loved the tone the Beats produced.  Nice blend of lows and highs along with mids.  When I received the Senso Earphones, I was blown away at how well they sounded in comparison (maybe not quite as good as the Power Beats which I tried along with my phone with the same music as the Senso pair but much better than what you would think for a set that costs less than 1/6th the cost).<br /><br />2.  Ease of use.  These are pretty easy to use.  All the controls are on the right side ear bud.  You have the main multi-purpose button along with the volume up/down button (double as the skip forward/backward buttons).  On the bottom side of the same unit is the connector for the charger (under a small rubber cover which can be somewhat problematic to handle; more on that below).  The multi-purpose button is used for pausing/playing music (by just pushing the button once and immediately releasing) and bringing up calling or voice control (depending on your phone; since I use a Galaxy S7 Edge, it pulls up the Google voice control which is nice) by pressing and holding the button for about a second or so.<br /><br />3. Comfort.  I have smaller ears, so the small ear buds work well for me (even though I could use the medium size though they got uncomfortable after a while).  I do use these more as a bluetooth ear piece than full on ear buds because of the amount I tend to drive but I do like to have them as a full headset when I want to listen to music while I work alone at times.<br /><br />4.  These are very much water resistant.  Because I work outside in the rain, I wanted something that would hold up to some water (though I wear rain gear).  I do get quite damp, especially when the rain is heavy.  I have not even noticed these being affected by water.<br /><br />5.  The range.  This is something I really cannot testify to other than an experience this evening.  I started playing music while I was doing laundry.  I went out to our washing machine which is on the same side of the house as my room but divided by a wall.  I had not realized I left my phone on my desk in my room until I made couple of moves that made my music break up a little.  But in all, it kept going with really not a lot of breaking up.  A nice surprise.<br /><br />Negatives:<br /><br />1. Lack of battery level until battery is low.  I have yet to find a way to know what the battery level is at whenever I want.  The only time it notifies me of the level is when the battery level is low.  This can be annoying on so many levels.  First and foremost is that I am usually away from a charger for long periods at a time.  So when the battery notifies me that it is low, I just have to turn it off (because every few minutes or so it will chime in that the battery is low being rather annoying).  My previous bluetooth headset would notify me each time I powered them on as to what level they were at (high, medium or low).<br /><br />2.  The multi-purpose button, though blended in to make both sides look uniform, tends to blend in too well.  Because the ear bud is in my ear, I have to find the button by feeling around.  I have found myself on multiple occasions missing the button trying to push the area forward of the button.  I have also found myself pressing the button once to bring up voice control and accidentally starting my music (but this is more out of habit because my previous headset had more buttons including separate buttons for play/pause and voice control vs the same button for both).<br /><br />3. Because I do use this as a bluetooth headset for driving, leaving just the right earbud in and the left out creates a situation in which the left side will weight down on the right side.  As a result I have to put the left side within my collar on my shirt to leave slack in the wire (but this is really because these were really meant to be used as a full headset).<br /><br />4.  Music can cut in and out if you just started playing right after turning on the headset.  But to solve this problem, just wait several seconds (maybe 15-30 seconds) after the headset connects before starting to play music.  Then it works like a charm.<br /><br />So far, I cannot say much about the battery life as I do tend to use these differently than my last headset (LG Tone Pro which tended to last me about two weeks between charges).  I have found that I am charging these about once a week, maybe a little longer.  But I am using these for more music through the day not to mention I have them on a good chunk of the day as I need hands free while working to receive and make calls as needed.<br /><br />Overall, I have been pleased with these.  When I was forced to find a new headset (my previous headset broke off at the right arm), I was looking for something that had sound similar to that of the Beats but at a fraction of the price.  These fit the bill well.  I totally recommend these, especially if you do not want to spend the $200 for the pricier Beats."
1,"Received on time. Packaging was as promised. I needed something to use for exercise and in my car (no hands free in the car). So far the car issue is solved, haven't tried the exercise yet. I'm a little confused as to why there is a longer Apple charging cord in with a very short android charging cord. Come to think of it, not sure why the Apple cord is in the package at all? I'm not an Apple owner so forgive the confusion."
1,Wife uses this way more than I do.<br />She took it and uses it all the time. Seems to really like it.
1,"Love these,  great volume and bass"
1,I have tiny ear canals and these really work. They stay on my ears without discomfort.  My second pair of Senso headphones  because I always have a pair charging!
1,Arrived quickly with extra goodies (multiple ear pieces) and extra charging cord. I have used these on several 10 plus mile runs and they stay put. No falling out. I use the small clip in the back to cinch the cord so it doesn’t bounce on the back of my neck. Good quality sounds buds for a runner at a decent price.
1,"Great headphones for a great price. Good quality sound and it comes with a nice case with extra ear tips, dual port car charger, short charging cable and 3 foot charging cable. I am extremely pleased with these headphones. Nice job Senso!!"
1,"It worked pretty well for about 5 months - I use it primarily for workouts but also worked fine as a phone headset.<br /><br />Then the battery decided to stop holding a charge. By month 6 it would only hold charge for 5 minutes after a full night charging. For the price, it's not terrible but I would expect at least a year.<br /><br />The Bluetooth was wonky sometimes as well and would not always make it maintain a connection. This was typically solved by some combination of cycling the headset, phone Bluetooth, audio app, or some combination thereof"
1,Easy set up. These are my first wireless headphones. Easy to use.<br />Im happy with my purchase. An excellent price!
1,"Love how these feel, work and they even say the phone number when called. Perfect and sound great. Lots of extra goodies. Great buy!"
1,"I ride a Harley and have been trying to find a decent set of ear buds and these are it. Quality sound, comfortable and little wind noise. Satisfied customer!"
1,great value. great sound
1,"Now that I have the iPhone X, I was in the market for Bluetooth headphones that sounded good, but didn’t cost over a $100. I refuse to pay that much for headphones I’m sure will be dropped and/or stepped on accidentally. These headphones sound amazing! The sound is clear and when playing music the bass is great. The headphones are comfortable to wear as well.<br /><br />I always had a problem with earbuds not fitting my ears or staying in place. With the ear hooks, the buds stay in place. In my opinion, they sound better then the Apple’s EarPods. I use them every day at my desk when working and use when listening to music on my walks. With loud co-workers in a open floor plan building, I can attest these are the best noise cancelling headphones I’ve used lately. You cannot beat the price either! I would definitely recommend these headphones."
0,"After misplacing my first pair, which worked wonderfully, this new pair has been very erratic.<br />Connectivity jumps on and off even when carying my Iphone in my pocket. Other wireless speakers have no issue with connecting with my Iphone.<br />While listening, will go silent then reconnect to phone. Very frustrating."
1,Simple to sinc with devices and quality sound. Great price is nice as well!
1,Great sound!  Easy pairing!
1,I was not so confident about it when I ordered these headphones. But Once I used these headphones I was so in love with them. The best quality headphone. They can beat any high branded headphones.
1,Ok so far
1,"This headphone is very good, however, even the lowest volume is too loud for indoor environment (cafe/library/anywhere indoors with not much other noise) with iPhone. I found out that you can play with equalizer settings from within your music apps to turn down the volume."
1,don't last all day but is a great back up....
1,Delivery was on time (i recieved the item a day before the stated date). Also i am impressed with the performance & quality of the product.<br />Highly recommended.
0,"I have this headphone and worked great for year but after that it do not stay turned on, but auto turned off even if i am actively listing to music. I will check with warranty department if there is anything they can do to resolve this issue."
1,Absolutely awesome .Fitment is perfect .Sound per price is great .Those leave my ears only to be charged.Love it.
1,"These bluetooth headphones work very well. The sound quality is crisp & vibrant. I haven't had any problems with them since I've been using them for the past two weeks. Operating the headphones is very simple, too."
0,"I had them for a few weeks and started good but after two weeks they brake bluethood connection, especially when you are running."
1,"Purchased for my son as Xmas present...returned as we received s lemon, but replaced and all good...my son loves it because he likes the waterproof since he works out every day"
0,"I had purchased these headphones for running and gym workouts and for the price you really cannot beat the quality. I lost my first pair, but was so impressed I decided to repurchase the headphones.<br />The second pair were working great for a few months without issue. However, I left without charge for about 2-3 weeks and at which point when trying to use the headphones would not recharge. I plugged the headphones for days hoping they would charge, but no luck. I have used different chargers without success.<br />When replacing these headphones I would go with a different supplier."
1,"Those Headphones are really GREAT, i was so stupid paying more than $100 for some brands that are ok, but now that i just got the Senso i can say that have the same o maybe better sound quality, special the bass is really good, in general the sound is well balance, it fit perfect on my ears, and also comes with 3 different sizes in case you need them, the case is also really nice and usefull for the gym, the bluetooh is working good, i connect it with my Iphone 6 in just 1 sec lol, really easy, can go wrong with this, i recommend it 100%."
0,Sound quality is good but build quality is poor.  Ear clips are limpier than wet noodle and totally useless and dont hold headphones in place and constantly fall off while running defeating the whole purpose of buying these headphones for working out. Totally annoyed and disappointed. Will be sending them back to amazon.
0,"I was hoping these would be a good replacement for my previous Photive brand bluetooth headphones, especially given the low price. This was entirely misleading, marking these down from around $170 to sell for $37. There is no way these retail for $170. The sound quality is extremely bass-heavy, but not in a good way. It's a muddled bass, like listening to music played in another room. The rubber clasp that wraps around the ear is so flimsy, it's hard to even get these on in the first place. Unlike the Photives, these are more prone to fall off the moment you start running (caveat: I never even bothered taking these to the gym for a test run).<br /><br />These look decent, which is a plus in their favor, and relatively cheap, but there are better quality bluetooth headphones available to be had cheaper than these even at their &quot;marked down&quot; price (Photive and Phaiser for example)."
0,"I thought the price of these was to good. I was right. They literaly fell apart before I could use them. I inserted the charging cable provided to top off the battery before taking them for a test run and the plastic casing for the earbud split in half! Destroying the ability to use the volume / skip buttons. Plus the seller says &#34;waterproof&#34; I didn't test it, but when the plastic split in half down the seam already there it was obvious that there is no way these headphones could in any way even be water resistant. Total trash item. Don't wast your money on this."
1,Great for the price & connects easy but does lose connection & crackle if jostled even a little bit.
1,"great buy, I have a pair of Plantronics and their no where near the as good as the Senso headphones. I love that the Senso headphones let hardly any background noise in compared to the Plantronics."
1,"Headphones were priced right, but the audio quality is poor with distortion with any level of bass."
1,great deal
0,"Garbage. Completely dissatisfied. Will be returning. Audio quality is horrible, no high range with overpowering low range. Pairing is near impossible if you don't have split second reflexes to let go of the button for the fraction of a second the light flashes blue and red. Interface is frustrating, and poorly setup."
1,ear buds are very comfortable and sound is very crisp. easy to use as well
1,This product is AWESOME.. I love my headphones..
0,Good sound and battery life but for some reason the headphones had trouble staying in my left ear. I found my self constantly adjusting them during my run.
1,"Excellent sound &  Quality  , a lot better than I  expected for the price, I would recommend to anyone"
1,"These headphone far surpass my expectations.  Very good sound quality, good fit, zero chance of them falling out, easy Bluetooth pairing.  Only issue:  The little rubber charging flap’s gripper is too small...you can’t get a grasp to open the USB charging flap without getting a pair of tweezers.  Very Very annoying...I’m tempted to just rip the cover off since I’m not going to be running with these in the rain or take them into the shower.  I now own two of these and both have the same flaw so it’s unlikely a single product aberration.  If it weren’t for that issue, it would have gotten a clear 5-stars for the price.  Now, I don’t know about the longevity, but for what I paid, if this lasts a year I’ll be happy."
0,Would not sync with phone and I was not able to return. What a waste of money.
1,"They have really good sound, but when I turn my head to the right they short out.  Super weird.  Doesn't do it if I  turn my head to the left.  If it wasn't for that problem they would get 5 stars, but I feel like Zoolander or something."
1,These are a great addition to my multimedia collection. The sound quality and noise cancellation are awesome! And they are easy to use!!
1,I bought these based on so many good reviews I thought maybe they were fake but these headphones are actually really good sound quality and great fit. Glad I got these
1,"To begin with the positive, I like how these Bluetooth headphones fit - they are snug and fit nicely into my ear and stay put no matter what workout I am doing.  They hold a charge for nearly a weeks worth of 1-hour workouts and are built well.  Now onto a few disappointments - for me, these headphones don't have great frequency range between highs and lows.  The treble is a just not what I expected from a set of small, compact headphones.  That being said,  they do provide a decent amount of bass.  Definitely more depth than iPhone earbuds but not nearly the crisp highs.  One other annoying problems seems to be degradation of Bluetooth connection.  After a day or so of being connected to my iPhone, I get these annoying double beeps, about 15 seconds or so apart, which interrupts what I am listening to.  The only workaround I have found is to completely remove the Senso Headphones (which show up as Activbuds S250 in my Bluetooth devices by choosing &#34;Forget This Device&#34;).  I then have to reconnect them in by Bluetooth device list.  This seems to work for a day's worth of use, however, the next day when I go to workout....same problem.  After researching a bit, it seems as if the double beep warning is a battery warning, however, this even happens when the headphones are fully charged.  A very annoying glitch as far as I can tell."
1,Love them!!! Very easy to setup and use. Great sound.
1,Currently enjoying the headphone
1,"Im very happy with my purchase of the Senso Bluetooth headset.  This is my first pair of Bluetooth headsets so I have nothing really to base the quality of sound other than my own hearing and I'm very pleased with them. The company is by far one of the best at customer service I've dealt with on Amazon. For under 40.00, you get a quality headset,  nice carrying case, different cables and earbud sizes. The box is nice, even the instructions are made on premium paper with a glossy finish and well written english. And if all of that wasn't enough,  they come with a one year warranty.  With 14,000 plus and a 4.5 out if 5 overall rating you can't go wrong."
0,"They keep turning off and disconnecting from my device. Did not work well when swimming, the reason I bought them in the first place. Water interferes with connection. Resets have not worked to solve the problem. Decent sound quality and battery life."
1,Great headphones happy with my purchase 10-10
1,"These headphones are pretty fantastic at the below $40 price-point.  Easy to set up.  It took less than a minute for me to pair it with my mobile phone and tablet.  Though not as stylish as the more expensive counter-parts, the fit is snug.  I wouldn't worry about them falling out during a workout.  Once they are seated correctly in your ear canal, they make perfect seal.  The sound quality is great, if not a bit heavy on the bass.  You can buy 4 of these for the price of one set of Beats.  And the sound quality is comparable.  I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a Bluetooth headset with good sound, at a ridiculously low price."
1,"These are easy to use, comfortable and the battery lasts well!<br />I will say that after 5 months and being used 3-6 times a week for 30 minutes or more, something malfunctioned- either the device itself or the charger cord. 1 call to customer service, tried a few things and they replaced them- super nice and easy! Oh how my wife has missed them on her runs!"
1,"The Senso earbuds feel like quality headphones. The sound is as good or better than any corded pair I've owned. First time out,I had my iPhone volume down and I assumed the volume on the headphone was down because the volume was plenty loud. The volume on the headphones ry  half way. The volume on the senso is the loudest Bluetooth earbuds I've ever had. Very happy with my purchase."
1,Easy to pair.  Sounds great.  Comes with car charger and necessary cords.  Extremely comfortable to wear.  I wear them for work and play.
0,Broke the 5th day i was using it as it stops charging. The charger it came with was a nice addition as a hybrid charger cord for iphones and androids but doesnt relieve the fact on how tough it is to hit the play button on the earphones without having it lodge deep inside your ear while having to use another finger to get it out and adjust it.
1,Excellent headphones
1,I liked how the wireless fit and the sound.
1,I sweat really a LOT while working out. This headset is really IPX7 level sweat/water proof. It easily lasts for ~7-8 workouts on a single charge. My last pair lasted me for about 2 years. This headset performs really good.
0,"I can't believe I only got to use these two times in the pool,  and now it won't take a charge.  I plug the USB cable into the socket - but the light does not turn on.  I'm trying to contact Amazon for a refund."
1,"I wish I would have found these earlier.  If you want a quality wireless in ear headset look no further.  I have used these for hours at a time with no issues at all.  The sound is great, clear and the battery last for a long time with a single charge.  I have had ZERO issues with the Bluetooth pairing either.  Well worth the price!!!!!"
1,"Love the headphones! Perfect for running. Had an issue and customer service took care of me immediately, too! So easy to deal with"
1,"These phone are much, much better than my previous Bluetooth buds.  Frequency range is far supersuperior. Package included more accessories than others, as well. I am very happy!"
1,"Great customer service! Stopped taking a charge during the one-year warranty period, after heavy use, and manufacturer immediately replaced the headphones upon request. They're comfortable and sound quality is excellent, with a higher volume than another brand I've used. I'd go 5 stars but the signal often cuts out when I keep my iPod in my pocket for a run, to the point where I'm buying an armband for this purpose (the other brand doesn't have the issue, so I can't blame my iPod)."
0,Have it for a few months and battery burnt out.  Loved it when it was working.
1,Great product and works just you said. May buy more later. Thanks
1,"My husband and I both bought these. They stay in your ears while doing most activities! I would probably upgrade to completely cordless the next time I buy Bluetooth headphones only because it does grab on things when laying down on workout equipment and once on an elliptical (ripped them out and they got tangled around it, lol. I do like that stay charged for about 12 hours and they charge pretty fast."
1,Price point is great and sound is good. Perfect for using at the gym or a plane. You can pay a lot more for a lot less quality
1,These headphones work as advertised. They hooked up to my Gearfit 2 with no issues. The sound is very good. They are comfortable and do not fall off when you are running/biking or working out. They are sweat proof and I think they are an outstanding value.
1,Can mold to fit my ears and stays in when buds would fall out
1,Sound great! Quick delivery.
0,"The sound was good. The change held for a long time. They just will not stay in my ears. When I try to adjust them,  I end up turning them off. They drive me crazy."
0,"They are constructed with similar quality to ones I purchased for $10. So much stuff came with it I wondered if all of the value estimate came from the stuff and not the earbuds themselves. I hope time proves my suspicions incorrect. Too soon for an early review, but since you asked, this is what I can honestly give for now.<br /><br />Update...<br />I was right, my lesson is, if you don't recognize the name of the manufacturer, DO NOT BUY! With very careful use, these lasted a month before they started acting up. A month later, even with my phone in my cycling jersey pocket, these DO NOT REMAIN CONNECTED"
1,"So far, great little headphones. They stay in nice, and aren't to heavy. A definite upgrade from my corded headphones!"
0,"Hurt my ears big time, returned them."
1,"These headphones are a MUST have.  The sound quality is great for music, video streaming, and phone calls.  In fact, I answered a call with them on and the caller couldn't even tell I was on Bluetooth, wish I could say the same about my car.<br /><br />They come with 3 ear cushion sizes, car charger, wall charger, caring case.  They have a really long lasting charge.  I wore them for 6 hours straight and they were still going strong.  They also seem to hold a charge for a long time, going a few days without charging and then they started right up.  They're awesome at the gym, sweat doesn't make them slide or fall out, and the hooks that go over the ears are very comfortable.<br /><br />If you're not technical, don't worry, pairing them takes seconds, and is super easy.<br /><br />I highly recommend these."
1,Have been using them at work and while working out. Great set of headphones.  Music sounds great!
1,I bought these for my husband at Christmas and he swears by them. The sound is great and the price can't be by eat. Once my son heard them I had to get him a pair as well. You have nothing to lose and everything to gain!
1,"These are incredible. Hard to believe they are so well priced. Fantastic comfort, packaging and sound quality."
1,"Love these, sound quality is great and they are noise cancelling. I had bought a pair for my boyfriend for Christmas and his are still working well so i had to buy myself a pair. Definitely would recommend"
1,"Everything i wanted...i was a little worried at first as the bluetooth seemed not to work well from very close, like in my pocket...metal blocked the signal?  At any rate,i have spent roughly 40 hours with them actively and they work great...what a deal..."
1,Had them for a while now and they still work greatly.
1,"Very high quality for the price Easy to link to iPhone and the sound is surprising given the low cost. Controls tracks, charges quickly and has a good sound. Bass is not as full as my Sony wired earbuds, but very close."
1,"I have had these headphones for a few weeks now and I like them. For a relatively inexpensive pair of headphones they're very nice, they're a little too loud though, I wish I could turn the volume down one or two more clicks. This is my first pair of bluetooth headphones and the change from a cord is incredible. Also the ability to pause your music/Netflix remotely by tapping the earbud is really useful. These are fairly good at keeping background noise out, they don't block out everything but probably 85-90% of the noise around you. They stay on pretty well too, I normally have issues with apple earbuds falling out but these haven't fallen out unless they've gotten caught on something. I haven't worked out with them yet though, so I can't speak to that. The plastic cover for the charging port did snap off only a few weeks after purchasing however. This was very disappointing because I take very good care of them and have kept them in the carrying case when I'm not using them. I am worried that this will compromise the water resistance of the headphones. All in all they are a decent pair of headphones."
1,"This item is great, and the delivery time was even better, Thanks, I would recommend this product to<br />My family and friends."
1,works great as expected replaced beats same style no noticeable loss of sound.
1,perfect
1,"Great product with a low price, sound quality is good and battery is solid my only complain is the ear holder , is the rubber piece that keeps your buds in place , like every molded part  where the two molds meet during production a residue line is created and is usually never cut off properly so it a bit sharp on the ear it wont cut u but is annoying i fixed myself but still highly recommend the product very happy with it"
1,Five star for the product and definitely more than 5 star for the customer service.  I was hesitant to buy this  Bluetooth earphone  at first because I never had a good experience in terms of sound quality from these type of earphones  and I always go for over-the-ear headphones but to my surprise this item performed exceptionally.  I really like the sound quality and the battery life but what I found very impressive was the customer service provided. i needed their help initially and they responded almost immediately..  definitely recommending this to my friends and family..
1,I'm very pleased with this product. The Bluetooth connection is simple and works very well.
1,"This is actually my second set of these awesome headphones, for I lost my first pair which was heartbreaking. Excellent sound quality and they stay in my ears as I run or workout with them. Now the only time I will take them off is to charge them which is not as often as other wireless headphones that I have had. Great product!"
0,Does not work
1,"Really good so far.  Audio quality is what you would expect, but build quality seems very high.  I am using these for cycling and get a lot of wind noise, but I think that is typical of most in ear phones.  Definitely a great value."
0,"============================<br /><br />Update on my experience as of March 2017.<br /><br />I gave a glowing 5-star report in my original review. However, I am going to have to reduce the rating to 2 stars because these earbuds do not work well when there are multiple sets of these in the same gym. I confirmed this when I purchased a set for my son as well. He was experiencing drop-out problems when we were together. At other times, I would experience the drop-out.  The solution was for me to turn my set off.<br /><br />I travel a lot, so I visit a lot of gyms - so I was able to further confirm this in multiple locations in North America. I was in an out-of-state gym where I started having the problem. I looked around and found another user of the exact same earbuds.  Today, I stepped into my home gym and did a visual scan. Immediately I saw another man wearing these earbuds, and just turned mine off and put them in my bag so that I would not cause interference with his set.<br /><br />IF SENSO can solve this problem then I will switch the rating back to 5 stars. The sound is incredible - when the earbuds are not interfering with other SENSO earbuds.<br /><br />============================<br /><br />I've tried many different Bluetooth headphones designed for the gym. Some of them were physically painful to my ears because of poor fit. One pair would not stay in my ears - and I couldn't even make it through one workout with them. Most of them have poor bass, low sound quality, or low sound amplification. Some have buttons so small that you will need to turn them on and off with a finger nail.<br /><br />I saw the high rating on these and decided to try another pair. I was not ready for the high quality of the sound when I paired these to my HTC One and played back a test workout song. Wow. They the most comfortable earbud headphones I have ever worn. They are easy to put on. They are easy to power on and off. And the sound is outstanding. (Especially considering the price. The sound quality rivals $100+ earbuds.) If you like a good solid bass sound for your workout - then I highly recommend these. Once these are running, outside sound will not easily make it to your ears. I could not be happier with this purchase. No wonder these are rated so highly by most users.<br /><br />These are so good, I would've given them a sixth star if Amazon had one."
1,I have not had them very long and the battery life seems inadequate.  Charged all night then went running and it lasted a half hour.  Very disappointing
1,"So far, pretty good.  Nice sound, deep base.  Like the soft ear buds.  Small ones fit me nicely.  Impressed with the innovative multi application charging cable.  Really like the compact carrying case.  Let's see how they will hold up over time."
1,"Very decent sound from a budget pair of headphones. Connectivity can be intermittent, especially when I use my runner's belt. Overall, pleased with the purchase."
1,"Good sound, stay on my ears while I workout doing various jumping activities and cardio. They are also lightweight, which I like."
1,I wore these for two half marathons—including one in the pouring rain—and the held up great!
1,Great sound quality. My Son is impressed with clearness of sound and long battery life. Would definitely recommend to family or friends. Update we have had to call the company. The headphones stopped working. The company was really great. They are sending a replacement pair at no cost to us.
1,pretty good for the money.  always have to re-pair it to phone.  pain.  but not bad for the money.  good sound quality.  can fall off if playing basketball or turning your head.  the loop in the back whips around doesn't stay put.
1,It just keep slipping out of my ears
1,100% satisfecho
0,"These headphones used to be great when I bought a previous pair and those died on me after 3 years however, the most recent pair was awful. How in 3 years the product went from me giving them a 5 star rating to a 2 is sad and the reason is the battery life is awful, the headphones constantly switch my songs and couldnt handle me sweating on a 10 mile run. Sure they’re cheap but you will be better off getting something that works."
1,5his is my second time purchasing these headphones. Not Soo happy with these. I'm getting horrible wind noise while running with these. Sound quality is excellent except while trying to run
0,"The headphones worked well, when they were working properly. Even for a &#34;discounted&#34; price of $35, the connectivity performance for both my phone and computer was VERY sub-par. In fact, the last time I attempted to use the headphones to watch something on my computer, I gave up after about 5 mins of very &#34;white-noise&#34; filled sound/playback. And just a little over a month of use and the power button won't work as it's recessed into the right ear-bud, warranting the headphones unusable. Considering the price and even TIME it took to finally get the headphones, I advise to go to your local walgreens, cvs, etc and pick up a pair of bluetooth headphones from there.<br /><br />When the headphones were working well, it was great in submerging me in my music and blocking out annoyances like people playing their on music out loud on the trains, having ridiculously loud conversations during early morning rides (when almost no-one is awake and wants to hear it), etc. It's pretty heavy on the base in addition to having some noise cancellation attributes, which is what I think helped block out a decent amount of disturbances/distractions. It may not be the most &#34;balanced&#34;, but I got use to it and adjusted tweaked the sound settings on my phone a bit to my preference.<br /><br />They also, have a free 1 year warranty, so if you still go ahead with purchasing DEFINITELY register these headphones. I'll see if the company e-mails me back and solves this issue with a new set- and then see how long that pair lasts, etc. Hopefully they'll take responsibility for their quality/lack thereof."
1,"These headphones work great! They have a cord to charge them with, they have easy directions to turn them on and off, they are comfortable, and they don't fall out. I bought these when my Google Pixel Buds went to crap and I couldn't be happier. The customer service is top notch too. They follow up on your purchase and remind you of the 1 year warranty you get with the headphones. Thanks, SENSO!"
1,I work out almost daily and this headphones are so practical and functional. Great product!
1,"People say you get what you pay for, but every now and then you get MUCH MUCH more!<br /><br />Music sounds AMAZING, the battery life lasts a really long time (all day and then some), and they sit very comfortably on my ears for a long time. (I meditate with them in my ears and forget they are on.)<br /><br />On top of he 5 star product, Senso's customer service went absolutely above and beyond when suddenly my left earphone started to cut out on me. After an email with a short set of instructions to diagnose the problem correctly, they completely verified my address and promptly sent me a replacement pair. They have a 1 year warranty!<br /><br />I am a very satisfied customer!"
1,"Fantastic!  I ordered a pair for my birthday in February, they worked intermittently.  I contacted customer suppport and they were quick to respond with helpful solutions.  Unfortunately that pair of earbuds just didn't want to connect well.  So customer support was very helpful in getting me to a point where I now have a great pair of functioning earbuds.  Not only do they work well, they sound great!  The best bass and clarity I've experienced in earbuds!  I would highly recommend these"
1,"Fits great, sounds good. Only funny problem is that it cuts in/out when hitting a bump on my lawn mower. Still a keeper!"
1,"very well made nice packaged,  I like the carrying case and all the other little extras they give you.  there are one set of earbuds in there they are made of foam like earplug material, they make for an excellent fit"
0,These broke within weeks. Rubbish and one of my worst purchases
1,"So, I had a pair of Beats by Dre bluetooth earbuds, 2nd series, that I lost and needed to replace (NEEDED.  i just can't deal with wired earbuds at the gym).  I ordered these because I really like the over-the-ear builds, and after testing them yesterday I'm pretty happy with the purchase.  I feel like the sound quality is really close, as is the quality of the hardware.  The only knock I would give these is that I like the button layout of Beats better, but it's certainly not enough to take off a star.  When I got my Beats, they were around $200.  Currently, you can get them for $100.  I got these for just over $30.  Do yourself a favor.  Unless that little 'b' on the side of your head is that important to you, score yourself a pair of these and go spend that extra $60 on something else."
1,"I've only used the headphones a couple of times.  I'm still getting used to the buttons but once you figure it out, it's pretty simple to use.  They are comfortable and the sound is very good.  So I am very happy so far."
0,I purchased these head phones in may and they just stopped working out of no where i  wouldn't recommend anyone to purchase these headphones
1,"I've owned multiple pairs of the original wired powerbeats, studios, powerbeats2s thinking that they were the best sound quality at their price point and they all fell apart after a few months. I am a bit hard on my headphones, but I want a pair that can take a bit of abuse, these are outdoor/gym headphones for me. I switched straight to these after my last pair of powerbeat2s became unusable. I was instantly surprised that I preferred th sound quality of the Sensos out of the box.<br />  Senso is at least as good as your average bluetooth headset but far cheaper, a little more emphasis on the lows with the foam tips, which I love. Use the foam tips, they really improve the quality. I wish they lasted longer, or came with more foam tips though."
1,Love it fits perfectly in my ear. I use ear buds before but always falls out of my ear in gym. But these are perfect. Sound so unbelievable rich sound don't know what to do with my old beats now.
0,Worked fine at first.  Now the keep loosing the Bluetooth connection.
1,"At a quarter the price, better than the Beats Wieless ones which failed after less than two years. Connects to my iPhone each time. Never drops a stream when I am running. Excellent fidelity."
1,"Fairly decent headphones, particularly for the price.  I'm mostly listening to talk, not music,  but the music is not bad on here. My complaint with them is that (per the manual) you shouldn't leave it charging for too long -- you kind of have to just watch it and unplug it when it's done charging (when the light turns blue).  It's easy to miss that.  They say they don't recommend overnight charging.<br /><br />I like that this will automatically connect to two bluetooth devices (Phone and tablet in my case).  It's a bit of a hassle to set it up initially -- not super intuitive -- and devices have to be paired in the correct order or the button will send a &#34;play&#34; request to the wrong device to pull your music/audio from.  But honestly,  once you figure out the setup quirks for multiple device pairing, it's fine.<br /><br />Also -- if you have two devices paired (tablet and phone in my case) but then you walk out of range of one (such as, I leave my tablet in my car to walk in a store but I have my phone in my pocket), the headphones will give you a really horrible choppy audio experience as they try and try and try to search for the 2nd device.  Also, if it is expecting to pair to a 2nd device and the 2nd device is just not there, it will do the same choppy audio for the 1st device for a minute as it searches for the 2nd device.  A little annoying, but forgivable for some headphones that are wirelessly transferring audio from my phone via magic."
1,"Very happy with the product, easy set up to get them up and running,  great item I would definitely recommend"
1,"Great sound, good range, fast shipping, nice product"
0,Sound is good when they actually connect and don't skip like an old record.
1,really good deal for the price... sound quality pretty good
1,My husband loves these. I'm thinking about getting a pair for myself and a back up pair to have around the house.
1,These headphones are comfortable and the sound quality is good. I'm very happy with this purchase.
1,They are great.  I love them.  They are perfect for everyday use and i use them for running and working out.  Better than airpods in my opinion.
1,Incredible and affordable!!!
1,"What I like about this headset:<br /><br />- The price is outrageously good for a pair of functional wireless earbuds.<br />- Even the low volume setting is quite loud, which is ideal if you’re running or working out in these.<br />- The sound actually improves when you figure out the right earbud fit and are able to twist/lock them in right. I’m impressed by the sound for the price.<br />- They really stay in place when you have them on; ideal for running!<br />- It comes with a keychain and a hard case, both of which are a nice quality. I love the case, it’s solid and the zipper is surprisingly well made.<br />- The wire in the back is probably not as annoying as you think. I tie it up into my ponytail when I run and it’s not noticeable in the least. Also, I can just pull them out on the go and have them hang around my neck— they’re not gonna get lost like AirPods.<br />- It connects quickly and charges quickly.<br />- Waterproof is correct because I got caught in a thunderstorm the other day and they were unaffected.<br />- People have mentioned that the connection flickers sometimes, but I’ve found the Bluetooth connectivity to be very stable.<br /><br />Some downsides:<br /><br />- The bass, if too heavy at times, muddles the sound. It is definitely not crystal clear HD sound.<br />- There’s a background fuzzy static noise when they’re on. Not noticeable when music is playing but it’s a little irritating.<br />- The battery life seems to be less than 8 hours.<br />- It’s not entirely noise cancelling. Wind especially gets really loud when running.<br />- Getting them on your ears is a tiny bit tedious, and they tend to hurt my ears after a while, so I wouldn’t recommend them for day-long use. For a workout session, or bus/bike commute perhaps.<br />- The little flap for the charger is really flimsy. I thought it was going to snap off the first time I charged it, but it hasn’t.. yet.<br /><br />They’re about as good as it’s going to get for ~$22, if you’re trying to budget. Just remember these aren’t at all high end, and for their price point, I would definitely recommend them if you want a working exercise/commuting headset. I quite like these Senso earbuds and I’m happy with my purchase. They get 5 stars because they’re overall well worth the price. But if you’ve got the money and are ok with spending more, buy more expensive ones."
1,Excellent packaging and build quality.  The Senso Bluetooth headphones are comfortable and have great sound quality.  I am very happy with them.
1,"These work great! I would compare them to PowerBeats2, which cost 3-4 times as much as these. I borrowed my son's PowerBeats2 for several months but needed to get my own pair of wireless Bluetooth headphones. I did my research and decided on these. I have used them only for 2 days, but am convinced they are just as good. Time will tell on the longevity.<br />Of course the ear buds come with a charge cord. But also included is a BONUS charge cord!! Those are always needed at our house! The bonus cord in the package is a USB-to- lightening plug/mini-usb cord. It's so very convenient!! It's either/or lightening or mini-usb! I can use it to charge my iPhone, or my portable battery pack, or several other electronic devices which require mini-usb... all in one!<br />I appreciate the case also, which is a sturdy plastic that zips shut.<br />They are comfortable also... there are several sizes of ear pads to find the comfort needed. The memory foam pads they come with are very comfortable... but they drown out any external noise. That may be desirable to some, but I use them mainly to walk or ride bike and need to hear a vehicle coming.<br />The battery charged very quickly when I got them... went to fully charged in 20 min., and are still going after about 2 hours.<br />I also like the fact that when I put them on, and turn them on, a voice in the ear buds say &#34;power on&#34;; when connected to device, says &#34;connected&#34;; and likewise when &#34;disconnected&#34; and &#34;power off&#34;... since the lights aren't always easy to see. This, to me, is an improvement over the beats, which just made a certain noise when turned on, off, and connected.<br />I personally love the idea that they are connected to each other, with a small cord, and fit in, as well as around my ear. I keep things for a long time, and I am certain if they were smaller and not connected, I might lose one.<br />If you are looking for this type of wireless ear buds, I highly recommend these!"
1,Excelent!! Shipped on time!!! I LOVE IT!!!
1,"Overall, it is a good product. The audio quality is fine, but not supper, you get what you paid for. The bluetooth is easy to setup and use."
1,"These headphones are awesome, but I don't write reviews"
1,"The product met and exceeded my expectations , great sound and very comfortable to wear"
1,"This product is great... And the company is even better.. I bought these SENSO headphone by invotek about six months ago. Great quality sound and quality material from the soft silicon ear hook; hooking over your ear, to the entire headphone.. The best thing is the customer service, the reason I say this is because it comes with a one year warranty and unfortunately I had issues is the unit within six months out of the blue but emailed them around 1am in the morning and they replied within a couple of hours with two more email they emailed me a well really professional and down righ nice letter saying they are sorry to hear that I'm having issue with there product, another email to confirm my address and two days later a got a new unit with no problems.. Will definitely buy from this company again.."
0,They sounded great for about a week but now sound awful.  Sounds like a blown speaker.
1,These headphones are my favorite right now
1,"the sound quality is good. the ear fit is comfortable and easy to place. they do seem to be water proof as i attempted to swim with them and after realizing there can be no bluetooth connection under water, put them out to dry and they worked well on dry land afterward! i had mistakenly and ignorantly thought i could use them to swim-the purpose for which i bought them for their 7px rating. until they come out with sonar earbuds, i'm not going to be able to use them to swim and listen to music! i would have given them a 5 star if they had been compatible with Siri."
1,"I received a pair of these in Dec. as a gift. I liked them so much I gave a pair to my mom. Easy to operate, very good battery life and most important great sound."
1,These things rock!  lots of bass and clear sound
1,Work great.  No more worrying about cords getting in the way or ear buds falling out while exercising at the gym.
0,"I bought these at the beginning of January, I use them almost daily, and they have died in August. Today they just quit. I feel like they should have lasted longer. I won’t buy this brand again."
1,"Great sound and valued, syncs immediately, has voice on/off notification-great feature. Replaced the silicone tips with Comply memory foam tips..great sound and stays in ear well."
0,Stopped Pairing with my iPhone a month after purchase.
1,just one word awesome!
0,"Did not like them at all right away. Called to return and the rep told em to try them for longer. I did, still didn't like them. Am still trying to return. Now when I call to ask where my return label is they say they can't help I need to go through Amazon. Frustrated."
1,"I have never owned a pair of wireless earbuds, but I had high expectations for these based upon read reviews and value.<br />First impression: they were stylish and easy to use, however once I put them on they looked a bit big next to my ears.  Vanity aside, the volume wasn't anything to write home about and the comfort was sub par as they jostled around while wearing sunglasses.  Without the glasses, I didn't have any issues.  I am happy with the product for the price and for my first wireless set I give it 3 out of 5 stars."
1,Quality sound!
1,My Grandson Loves it.
1,Works great - third set I bought for members of my family.
1,"This Bluetooth came to me well package and i finally got it to pair.  I really had a time trying to pair it with my iPhone.  I was going to send it back and purchase another brand.  But i went to you-tube and i saw what i need to do.  I was trying to pairing it from the charger and that really didn't work at all.  So i learn never pair a Bluetooth while charging it up.  Thanks for such a wonderful product.  So if you have another Bluetooth  that is made more for a truck driver, please send me information on it.  I would like to see one that i can use with out putting plugs in my ear..ok<br /><br />Thanks again it does work rather well.."
0,"Not bad headphones.  Sound quality was descent.  HOWEVER, I have only owned these for 4 months and they are already not holding a charge and constantly disconnecting from my device during use."
1,"I have only been using these for about a week but so far they are great.  They charge quickly and last a long time.  They last a long time between charges.  I have used with my TV and with my iPhone on a recent trip.  Good sound, comfortable.  I would buy them again.  Very reasonable price."
1,Good for the price. Fit my ears nicely. Bass distortion at higher volume levels. No issues otherwise. Solid 5/7
1,Great for price
1,"So far, I love them. They are comfortable and loud enough to play my drums. I was tired of a cord head set, so these are working great so far.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Will Dillard"
0,"Start off great, very comfortable and the sound was good. However it appears as with any decent priced blue tooth the sub par electronics don't last. Mine are in mint condition, kept in the case and very well treated but they just quit. Chords didn't break battery didn't go bad they just wont turn on and quit while on a phone call. If I plug them in and turn them on which you can't they give a double beep letting you know but unplug them and nothing just plain dead after 8 months. I guess if you don't want to spend hundreds of dollars you have to get used to purchasing new headphones a couple times a year. I guess I'll see how their guarantee is."
1,I love the headphones. They have a great sound and they stay in during my workout.
1,Thank you for the excellent quick delivery last Saturday. I ordered several items at Amazon and yours came in first. I thoroughly pleased with the sound. I quickly put a drop of crazy glue on the connection joints to avoid accidental disconnction as what happened to my previous LG headsets. the earbud connection got severed one after the other. The sound is extraordinarily clear and the bass was loud and clear.
1,Received my headphones a few days ago. They work great and the volume control is very good. I have other wireless headphones that the volume doesn't go very high.
1,"This headphone is good, it was delivered on time, the accessories are good too. The price was good, but as expected the sound quality is not exceptional. I still prefer the sound quality of Apple headphones which come with the iphone. However, for a simple and good wireless headphone for exercising, this headphone is a good option."
1,"Great headphones! Easy to use, comes with multiple accessories. Very satisfied."
0,"I bought these because they were recommended by amazon and for the 8 hour battery life. Sadly, these do not work for answering phone calls. Do not buy these for the microphone it's horrible. I actually switched back to wired headphones due to this issue."
1,"This is my 2nd pair.  I bought my first pair 3 yrs ago and they finally died, but for less than $20 you can't beat these for the easy pairing with an Iphone and they are very comfortable with great sound!"
1,I’ve had them for a while and use them a lot to watch tv. Great value!
1,I have had my new head phones for 1 day now and so far they are just what I wanted. I need to be able to watch TV without disturbing my family. The Bluetooth function works very well for that. The controls are easy to use.<br />I do notice that I can see the flashing light reflected in my glasses whle I am watching TV. That should be corrected. It can be distracting.
0,Stopped charging after a month of purchase
1,Great ear buds for the price.
1,Great...
1,They have prettt good range. Spund qaulity is amazing for the price. Comfortable feel as well
1,"What an awesine bargain, Sound as good as my Jams that do NOT have the ear hook that make these totally functional for gym and running"
1,"These came quickly, and work wonderfully. They were for my son, and he loves them. Wears them to workout, and study. And everything in between."
0,"I was in the market for Bluetooth earbuds for running but not wanting to drop a whole bunch of money in the process...simply I wanted something sweat proof and comfortable that would stay in my ear. I base a lot of what I buy through reviews which is why these earbuds caught my attention for the price. I received them today and after giving them a full charge I went to pair them with my IPhone 6, it only took 2 seconds BUT as soon as I went to play my music the connection was lost...I went through the trouble shooting section in the book and tried everything including a factory reset. I decided to let them charge another hour just to make sure I gave the earbuds a complete charge. It states in the book that a solid red light means it's charging and a solid blue means they're fully charged. Double checking the light I got a solid blue so I tried again to pair and after 30 more minutes still nothing...I will say that when I tried them on that they were comfortable but that means nothing if they don't work..."
1,love these - stay charged for a good long while
1,"Yes, like another buyer of this wireless headphone set said, STOP reading reviews and order one now.  For the money you will not find a better set with such impressive sound and it's easy to set up."
1,I’m loving this bluetooth. Perfect for my gym workouts and has a nice radius where I can workout and walk away from my phone
1,Work great for workout or hands free driving.  Easy to sync
1,"Nice, quality headphones. They stay in place while running, have good battery life, great sound quality. No issues with Bluetooth connectivity."
1,"The music plays well and it does sound good. My only gripe is it is hard to ensure it does not move around my ear. I tried all three of the buds to get a snug fit but as I run I noticed that occasionally the earpiece would move causing it to shift a bit out of my ear. I occasionally have to re-adjust the earbud in my ear during a single run.<br /><br />I am a male that is 5' 9&#34; 170 lbs. So I am not a small guy or a big guy. I would expect them to fit a tad better. Either way, I will still use them :)"
1,"I can honestly say for the price, the quality and battery life are perfect.  From the first day and on, the battery has been phenomenal.  I got a full day of work (almost 8 hrs) out of each charge so far and it's been awesome."
1,"Great price for great product, with extras. L9ve the car charger and various ear bud sizes."
1,For $36 they are pretty amazing. Amazing.
1,Works great! Pick up is better distance than the beats headset  I replaced. Quality and price of this headset is so much better. I purchased 2 pairs and we use them to connect to our tv every night. They are so soft fitting around the ear you forget you are wearing them.
1,Good sound deep base better than most I’ve bought that were much more expensive
1,"Bottom line - these don't fall out when running. The sound quality on these,unfortunately, is not as good as my Jaybirds (which don't stay in my ears when running). I would say the sound is muddy, which is a disappointment. But for $36 I'm not complaining too much, I just wish the sound was brighter. And I'm not an audiophile."
1,"Sounds was very perfect. If the headphones cord is softer, it's more perfect."
1,"Work great with all phones, no need to pay $150 (or more) for BT headphones that are easily lost. Great product, good sound, connects reliably."
1,"Sounds ok, a bit crackly at times, you get what you pay for I guess."
1,Very nice headphones!  Nice case!  Well worth the price!
0,a lot of static - can't really used them as &#34;wireless&#34;.
1,I got these for the prime day deal black friday was suppose to be $29 something and was charged full price of $36 something. the ear buds hurt my right ear and sound quality is not to easy/smooth and clear like my samsung wire buds but they do stay in my ears working out so thats a plus till i find something better.
0,I never get them. They didn't get deliver.
1,"My son likes his birthday gift.  He tells me they stay on your ears and the buttons for volume, pause/play... are easy to use.  The reasonable price makes it a great purchase."
1,Great headsets and  you get a free cellphone holder for your car.  Nice purchase
1,I would give it 5 stars if it didn't have a buzzing noise which is noticeable at low volumes / in a quieter room (where I have mostly been using them).  When working out with these it would be less noticeable.
1,I was impressed by the quality of sound and their comfort. A great product especially for the price.
1,Has foam ear buds that are great for working out. They like form to your ears and stay in really good!
1,Product is perfect. Completely happy with this purchase.
1,"I have been searching for a well deserved product, and I am so delighted to have come across,<br />  &#34;SENSO Active earbuds&#34;.<br />Now, I can comfortably do my long distant walking  without having to be entangled with the long cord ear buds or occasionally  them falling out ."
1,"Great product for price, won't feel bad if I lose them.  Doesn't have great range"
1,So far they are wonderful.  I hope they continue to work out
1,These head phone is the best one's i have had yet. They are Loud and cancels out the noise around you. Great to talk on the phone with also. Stays in while you run and doesn't hurt your ears. You won't be sorry!
0,"I bought these because they had RAVING reviews, but the sound is TERRIBLE. I knew that being as inexpensive as they were I wasn't going to get five-star sound, but the fuzziness and base is son as that I can't even understand anyone on the other line when I try to use them for phone calls. Maybe I got a bad pair and this was a fluke, but I'm not spending more money to find out!"
0,"I really liked these during my first run.  Great, I thought...I charged them and prepped everything for my second run.  I had to turn back home immediately to grab another pair of headphones because these were dead.  Hmm, maybe I accidentally discharged them right after I finished charging them.  When I looked earlier, theblue light was on and I left them on my desk with nothing touching them and nothing turned on but maybe I accidentLly pressed the buttons.  I tried charging them again and when I came back to test them, the headphones were totally dead.  These headphones suck.  They still do not charge!  In other matters, the play button is too easy to press as you are trying to shove them into your ears.  The pads for the ears buds are way too large even though I have the smallest ones on them.  Headphones are a totL fail."
1,They arrived right on time.  I bought these for my son and he loves them.
1,"I really like the headphones. Seems to keep a charge for a long time (I never timed it, but plug in when I remember). It tells you when the charge is low, which is nice.  The ear pieces could be a bit firmer, but they're fine."
1,"These have such Great sound quality. Only 4 out of 5 stars for the simple fact that I wish the ear hook was somehow adjustable. They are one size fits most, but apparently I have tiny ears because they are too big on me, and feel loose but somehow don't fall off at least."
1,"No issues so far, clear crisp sound and the bass hits really good too. Better than some Skull Candy and headphones that come stock with smartphones. Stay in place while moving, and buttons are easy to use."
1,"They have great reception, I just wish they would fit more snug around the ears."
1,"-Sound quality is deep and rich<br />-Battery life can practically last a full days use,<br />-Headphones fit mostly secure but could be better as while I know they won't come off, they still feel somewhat look around the ear. (Could because it makes it more comfortable for the user)<br />-Small travel pouch is nice with a secure outer protection layer<br />-Multi port cord set is a nice complementary addition<br />-Nice touch with the multiport car charger for the headphones as well<br /><br />*One thing I'd fix<br />(Possible smaller sized ear bud attachments than what was given to choose from) When wearing the ear buds, within a hour or less they can start to irritate my inner ears and this is without running but medium movement during my working hours."
1,"lower cost, effective and good with battery life."
0,"Out of box, one ear is fine, but the other has lots of noise. Returned right away"
1,"Even just in the shower, the sound gets muffled.  Dry them out and after a few times, the charging port fails after a month or two."
1,"For the price I don't think you could find a better offer. The headphones fit nice, have at least a 3 hour battery life, Stay connected to my phone with no problems, the sound quality was nice, the price is low, and came in a nice little packaging with a decent carrying case. I use these everyday at the gym and haven't had a problem yet"
1,I do like these headphones.  I use them for phone conversations and listening to music.  Good value for the money.
1,"Agree with all the other reviews here.  These headphones are great, especially for the price.  They are very comparable to the headphones they're obviously copying - even including the muddy low end.  As other people have said, change the EQ on your phone to &#34;bass reducer&#34; or similar and they sound ok.  I've only used them once so far, but they seem like they'll hold up.  They do seem a bit lighter than the other brand, so I wonder if that means less battery capacity - after a 1 hour workout, they were down about 10%, which seems ok with me.  We'll see how many charge cycles the battery lasts.  The controls are a little wonky, but they're easy to get used to.  All the extras are a great bonus though.<br /><br />Best thing is the memory foam tips that I bought for the other brand also fit these.  Score!"
0,"We ordered 2 pairs, one broke within first10 days (just stops working) - got replacement which also lasted for week and stopped working. Quality is questionable. These we great few years ago, clean sound, long life, that's why we ordered it again, but the quality changed drastically."
1,"These are simply amazing for the price. I got them, charged them and tested the phone mic before taking a long run. These are well constructed and very comfortable. I just ordered a second pair for my wife. I would give these as gifts. They are so well made."
1,"After some days of extensive testing, I have to say that those headphones are great!. Their confortability in Gym sessions and even walking in the street is very good."
1,"Fantastic so far! Perfect for the gym when I need hands free. I've never been able to find ear buds like this that fit around my smaller ears, but so far these are working great!"
1,"Great quality product. I love the noise canceling quality. It will tell you when you turn them on, connect to your device, and power off."
1,"How can you beat the price of these?  The sound quality may not be the absolute best but if you are working out, playing golf, or washing the car, these are incredible.  I have small ears so the combination of the buds and clips are perfect for me."
1,Noise cancelling is BS. Other than that they are good.
1,Great headphones sound is great  worked well with phone person on other line could hear me loud and clear.... only reason for not the full 5 stars is because of the fit the buds fit in the ears just fine just the ear loops are a little loose but on the plus side they don't fall out
1,Easy to start up. So comfortable! Highly recommended
0,"I really was happy with these headphones until they stopped working after 3 1/2 months.  I have had much more expensive headsets but for the money these were a good fit.  Unfortunately,  they only lasted 3 1/2 months of use for working out 3-4 hours per week."
1,"Great sound, easy to connect.  Only problem is the ear hooks are a little too flimsy and don't stay in place well.  I wish they were a bit stiffer."
0,"This product is great when it works , a long battery and a good sound. It died 6 months in completely. The seller replaced the product. another 6 months in, the new one dies again, this time no replacement, since it is over the 1 year mark. if you want headphones that last 6 months these are great. get the 2 year warranty next to the product. the company was good in replacing the headphones the first time without any qualms. good product while it lasts"
1,I wish the over the ear loop was more rigid. It really doesn't help much to keep the bud in the ear. Which is something I need as most buds fall out with me and the reason I usually don't buy ear buds
1,"good quality , sound is very good only one thing is that comes off from my year often . my ear is too small I  never found good stick in earplugs for me yet.  me yet,"
0,If you have an iPhone and want to lose your hearing in less than a year.<br /><br />These headphones are so loud even on the lowest volume that it hurts. I contacted their support team for help but they told me all BT headphones are loud with Apple. I have other pairs of BT headphones and have never had this problem. Would not buy these or recommend them.
1,Love it with great sound and easy fit. No excessive cable.
1,"Updated Review:<br />I liked these so much, I bought 3 more pair for Christmas gifts.  Everyone that received them liked them.  Honestly, for the money, you can't beat them.  As far as the negative reviews that you see, they are all nit picking.  If the headphones don't sound good, change the ear bud tips.  As all ear buds, they have to fit.  These came with plenty of different sizes to choose from.<br /><br />Original review:<br />I have been using these for 2 days.  My first impressions are that they are an OUTSTANDING value for the money.  They came with 4 sets of different sized ear-bud tips.  Plus a 2 port car charger and a cable that is compatible with both Iphone and Android.<br /><br />They sound just fine and are extremely comfortable.  The hook around the ear is made of a silicone type substance which is very flexible.  This makes them extremely easy to put on and off as well as very comfortable.<br /><br />I highly recommend them."
1,"Just received these new earbuds. Very pleased great sound and user friendly. Would highly recommend, they stay in place when active."
1,Great sound and long battery life!
1,I love this headphone so much using for my running.
1,"I've purchased several Bluetooth earbuds, and the Senso Bluetooth headphones are by far the best I've purchased. They are by far the best product for the price. One tip, charge the headphones fully before  trying to &#34;pair&#34; them to your device."
1,These are worth it my friends. They provide good bass which is something I love in headphones. Sound is clear. You won't regret purchasing these.
1,"Love these headphones. I was originally going for a $300 pair and decided to give these a try first. I'm so glad I did. I use them primarily at the gym while listening to Pandora, and I'm hearing lyrics more clearly than ever - recognizing words I've missed for years in some songs. They are easy to link and to control - you'll master the technology in one or two listening sessions. They do fit a bit loosely on the ears, but they don't fall off. Highly recommended."
1,"So far I've used these for 2 runs and 1 gym visit, and I'm blown away by how great they sound and work ESPECIALLY given the price. Though they aren't quite the right size for my silly little ears, they don't pop out when I'm running. I've tried 3-4 different brands and these are the best by far. I really hope the honeymoon continues!"
0,"I’ve had these headphones for all of about 6 months. All of a sudden they stopped holding a charge. Despite their claim for a long lasting battery, I would fully charge them and then within 12 minutes of use I would receive the low battery warning.  They would shut off, which was extremely frustrating since I just began a workout, and then hour later seem to have recharged themselves to half battery, only to shut off again. I reached out to Senso to see if they were defective and have been ignored."
1,Very nice and comfortable
1,"I have had these for six months so far so good. Very good sound, comfortable for working out. I know other reviewers have had some issues but they are holding up well for me. I did take some precautions and have not stored them in the car. Very happy with my purchase so far."
1,"Sound quality is great, price is great, call quality slightly lower than sound quality or would’ve gotten 5 stars, but for the price still an awesome deal, time will tell for how well they stand uo"
1,"Everyday use, sound and feel great. Working great. connected to my bluetooth right off."
1,"These work great! They come with the typical three different size ear pieces. They also came with some thicker Red, cushioned, foam-like ear piece, so a 4th set. The instruction don't mention them, but all I can gather is that they are noise canceling? Haven't tried them yet. They pair easily. I love the buttons. They are not tricky like other pairs I have had. They come with a charger for your car and for the house. These are really great quality! The cords for charging are even reinforced in the areas that these type of cords tend to break and fray. Ok, my favorite part....drum roll...the part that wraps around your ears. I have these little ears.  These type of head phones normally fall right off. But, this pair, that ear piece is bendable. I can mold it to actually fit my ear. What a relief!"
0,These were rubbish. They worked for a couple of months and then nothing.
1,ARE YOU KIDDING ME!! For this price!! What a great set of ear buds that have Bluetooth capabilities. Excellent sound quality. You get these and it won’t disappoint.
1,Love these. Best i have owned.
1,"Pretty nice headphones! Picked them up on my way to the gym, charged them until I got to the gym (maybe 10 minutes), paired with my phone fairly easily and worked fine for my 45 minute workout. Only concern so far is they get a little loose while running, not falling out, but loose enough to hear gym noise. As other people said the bass is a little heavy but its not a big issue for me."
1,I received Bluetooth as promised. I love the product. Only complaint is that it took a while to oairbti mt phone and I’m still working on fitting it to my ears. It’s a little big but I can work with it. Sound quality is great. I have not experienced the noise canceling or the gym as yet. So far I love it and all the little accessories that came with it.
1,"Received in a timely manner. Actually received my package because they get stolen often. These headphones are sleek, nice looking & work perfectly. No complaints. Will let you know how they are holding up in a couple of weeks."
1,"Edit#1:  The company has reached out and taken the action to ship me a new set.  Will further update the review when I op test the new set.<br /><br />Edit#2:  I have received the replacement unit and it functions perfectly.  It immediately paired and maintained its pair for a 40 minute run.  Thanks to SENSO for standing behind their product.<br /><br />Original:<br />I have had this product for a month, and cannot give it more than one star. I will give the manufacturer credit for fantastic packaging.  It came with a very nice storage case, charge cable, thunderbolt cable, and car USB adapter.  All of those products look great and function as expected, with the exception of the thunderbolt cable being unable to charge an iPad.<br /><br />However, the earbuds themselves simply don't work.  In more than 15 workout sessions I have never managed to have the earbuds hold a stable uplink with my phone (iPhone 6s).  I have tried everything I can think of.  I wear my phone on my right arm, so as to be as close to the receiving earbud as possible, and the connection still constantly cuts in and out.  I have never used them at less than a full charge.  I have tried these with multiple devices, Android and Apple, with no success.  They have been nothing but a distraction, which is definitely not the point of wearing earbuds during a workout.<br /><br />Spend a few dollars more.  No matter how much these cost the value is still zero if they don't work."
1,"This is my second pair of these headphones.  I would still be using the originals had I not stepped on them! These are the best wireless headphones I have owned and that includes many of the top name brands. They are comfortable, long lasting, and sound incredible. The seller delivers quickly and follows through to make sure you are satisfied with the purchase.  All this at a price 75% below the higher priced competitors for a product that performs on a similar level..  A great value!"
1,I am a distance runner and I have an extremely hard time finding earbuds that will comfortably stay in my ears while I am running. These are the first pair I've tried that actually stay in place! The sounds quality is great and I've had no trouble with battery life.
1,So far these are the best headphones I have ever used.
1,Excellent head phones. They are Light and fit perfectly. Sound quality is great and most of all I don't have to fiddle with them while running.
1,"Stay in place, excellent value, better sound than my Apple pods, I haven’t maxed out the distance yet, so can’t comment on that, they do charge quickly and the function buttons are easy to access and figure out after using once or twice."
1,"These connect easily, are plenty loud enough, and block enough noise that I can listen to audiobooks in the gym. My only complaint is that the part that goes over the ear is a bit floppy an unwieldy (though it does work), and that they're a bit uncomfortable. That said, I find all in-ear headphones to be a bit uncomfortable. Overall, would recommend."
1,"I bought these as a Valentine's gift for my husband on a deal. He really liked them, wore them to work and someone stole them.<br />I bought him another pair which made him happy . He says they make work more enjoyable! Who doesn't want that. Price was great , arrived super fast and he likes them. Couldn't ask for more."
1,Great service of headphones
1,I just tried them out at the gym this morning. They are fantastic. The sound quality is great I felt like I was hearing parts of songs I never heard before.  It was also very easy to switch songs. I have an android and had no issues connecting at all.  I haven't tried the microphone part out yet but am certain that that feature will be good as well. I had another brand of earbuds that kept falling out of my ears and it was a major pain trying to run. These fit snug and didn't slide or move.  I am very happy with this purchase!
1,I love my new SENSO BLUETOOTH HEADPHONES
1,I love these headphones!  Best thing I have bought in years.
0,Horrible sound quality!
1,These are by far the best headphones I've ever owned. I bought Beats because I thought they were good based solely on price. I was running a half marathon and it began to rain. Those headphones shorted out within 3 miles. Never again.<br />The headphones held up in the rain a few times and they still work. Great quality and they withstand rain and sweat. What else can you ask for? And great price...
1,"sound is clear , no echo , wire is practical , strong , i will buy another one"
1,Best headphones I’ve ever used :)
0,Would not buy again. Looses signal all the time and phone is only in my back pocket. Sound quality is good. Nois canceling is fair at best.
0,Great sound. The cover for the charge port is very hard to open. Mine tore off the second time I went to charge them. No longer water resistant. Disappointed buyer.
1,"As an incomplete quadriplegic, I spend quite a bit of time listening to music on an MP3 player and the Senso sports Bluetooth earbuds are wonderful to use."
1,"For the cost, they are not bad at all."
1,Lo uso para correr es muy bueno
1,Headphones were just as described. Great quality.
1,"Great product with nice attention to details. Comes with plenty of accessories. Good sound, easy to pair."
1,Great sound quality and very comfortable fit
0,Really good ear buds works great however when the battery is low the volume goes down so make sure you keep it charge other than that great product.
1,Terrific ear buds and the price can’t be beat! These were exactly what Ibwas looking for. The special flash sale made them impossible to ignore. I’m grateful that I didn’t ignore them.
1,"Great product for the price , easy to set up and use , and decent sound"
1,"I've only had my SENSO headphones for a few days but they are an excellent product, the set up is fast and easy, they are comfortable and I am very pleased with them."
1,I am very pleased with my earphones.  I use them when I go walking.
1,I love my new Sesno bluetooth headphones.  Great sound and block out a lot of outside noise.
1,"I was a little skeptical about purchasing these only because I wasn't sure I would really get great sound at such a low price point, but I was so wrong! I love these headphones. I love how soft the piece is that fits over your ear. I have had some that really can be bothersome. I do not consider myself an audiophile perfectionist, but I do know when sound is flat. You will not get flat sound with these. I really enjoyed listening to my music with these headphones and appreciate the sound quality. I use these in my office and the only thing I wish I could change is that the lowest volume setting could be reduced just a tad more. At the lowest volume setting when paired at the lowest volume setting with my iPhone, it is still a bit too loud for use in my office. When I try to turn my volume down more using the headset, it just mutes the audio, but does not turn it down any more. Regardless, I still am glad I purchased these and I am sure they will be perfect during a workout."
1,"Overall I am happy with the product, it does drop out when I have my phone in my left pants pocket."
0,"Bought a pair in mid-May, which died on July 1.  Wouldn't recommend these to others."
0,"they worked well for a short time, and now refuse to take a full charge and do not keep working but for a short time! And I need to know if I can return these and get another set."
0,"Kind of clunky, can't seem to find the right fit with the supplied ear pieces. They don't stay in my ears well and I am constantly fiddling with them on runs."
1,So far so good. I am proud to say this old lady figured out how to set them up and loves using them.
1,"Great sound and great price for these headphones.  Just adjust the EQ on your iPhone and the earphones can handle it-deep bass, treble, etc.<br />The nice thing about these is they fit nicely in your ears, so you block out noise and do not have to turn the volume up to hear them.<br />Great for working out."
1,"Can't deny it, it really sounds good. Am enjoying It so far"
1,Good product
1,Great purchase. They sound great and connect very easily. There are different size ear buds so it is a guaranteed fit. Will purchase again.
1,After throwing away 10-20 pairs of $20 headphones I finally found something that was well-made and waterproof!  The $35 price was fair given the quality of the product.
1,I've had these for about a month now and use daily. They hold a charge for about 2-3 days if I use them for 3-4 hours a day. Easily charged by plugging into the computer and does not take long at all to get a full charge. I use these at the gym and running outdoors and then do not bounce or come loose at all. (And I'm very picky about head phones!) I would buy these again.
0,"The headphone went dead completedly after 9 months!  It was used for about 4-5 hours a week, and was stored in the little sealed box when not used."
1,"Best I have purchased, all features are functional but behind ear piece could be a little more stiff for my preference. Out of range connect is perfect for me I have a bad habit of laying down phone and walking away. Set up and pairing was user friendly, I will recommend this brand."
1,"For the price, these headphones are great. The sound quality is decent, not the best, good enough for working out at the gym. The ear loops do an adequate job keeping them secure to the ear, except for when jumping rope. Otherwise, they are super easy to use, comfortable, and perform well."
1,Lasts all day at work and good quality
1,"I don't leave many reviews, but I feel compelled to comment on these headphone since I'm so pleasantly surprised at the quality on offer at this price point.  There are a number quite nice headphones at even $30-40, but closer to $20 you're more likely to find tinny, lackluster garbage, especially for wireless headphones.  Though these cannot compete with some of the more expensive wired Shure and Etymotics headphones I own for overall sound quality, they hold their own remarkably well at ~1/5 the price.  Bass is overrepresented, which is not my preference, but what's there is not muddy; rather, it's surprisingly full, and it gives a lot of full sized headphones a run for its money. Sound isolation is moderate; these aren't earplug style headphones and they let in some outside noise, but there is definitely a significant reduction.  I can't verify the advertised battery life, but I get through a full day of heavy use no problem, and the controls are all conveniently located.  I've been using them much more than I initially expected despite owning several more expensive sets of earbuds with objectively better audio quality, as these are good enough for a lot of listening and more convenient.  I'd be happy with them at twice the price; at around twenty bucks they're an absolute steal."
0,Will not take a charge or turn on after 6 weeks of owning. Used approx 10 times before they quit working. I've sent a msg to Senso customer service and have received no response.
1,"The sound is great, but they don't stay in my ear.  I have holes / ruptured ear drums so ear cups can't form suction in my ears.  The ear hooks are so floppy they fall out a few minutes into biking or running.  I tried using the cable to wrap around my ear but that was more awkward / painful.<br /> I just couldn't make them work.<br /><br />Sitting on the computer they work great but I really need something with stiff and flexible ear hooks.  Thankfully they never fell of completelyf, just came out of my ears and hung around my neck."
1,Love the headphones.  The voice is pretty clear but the earpiece made a bit big for my ear so left one doesn't stay on my left ear well but other that I love it.
1,"This is my third pair of senso earphones and all of them had weak connection to my iphone even though it was only in my pocket for jogging. The fit for my newest pair bought 1-2 months ago (non red-label) was not that comfortable. Also, all of them are uncomfortable lying down in bed while using them. My initial pair of senso had trouble connecting to my devices as they would show it’s connected but not play to my earphones."
1,"Very good product. Good fit for my ears, and work well with my bluetooth mp3 player. I use them for at least an hour everyday, so I recharge them every 3 or 4 days."
1,These headphones are very well-made and sound great. I primarily listen to audiobooks so I can't attest to the Fidelity that they would provide for listening to music yet I would imagine they would perform very well.
1,One of the best headphones I have used.<br />With this price you will get great sound and durable headphones.
1,Bought these as a backup to a pair I purchased last year.  They've held up through sweaty runs and workouts and look brand new.  Great value for bluetooth headphones.
1,"Just got my new Senso headphones yesterday. I am very impresses, the soft flexible texture for the ring over your ear is great! The sound in my opinion is very good. I put many hours a day on my headphones. The last pair i had i would put about 7 hrs of use everyday. And this pair i will do the same. The noise cancellation is awsome. Really good, the case and accesories are cool too. The charging cable doubles as an iphone charging cable too. That was cool, so far no complaints. I love them. For the price,these are amazing."
1,Very good product at fair price
1,"I've bought a few types of wireless headphones in the $17-$30 range and they worked fine, but  died after about 3 months. I use mine specifically for gym workout and what I like about these is not just the sound (great sound and great bass) but that they do NOT have the mic and volume on the actual cable (it's on the ear piece). I found it's annoying when you have that extra piece of plastic throwing the weight of the cable off balance while you're running, walking, etc..<br /><br />They're super comfortable and stay in your ear really well which is sometimes a problem for me. Comes with two different lengths of cables to charge along with listed accessories. Great headphones... I might actually buy 1 or 2 more for when these actually do die out. Hope this helps. Ah... and I never leave Amazon reviews. haha."
1,Awesome sound! Very comfortable. Paired very quickly.  Many reviewers mentioned a heavy bass response.  I didn't notice it so much.  Smooth sound with nice dimension. Not harsh. So much better than my previous wireless headphones.  Noise cancelling is not quite as as effective as I thought it would be but I've never really heard a pair of noise cancelling headphones before so have nothing to compare it to. This however is not a major problem for me. I would recommend these headphones to friends.  Very happy with my purchase.
1,"I recently purchased my SENSO ActivBuds Bluetooth Headphones and was surprisingly satisfied with my purchase. I own many pairs of headphones, both wired and wireless and these headphones may just be about the best I own. The usual lot either hurt your ears or don't fit very well. These fit almost perfectly. They are very light, and the sound is clear. There is an audible confirmation for connections and this device allows multiple connections simultaneously."
1,These worked perfectly for about 4 months and then went on the fritz - I emailed senso and they responded immediately to try helping out by walking me through the factory reset. Unfortunately it didn't work and instead they replaced the unit free of charge!
1,"These headphones are pretty good. However, I bought them on February 2018 and they no longer work. So, they have a life span of about 1.5 years."
1,They are awesome
1,Service was great.  Good sound on the headset.  I was hoping to wear them under my motorcycle helmet but the profile of the earpiece is a little too high for that.
1,Bought this because of the reviews. I like it. Im a fan of Bose speakers and I appreciate the bass of these small headphones. You'd be pleasantly surprised as well with what comes with it in the box.
1,I've had the headphones for a little over 6 months and they have worked great until recently. I contacted the seller and after some brief troubleshooting they replaced them quickly. Definitely good headphones for the price!
1,"They're kinda bulky and don't fit in my ski helmet (kind of why I got them). They also have a cheap feel to the buttons and wire, BUT the sound is pretty good and they're good for running as the buttons are big enough to grasp without slowing down."
1,gret sound for small device
1,Great phones and absolutely stellar customer service from Tekatron. I wish all Amazon sellers were like this. Buy with confidence!
1,works great. but I was hoping for better bass.
1,"I bought these to run with.<br />Pros, easy connection, comfortable, good sound<br />Con, the reason for a 3 rating is the wind noise. 5-10 mph winds and the wind noise was very high. I tried each size of earbuds included with the headphones and each one had the same loud wind noise"
0,Would charge for a few seconds then quit. I'm not the first to experience this. Dont bother.
1,Great product! They seem very durable and the sound quality is much better than I expected.
1,"Think I stole them on Amazon.  Probably a decent deal at $150+, but in the $30 range you have to buy even if you don't need more headphones.  Outstanding quality, sound, and comfort."
1,"For the price, these are a great value.  I bought them for use in then gym or when I listening to music without a cord.  Don't expect world-beating sound, but it's pretty good.  Setup/connection is easy, fit is good, controls are also easy to use, and the included car charger with android and apple connectors is a nice touch.  Clarity on phone calls not the best when there is background noise - at least that's what people on the other end of the line said.  I'd buy them again.  If fact I did already after losing the first pair I bought. Customer service is excellent.  Had an issue with them holding a charge, but a very short phone call had a new pair on the way at no cost.  Could not have been easier."
1,Ok. Not the greatest but not bad.
1,Stays in place well.
1,"Awesome sound , super comfortable and a great set up of cords , chargers etc"
1,Perfect headphones for my workouts. Does the job nicely
1,"Loved the sound quality and comfort.  The packaging and accessories were really nice quality. Only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the wire behind the neck. I would've preferred a solid neck bar so when I drop one of the buds, it doesn't pull on the other one."
1,"Short & simple review:<br />I have had these headphones for well over a year very close to 2 years. Great sound and bass, very comfortable, battery lasted days at a time without needing charge.<br />I used these while running, sweating, played basketball, during work, practiced kick boxing on a punching bag, and they would not come out. I have dropped these repeatedly, i would throw them in my car & backpack without care because of the durability.<br />Best headphones i have owned.<br />Only 1 minor flaw was the wired cable would get in the way of turning my head, I would have to wear these headphones the opposite direction with the cable infront instead of behind my neck.<br />Almost after 2 years one side decided to stop working. I highly recommend these, i just dont like the cable, and the cable tie kind of helped.. not really."
1,Not very secure in ears
1,Very good earphones. Great quality and stay in the war during a run
1,"Great sound comfortable , like the choice of sizes for ear pieces."
1,Great price and the audio sounded awesome
1,I couldn't turn down the price advertised. Works great so far
1,Very Happy with the headphones. I was impressed with the price and sound.
1,The headphone are perfect !
1,Took a minute to get used to but well worth it!!!
1,"I love this set! I'm one that thought spending over $15 for headphones was silly. But, having purchased at least 3 sets in the past year has cost more. They have enough weight to stay out, but don't feel like their there hanging.<br />I had to contact customer service because I couldn't get my Amazon Fire to connect. iPhone connected right way.  They were helpful and walked me through (hint: turn off IPBT and then turn Fire BT off then back on)<br />The only reason it is 4 is because I'm struggling between connecting w/ both at once. It's frustrating turning off one and turn one on, etc. can't figure it out. I've had cheaper set that connect both at once. Use the cord holder/weight it works to hold set w/ only one ear being used."
1,Excellent quality
1,"great, cear sound. blocks out most noise as well. connects via bluetooth to by samsung 5 phone in a snap. well packaged with helpful other items as well. very happy with the item!"
1,"Sound is good. I'm having issues with the left headphone not producing sound. I'm afraid I will have to return them. Hopefully this pair is just a dud. I'm not sure if I will reorder, their customer service has been helpful and timely."
0,"Worked great for running through heat and semi cold for about 4 and a half months, then thr left side quit working."
0,"These are cheap. but the sound quality is pretty good and they stay in  your ears. However , after 3 months of use, I lost sound in one of the earbuds. SENSO customer service was great and sent me out a new pair. I used them for 3 months, then the same issue happened again.  I use them at the gym and running and I do sweat a decent amount. So now i'm back to square one, looking for a new pair of headphones again."
0,This was my favorite product last year. I bought them/recommended them to friends for the price and good sound. Then one earbud lost audio and it would only come in if it bent the cord just right. I reached out to the seller a few month ago but haven't heard back. I'm going to try these next https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0753GRNQZ/?coliid=I2MYQ29AX4P1NJ&colid=O7PD4N7IJX7H&psc=0&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it
1,Easy to connect. Great sound. Light weight and it’s easy to run with them in.
1,Good quality
1,"**Update: Invotek customer support was 5 stars so I've modified the rating. They immediately honored the 1 year warranty. They did a quick troubleshoot and then sent out a brand new pair of headphones for free. The headphones, like the original, work great.**<br /><br />Two stars because for the first 6 months, the value of these headphones when considering their output for the price was 5 stars. However, the Left phone has unexpectedly stopped working. It occasionally goes in and out but that almost makes it worse.<br /><br />I'm hoping to get a clear understanding of the warranty and exchange process. Hopeful that I can exchange these because they had great performance when working."
1,Great bluetooth earbuds-- love the case and other extras. Seamless pairing. Love them!
1,Bass sounds excellent! Very pleased with these earphones.
1,"Arrived fast, perfectly packed, I've been using it daily mostly for commuting and they are excellent value headphones.<br />I didnt want to spend too much money and after good amount of research I decided to purchase the Senso. Very satisfied with product. You will not be disappointed."
1,Great product!
1,Good quality product!
1,I purchased these on the off-chance that they would be comfortable and I wasn't disappointed! Regular ear buds hurt my ears and as a glasses wearer the headphones that sit on the ears put pressure on the earpieces behind the ear and cause pain so I've to resort to ear-muff type headphones. I hardly know that I'm even wearing these and the silicone earpieces are amazingly comfortable. The sound is also amazing! I can now hear pieces of the song that I've never heard before. Everthing including the carry case and charger cable are quality. I won't hesitate to recommend this set to anyone. Good job Senso!
0,Absolutely unwearable. The ear loops are enormous and dont sit anywhere close to my ear lobes. No way to adjust them either. Dont even know if they work because they wont sit in my ears
1,"Great buy for the price! The earbuds come with a handy carrying case, adapted, charging cords, and additional in-ear piece, including rubber and foam. Great sound, love that they're waterproof."
1,I've gone through 5 or 6 sets of headphones and these are by far the best I've found. This is the first set that I haven't had to use the EQ to adjust the sound quality. Simply great headphones.
1,There exactly like my treblab ear buds but cheaper. I would like to see all the controls on the top of device instead of having the power buttonn the side. It can be a awkward at times.  Adding foam ear tips would be very nice.
0,"Got these headphones through a Facebook promotion, at a a price too good to pass up. While the product themselves were decent enough, the customer service had been so lacking, I regret the purchase.<br /><br />Had an issue with the power button, and the headphones no longer charging, which both were well within the warranty period. I emailed customer service, only to get a reply about a week later, asking to send a photo of the broken headphones. Which I did.<br /><br />Then nothing. Crickets. And guess what? Now they are no longer under warranty. How convenient for them!<br /><br />The product itself is pretty good while it lasted. I used them every single day, even more than my wired Bose earbuds. But, I can't recommend them if they can't back up their product.<br /><br />If you like throwing your $ away, by all means, go ahead. But, I don't think I would buy these again. At any price."
1,"Ok so this review is from a fresh out of the box owner. I read all of the reviews both good and bad and thought what the heck im going to try these out. I have been a loyal Plantronics Bluetooth owner for 10 years ever since i bought my first voyager headset. But straight out of the box these were the easiest headset that i have ever had to pair with.<br /><br />At first i wasn't sure if I would like the design of the headset but once i put it on they were light and comfortable and no matter how i shake my head they are not moving.<br /><br />When it comes to sound i like a variety of music so i started right off with a good EDM Playlist and they didnt fail to meet expectations. The sound isn't as rich as im certain some of the high dollar headsets sound, but it sounds 100x better than previous mid range sets i have owned.<br /><br />I look forward to seeing what the battery life will be like. If they were consistent when it came to the quality in the design im certain they wont disappoint."
0,"Sound is decent, but headphones are bulky, meaning they look like you're always on a phone call and they don't fit your ear that comfortably. The wire connecting the earbuds needs to be a little shorter and a different material, it sticks to your skin so as you turn your head you'll feel a little tug and the wire is always awkwardly mainly to one side. Lastly, the battery definitely does not last 9 hours as claimed in the description. I would not recommend these to anyone."
1,"Audio quality for voice calls is very good.  Listening to music, however, the bass is unnaturally boomy and overpowers the rest of the music."
1,"Love these!!! sound is awesome and the time on Bluetooth is long up to 6-8 hours. Takes no time to re charge. Great for workouts never come out of my ear..I would recommend these for sure, you can not beat the price and the accessories that come with it."
1,"So far, these earbuds have done everything as advertised. I would recommend them to anyone who is looking for a quality device at a reasonable price."
0,"These are a nice pair of headphones and everything works well, but they won't stay in my ear! I couldn't even turn my head without them falling out, let alone try to workout at the gym with them. The ear loop is gigantic and doesn't fit around my ear. Returning ASAP."
1,As promised. As represented. Straight up value. Thanks
1,Excellent product. Sound comparable to Bose Bluetooth headphones.  Very happy with them!!!!!
0,Wind causes noises that crackle. I was happy with the fit and ease of pairing but the sound quality was disappointing.
1,"They are fabulous! They are loud enough to drown out any noise around you, clear sound & 8hr talk time is awesome.  My husband and I primarily use them at work.  He does home remodels and I am field tech support . So we have been through a few pairs of Bluetooth headsets and these are the best we have come across."
1,"Really good headphone, use for running. It does not break the connection when running. Had an issue with one of them but the support attended to it promptly and resolved it. Great!"
0,The headphones have the worst cut out that I've never experienced with Bluetooth before. There's days where it does not stop cutting in and out so I end up throwing the headphones on the floor mid workout because it's extremely annoying.
1,Cheap and effective! I
0,Completely stopped working within a month
1,"They're great, stay in place and the sound isn't bad..."
0,"If you have small ears, do not buy these earphones. The buds don't go in all the way and I thought curving the headphone to go around my ear tightly would help but it did not. It's also a pain to have to curve them around my ear every time I would want to wear them. These earphones are made for people with average to large ears. They are also very clunky and look super dated. If you have smaller ears, and want something that looks nice, do not purchase these. I was duped by all the good reviews... do not believe the hype."
1,"as promised; great product, reasonable price, reliable seller - highly recommend!"
0,"Well they worked good for walking ,but not so good when hitting tennis balls against a wall. Everytime you'd bend over the music was distorted. 3 months later they stopped talking a charge.<br /> I would have made do with them for walking and given a little higher rating if they were still working."
1,Nice headset
1,I love the versatile ear pieces. I can interlock them when not in use which prevents them from falling off my neck.
1,Me agrada la duración de batería y la calidad del equipo.
1,"Quick Pros & Cons:<br />Pros:<br />Price - soo much cheaper than other mainstream brands like Bose or DreBeats<br />Flexible hooks - the plastic over-the-ear hooks grip the back of the ear nicely without the feel of hard plastic.<br />Package &#34;deal&#34; - it's great that the headset comes with a lot of items to help with carrying and maintaining the product.<br />Battery life - Lasted for a while in one charge (~2hrs per day, for 4 days on one charge, turning it off after the 2hr training session).<br /><br />Cons:<br />Not a &#34;truly&#34; secure fit - if doing anything that involves VERY quick change of directions (i.e. football, boxing, dance) earpiece might fly off.<br />Durability is questionable - earpieces of the headset feels &#34;cheap&#34; to the point where if i drop it from head-height, i feel it would break.<br /><br />Background on why i bought these:<br />As a strength and conditioning coach, I train in a variety of sports and training regiments. When listening to music, I prefer headphones that hooks over-the-ears because it feels more secure in my ear when doing a lot of quick-change-of-directions. Earbuds would fly out while sprinting, ear-muff type of headphones are too bulky, and having a cords connected to my phone/ipod sucks. I saw these after researching headsets that would be like PowerBeats but doesn't cost as much as $180.<br /><br />Why i like them:<br />These ActivBuds have been working very well when I'm doing field drills, boxing exercises, and plyometrics. Definitely secure and great when lifting or jogging.<br />It being sweatproof and bluetooth is a &#34;must&#34; for those that train for long hours, sweat a lot, don't like earbuds cause they don't quite fit right, and don't like to have their phone on them during exercises.<br />I like how the company is asking for feedback soo quickly after purchasing them. Seems like they really take in feedback well to make their products better... or that can just be my &#34;wishful thinking.&#34;<br /><br />What I don't like:<br />How cheap it feels. I know i could be getting my money's worth, and i didnt pay much for this headset. It just feels like i can break the headset if i grasped them in my fist too hard.<br />Durability or wear-n-tear on these is TBD cause it is recently mew to me. I would have to update on this aspect 8months later. I have been using this headset on a daily basis so i am definitely racking on &#34;mileage&#34; on them.<br /><br />Possible Improvements?<br />I would like to see the earpieces have a magnet on them so that when you want to take them off your ears, but have them stay wrapped around your neck, the earpieces can &#34;attach&#34; to each other making the headset into a &#34;secure&#34; necklace. They have those for other headphones I have used like the Ironman Headphones."
1,It’s the best this is what I can say👍🏻
1,Have used them once and already know I will be totally pleased with their performance
1,"Incredible value for the dollar! These headphones sound fantastic, deep rich bass, wide soundscape, they sound as good as my more expensive over the ear headphones. You get so  much with one package; a case, multiple earbuds, a car charger, a cord organizer. You can't beat the price or the value"
0,"DONT waste your money.. Battery time sucks, sound quality is great first day and sucks the next and than on.<br />there is no noise cancellation what so ever."
1,"Very comfortable and the functionality is great, 4 stars because the sound quality isn't the best"
1,Great best ever!!!!
1,"I only wear these to the gym and when I am trimming the yard (not mowing) but so far they work great.  I wish there was another size earbud insert just a little smaller but I am making due with the 3 it comes with.  Other than that no complaints, glad I got em."
1,"another great product on amazon that out do products in a much higher price point.<br />great battery life ,waterproof not so much for making calls but then again if that what you need then look elsewhere."
1,"The product is exactly as described, great sound quality, easy pairing, lightweight, noise canceling and it fits perfectly. It is a must recommend."
1,for the price its ok i guess. I fell for the ad on amazon. after a while i had a hard time connect it to the bluetooth.
0,"The sound quality and overall features are good. A very solid value for the money. That said, I purchased these to use while running as I listen to music and audio books, podcasts, etc. If there's even a slight wind, the design of these headphones cause an almost unbearable wind shear sound. This sound is not slight. It drowns out the sound completely. Now if there's no wind, or the wind is with you, the headphones are great. For me, that's a two star. If you're just using them around the house/office, or in a gym, they're a great value. Outside though, not so great. UPDATE: I've tried all of the different ear pieces that come with the package and all of them have the horrible wind sound. Unusable outside. I'm moving on from these."
1,"Got all the emails and shipping info right away, and i love the customer service making sure im happy with my purchase will buy again"
1,They are great. They stay on my ears and the sound is excellent.
1,"So far so good. Love the fit, sound and function. They blow my old head phones out of the water.<br />GREAT VALUE."
1,Sound good. Battery short. Got 5hrs out of it today (not on whole time)
1,Speedy delivery 2 days . bluetooth headphone is very is nice and good sound quality.
0,"The product works well for a little a few months, but eventually gives out. If you are having trouble with it not charging, plug it into a charger and hold the power button down for 5-7 seconds. That worked once to revive it, but not a second time. Know you are getting a product that will not last longer than a year."
1,"I use these when I go to the gym, and I love them. The sound quality is great, the charge lasts for a long time, and they are easy to use. I have small ears and earbuds just won't stay in place most of the time, but since these wrap around the ear with rubber they seem to stay in place."
1,"I had high hopes for these headphones. Unfortunately, there are too many small issues that combine to make a product that is just okay. And I won't buy &#34;just okay&#34; products if given a second chance. So I would recommend continuing your search for a solid product. If you're interested in details, by all means, read on.<br /><br />Packaging:<br />When I got the headphones, they were boxed well. No issues with that. The only minor complaint I have is that the included clamshell is a bit cramped if you want to store the headphones, extra earpieces, and the short USB charging cable. They will all fit, but it takes a little finagling and patience. But if you're like me and bring a backpack with you also, then it's not really an issue. I'm definitely glad they give you a clamshell at all.<br /><br />Physical Aspects:<br />The earpieces are small enough to not look goofy on your head. And the buttons on the right earpiece are small, yet big enough for my sausage fingers to operate without accidentally pressing 2 other buttons. The cable that goes between the earpieces is also of sufficient length and don't snag or get in the way much at all. Unfortunately, that's about where the pros end. The earpieces themselves are uncomfortable, and that's probably the biggest con you can have with earbuds. Now, I'm a large guy. There's nothing small about, including my ears. However the clips that go over the ear are pretty much useless to me as they extend well above my ear. They don't offer any suspension support, so all the weight of the earpiece is bore on the ear canal. For me, unfortunately, that means after about half an hour of use, my ears start to have significant discomfort. I use these for my daily commute, which is about 1.5 hours each way. By the end of the day, my ears are pretty sore. If the clips were somehow adjustable, that could be the saving grace. Until then, these earbuds are the reason I was ever hesitant to switch to buds in the first place. I thought perhaps the rubber pieces were contributing to the soreness, so I switched from the medium to the small, thinking the mediums were just too tight of a fit on my ears. No luck. The smalls were just as painful. Maybe I'm doing it wrong, so if anyone has suggestions, feel free to let me know.<br /><br />Sound Quality:<br />The quality of sound is definitely there. The speakers can push some great sound, however in my case I had to use a 3rd party equalizer app to fine tune the sound. Out of the box, they push too much bass and it sounds kind of like your neighbor playing music way too loud with the door open. The mids and highs are there, but the bass is just a little too much. The EQ app did the trick and the speakers put out some great sound, especially for the price. If you don't mind using an app or have some other way of modifying the different ranges, then these are great.<br /><br />Battery Life:<br />The battery life seems decent. I get about a day and a half's worth of commute time on a full charge, which equates to about 4.5 hours of use or so.<br /><br />Connection:<br />This is another huge con, but it might just be the nature of Bluetooth. On my commute, I go from the farmlands to the Chicago loop and I can tell you down to within a couple minutes of when the Bluetooth will start to act up and cut in and out. Without fail, it is always when I get off the train and start walking around the Loop in downtown Chicago. It may just be the pollution of wireless signals and other Bluetooth devices that causes it, but that is when it will start to stutter and audio will cut in and out. Skipping audio is one of the biggest frustrations I have so needless to say when it gets excessive, I switch back to the more reliable (but far less quality sounding) wired earbuds. In addition, one thing I have noticed that isn't related to location is the stuttering of background sounds. During my commute, I listen to music and one of the games I play has quiet background sounds. While on the train playing this game, the music plays perfectly: no stuttering, no skipping, nothing. But in between songs when it is naturally quiet, I can hear the sound effects of the game stuttering routinely. This is not stuttering due to a Bluetooth connection issue, this is something else. Even during lulls in songs, when the song itself is not skipping, the sound effects will. It's not as frustrating because my ears are focusing on the music and that's working great. But nonetheless, it's there.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Price, sound quality, battery life.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Prone to ear discomfort due to poor clip design, strong audio stuttering in densely populated areas with lots of other wifi / Bluetooth signals.<br /><br />This is one of the rare products that fall into the category of &#34;I wouldn't buy it again, but it's not bad enough to make me want to deal with the hassle of returning it.&#34;"
1,Great headphones and very good sound quality.
1,"Great battery life compared to my last BT earbuds. Great minds and bass too, for the money"
1,"Very good for the price.  Holds a good charge for 5 or 6 hours. Sound is surprisingly good.  Bass is lacking a bit so I knocked off 1 star.  They are NOT noise cancelling -- but they seal well and hold out most noise.  Use mostly for traveling, airports.  Mic is good.  Features are solid.  Comes with nice extras.  Excellent value for the price.  Owned since April of 2017."
1,Best headphones I've used @ 100$ or less
1,"Sound great, the battery last for a long time, and great range..."
0,"I'm a little bit disappointed with the Senso Bluetooth Headphone. Whereas the right ear hook holds firm while exercising, the reverse is the case with the left ear hook. It kept coming off my ear and I had to constantly keep fixing it back on my ear to prevent it from falling off. There is a wide gap between the hook and the ear bud on the left side which is absent on the right side. That may be the reason for this problem."
1,The only problem I have is the assortment of ears plugs so not keep out outside noise.
1,"The earpieces, even though it comes with several adjustable sizes, none of them with fit and stay in my ears. And when it took the headphones out running - which is why I bought them - this became an even bigger problem. Also the over-ear piece, which is flexible and soft, which I appreciated at first, having had running headphones in the past where the over-ear piece is so unforgiving that it leaves a mark - but it was so limp that coupled with the earpieces not fitting in my ears, the whole headset was loose to the point of falling off my head.<br />The sound quality, noise cancelling, and call/mic quality were all great though. Just not a good fit for me."
1,"So far so good.  I've only used these earbuds for two days now but they seem to work great, sound is good, fit and comfort is good, range is excellent, pairing was really simple, controls are simple.  The big test will be running with them, I'll have to wait and see but for now no issues or concerns.  Excellent product."
0,I was disappointed with the way the adapter for the earbuds on the IPhone 7 drained my battery so quickly so I gave these a try.  These are large and bulky and hurt my ears on extended wear.  They also fall off the ear quite easily with movement.  I would not recommend these.  The sound and the case were okay.
0,"I bought a pair of these about four years ago, used them weekly if not daily. Very water resident, battery life was amazing, sound was awesome; plenty of bass and treble. Range was great, connection, atmospheric noise reduction was great. All of a sudden they were gone. Don’t know what happened to them, must have set them down at the gym or dropped out my bag, I don’t know. Ordered another pair because I had such a good experience with the first pair. Quality in hand was greatly inferior. Just felt like cheap plastic. Not nearly as much bass and max volume was less. Battery life seemed to be lacking. Then, all of a sudden, the charger port came lose in the earpiece and couldn’t be charged anymore. So, ordered another pair thinking maybe I just got a fluke crap pair. New pair is here. Feels about the same as broken pair, sound is the same, seems to stop charging before it’s done charging, reception/connection to device is garbage. I lose connection to my phone while it’s in my pocket when I used to be able to basically mow my lawn while my phone was in the house."
1,"My Senso Bluetooth headphones arrived a couple of days ago and I am 100% satisfied. Great sound. Adequate noise cancelling and comfortable fit. At a fraction of the price of a more well known brand, I highly recommended."
1,"I really like my Senso Bluetooth headphones! A couple things though my Bluetooth doesn't stay connected for the 30 ft like the add said, and at times there will be a few seconds that the music stops or lose connection for a very short period of time!"
0,The headset part works well but the car charger arrived totally misaligned. I don't think it was ever QA tested!
0,Bad sound
0,"I bought these to replace my wired headphones/mic for use at work.  The sound is great but the microphone is extremely sensitive.  My clients told me that it sounded like I was at an airport, in a hallway, etc.  They could hear their own voice on delay as they were talking.  I tested it on about 12 different calls and the feedback was the same.  They're ok if you're looking for headphones only but the mic does not sound professional enough for office use."
1,"Husband likes them, they work well and are comfortable"
1,These work very well and are holding up very well to frequent use. I use then while working out. The sound is right good but if you want great you'll most likely spend a lot more money.
1,"These are my wife's, and she hasn't used them much, but she likes them. They certainly are neat and tech-y looking."
1,"I'm a big fan of these headphones. I actually bought this pair to replace my previous ones,which had lasted several years before I broke them. The connection to both my phone and computer is great and sound quality is excellent. There are a few modifications from my last pairthat I really like, such as the malleable-ness of the past that goes around my ear. I have little ears and find that feature to be really nice!"
1,Sound is good and fit great!
1,"Being a non digital person, I was very pleased at how easy these earbuds are to sync with my devices.  The sound is very good.  Very pleased with the product so far."
1,I am loving the clear sound and comfort of these headphones.  They arrived quickly and safely.
1,My daughter bought these for herself and loves them.  I asked her for a recommendation and she sent me the link on Amazon.  I am completely satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this product to anyone.
0,Bluetooth range not very good if phone is in my pocket.  Does not work well while bike riding because it pick up wind easy. too heavy!
1,"This was a gift for my nephew 17 BD. I ordered it Saturday and he received it on Monday. I was very impressed how fast he got he's package. He says he likes it very much. He does a lot of sports. I wanted to get him a Bluetooth that can work for him better that the headphones he wears. If it works for him, for sure I'll be getting another one for my neace and my self. Thank you!"
1,"These headphones sync pretty well and fit great!  I did have an issue with the sound seeming distant when syncing with the PC.  However, the next day, without doing anything differently, the sound was perfect.<br /><br />The sound does sound good when connected via the iPhone 7 Plus which is the main reason I got it.<br /><br />I was able to test the mic on a call and the person on the other end said I sounded good."
1,They work
1,"Headphones are extremely easy to set up and use, paired right away with my LG V20. The sound quality is great and the earbuds are comfortable for me. It came in a nice case and has the usual stuff like replacement buds and what not nothing too surprising.<br /><br />The one thing that really stands out is the fact that SENSO contacted me through email stating that the headphones are covered by a one year warranty and if anything were to be an issue with them would be to contact them first. They seem very willing to go above and beyond for customer support which more than makes up for 5 stars. They seem like they genuinely care for their customers which is more than a lot of companies these days."
1,Love them!!! One of my best purchases!
0,"The headphones only worked for a short period of time. The sound is great, battery is okay, but they’re made cheap. It says they have a warranty but unfortunately that doesn’t seem to be the case. I’ve sent emails back in May to get this resolved and still no resolution."
1,Battery life
1,Ok unit.
1,"Came package very nice, easy set up. Quality sound, used them in the steam room to text the water proof and no issues to date."
0,"Summary:  Very bad for money and sound quality<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Comes with a boatload of accessories<br />- Is Bluetooth<br />- Good for exercising<br />- Has bass<br /><br />Cons<br />- Sound is let say not pleasing.  Reminds me a bit of a Nintendo ds included earbuds.  Remember those?  The sound is very murky, it’s like listening to music playing in the room next to you.<br />- Button configuration could be approve (accidently called a sleeping person, they weren’t in the best mood as many of y’all would’ve been)<br />- The earbuds would loosen a bit while running.<br /><br />I bought these for running and they do the job pretty well.  They come with very nice foam eartips that are like complys.  The cable isn’t annoying while running.  The only complaint is that they may loosen up.  This is the first time I’m using the kind of earbuds that loop over your ear and these are pretty comfortable.  The earbuds don’t smell at all unlike several other earbuds I’ve encountered.  They come with a huge assortment of accessories that has me wondering why include this!?  I’m not complaining though.  The sound quality isn’t good at all.  Very murky and leaves me unsatisfied.  My 4 year old $30 earbuds somehow sound a indefinite times better than these.  My cheap $10 parasonics are high end in comparison with these.  The bass is there, however, it’s not the good quality bass.  I’ve gave my cousin who is only famailier with apple earbuds and he called these alright.  From someone who has never touch another pair of earbuds in his whole life just called these OK isn’t very ok.  My cousin isn’t very sensitive to sound quality like me since he thinks apple earbuds are the best of the best.  He got excited when I offered him some 0.99, possibly fake Samsung earbuds.  He lost his apple headphones and is probably sick of the sound.  I too would be desperate for a pair of possibly ripoff  earbuds instead of these."
0,"They sound great and the battery is long but the right ear bud never stays in my ear but the left one stays in perfectly. Kind've disappointing because these were such a great price. For the right fitting ears, these would be awesome."
0,"They do not work with my windows 10 computer very well. This is the only real complaint I have. I can pair them, but the play / pause feature doesn't work at all. I can skip the song with them though, which is nice.<br />They work perfectly with my phone.<br />I have small ears, and they are slightly uncomfortable, so I'm trying different tips and experimenting.<br />The case is small and it is hard to fit the ear buds in it. No real space for the charging cable. It is well made and has a sleek design though.<br />Sometimes the over ear hook doesn't fit properly at all, and they do fall out if not positioned just right. These are slightly noise cancelling, but if the wind picks up, it creates a whistling effect.<br />Fantastic charge time. They last me the majority of the day. The notification voice is sometimes a bit muted, thus making it easy to miss but it's not unpleasant to hear.<br />These are a good pair of headphones for the person who isn't too concerned about audio quality and wants to experiment with Bluetooth audio.<br />I probably won't buy them again, but I'm not upset either.<br />Update.<br />They have broke after about five months. The left side of the earbuds quit working. The company has replaced them, however the new pair has a large white scratch on the side and the included car chargers front has been dented inwards in multiple places. The product also came complete with horrible audio coming from both side. Pa*asoni*s ear buds last much longer, cost much less, and come in a wider variety of color options. Paying more doesn't mean your going to get quality."
1,"I'm 67 years old and just learning how to use Bluetooth devices.  I am thrilled with my Senso headphones.  They are lightweight and fit perfectly.  I can use them to listen to any radio station from my smartphone and I Heart Radio.  I can also work around the house while listening to my favorite TV shows - with no cords!  I used to use a Sennsheiser headset, but it was bulky, heavy, and required a transmitter.  Bluetooth technology is wonderful."
1,"I actually replaced my beats with these headphones, and I love them. I’m still waiting for “the catch”.  So worth the 20 bucks. The sound is amazing. No complaints"
1,I buy tow one for me and other one for my wife because we go to gym .My wife was so happy me either we satisfied with this SENSO Bluetooth Headphone . The soude very Clair no noise and the volume is very laod if you want the maximum I recomande it for any one.
1,"LOVE these so much that after ordering my first pair, I ordered another a week later! All that's different is the first pair are in a black and red case and the second ones in a black and blue. EASY to link with your phone, a pleasure to wear, user friendly, and a really nice case that holds the earphones and the charger I use to charge them in my laptop. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THESE. Lovely customer service, too. I was contacted by the seller just to be sure I was happy and the product worked well. BUY WITH CONFIDENCE!"
1,Fit great. Sound great. Work great. Look great.
1,"One of the best purchase I have made for headphones. Pros: lightweight, fits great, sounds great, with great price. Cons: I can't find any. Very Good product. Buy one today!"
1,"Really like, have only used for a few days but are comfortable, sound is great and battery life is long"
1,"I love these - affordable and connect smoothly with my phone so I no longer have to deal with the long cord. Come with a nice case and a dual car chargers I wasn't expecting - great surprise! I'd recommend these to anyone who doesn't want to invest $$$$ into a set of headphones. They also come with a few size of the ear buds, so I was able to adjust to fit a little better."
1,Great little headphones for the price!
1,Great. Easily fits on my ears. Other similar ones didn’t fit well. Happy with it.
1,My grandson they were perfect for him
0,"I thought these would be much better, since they were so pricey.  The sound is not great.  They feel like they are going to fly off when Im running."
1,I am very happy with these headphones. This is the 3rd pair I've tried and finally what I was looking for. They sound great. The battery life is good and it doesn't take long to recharge them. I use them primarily to walk the dog but also to do housework so I'm happy with the range as well. They don't have to be constantly adjusted in my ears like the other ones I bought did. They block outside noise extremely well so watch the traffic!
1,This is a great buy. Battery last around 5-6 hours os straight use. All the items included in the box are great.
1,"The headphones have awesome sound quality.  After a small hitch, the issue was resolved within 24 hours and I couldn’t be more happier!"
1,"I love  them ,  fit perfectly , the best headphones I ever bought very durable. This may be the last pair of headphones you every have to buy."
1,good sound quality.good packaging...seems made to last...<br />had some question but excellent support and personal touch provided by the company on resolving the issues/concerns of mine.<br /><br />so far happy to use these...
1,"The Headphones sometimes don't connect to my phone and need to be shut off and turned on automatically. No big deal really, only happens on occasion and I have an old iPhone so what can you expect. Also, the button is hard to push to turn on and off and pause and play. Overall the sound quality is there and if you use the included job site earplugs, you will see monster base yet still good quality. I would buy these again and recommend to a friend. Not without its flaws, but for the price, I would buy them again they are such a good deal."
1,I love these headphones. I have trouble with headphones falling out while I work out and these do not at all!! The quality of the music is also prestine. The price for the value is incomparable.
1,Super long battery life. And very sturdy
1,Easy connectivity.<br />Great headphones for the price.
1,"These are great but are very good at blocking sound.  This is my first pair of wireless headphones and I really like them.  However, I wanted them to walk / run outside with.  Since they block sound so good, I don't like them for that reason.  But, for the noisy gym, they are GREAT!  I will be looking for some that is not so good at sound blocking.  They look stylish, sound great."
1,Best running headphones and work headphones to buy. I use it at work for calls and to listen to music. It is great for running and working out!
1,"I just ordered these headphones and could not be more impressed. While running, they stay firmly in your ear, and they sound excellent as well. I highly recommend these earbuds for anyone that is looking for a good pair to wear while exercising."
1,The headphones are very comfortable and I love the range I can move from my Bluetooth source and still get clear sound. There is no doubt that the value they give is worth multiple times their cost.
1,Fantastic headphones. They fit great feel good and sound awesome. Great bass and volume. Best set I've gotten so far.
1,"Great for the price.  Paid 3 times as much for a pair of Jaybird's that didn't sound any better, didn't stay in my ear as well, and the battery died after one year."
1,These are wonderful earbuds!! The sound quality is outstanding. They are very comfortable.
1,"Bought as a gift for my husband.  Once you get used to the ear piece, they are great.  Good sound, definitely a good deal for the $."
1,Great headphones for the gym.
1,Meh... They are ok to use while sitting down or doing light work but I cant keep the on my ears when I run no matter what I do.
1,"I just bought a pair of these earphones, because I was tired of not being able to listen to music and charge my iPhone at the same time.  So far, I'm happy with them.  They came with clear instructions for charging and using them, and the sound quality is fine.  I haven't tried wearing them for jogging yet, but they fit well don't easily fall off when I'm wearing them around the house.  I was pleasantly surprised that they came with a carrying case, and a couple of charging cables.  All in all, this looks like a good product."
1,I like the ease of starting and stopping play and adjusting volume.  Comfortable on ears and stays in place while jogging.
1,For the price the quality is great.
1,I wanted some wireless ear buds for running.  And I've tried several wireless models.  Sound wasn't as important as comfort and staying in my ears.  I bought these mostly because they didn't have the control box on the cord piece.  I have a set like that and the box pulls the ear piece out of my ear when running.  These fit comfortably and the wrap piece helps without rubbing.<br />These also connected with my TomTom GPS/music watch which was a big plus for me.  Very happy so far.
1,Great Product I'm ordering a second one for my other son today.
1,Very pleased with these headphones. I had issues hearing tv. Now I catch every word.
1,Great pair of headphones.  Easy to setup and are very comfortable.  Will definitely buy again.  High recommended.
0,Did not work as well. Battery did not hold a charge
1,Junk product the button is hard to push the right ear bud don't work after 6 month's
1,"Product worked fine until a week after the Amazon return window expired, at which point the on/off button broke.<br /><br />Senso were very quick to send me a replacement.... hoping this one works longer!"
1,I use them with my tablet to listen to music while I work around the house.
1,So I've had these a few weeks and I gotta say they're great. I bought them for yardwork and I totally use them for anything. The sound and battery life are incredible for the price. I recommend these for anyone who wants a good pair of buds at a great price
1,Not the best headphone out there but do the job. only thing is sometimes while playing songs the connection is choppy or something. I will update later on how they handle the gym life
1,"First - service is spectacular. My buds got a button stuck a few days after receipt. One email, and the replacement was in process.<br /><br />Note - I am not an audiophile. Nonetheless, The buds are terrific. Good sound, easy to use and pair. The case is neat and fits into melt bag minimizing the chance of loss (a real problem solved)!  And, the cost?  Wow."
1,Bluetooth is nice clear for phone and music. But I was that they made cord that around your neck longer.
1,These headphones sound good and they are priced well. Good buy.
0,Returning. Loses connection to much. Will lose connection when I put my phone in my pocket. Battery life sucka
1,These earphones are really good. The TV sound is plenty loud and makes the dialog easier to understand. And I like the volume control. Very convenient..
1,They're good for the price
0,"Apparently there is only a Bluetooth module in the right earphone. I synced them to my watch (which I wear on my left arm) and everytime my arm swings they cut out. I also noticed they cut out every time I turn my head to the right. The sound quality is also aysmal. Extremely muffled almost like it's all mids and no highs (and no bass).  For the seller to even hint that these are $169.00 headphones is a fat ass joke. Maybe these were defective, but either way they are going back."
1,Good for my music.
1,"These were on sale and what a bargain.  Came with clever APPL/mini-usb charging cable,  regular USB cable, nice case, and replacement earbuds.  Sound is really good.  Pairing was a breeze.  Highly recommended!!!"
1,"Not bad for $36, but could be a lot better. The audio quality is ok; the earbuds have trouble with some bass frequencies, which sets them into a crackling noise. Nonetheless, they are much better than my MPow Magnetos and the MPow Swift, with far more depth and sparkle. Other notes; they are rather large and noticeable, the ear loops cannot be removed except with a pair of scissors, I liked the on-ear skip/volume buttons, the extra goodies are almost worth the price, beautifully boxed, awesome case, and fairly easy to fit, given the 4 different pairs of tips. IDK, at the end of the day, I am returning these to look for a better earbud pair (somewhere). Perhaps I am just not a fan of ear loops."
0,hard to set up still struggling
1,"Good quality for the price. Need to get used to it at first (not comfortable as expensive bose), but works nice and good battery life."
1,"Great wireless headphones so far. The only complaint was that when he is riding bike, it is hard to hear the music over the wind, but that is not really a fault of the headphones."
1,They are great. No issues great sound.
1,"My husband and I have both purchased these headphones. They sound quality and battery life are wonderful! They are perfect for the gym, especially since they come with a car charger and a carrying case.<br /><br />My only warning is that if you have small ears, they may be too large. I have problems with my pair slipping over the back of my ear. Other than that, they are perfect!"
1,"Easy to setup, perfect volume, long lasting battery."
0,"Didn’t work while swimming, then stopped working altogether."
1,"Beats who?!? These headphones can definitely be placed on the same level with a pair of Beats headphones, without the price. They are EXACTLY what I was looking for. They are indeed loud, I haven't even turned them up half way, and that says a lot because I like my music very loud. The bass quality is very good, I feel every beat perfectly. Clarity in every conversation. Great battery life, I get a full day and a half on one charge. The only thing I can think of that I don't like is the &#34;Low Battery&#34; alert in the headphones, it tells you &#34;Low Battery &#34; multiple times before turning off. I do not like that, but other than that these are my favorite headphones by far."
1,"Very comfortable, great sound!"
1,GREAT... quick shipping exactly what was advertised
1,sound quality as amazing and everything that came with the package was worth the money defintiely buy again
1,"I Hope this review isn't a duplicate.  These headphones are decent.  I wear them while dancing.  There are several foam tips so they should fit any ears. The button controls are not difficult.  My biggest issue is that the ear hooks are soft ... like silicon.  My ears are very small and lie quite flat to my head and I also wear glasses.  They literally fall off and therefore won't stay on my head.  However, I have devised a work-around.  I tuck the soft hooks between the control box thing (Don't know what it is called) and the ear canal piece and leave it while I'm not wearing it.  It takes a set and seems to work.  I have attached a picture."
0,These headphones are very poor. They hold a charge for only a few minutes. I bought them for my husband in Colombia and of course can not return them unfortunately as it was a gift.
1,"I've used these a few times so far and I'm very happy with them. It took me a few minutes to figure out how to connect them and figure out on and off, but the directions are pretty clear. The only struggle I have is getting them in my ears, but they are very secure once in. All in all, I'm thrilled with the quality for the price I paid. 2 thumbs up."
1,So far so good feel comfortable
1,"Not only were they delivered on a Sunday when I requested free delivery, but they are perfect!!! Got two pairs - my husband and I's birthday presents - and we could not be more happy! They feel great, sound is great, don't have any issues when looking to the left or right like I had read about a couple other wireless headphones. Just perfect! Thank you for an awesome product!"
1,I was going to get the Apple ear pods. But the price and lukewarm reviews made me hesitant. Glad I didn't. Senso headphones are great! Best part is they fit my ear canals. And the ear hooks is are great. The sound is phenomenal. Best I've heard for ear buds. Battery lasts the longest of any Bluetooth headphones I used. Very happy with the purchase.
1,Easy set up. Good sound . Everything I wanted! Can't beat the price!
0,they dont fit well and they kept falling out when i am running
0,I like them if they were loud but they not thankyou
1,"I wasn't looking for Bose-quality sound because for the gym I don't want to spend that much $.  These are very good:  sound, features, comfort, quick charging and long lasting.  Very pleased.<br />*One year later, and these are still going strong. I'm so impressed, I had to add the update.  I'm careful with them, but not exceptionally so, and my wires are just fine so far. Sound is good, links in seconds, no drop-out. The charge lasts a really long time.  I'm very happy with this purchase."
1,Best headphones I have ever listened to . feeling like you can go under water and workout in the is to good to be true
1,Great set of affordable earphones would definitely recommend
1,"These headphones are amazing!  I love a bargain, but the quality you are getting with these make these a perfect purchase. The sound quality is more than should be expected at this price point. It is far and above what you are paying for these. They hold a charge very well and even the range is kind of incredible. These are a must have for the gym or work. You wont regret this purchase."
1,"I'm actually very happy with these headphones the sound quality is great, with a long lasting battery, I could use it during the day to answer calls from my clients and then head straight for a workout with music playing and still not have fully drained the battery. And when one side stopped working they promptly sent me a new headset that's on its way because I was still within the year warranty."
1,works as expected
1,Excellent product
0,Everything (Sound quality and battery) was great for the first few days. Then the battery just stopped charging. Couldn't even do a factory reset. Dead and waste now. I don't recommend this product.
1,Works great a little bit of a bulk in the ear and a bit hard to put on without accidentally hitting the on/off button but besides that there great so far.
0,Over all good but stopped working not able to charge after  4 months and not the charger is is definitely the head set
1,They came so fast.  I love them.  I will be ordering a second pair for my husband!
1,"The headphones met my expectations. They have good sound and stay in my ears when I am running. Unfortunately, they stopped taking a charge. Fortunately, the excellent customer service that they provide ensured that I will have a replacement set shipped to me immediately."
1,"These are actually great. I was worried when I saw they were incredibly discounted, but they work AWESOME! And what an awesome price!"
1,Simple to set up and sound quality was great don’t think you will find a better product for the price
0,"I bought these to wear as I ride my bike to and from work. I put my phone in a saddlebag and connected the headphones, but the Bluetooth would cut out and stutter the entire time. I tried various things, and the only way the Bluetooth works is if I have my phone within 1 foot of the headphones. If I hold my phone in my left hand, they don't work.<br /><br />This completely removes any convenience of bluetooth headphones."
1,"I'm glad I purchased these. The sound is crisp and loud. There are some other reviewers which summarized and compared these to the beats, pros and cons and I will say they are spot on. I have purchased tons of headphones, all more expensive and returned them all. I have an over the ear I use for working out but wanted to give ear buds another try. These still slide out a bit, so I'm not sure they will stay put if I go for a run, but they may be good for weight lifting. I may just have to give up on looking for ear buds that don't slide out and put a headband on top of them, just keep it moving."
1,Very good headphone
1,Great job Great product!!!!
1,I got these headphones because of other reviews and they have lived up to the hype.
1,"My son loves these, especially when he is shooting buckets in the driveway. They stay in and hold a charge."
0,"Using with Series 2 Apple Watch, really poor bluetooth connection, Apple Watch on my left wrist and the signal is having difficulty getting to the headphones. . . so I guess it's antenna is on the right ear piece? Sound is constantly going in and out. They only pair with my Apple Watch if the watch is power-cycled(power watch off, then back on). They are not recognized by the Apple Watch otherwise. I'm curious as to how these headphones are so highly rated. Not a very good value imo. These should pair and stay paired. However, once they are powered off, they will not re-pair with the Apple Watch unless the watch is again power-cycled. I'm outside the return window so I'm stuck with them. Frustrating.<br /><br />*update*<br />Performed factory reset, as recommended by Invotek CS rep in reply section. No change in pairing procedure. Headphones will only pair if Apple Watch is power-cycled."
1,Good quality sound and very comfortable
0,"loved it while it worked, stopped functioning after 3 months :("
1,"I bought these headphones based off price and prior reviews.  I use the headphones five/six days a week from 75 to 90 minutes and they work AMAZING!  I have had them for over six months and they still hold a great charge, clear when working out, on the phone and the range is pretty amazing.  When on the open floor at a gym, the range is great.  The set comes with several ear buds to ensure you get the correct fit.  The sound comes in clear and loud!<br /><br />Love them, hope  you will too.<br /><br />PS: they charge FAST!"
1,Works great..  and quick..
1,It's a good buy for the price. The sound quality and battery life are ok.
0,Worked for two month. Now when the cable plugged in I see blue light as if it is charged.<br />Take the charging cable out and the unit does not power up.<br />Tried to reset per procedure provided in one of the reviews to no avail.
1,Omg finally! I've been looking high and dry for loud headphones for my Peloton and these are great. So loud that I can't turn them up all the way! Can't wait to ride later!
1,"Excellent product, excellent documentation, easy to setup, easy to use, Excellent sound and microphone....looks like a 200.00 set of buds with a budget friendly price.  These would make a great stocking stuffer for the kids or a great workout set."
0,"I use headphones with distant friends for virtual run/conversation. I would also use for solo runs to listen to music/podcasts. During testing with friends, they said the call quality was not good. Outside sounds like footfalls, cars, even my voice sounded like chipmunks - too squeaky and not clear. After adjusting the headset a few times, I had to abandon using it.<br />Music was good sounding though."
0,"I'm not sure why these are so highly rated. Right out if the box, they have like zero treble and I got static noise during bas parts of songs. Returned same day and will continue to look for an actual good set."
1,Good headphones. Fit is a little weird for my ears. But don't think that's necessarily a general problem.
1,The headphones works great. They last all day. The sound is really good and the bass. I will buy another pair for my wife.
1,Bought As a gift.... love it
1,"Bit heavy  on the bass,. Pass them to my kids. If you like beat headphone you will like these"
1,I have only used these three times so far but I am very pleased. I love the wireless feature. This is my first pair of wireless headsets and I was constantly snagging the wire on the traditional iPhone earbuds. So not having the dangling wire helps me feel free to walk around without fear one is about to get tugged from my ear.<br />I'm happy with the sound quality. I've listened to music and an audio book and both have sounded great. I've never owned a pair of expensive earphones. So I'm not comparing then to anything more than my iPhone buds. But for my purpose as a stay at home mom who likes music once in awhile these sound great to me.<br />I also was listening to an audiobook the other day when my husband called. I pushed the button on the side to answer the phone. My husband said he could hear me perfectly. It was easy and worked better than I expected since I've only ever answered my actual phone. So it was a cool feature.<br />I did need to change out to the smallest ear tip that they came with. I'm still learning to really get them in my ear but once I do they feel very secure.
1,"Just let me say one thing! Beats are overrated!  Absolutely 100% satisfied with senso, the sound is amazing. I ordered one pair went back a few days and order another for a friend, looking to order another pair for my Fiancé."
1,they are very easy to work and connect unlike other brands I've used before.
1,"I just opened and started listening. First I can tell by the packaging that the creators take their product seriously. For then being $20 I expected them to be in a bag or something. Boxed well and came with other goodies I didn’t expect. The sound so far is good, bass is a little weak but they do well. I’ve never owned noise canceling headphones before so I don’t have anything to compare them too but I don’t think I’d hear someone talking next to me with them in."
1,"These are my first bluetooth sports headphones, so I wasn't exactly sure what to look for and what would work for me. I purchased these because of their high water resistance rating, reasonable battery life, and price at the time of purchase.<br /><br />The ability to quickly pair to my cellphone was extremely easy. The bluetooth protocol easily recognized each other and sound immediately transfered to the headphones. The sound was clear and powerful enough to drown out traffic, my heavy breathing, and other distractions while I run. The carrying case is about the size of a hockey puck (perhaps a little thicker) and is able to store the headphones and charging cable without issue.<br /><br />The issues I have with these headphones are the over-the-ear clip that appears in the picture. They are soft, almost flimsy little pieces of rubber that barely keep the headphones fitted into my ears. I have tried every size of the included ear bud cups and sadly none of them improved the fit enough to keep the headphones from nearly falling out while I am running. I have to readjust them from time to time. This isn't a total loss, but would have preferred something a bit more solid to hold them in place. My other issue is the cord that runs between the two headphones. This is my problem, but it seems that the cord is always finding a way to works its way under my shirt or stick to my skin while I run, which then pulls the headphone out of my ear if I turn my head (looking for traffic, etc) one way or the other.<br /><br />On the plus side, the headphones sound great. I have even taken calls while on the go and outside of the person asking me while I'm breathing so hard, they are able to hear me just fine via the built-in microphone. Volume is easy to adjust, as is switching songs, which just requires a long hold of the volume button. I do not notice any issues with bluetooth connectivity while I'm on the go, as long as my playlist is on the phone. There are instances where sound comes in and out, but I think that has more to do with my phone not downloading new tracks fast enough sometimes.<br /><br />Overall, I am happy with my first pair of bluetooth, nearly wireless headphones. I now know what I will look for in my next set when these wear out. The sound is great, the price was reasonable, and I haven't had any issues with shorting out due to sweat."
1,"Awesome for the price. Overall sound quality is bass heavy for sure, but not a deal breaker for me, depends on your choice of music.<br />The included accessories don’t matter to me much. The multi end charger cord is pretty cool, a little short to be an all the time use. The carry case is a nice touch, but stuffing the buds and cord and charging cable is beyond my patience. Would definitely be better off with a typical round cord between the buds, not a fan of the flat ribbon cord.<br />If you use the squishy foam ends they work well at keeping out ambient noise, almost too much for speech though.<br />I use them exclusively around the house for mowing the lawn, weed wacking, and snowblowing come winter. Have no issue with them falling out."
1,Got them for my wife to use for working out.  She had trouble with them fitting in her small ear canals.  They just never stayed in place.  I took them and they work well for me.
0,"They fit well and they were working pretty well for the last couple months. However, recently they started cutting in and out which drives me nuts. They will even cut out when i'm walking and just lifting weights. unacceptable. athletic earbuds should be durable.<br /><br />I am disappointed because i wanted to like these headphones. the sound quality is good, even the mic is good. they are very comfortable. but when your music skips in and out constantly, it is super annoying."
1,Great value for money
1,"wow i'm very impressed with this headphones, in addition to the headphones you get a ton of other stuff, like car chargers, 2 cables, carrying case, extra rubber tips. definately worth the price.  one small detail is while making calls if you are used to pushing your headphones in your ears you will hear yourself speak which can be distracting. try putting them on to the tip only."
1,"Received my senso headphones for Christmas. Was very skeptical, but was I surprised. Very easy to set up, easy to charge, and simple to use. Thanks so much. Just hope the product is sturdy."
1,"They're pretty good, easy to connect to devices but they are starting to not be so great after several months. I can hear electronics bouncing around in them, which is not ideal, but so far it still works!"
1,"Sound quality is excellent. Play time is covers all of my needs. Charges quickly, very comfortable, lightweight, durable materials, easy to set up and use, priced right... what more does one need? More time to enjoy them!"
0,"I gave them away. Did not fit in my ears, easily fell off when exercising. Set up/pairing was easy and the sound was ok. I'll keep on looking for a pair that works for me."
1,"I love these headphones, they're really &#34;comfortable&#34; and the sound is great.  I'm not sure what the battery life is but I know they will last at least 3-4 hours.  The over the ear clips are made of soft rubber so they are easy to put on and they give you different bud sizes to fit inside your ears.  I thought the price was very fair and they through in a case along with a USB cable and a cigarette/car charger.  I took these down to Cancun on vacation and so far so good, I really like these.  I had returned a pair of Anker headphones because they just didn't fit right and the sound was not that good.  I'm not sure if I'm listed as a verified buyer but you cannot go wrong with these bluetooth headphones and I paid full price for them so I'm not writing this review as a &#34;freebie&#34;."
1,"Good sound quality<br /><br />Easy setup<br /><br />Exactly what I needed<br /><br />Would have given 5 stars but sound is not quite as good as some of my other wired  ear buds/head phones.  However, they are excellent for working out.<br /><br />Other minor complaint... Microphone appears to always be on, which impacts sound when running in a windy environment.  I'll probably put a piece of tape over it... again a minor issue."
1,Great for an active person.
1,"I loved my pair. It lasted me a year before it stopped working but to be fair I have a rough job and would wear these all day. Speaking of all day, the battery would last the full 8+ hours. To be fair towards the last few months I would charge it during lunch to make the full shift. Either way it is well worth the price and I will be getting another pair."
1,"So far pretty good Bluetooth earbuds, I noticed some wind noise while riding the bicycle but, other than that they work great!  So far let's see in 2 months."
0,"I absolutely hate these headphones, the battery does not last long, sometimes it takes like 30 seconds to connect to the iPhone and then there are times where it will disconnect and reconnect multiple times. I end up having to turn them off, turn off the Bluetooth of the phone and pair them back up it is a pain.  The range is also pretty bad, if I have my phone in one room and go to another one you cannot hear well.<br /><br />Two stars because they are light, and if they are fully charged and don't have any issues the sound quality is not bad."
1,To think I almost paid 200 bucks for a headset just to work out with. This particular headset exceeded my expectations and I'm glad that I took a chance with this product. I highly recommend them for you're listening needs while actively working out. Their customer service reach out to me via email to insure me that they were standing by to answer any questions.
0,Not worth it. The quality is bad.
0,"Just 5 months after very irregular use (~3 times a week for ~20mins each time), this has started breaking down. First, it takes many tries to get the bluetooth connection to work and now, I cannot even get it to charge. I'm unsure if the problem lies with the charger or the device itself. Very disappointing given the good reviews and the fact that it worked well for a couple of months or so."
1,The headphones are great. . I have the bose brand too. And this headphones sounds as great or better. ..and way cheaper. ..now all I need to see if they last  a good long time. Since I just received  and I have used it only one time. .but I was amazed this one time
1,"NOTE: I clicked on the old order and it linked me to this product. So I purchased presuming the products were the same.<br /><br />I bought these headphones in May 22 of this year. I chose to get these due to my VERY GOOD experience with these headphones back in 2017. These were purchased to replace the ones I had from 2017 since those were starting to wear out with exposed wire and etc. Where as the 2017 version would easily get 5 stars, this time these do not.<br /><br />Comparing the two, my main issue is that the ear hooks in the 2019 version that I received has a wire frame that you can use to adjust to your ear and etc. Like inside feels like you're bending a worn out paper clip that you've been bending back and forth or some wire frame. This sounds like a good idea, but it's one of those good thought but very bad execution. The problem is when you're moving or talking or doing anything, it moves the ear hooks and it cause the suction of the buds to come out. Making it feel like it's not fully in your ear or stays there uneven. For headphones that are designed for physical activity, it's perplexing why they would design the hooks to have that flimsy wire instead of plastic that's one size fit all like in the past.<br /><br />The price changed too, but I thought it was just due to the 2 year time between my last purchase and this current one.  At the time of purchase in 2017 it was about 10-12$ more to the current price (29.99 instead of 19.99 or so and factoring any tax and shipping).<br /><br />Overall the quality of this current product should be considered, and ultimately I do not recommend it. I hope they go back to how they manufactured these like in 2017. I'd pay more, for better quality."
1,Work great!
1,Headphones all about them is the quality of sound . Headphones are build for sound and that what I was looking for considering it. I have to admit that I am not disappointed. Good quality sound you can compare it to HD sound. Great bass ! functionality good too. Overall I am pleased I use them all the time  and I replaced my other wired ones. Thanks.
1,"Literally so mad at myself for not getting these 5 years ago. Bass sounds basically the same compared to the Beats by Dre ones I tried from my friend. I've used the apple headphones that comes with iPhones basically all my life which are great, but the wire and having the have the phone in your pocket can get annoying after a while.<br /><br />With these, you can set your phone down in the middle of the gym and workout without having to worry about a phone being attached to you or a while dangling from your pocket. These also stay in your ear MUCH better than any other headphone I've ever tried and never budge even a bit. 10/10 and for the price, can't go wrong."
1,I bought these for my wife and she loves them.  She said they have wonderful sound and are very comfortable.  We bought a pair for our daughter one Christmas and she highly recommended them.
1,"These headphones are amazing! I have only worn them 3 times but I'm so pleased with how they fit, how lightweight they are and the quality of the sound.  I like that they don't sound or feel like I'm wearing earplugs.  They don't totally block out everything around me so I can still hear a car approaching and the ocean waves as I run down the beach but I also hear my music.  Of course I don't have them cranked up all the way either.  The controls work very well and are easy to use while I'm running.  I had an incoming call while I was wearing them today and I could hear the caller perfectly.  It was even windy on the boardwalk and I didn't notice it nor was the caller able to hear anything on their end.  I can't speak for how long the batteries hold but yet.  The case and accessories that come with the headphones are top notch as well. I just couldn't be happier that I purchased these at such a great price!"
1,Really great quality for the price.
1,"The product seemed to work okay, but it came already used even though I bought it brand new. The earbuds had wax and dirt residue on them. It was very disgusting. I'm disappointed."
1,"These headphones are amazing! I cannot praise them enough for their quality in build and in sound.  I do not have a lot of experience with wireless earbuds but for me these are the best and the best priced. I highly recommend these to anyone who is looking for a sturdy reliable pair of wireless earbuds that can take the sweat and the work load of my particular lifestyle. I have worn these mowing my lawn and doing my exercising...they are comfortable and make these otherwise mundane and activities enjoyable!  I have already ordered another pair for my wife. They are, in my opinion, a &quot;must have&quot; for active people."
1,This is second Bluetooth headphone I bought. First one was cheap and it cost about $15 and it didn't last for a year. I see this one had many review and big discount and so I bought it. I was very pleased when I opened package. It was nicely packed and with additional items like charger wire and little container so you can carry with you. It fit into your ear securely.  I have used for a week now.<br />Update: I wrote this review a week after I bought this and did not realize I did not submit the review. When I want to get another one since I gave it to my husband. After a year later it still works great. So I want to get another one.
1,Was on the market for wireless headphones for the gym. I was having a hard time justifying paying a few hundred dollars for earbuds. So I'm so glad I came across these. Great sound quality.
1,"I bought these headphones back in March 2017, and absolutely love them. They provide quality sound and bass. The battery life is great - just charge it how the manual describes. They served me very well until February 2018, when the left headphone started cutting out due to physical strain on the cable. I contacted Senso directly, and they responded within the day with a technical solution. Since the technical solution did not work, the one year warranty covered replacement. The sent out a replacement pair, and I received those within 2 days. I was so glad to have a new pair, and would buy another pair from them since the quality, customer service, and warranty are great. Amazing customer service, and awesome product! Highly recommend this pair of headphones for aspiring on-the-move audiophiles."
1,Good product
0,I've had these headphones for several months now and bought them for swimming. The problem is when you go an inch under water the music shuts off so you can't listen to music uninterrupted. Also when talking most people can't understand me on the bluetooth so I have to switch over and hold the phone up to my ear which is highly annoying. Then on top of it I keep getting a beeping noise when I use them and it stops playing then starts again. I almost just want to throw them in the garbage. They're some of the worst headphones I've bought.
1,Very nice and strong
1,Excellent sound for the price!
0,"The ear piece that goes behind the ear doesn't really do much. and I keep having a static sound and the music cuts out multiple times. very frustrating because I read a lot of good reviews, but these do not come close."
0,Lasted about 6 months and then wouldn't turn on or charge. I handled them with care too.
1,"Fantastic headphones, as someone who exercises regularly I hated constantly having to either choose sound and a cord or distorted sound and bluetooth. This delivers the best of both worlds with amazing base, greats highs and mids, solid control functionality, and great design to hold in place. My only complaint comes with the answering of phone calls, as the sounds is always quieter than the music."
1,"I've used these a few times since getting them.  I use them for running and haven't had any issues with them falling off.  Sometimes they get a little sweaty inside the ear, but not a big deal."
1,"Well right off the top when i opened of the package i was pleased with the ear hooks and dimensions of the product i like the way the plugs curve into my ear for snug listening... and the sound is full and bold my only dislike is the cellphone card wallet the width of it is not feasibly functional ...but the gesture was not under appreciated ...ill find a use for it THANKS SENSO....and in closing I'll run a pun intended statement ""Wow those ActivBuds S-250 from SENSO are SENSATIONAL !!!"
1,Good quality. Love it! Hope they'll last long too.
1,Nice sound easy to use
1,"I've used these headphones almost daily since February, 2018 and it would be hard to beat the level of quality and sound for the price. Are there better headphones out there? Sure, but they won't cost $20-30. Also, as of September, 2018 they started having trouble taking a charge. A five minute call to customer support resulted in a new pair of headphones shipped within the week. So again, you can spend much more for better, but for the price you get good sound and quality and great customer support. I would definitely recommend."
1,"The purchase was a gift for a friend. However, I would very much appreciate your follow up on your customers' purchases. To me, that  identifies you as a first class company who also cares to offer technical help to their customers  in case they run into problems using their products."
1,I bought these for use while exercising but find myself using them as much or more for music listening because of the sound quality.  Bass response is good and the stereo quality is exceptional.  Definitely recommend.
1,"These are great Bluetooth headphones. This is my second pair as my first were accidentally thrown out. I used the foam ear bud replacements provided with the kit which actually improve sound, cancel outside noise better, and keep everything in place. Great buy. I highly recommend."
1,"As long as they last longer than my Powerbeats3 I don't care if the sound is a little subpar. They're loud enough, they do a great job staying still at the gym and they're pretty much noise cancelling (I can't hear anything else when they're on) so 4 stars, just because I wish the sound was a little bit better."
1,"Was hoping for great things based on the ratings, but I wasn't too impressed. I bought these to use at the gym while working out, I think most people are probably going to use these for that purpose as well.<br /><br />I had no problems pairing the earbuds to my iPhone. The earbuds turned on quickly and I was able to pair them to my phone easily. I found the bluetooth connection to be good, I didn't have any problems with my music cutting out while moving around with my phone in my pocket while at the gym.<br /><br />Battery life is good. With my iPhone 6S, it tells me how much battery I have left in the earbuds when they're connected to my phone, which is very useful. The battery lasts me a couple of workouts, I'd say they lasted me about 4 to 5 hours of music playtime.<br /><br />However, I did have trouble getting the earbuds to stay in my ear. The loops that go over your ear are flimsy rubber, and don't provide much support, making it very easy to the earbuds to slip out of place. I found myself constantly repositioning the earbuds throughout my workouts. I tried using different sized ear tips but still had the same problem.<br /><br />The sound quality wasn't impressive either. I listen to mostly Hip Hop at the gym and found that songs with bass would become distorted, even at lower volumes.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say these earbuds are okay. Nothing great but not bad either. Considering they're just for the gym, I'd say I'm satisfied with my purchase. But when they break, I'm definitely going to look into a different brand of wireless earbuds to replace them."
1,These are great!!.. Wonderful sound... Carrying case.. Extra buds... Car charger and charging wires.... I never had one of these and wasn't sure.... I'm not real good with technology but so easy to use figure out!!<br />I defiantly would buy again and they have one year warranty<br />I'm satisfied  the price was so reasonable as well!!
1,fits nicely in my ears and can have them for hours
1,"Great headphones, unfortunately I only got<br />to use them for two days . I lost them at a club."
1,Arrived when stated. Easy to use out of the box. Comfortable. Great sound.
1,So far they sound pretty descent.  Battery seems to last right at 8ish  hours before a voice comes on and tell you &#34;low battery&#34;.<br /><br />Update 3/26/19<br />These headphones are still running strong with almost daily use. I cant find my orig purchase date but I'd say mine are easily 2 years old by now. Battery life is still excellent as well as the sound quality.
0,"I bought these headphones on OCT 7, 2017. All of a sudden, they stopped charging and working! The product is made to work only for 1 year."
1,easy set up-comfortable to wear.  fast delivery
1,I like that they are good with bluetooth.
1,"My new phone does not have a 3.5mm headphone jack, which bugs the crap out of me, but here we are. Searching around I found these headphones and decided to give them a shot. Getting Windows 7 to talk to them consistently is not the easiest, but that is a Windows 7 issue. At first the sound when connected to my work laptop (win7) was rather muffled and I was discouraged. Connecting to my phone seemed to work without issue so I updated some drivers and things are now happy on the laptop as well. The single gripe I have is that the bud angle is fixed, making it a little uncomfortable for my left year. An older pair of headphones came with a similar but smaller eartip, so I have that on which helps, but the bigger issue is the angle which causes pressing. I'm 2 days in, but I used them at work for several hours, and at night I listened to an audiobook for a few hours, and I am relatively pleased thus far. I will update this review should anything change."
1,I've been using these headphones for more than a year and I was pleasantly surprised that they still work well. Battery life is more than enough for a run and they are pretty comfortable.
1,"They are comfortable, sound good, and easy to use... battery life lasts about 8 hours but once you hear the voice come on and say that the battery is low you only have about 20 minutes left before they die just a heads up but still awesome and worth every penny so far"
1,Sound cancellation not an issue… use for talk radio mostly….entertainment while exercising
1,"As an active person who uses headphones 5 days out of the week really can't be too disappointed that they wear out quick. 7 months is how long this brand lasted. Longer then my beats so that's to say something. I can no longer charge the headphones because the charging port on the headphones just wore out. Sound quality is good, not Bose quality but decent enough if your looking for something that's better then you would expect."
1,"These have better sound quality, and fit better than some of the more expensive ones."
1,"Amazing headphones.Has phenomenal distance from phone, amazing aound. Well worth every penny!"
1,I love ❤ the sound quality and great for workouts!
1,The hook around the ear is too large and they are hard to keep in my ears.
1,"On top of the fact that these earbuds work amazing and the sound quality is top notch, the costumer service  is amazing. I had a small problem with my earbuds and the company responded to my email in minutes! I highly recommend these earbuds to anyone looking for a quality product."
1,"Great sounding headphones,very good bass and comfortable"
1,"I've been using these Senso earbuds for about a week. I'm very happy with the distance they can cover away from my phone and the excellent sound quality they provide. They are very easy to use when changing the volume, advancing my music and taking a phone call.  Feeling very hopeful that these will last longer than my previous earbuds that failed me after about 9 months and cost me twice the price. I'll let you know how I'm feeling about them in a year."
1,"These are amazing!  I absolutely love everything about them!  The sound quality is better then my beats, definitely recommend!"
0,I really enjoyed these but only for a short time. The headphones only stay charged for about 15-30 minutes now. I have only had them since April. Not even a year yet. I would not purchase for the price.
1,"They sound great, comfortable."
0,Great headphones until they broke after a week of use....!!!
1,so far so good!! love em
1,"Awesome product, awesome presentation, awesome packaging... and great sound quality.. .easy to setup and configure."
1,"They came quickly, are very flexible and easy to match to my phone.  I go swimming several times a week and need to have good music to swim with.  These are very nice and come with everything that you need to charge them, including a car charger.  Very impressed."
1,"Of the several inexpensive Chinese BT head sets I have tried, these seems to have one of the better sound qualities, however, the over-the-ear loops don't do anything, they are too high to rest on my particular ear profile.  Nothing unusual there, just an average white male.  Returning these instead of getting plastic surgery.  Really disappointed that the ear hook cannot be adjusted, should have some sort of embedded bendable memory structure, or an alternate (smaller) ear hook.<br /><br />Bought these ear buds for the gym, hoping they would stay in place for running on the treadmill, etc., but the only thing holding them in place is the ear bug themselves.<br /><br />I just got a pair of Anker SoundBuds Sport NB10, these seems stay in place very well when active.  Will be trying at the gym this week."
1,"I’ve had these for 6 months and run in them daily 7-9 miles.  They work great, sound great and charge quickly."
1,"I really like the ear buds, thanks. In fact, I like them so much, that I just ordered another set for my wife."
1,"Best ear buds for the price, super easy to setup, tons of different ear bud sizes to fit any ear canal perfect HD sound. Louder than heck! Half volume is blasting ! Perfect ear clings that keep earbud in my ear and on my head. Comes with awesome carry case and charger. Will buy more for family and friends. Thank you Invotek and Amazon. Phenomenal product. 5/5"
1,The bass and sound quality are unbelievable for the price.  They fit great in your ear also.
1,"These headsets are the best. Have had them for almost 2 years and the sound quality is still great for both music and calls. More iimportantly, people can hear me clearly also. The charge lasts almost a full 8 hours, still."
1,The earbuds came as described and arrived as promised. I really liked the case they came with along with the other couple of things. I appreciated  the ear hooks were able to be made tighter around my ears. So far I have really enjoyed them!
1,"Sounds great, easy set up. This is the second set we have ordered for our family, my wife loved hers"
0,I had to return them as they wouldn't stay on.
1,"These headphones are awesome. Excellent sound. Paired quick to my Note 4. I can barely feel I am wearing them and for the price, I am kicking myself for waiting so long to buy them. BEATS who?"
1,After purchasing this product and using it at work for 8 hours solid I can tell you the battery life is awesome. However the design of this particular product injures my ear canal and makes it difficult for me to wear them. so consequently I'm going to be switching back to my old headphones.
1,"These headphone are working exactly as expected.  I don't use them for exercise but I do use them so that I can listen to audio books and videos while I work around the house.  I previously used a one-ear bud for listening, but the sound is much better with these and they fit more securely in my ears.  I will say that these are not petite earbuds.  Each piece is a good size.  I do wonder if the over-ear piece is even necessary because it does not really tuck snugly above my ear.  It seems like the product could do without it.  But these are comfortable and the sound meets my expectations.  It's nice that a dual car charger is included along with a cord that can be used to charge either my earbuds or my iPhone, and the case will make it easier to keep the earbuds in my purse."
1,"My purchase was based off of reading others' reviews and I must say I can see why they are happy with their purchase. These are very comfortable, lightweight and were easy to pair to my phone. I appreciate the fact that the company works hard to ensure complete customer satisfaction and that they followed-up immediately after shipment. I would definitely buy another should I need a second pair."
1,I never leave reviews. These are great. Awesome price. Love the case!
0,Absolutely the worst wireless headphones I have ever had. I charge them all night and get about 30 minutes use out of them before they are completely dead. I will never buy these again. Do not recommend at all. I could have just gotten a bad pair. I would love to hear back from the company about their product.
1,These are a great buy. I love them.
1,Nice
1,"Good product, great value! They were easy to pair with my phone and have an excellent range. I'm very please!"
1,"I use wireless headphones ALOT.  I own several sets- this one is always the first one I put on charge.  Reliable, simple to use, and comfy!"
1,"So far I really do like them, I mainly used them at the gym and work. They stay in my ears when I work out (running) and everything else."
1,My husband has ordered three pairs now.  Both my husband and 11 year old son love how comfortable they are.
1,"I wasn't feeling these buds, at all. I was going to return them. However, I found that replacing the ear pads with a pair from a different pair of earbuds that I was using made all the difference in the world. Plenty of bass, plenty of highs and spatial sound. It's really all about the fit. If you can find ear pads that fit your ear canals, well, you will not be disappointed."
1,The packaging was superb and these earphones are great quality. The fit is really nice and I can see myself wearing these constantly on runs and at the gym.
1,"Very durable, dropped them in water and they were fully submerged for a few seconds and work great. Also they fell into mud and were ran over by a 20,000 lb telehandler forklift and still work like new. Sound quality is fantastic.<br />I recently needed to replace my headphones and the customer service was fantastic. The representatives were courteous and responded within hours of each email I sent."
0,"After using them for less than a yr, it no longer charges. Tried to change chargers but that didnt work either. Very disappointed"
1,This purchase was made for my daughter and she is pleased with the product.
0,"They seemed great, connected easily but sadly the one I got does not work properly. The - button does not function correctly, I can't turn the volume down or go the previous track. The + does work so it's definitely a factory problem."
0,"The sound was great, but I could never quite find the perfect fit for earbuds (I'm 5'9'' and average build). It wasn't a bad enough fit to return them though. And then after 6 months of somewhat regular use (for running a few times a week), they just quit working. Buy at your own risk."
1,I'm in love with the quality and price. Great with work outs
0,"The Earbuds Do Not Stay !!!!<br />I just received my order last night. It had a nice package and a well equipped set of charger, case, earbuds & ... but I am so CONFUSED abut the<br />22000 reviews on this product. I purchased it based on all the reviews and to my SURPRISE IT DOES NOT EVEN STAY IN MY EAR FOR AN HOUR.<br />I tried it on at home while I was running errands in my house and I had to adjust it every few minutes and overtime I was trying to tuck it in my year my hand would touch the ON/OFF button on the earbud and it will turn off. The ear pieces are so mall there is no other room to fid for adjusting it and your finger will hit the ON/OFF button. It finally fell off despite many attempts. I do work out at the gym and jogging in nature so this headphone does not do me service. I do not understand how other people did nit mention this in their reviews."
1,I liked this headphone set so much that I have already recommended it to several people ... extremely comfortable to wear ... very easy to sync with my iPhone ... simple control buttons that are easy to find ... incredible sound ... and no one that I've spoken to via the telephone has mentioned they could tell I was on a headset ...
1,For the price 100% - it's subjective though and not as bass as I'd like - but a good gift for someone in the family that doesn't like as much BOSE type bass - it's in a better place now.
1,Super high quality. Comes with a carrying case. Easy to set up and use. Great audio quality.
1,Excellent headset for moving about ! Bluetooth range is strong and battery charge gets me through the gym and listening to audible when I get home - quite comfortable- very satisfied with purchase !
1,The best
0,Stopped working 40 days after purchase. It's as if they specifically engineered them to work for just enough time until customers can't return them. Absolute junk. Don't waste your money or time on this.
1,"Bought a pair for my son for birthday, his wife sent me what he wanted. The price was so good I got a pair for myself! I used them when I was at gym and was very happy . Awesome sound(better than my Sharper Image overhead headphones). Phone system worked great when my wife called. Would buy again!"
1,"Owned for about a week and the product has been great so far!<br /><br />Sound Quality = 9 (not Bose, but great for money)<br /><br />Comfort = 9 (The wrap around is functional, but not as secure as the rigid plastics)<br /><br />Ease of Use = 10 (Turn on and go)<br /><br />Performance = 9 (I've gone on 2 long distance runs with no issues.  I did have to readjust once due to the non-rigid wrap around but it is miles ahead of the in-ear style with hooks)"
1,Excellent product easy to managed
0,Only lasted a month and a half and now they're dead and won't take a charge.
1,"The value for the dollar is huge on these buds. I needed something that would stay in my ears while being active and these delivered, once I found the ear tips that fit (I used the foam ones that came with it). I do wish that they would allow for the Comply tips to fit, but the connection is too small. Sound is good and they're comfortable to wear for hours. Minimal Bluetooth issues - occasionally a hiccup but that's normal for these devices. You get a ton of goodies in the box, including a cool two-headed charging cable, which will save space in the glove box of the car. Just two wishes for me: they feel a little cheap, so perhaps a better plastic (I'm coming from a set of Jaybird Bluebuds), and it would be good to have extra foam ear pieces (I typically need to replace them every six months). Overall I'm very happy with my purchase."
0,"These do not work with my Apple Watch!  I was on the lookout for a pair of earbuds that did not have volume controls on the actual cable (it bounces around and annoys me while I'm on the treadmill).  I saw these and all of the great reviews and I jumped at the chance to get them.  With my iPhone on the treadmill, these are great!  They sound great, have great battery life and the thin cable doesn't bother me while I'm running, or should I say &#34;jogging&#34; -man I'm out of shape.<br /><br />Anyway, things changed when I took them on a walk with my Apple Watch as the audio source.  I guess the watch has a lower bluetooth signal (go figure) than my phone because it immediately started cutting out.  The audio disappears and you get the beep telling you it's disconnected.  This happened so much I had to turn around within a half mile and go to the car to swap it for an older pair of bluetooth headphones that pair up nicely to the apple watch.<br /><br />These are fine if you have devices with AMAZING bluetooth amps.  If not, keep on looking elsewhere..."
1,"These sound really good and for the price, I wanted to replace my iPhone earbuds for long walks and runs.  The sound quality is great, however I can only get about 5 hours use before the battery needs recharged."
1,"Great sound, comfortable, long battery charge"
1,"Great battery life, super easy to use, and very comfortable. Did have trouble using them with a video editing software on a PC (they were for audio and music only) but other than that they've been awesome! Totally worth the price!"
1,"They're the best for the price last time I looked.  I'm on my 3rd pair.  They tend to last 6 - 9 months and then crap out.  The 1st two suddenly refused to charge, like there's a kill switch on the internal battery that flips once you make the 9 month mark. This last pair made 6 months and the usb receptor broke its sodder.  I kept all my sensos in immaculate condition,  it's a shame they're not made with more integrity."
1,"Will be contacting the seller, item needs some adjustments. Unlike the previous pair ordered earlier"
1,"Grandson uses all the time. Kid resilient. Durable, sounds good he says."
1,"I like these headphones, but they failed after about 6 weeks.  However, Senso worked almost instantly with me. They answered my inquiry within a couple hours, gave me reset instructions to try, and when that failed, sent me new ones in 2 days. Customer service like that is rare."
1,"Great buy... They sound great, easy to pair. I love them."
1,"Today (05/21/2017) is my first day with these headphones. Using them around the house while doing chores and listening to a wide variety of Music everything from Americana to Hip Hop sounded great. I'm a bit of an audiophile and for the price you can't beat the bass response and clarity. I plan on mostly using these at the gym where I usually sweat buckets that ruined my older version of some BackBeats that weren't designed for the abuse I put them through. These sounds much better and the ear bud fits my ear really well. I'll update this review after I've been working out for a while.<br /><br />UPDATE: (06/25/2017) I have now had these through over 20 high intensity workouts where I sweated enough to where there was no dry spots left on my shirts. The amount of sweat I've put out would have damaged most other headsets I've bought in the past. Also, I have these in my ear for anywhere from 30% to 60% of my waking days. I use these for conference calls while at work. I've only had 2 issues so far. First is that the cable running between them phones can lay on my neck in such a way that makes it hard to turn my head, but this is my own fault and nothing could be done about this other than if the cable was removed.  The second issue I've run into has to do with my Samsung Gear Fit 2. When I'm wearing my Fit2 on my left wrist like I normally do while listening to music off of it, on the back swing of my stride, the Bluetooth has issues due to the receiver being on the right side. I've fixed this by just wearing the Fit2 on my right wrist when I go walking or jogging without my phone.  I still love these and would HIGHLY recommend them based on their price. I don't know if any manufactures could do much better and if these break, I'll be buying more. Fortunately,"
1,"You get a nice quality sound with the amount you pay. Easy on ears and comfortable to carry during a heavy run. The only drawback is it's battery life, doesn't last more than 90 minutes straight."
1,I bought these to use at the gym.  I’ve had them for over a month and they are standing up well.  In addition the battery life has been excellent.  My use is 4 times per week for an hour each time.  So far they’ve lasted for 8 hrs without a recharge.  Also for gym use the sound quality is good.  I definitely recommend these!
1,"The price basically speaks for itself. Not amazing sound quality, but what are we supposed to expect from this price range? it just works, and at this price, that's all i'm asking for."
1,very comfortable and good sound - easy to use - would recommend them.
1,"I absolutely love the packaging and all the accessories that comes with the product. The sound quality is good and it feels like a overall solid product. I’ll definitely recommend this product and Yes, I ’ll buy it again"
1,"I have had these ear buds for about a month or so. I use it mainly when working out and when traveling. So far, I am pretty satisfied with the quality. They've held up pretty well, I keep mine in the case when not in use, and the battery life has been good as well. The sound quality is good, given these are nothing like the more fancier brands like Beats or Bose, etc. so don't expect the crisp sounds or bass boosts if that's what you're looking for. Sound quality is clear and can get loud, but remember, you can always adjust your equalizer on your cell phone or whatever device you are pairing it with. However, I am overall pleased with the quality and price point."
0,They seem to be made well and sturdy but when I paired them with my phone after a half an hour from being fully charged they starting breaking up and listening became unbearable.Thet also have very little bass.
1,Excellent sound!
1,"SENSO's wireless sports earphones offer a great quality product at a terrific price point.  Too easy to set up and use, even for a non-techie person like me.  I like to security of the ear wrap-arounds and they do not interfere with walking, running or working out at the gym.  Highly recommend SENSO."
1,"Big points for durability. This set of bluetooth headphones has lasted the longest of 4 different types I've owned. The only thing that makes it slightly less than perfect is there is somewhat annoying high-pitched buzz in the gaps between switching apps/playlists. This can be minimized by turning the volume down on the headphones and turning the volume up higher on your phone, ."
1,"They are good, but in grocery stores and inside some buildings the Bluetooth is interfered with very easily."
1,Great headphones. Good sound and like the extras they sent. Stay on my ears!
1,"Sound good - better than i expected, do a good job of blocking outside noise."
0,This is the second pair I bought. First was for me and work great. This pair I bought in September for my teenage son for Christmas. He started using them right away and within 3 weeks they fell apart
0,This is my second pair of these. These put out about 30% of the volume the last ones did. Totally not acceptable.
1,"I've been looking for a good pair of affordable earbuds for a while these are excellent! I love 70s  funk and old school rap so my music is bass heavy. These have a deep, clear bass sound. I'm pleasantly surprised"
1,"These are ok for gym abuse. Holds charge and withstands sweat, Sound is ok"
1,Very comfortable design and they sound great great during my workout!
1,So far so good...I have used 2 days in a row and they have been great. will know more in a few weeks. Stay tuned
1,These headphones are great for the price.  They put out good clear sound.  Bass is really not bad either.  The part that goes around your ear is pretty flimsy and could be in more structurally sturdy.  The controls are easy to use and convenient.  Pairing to your device is really easy.  The noise cancelling is just OK.  When you have these headphones on while riding a bike you do get a lot of wind noise.<br />One thing that I don't like is the cord that runs in the back of your neck can get stuck a bit on your stick as you move your head around therefore pulling the earbuds out of your ear some.
1,I'm a runner and these are fantastic.  They never fall out of place - I don't worry for a second they are falling out.  The sound is great.  I can speak if I get a phone call and it seems to work good.  I don't have any connectivity issues.  Worth every penny!
1,"Worked as advertised. I've had them for three months and have worn them while working out and they stayed on. Ran in the rain and had no issues with water, getting into them. My only complaint is the difficulty in opening the little cover for the charge port. After a few times of opening to charge, the little nib used to open it, broke off."
1,The best Bluetooth ever.
1,Love them use them everyday at the gym and for outdoor activities great product great quality would buy them again.
0,"If I were writing this review 5 years ago it would be 5 stars. My original pair recently broke so I figured I'd get the same ones again. The quality was amazing up until the end, they only broke because I tore the wore by accident.<br /><br />Something at the factory changed big time, there's a noticeable drop in sound quality plus the part that wraps around your ear doesn't bend anymore making it basically pointless. Such a shame, I thought I could keep faith in this company but they seem to be cutting corners and running their brand name into the dirt to make some easy money before going bankrupt. Stay away!"
1,"I use these for runs and other workouts. They stay in my ears, are comfortable to wear. Have volume adjustment on the ear bud. I sweat all over them and theyre still 100%. Does not drain my cell battery either, and the headphones hold a charge for hours. I went through 2 other diff types/brands before i found these and i love them"
1,"I got these for my boyfriend for Christmas and he uses them almost everyday. He says the range is great. At work, sometimes he'll leave his phone at his desk and go to the bathroom with the headphones still in, and they'd still be playing music. The carrying case is great for him because he had gone through at least 3 sets of earbuds that were broken/ripped due to his carelessness after he tossed them around. Being able to take phone calls with them is a plus too."
0,Sound is decent. Physical build quality seems good too. Bluetooth connection is not good at all. There are constant skips and stutters when playing music. Sometimes the headphones will disconnect for no reason and sometimes the voice that says &#34;connected&#34; will turn on while playing music. I would definitely recommend looking at another brand.
1,"I've been using this for a month now and it works great! Sound is clear and if you walk a certain distance away from your phone, it will beep to notify you. I love the hands-free! I can do practically anything with these wireless headphones. Definitely recommend the headphones."
1,The greatest
1,WORKS GREAT BEST PART IT DOESN'T HAVE TO GO INTO THE EAR CANAL.
1,Great value for the cost!  Easy to use! I also thought the sound was excellent
1,I love these headphones so far! I've only had them for a few days but they are pretty awesome! They were very easy to use and the sound is very clear!
1,"These are primarily used for flights and yard work. The sound quality is very good for both music and voice. I would recommend these to family and friends, and would buy these again."
1,"The headphones are well designed for athletic activities, commuting. The sound is clear. The head phones will literally say power on and power off to save the battery life. Honestly they have an excellent battery life because I've charged them once and used them for over 6 hours with no slowing down."
1,The value of these are great. They have good sound quality for everything from classical to metal. Hip-hop to country.
1,These headphones are great.  I replaced the wired Apple Earpods with these.  I use them while mowing the lawn.  They stay in my ears and don't limit my movements like the wired headphones tend to do.  The sound quality is more than adequate and the controls are easy to use.
1,"These are good headphones for the price, sound quality is great considering the price point. The one con I have is the rubber part that wraps around your ear. Thus piece us flimsy and caught me off guard. I have no issues with it falling out during normal use, but these may become dislodged while wiring out, specifically while jumping."
1,So far so good!  I've had them for 2 weeks with no issues.  Sound good and fit as they should.  I
1,I had originally ordered Otium wireless headphones from Amazon. Talked to three different friends who all stated they heard a annoying voice echo when talking to me. I returned them to Amazon.....no problem. So far the Senso headphones are working perfectly.
1,I bought them for listening during showers.. seem to work great for that.
1,"I have had them for about a month, been able to travel and workout with them. They have great sound quality, good battery life and recharge quickly. The only thing that is not really that great is the mic; if a call comes in, while in use, they get a little static and make me sound far away. Otherwise so far so good."
1,Seems like a good product so far. Good sound for the money.
0,Stopped working within a year for no reason. Warranty from senso is impossible to navigate and complete
1,I have tried them and they seem to be as mentioned and so far I am happy with them
1,"Love these headphones. I'm very active, i use these in the gym, running, and while doing yard work. Very comfortable!"
0,"I had the red pair.  They had excellent audio, bass, and volume compared to others I have used.  Unfortunately, within 1 week the audio stopped working in the left earbud.  Originally, the audio would periodically work on the left side.....then it just stopped altogether.  I used this with my iPhone 7 Plus.  BTW, I never left them on the charger for too long or overnight like others have warned."
1,I love these! They fit really well and the sound is great. It's also really nice to have instructions that are written in clear English. They were packaged nicely and I love the case they can be stored in.
1,"I have had two Beats wireless and they couldn't hold up to me running (sweat and humidity). Not wanting to cash out big bucks on another expensive pair that might stop working again, I bought these. Very impressed with sound quality and mic. The mic does pick up sound heavily (Beats not as bad), but for the amount I use the phone, it's great. I don't talk when while running and when using them inside the sound quality is great on both ends regarding the . Battery life is excellent, too. The button to disconnect is in a awkward place for me when I need to readjust while running or moving around and that's my only problem so far. I believe it's due to me being used to using Beats and having to get used to these. I would recommend to anyone looking at more expensive sports buds."
1,"great item for the price, the battery lasts a decent amount of time as well. the range could be better but isn't bad."
1,My wife loves them!
0,All not good
1,Great Product!
1,"These are excellent Bluetooth headphones – my first experience with Bluetooth. I wanted to eliminate the hassle of wires twisting and getting in the way of my morning exercises (yoga, pushups and flex). The controls are easy to use, the sound quality is excellent and the packaging was well designed. Thank you for paying attention to the details."
1,Very Convient.
1,Reasonably priced. Excellent quality sound. Great battery life. Would definitely buy again
1,"Works well, stayed in place as i used them while working under truck."
1,"I have tried four sets of bluetooth headphones, and these are by far the best in the $20-$40 range. I am using them with an iPhone 7.<br /><br />Pros<br />*The ear hooks help these to stay in my ears, even when I run.<br />*They are connected by a wire so not easily lost.<br />*I can use them to talk on the phone, and the other person can hear me.<br />*The sound quality is good.<br />*I can comfortably lie on my back while wearing these (unlike earbuds that are connected with hard plastic).<br />*They stay connected to my iPhone while in use and have a good distance range away from my phone, at least one room away.<br /><br />Cons<br />*The blue flashing light is SO annoying in a dark room. Flashing to show it is paired is completely unnecessary. I know it is paired because it is working. I read another reviewer put electrical tape over the light. I might try that, but I don’t want my hair to get caught on the tape. Also, the same light is red when it is charging so I am hesitant to cover that.<br />*The sound does not get quiet enough for my taste. I wish I could turn these down one more notch. The volume button on the headphones adjusts the volume of my iPhone and vice-versa."
1,Great set of headphones very pleased and fast shipping
0,It has a good sound quality if you want to use it for listening to music. But it has a terrible sound/mic quality for the voice communication such as phone/skype call. I had to return it back because of the mentioned problem. I don't know if all of them have the same problem or this one had the problem.
1,Just got them sound is amazing<br />Connection by Bluetooth is amazing left phone in house walked  outside across street still got great sound and did not lose connection<br />Loved so much ordered another pair<br />just bought my third pair for my family
1,Just got them hooked up to my phone and the sound is great.
1,"Haven't worn them that much but enough to say that I like the fit, the sound, the band and the controls. I'm not crazy about the way they stick out from your ears but I suppose wireless headphones all do that. I really can think of anything else to say about them. I'd recommend them."
1,try it to see it the 3 different buds small medium large. and very lite almost feel nothing my only issue is how long it gonna last? i hope i could buy this again if mine broke...
1,"Just got it yesterday. The sound quality is better than I expected, very clear. It blocks most of outside noise. I had to turn volume quite high when I  used another brand blue tooth headphone on the street. This one is still clear when the volume is low. (I just realized this when I began to write this review).<br /><br />Comfortable to wear it."
1,The small ear buds fit my ears snug enough that they don’t fall out.  The sound quality is great and no issues pairing.  I just can’t seem to jump ahead or skip a song without resorting back to my phone and I don’t like that.
0,Would not recommend if you are looking for something to last much more than a year. Mine stopped working just after a year of use.  These were nice and light and the sound quality was good. Mostly used for talking on the phone or listing to podcasts.  I would not suggest for music if you want quality.
1,"These work pretty well! The only issue I have is they don't stay in the best when I am outside running. But for gym workouts and weightlifting, they are perfect."
0,Compre este articulo y aun me llego lo que me mandaron otro que no es ta ase un mes no tengo repuesta necesito que me repongan mi dinero o me manden el articulo que yo compre gracias
1,"Great Bluetooth head set. Good value for the money. Comfortable to wear and easy to pair with my laptop, iPhone, and iPad, and iPod."
0,Loved these so much bought 2 more for Christmas presents. Good sound for a sweet price. 3 months later charging port broke. These were great while it lasted. Hope the gifts last longer than mine.
1,Their fantastic.
1,"The sound is great, our gym is pretty loud sometimes and these do a good job of blocking that out. They stay on and don’t move much even during a hard workout. Battery lasts a long time.  I have had them for a couple weeks and only charged them once since my initial charge. They also arrived quicker than expected."
1,"These beat the high end guys all day long, you wont be sorry. Great volume, bass and sound."
1,"Sound great , durable and priced right"
1,"Easy to set up and great sound.<br />Could actually understand all the words while listening to &#34;Hamilton &#34;. My wife loved to sound, as well.  I plan on getting another one for my wife, and one for my daughter."
0,For some reason the ear pieces are oozing some kind of red liquid. It was all in my daughters hair. I would not recommend buying these.
1,"I first purchased over a year ago. I wore them every where so when I broke them I couldn't be mad, I had gotten more than what I paid. My new pair is here and I still love them. #greatinvestment"
1,Great
1,I have used these twice and both times the music was Crystal clear and I could hear the music just fine even though the volume was only up 50%.
1,"Es un muy buen audífono: tiene muy buena calidad de sonido, cancela todo ruido alrededor. Lo uso para hacer ejercicio. El cable hace que sea práctico para el ejercicio porque lo puedo quitar fácilmente sin que se caiga y pierda. Muy recomendado"
1,As advertised.  Great sound and functionality.
1,"I originally bought these headphones to use when I work out.<br />They connect via Bluetooth to my phone and I was surprised with their range! I can put them down on the basketball court's baseline and go out to half court w/o interruptions!<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Highly durable, don't fall off even when I sweat a lot<br />- Great battery life- I charge mine once a week, sometimes once every other week.<br />- Fast connection and good sound quality due to the passive noise cancelling.<br />-Stay on during basketball or weight lifting. Wear it as a necklace or behind your head. Either way works great!<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The only Con I can think of is that there is no way to set the equalizer on it : i.e. bass, treble, mid, etc.<br />You're pretty much stuck with the preset they ship it or that your phone has (which isn't that bad!, but sometime I would like to have less bass and more treble, let's say).<br />- Passive noise cancelling is good but still can't compare to active noise cancelling.<br /><br />Overall: Highly recommend these for sports instead of the big Beats or the more expensive brands. They definitely do the job!!"
1,I love the headphones. Great sound and seemless contection
1,Would definitely buy again. Putting them in can be a little awkward but the sound quality is unmatched for what you pay.
1,Great quality and super loud!
1,I was too cheap to buy AirPods for $200 so I thought a $20 pair would work. I kinda bought them thinking they were a cheap pair I could wear to the gym and not worry. Turns out they are a great pair and are perfect for wearing at the gym
1,my wife loves them
1,"I bought these for the occasional work in our machine shop, as I didn't even want to have the possibility of a cable snag pulling my phone out of my pocket near the lathe. With the cord behind my neck I never have to worry about a cord catching on things, and I can keep the ports on my phone pointed down (keeps metal dust out of them). I also wanted an in-ear headphone, as they can reduce some of the machine noise so that I don't have to wear hearing protection over them, and that has worked out for &#34;relatively&#34; quiet machines like the mill and lathe. Unfortunately they do not fit under my actual hearing protection, but I only need that for a few machines.<br /><br />The sound quality was surprisingly good, and while they don't beat my $90 over ear corded ones at home I use for gaming, they do an excellent job overall. I'll listen to music for 3-6 hours a day, depending on what I'm working on, and I've never had them run out of battery. Overall I was supremely impressed by these, and they are on me at all times now. The case is also super handy, as I use it for my spare charging cable and some disposable earplugs."
1,"I've tried a bunch of both wired and bluetooth headphones for running and these are the absolute BEST i've found.  They stay in my ears amazingly well (i've had issues with that in the past with others), the battery is super long lasting and I love being able to adjust the volume and change tracks right on the headphone.  For me, these are the perfect workout headphones."
1,"Pros:<br />comfortable ear piece<br />Wire that hangs behind head is not heavy or distracting<br />Long Battery life<br />Short Charge time<br /><br />Cons:<br />Distorted sound - I don’t use my headphones on full volume - anything that has bass of any kind becomes distorted<br /><br />Sensitive Bluetooth connection I’ve noticed my headphones will try and connect with random devices around the gym - connection is never flawless when I turn on the headphones , even though my headphones have been paired with my phone I still always have to go into my Bluetooth settings and connect the phone.<br /><br />Overall: I probably won’t return but do not recommend as far as sound quality. The distortion of the music  is distracting from the comfort of the actual headphones."
1,Great headphones to workout!
1,Worked very well for 6 months. then the left speaker intermittently stopped working. If you are planning on buying it every 6 months then it's fine.
1,"I have small ears, so am still working out the fit.  Sound quality is beautiful with music.  Will update if necessary"
0,"Revised: After my forth replacement pair, I have to say that this product lasts around 2 weeks and that just quits. It also has a skip with the Apple Watch, and is also hard to pair and just disconnects for no reason, before it stops working all together. Was really rooting for the forth pair, but not worth the constant exchange process of waiting for a new set every couple of weeks.<br /><br />The SENSO customer service team is amazing. I recently received a defective pair of earbuds, which happens from time to time, and without hesitation the SENSO customer service team had a replacement pair to me within days. First class customer service all the way.<br /><br />The actual earbuds are not only one of the most comfortable pairs I’ve tried, but the sounds is great as well.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend SENSO for their amazing customer service, and their products."
1,"I never review products but I had to go back and review this one. I’ve own these for a year now and they work great! Charge quick, great sound quality and best of all never fall out of my ears when I’m running. Highly recommend these headphones!!"
1,"Back when I first got a Google Pixel, the Bluetooth headphones that I had refused to connect to the phone. I was skeptical of any and all wireless earbuds as a result, but I'm thrilled to say that the Senso Bluetooth headphones work perfectly! The sound is AMAZING and the buds fit comfortably in my ears. I could definitely wear the buds for hours without getting sore ears. The product is incredible and offered at a bargain!"
1,Gave as a gift and they loved them. Good quality for the price.
1,"The bluetooth sound is very good when ambient noise is at a minimum. However,upon riding a bike or traveling at this speed these headphones produce a loud wind noise which is difficult to override,even by increasing the volume.  I only wish they would allow for out-going bluetooth calls from my paired cell phone like all standard bluetooth ear pieces."
0,Mic gives a lot of feedback.  Bluetooth connection starts too skip after about an hour of run time.  Next time I will but a more powerful higher quality product.
1,"Not sure how to rate these earbuds. Sound quality is fine but not amazing. Build is okay but not amazing. I found the connecting strap to be both too short but also getting in the way (and the included tiny ties are a joke and fall off easily). All in all they work just fine, and I suppose if you use them for workouts etc, pretty much everything where you don't wear a hat,  you'll be a happy camper. But I was planning to use them on walks to listen to podcasts or music, and here's the rub. I'm in New England, it's winter, and that means, it's cold outside and you'd better were some head wear such as a beanie. While the piece that goes in the ear is okay (they actually come with adapters in different sizes) it's the large bulky pieces on the outside that kills you. With any kind of pressure on them (eg from a beanie) they hurt like hell. I've never had that problem with a design like the (wired) earplugs that come with an iPhone. Guess I will be looking for a new pair."
1,"After an initial problem with battery life, a tech recommended a reset procedure which appears to have corrected the problem.  These earbuds are completely waterproof and have very good sound quality. They stay on well during all activities and are only slightly uncomfortable after several hours of constant wear."
1,Everything from the gym to the car etc
1,syncs so fast!
1,"Excellent headphones!  I switched from a high end over the ear corded and going to these I feel like I have my life back LOL.  I use them for the treadmill and other machines at the gym.  I listen to music or watch movies on my tablet.  It is nice to have good, inexpensive Bluetooth headphones that work well so I don't have to worry about &#34;running over&#34; my phone or tablet while on the treadmill.  I have been able to start running as well, without worry.  The only thing that I don't like is that if there is a loud speaker playing music, over my head at the gym, I find it hard to hear MY music or movie.  But, I think that is just what we have to deal with when it comes to Bluetooth headphones.  They are not going to be as loud.  I don't fault these headphones, I fault for gym for blasting the music too loud.  LOL"
0,"Great sound quality, paired easily with my devices, stayed in my ears without having to adjust them.  I put them in my purse and the next time I reached for them the right bud was broken. The control button for power came off and the tiny volumn button on top was detached as well. Very disappointed! The only other issue I had before they broke was they would randomly disconnect and the sound quality would come and go when connected to my computer."
1,Verry happy
1,Great sound quality. Great price compared to other Bluetooth headphones. Very comfortable while working out.
0,"The cable for iPhone doesn't fit, the plug is short, not the right measure as any lightningbolt cable (see photo)<br />the support for the ears is very large, can not be adjusted in noneway, just for persons with big ears, is not comfortable at all, that's a shame, because the sound looks to seems good if you got the headphones in the right place"
0,"Everything worked great as described for about a month. Then shuts off without warning. Difficult to pair with Bluetooth, after multiple attempts/factory reset. Don’t waste your time. You pay for what you get."
1,This is my second pair and they are doing well so far.
1,"Very light,  Hi-def sound Excellent head set . Took some time to learn how to pair  with Phone."
1,Best thing about this earphone style is that it doesn't fall off as easily as earbuds.
1,Love these headphones amazing quality fir such a good price
1,Great product! Highly recommend. Don't be skeptical on the brand.. totally worth it for the price.
1,Husband loves the thank you! Excellent quality headphones.
1,Look forward to using in gym.
0,This product will only last For a couple of months mine no longer works .
1,"These headphones are great.  They are comfortable to wear, and they connect easily with my iPhone.  The sound is very good."
0,"Poor sound and voice quality, everytime i move the headset the sound cuts out."
1,These headphones work great! I've been using them for 3 months now and I really love the sound and comfortable fit. Battery life - easily 8 hours +
1,"They sound pretty darn good. Also, washed them and they survived. Would recommend."
1,I love your product! It’s the first pair of earbuds I have been able to wear that fit comfortably. They deliver a great sound!
1,"Great wireless earbuds. They have a long battery life, have good sound quality, are comfortable, and have good noise cancellation, all for a very reasonable price."
1,Sound quality is very nice and they fit comfortably. I've only used them a couple of time so far so I'm still getting used to them. They did cut out for part of one of my jogs but it later disappeared.
1,I like almost everything about these earbuds except for the noise cancelling. I have been using these with my T.V. and I get a feed back from the T.V.
1,better than expected! they sound better than my bose did...
1,Def 5 star for me ! It comes with everything
0,"Used it for 8 months,<br />around 4 months, Left side ear piece stopped working. and last week, headphone is not turning on. sound quality was okay but its not durable! wouldn't recommend"
1,"These are my first pair of wireless headphones and I must say that my first impression was very good. I really liked the sound quality compared to the Apple headphones that I usually use. Also, being able to run without a cord swaying back and forth is really convenient. The battery life is pretty good and I like the variety of ways that are provided to charge the earbuds. I also appreciate the different sizes of earbuds that are included in the package.<br /><br />I do have a few complaints though. Since I do use these to run, I expect them to stay in my ears throughout the constant up and down movement. The addition of the plastic that wraps around your ear is a great idea, but the earbuds still seem to start rotating forward and out of my ears midway through my runs. I have to constantly move them back into place every so often. I have tried exchanging several of the different sized buds to fit my ears, but the same problem occurs no matter what size I use. I think this plastic needs to be a little less flimsy so that they will stay secure through long runs. Another thing I have mixed feelings about is the cable management clip. My package arrived with 2 of these and after my second run, I lost one of them. The concept is very smart, but adjusting my headband mid-run may have caught onto the clip and caused it to fall off. Thankfully I have a spare, but these clips could be a little more secure.<br /><br />After reading some reviews about these dying after a few months use, I am nervous that these will be a letdown in the end. I guess time will tell..."
1,"It’s amazing that you reached out personally. The verdict is still out but, I can tell you that these headphones have beat out 80% of the ones I have tried lately. On the hunt for that perfect pair (for me). That includes fit, sound, and durability.  Fit I give a solid A/A-, sound=B+ and too soon to say about build but initially I’d say it’s pretty good but I’m very careful. For the price I have to say an overall A. I am just need that solid sound and I can’t say I feel that just yet. But they will stay in my collection at the top of my choices. If you have any new ones you have developed, I’d love to give them a try. Let me know what you recommend. I’m ordering a new pair today of another brand to compare.<br /><br />Your approach to customer satisfaction is bar none!!  Don’t stop!<br /><br />I’m a personal trainer looking for my perfect kit of gear and when I find it I’m loyal and I recommend to everyone I come in contact with. So if you make that kit, i promise I’ll send you a collection of new customers!!<br /><br />Barry K Brooks"
1,The foam cushions on theses ear buds hold them in place very well. They sync up easily and I have not had a problem with them disconnecting. The sound quality is great except for the bass
1,"It doesn't last too well while running & if you're sweating. Maybe my ears are tad too small? But otherwise quality is great, especially when running indoors, and enjoy the easy skip button!"
1,"Got my SENSO headphones late last year.  I was really impressed by the gorgeous design and superb stereo sound, plus it fits comfortably on your ears.  I literally use it everyday--when I watch a movie, listen to music, audiobook or podcast.<br /><br />Recently, I had a setback when one of the earbuds stopped functioning.  Then I remembered that this product has a 1-year warranty.<br /><br />I contacted the seller thru the Amazon website.  I did not expect much, but, to my surprise, Tekatron responded promptly and courteously.<br /><br />Tekatron gave me this assurance: ""Our products go through a strict quality check but there may be rare cases when a product turns out to be faulty.""<br /><br />Tekatron has promised to send me a replacement soon.  Problem solved."
1,Amazing headset. Sounds great and last very long time.<br />I wish it would stay in my ears when I'm running or moving fast.
1,The ear part that goes around the ear is way to wide and big it doesn’t even hook around the ear and the headphones keep falling out of ear
1,"I am very pleased with these headphones.  I have issues with headphones staying in place as I bike ride 20-30 miles at a time so between the jostling around and the sweating, these headphones are perfect.  The sound quality is great and I have no issues using them with my Iphone.  Their customer service team is quick to respond and easy to work with!  I love these headphones and absolutely recommend them to anyone looking for Bluetooth headphones!"
0,"Walking around Mew York City wirh these is a pain, a lot of inteference, the audio cuts off by me turning my head sometimes!  The mic is horrible, i have not been able to make more than one  call because people cant hear me."
1,"Nice audio effect. A little slow when change from wire headphone to this Bluetooth one. There is a 10 second or so delay when I turn on this headphone if another plug-in headphone is working. First it's silence, a weak but high pitch noise, then intermittent sound, and finally full audio."
1,"These are my first pair of bluetooth headphones so maybe this is par for the course but when I move my phone to much it cuts in and out a lot.  My phone is in an armband as I'm cycling on trails, maybe that's the issue but it shouldn't be.  When it's in the sound quality is very good"
1,"Received my headphones and they synced very easily to my iPhone 7. Listened for a couple hours that afternoon and a few hours the next day. Hooked up the charger and let them charge a bit. When I went to use them again they wouldn't sync up again, contacted the company by email and they got right back to me with a customer service phone # which I called. The gentleman guided me through simple reset which solved my issue and have had ZERO problems since. They sound awesome, the controls are simple, and the price is outstanding compared to the larger brands. Overall, I could not be happier with my purchase.  Thank you"
1,overall like the headphones. decent sound quality and long battery life. however the battery indicator that gets displayed on your phone is often very inaccurate. i've had it go from 3/4 full to dead within 15 minutes. so i guess you just need to remember when you last charged it.
1,"Very comfortable, light weight and easy to use."
1,"Cheap, wireless, good sound for the price, sweat resistant, great connectivity.  What's not to love?"
1,Wow!! I've had these for a year or two now and I love them so much!! The battery life is outstanding!! I never have to charge them and I use them in the gym all the time! Very pleased with these!
1,"I first scratched my head and asked myself ear buds for 169.99 for 34.00 hmmmmm I asked, so I bit the bullet and bought a pair for when I'm in the office working and man were they great. I simply charged them linked them to my phone and began listening to my music and wow was the sound as good as the reviews showed. I ordered my wife a pair 2 days later for her to have at the gym and she loves them. I would recommend these for great sound and quality."
1,Great product for a very reasonable price. Functional features are impressive given the price point as I see similar capabilities and Sound comparable to PoweBeats. Well worth considering if you need new new earphones.
1,nice sound/blocks outside sound well.
1,Best headphones I actually replaced my wireless beats that broke after 7 months
1,I like that they are blue tooth but with the fact that I wear glasses the part that goes around the ear is a pain  in the neck.  So I've only used them twice.  Ended up getting a great pair of wireless bluetooth for Christmas so the end!
1,Bought the headphones based on good reviews. Have now used them for the past few weeks and the sound is great. Construction also looks good. Only complaint is that it is difficult to open the flap that covers the charging port. Tough to open with nails. Needs something sharper to do it
1,"I have very small ear canals-these came with multiple sized buds, fit perfectly and stay in during excercising!  Great sound, easy to use."
1,"Decent fit (use the correct ear piece for your ear). Stay on well because of the loop. Some issues with the quality breaking up even when my phone was only on my waist line but it was not frequent though frustrating. Biggest two issues I had are the they start warning you verbally that the battery is low at 30%, so every minute or so it goes &#34;Battery Low&#34; while you are wearing them. This means they can only be for 70% of their battery capacity with out this annoyance. The other issue is that my left ear has gone out and the while the wire is still solidly connected, it is clearly a wire issue because it comes and goes when you wiggle the wire but since I use these when I run the wire wiggles while using them. Too bad. I need a new pair now, because of the wire issue, but will probably find something else that is hopefully more durable. I bought these last March, used them everyday until December and then only a few times a week since then because I could only put up with the lack of a left ear piece for shorter periods."
0,Defective. These buds lasted a month before they stopped charging. Find something better from a different seller.
1,"These paired right away with my phone and the sound quality is really good, especially for the price."
1,"We loved them. They were for my daughter as a Father's Day gift to her in the reverse -:). She loved them and has been using them since they arrived. The delivery was very very prompt, I am sure they arrived  earlier than they were supposed to.<br />Thanks"
1,I am in love with these headphones! I have been under the impression that good bluetooth headphones for working out were over $100. These proved me wrong. I use them everyday to lift weights or run. I finally can concentrate on exercising instead of constantly adjusting headphones.
1,"For the price I love these headphones, they noise cancel through the snug fit only.  I can run a loud vacuum and still hear the audio.  Very comfortable and good sound quality"
1,Works well for me. Overall no issues at all
1,When I was looking for Bluetooth headphones I seen these with many reviews. I read reviews and the reviews were great reviews had to check for my self. I received them and used them right away. I used the headphones for work and the noise cancellation works great. I really couldn’t hear much just the music. The sound is great as well. The reviewer had said that they have the same quality as the beats headphones. I think the SENSO can be compared to beats headphones and way better price. I also check how far can can get the Bluetooth headphones stretch. It was about 100’ until the headphones cut out. These headphones I recommend for the price and quality of sounds.
0,"I bought these as a replacement for wired headphones because bluetooth headphones seem to be the way the world is going.<br />Cons:<br />The sound is bad. Just sounds all around small and weak, even compared to similar size headphones<br />The BT connection cuts in and out with my phone in my front pocket...<br />The battery warning gives you about 3 minutes before it's done. I just started a walk with my dog when I got the warning and then had to go the remainder of the walk in silence. Never had that problem with a cord...<br /><br />Pros:<br />No wires to get tangled up.<br />They don't fall out of my ears.<br />The fit is good and doesn't cause any pain."
1,"These headphones are an unbelievable value! The sound quality is excellent and while they don't cancel all background noise, they block the annoying muzak soundtrack playing in the gym.  They are truly sweatproof and stay in place even while running.  The battery life is about 8 hours as advertised and they do give you a warning when the battery is getting low.  They also give you a voice &#34;power on&#34; &#34;power off&#34; when you press the on-off switch. They come in a very decent zip-up case that easily fits in a gym bag and include a short charging cable, a plug, a car charger, and extra buds in different sizes.  I love that the short cord between the two buds fits comfortably behind (or in front of) the neck.  When I walked or ran with the non-bluetooth cord attached to my IPod or Kindle Fire, I would often catch my arm in the cord.  I had ordered my husband some cordless bluetooth earbuds but think the likelihood of losing them is far less with the short cord. They were easy to connect to the source device and do work for a good distance from the source. I had researched many different bluetooth headphones and most were $100 and up.  I am truly amazed that you can purchase something this good for such a reasonable price.  My husband tried them and is ordering a set for himself.  Highly, highly recommend."
0,Broke with in a couple uses
1,"Nice audio, one of the few bluetooth sets that actually stay in my ear while running. HOWEVER, there is a huge &#34;echo&#34; for the person on the other end and they can't hear what I am saying. Returning this."
1,So far so good seems to be a great product
1,"Great headphones!<br />Pros:<br />-great battery life<br />-Great fit<br />-wonderful quality of sound for music, videos, and calls<br />Con:<br />-can be a bit hard to get put in place but once they're in they're not moving"
1,"I have had my first pair for just over a year. I think they may be starting to lose some battery life, so I am ordering a second pair. The sound is better than you would expect for $30. The range is great!! I can be in a different room & still have a strong signal. Battery life is great. I’ve gone on 6 hour car rides without needing a charge. I like the over ear design. Most buds fall out of my ears during workouts. I actually ran these through the washer & dryer once & they still worked great."
1,"I love this product worth every penny . Quality is  very good ,i rate five star because for me not just the quality is really good but the customer service was phenomenal. Thanks to Adam Fisher and Kimberly Pollak for handling my issue so smooth and hassle free . Now i bought my first one early this year somewhere around<br />( Feb.,2017) when my senso Bluetooth stopped working, the team of Senso Bluetooth was quick to reply and so as sending a replacement. Guaranteed No hassle...!<br /><br />I would recommend this product and the team/staff to all my friends...<br /><br />Your Patronage customer."
1,"I have used these almost everyday for the past week, and I love them! I initially got them for my gym workouts and water jogging, but use them around the house, too.<br /><br />They are compactly packaged and come with a short charging cable, a longer charging cable, several styles/sizes of ear buds, a hard-sided carrying case, car adapter, and detailed instructions.<br /><br />The sound they provide is high quality and very clear. They are not noise cancelling, but great on noise reduction. I especially noticed it when I was water jogging in an indoor pool. Every little sound echos in there, but I only heard the very loud ones while I listened to my music--couldn't even hear someone talking a few feet away. I used them outdoors today, and was able to hear the music above the birds and vehicles on the street. I made a call while outside, and was able to clearly hear the person, and they said that they were able to clearly hear me.<br /><br />I am impressed with the range they provide. When I got them, I tested it by leaving my phone on the kitchen counter and walking around the house. I was even able to go to the second floor before I lost the signal in the farthest corner of the house. At the pool, I can leave my phone with my towel on a bench, and have an uninterrupted signal 25-30 feet away. I love the freedom they provide!<br /><br />The storage container provides good protection. I had to try several different ear pieces until I found a good fit--now, if I could get a few extra of that size I would be happy.<br /><br />These headphones, combined with a Running Buddy to hold my phone, make my workouts more pleasurable."
1,"Bought these because of the pricing offered during a daily special deal.  I have a hard time keeping headphones to stay in my ears and I also need headphones that can still function in my workout routine which can include runs in heavy rain.<br /><br />PROS:  Battery life, sound and noise-cancelling features.  The volume is almost too much, you wouldn't want to turn these things up more than half way.  Uses the same flat USB charging cord as many of my other devices.  The rubberish feel to these headphones gives the impression they will stand up to moisture although I have not tested that yet.<br /><br />CONS:  These have an integrated microphone.  People I talk to say there is an echo when I talk to them using these phone.  Also, the attachments that are meant to hold these in your ear are not terribly effective - they are somewhat flappy rubber extensions that don't really hold on to your ear snugly like some of the plastic devices I have seen on other headphones.<br /><br />I paid less than $40 for these so they are a good value.  I would rate higher if I was not using these for a workout routine."
1,So far so good.
1,"I have recently bought the in the ear version. I purchased these over a year ago and they are still bumping strong. They went from my wife's headphones to mine, because I like them so much. Senso definitely has the best sound quality for the price. They are comparable to a 80$ pair of headphones. They are also loud, I can never have the volume all the way up."
1,"These are pretty darn good headphones. I use them for the gym and for work phone calls. They stay on well and are clear during a workout, and they work well even when I'm driving with the windows down. Probably not the best quality sound on the other end, but not the worst either. Overall great value for a reasonably priced set of versatile Bluetooth headset. Try it!"
1,Great value and quality headphones!
1,Still the best for your money. On my second pair because I smashed one in the car door.
1,I am using my headphones while I walk everyday. I love that I don't get tangled in earbud wires. I can move freely and know that I won't pull them from my ears as I excercise.
1,"Just got these earbud a week ago, good value (got it limited time sale for $22), fair enough sound quality for that price (also depends on the quality of the music listening to, you can add equalizer as described by some users, but personal preference is not to). They fit pretty well when not in motion, and it had wind noise, it felt a little lose on my left ear, I had to keep adjusting it, but it was that disturbing.<br />BUT, everything has changed until searched up for a pair of silicone anti slip grip, I got them on Friday, fit them on right away, worked perfectly in both of my ears, not just comfortably holding earbuds in my ears, it reduced noises more and especially eliminated wind noise. (Check my photo, not advertising for any company, but I do recommend them). I am enjoying them right now! :-).  If you have same problem, try them, worth it!"
1,Very happy!  Comfortable to use! Great sound!  Easy to pair with my iPhone!
0,Stop working after 3 months<br />Can not turn it on even the battery is full
1,Great product
1,This are my favorite ear buds!  Great quality for a low price!
1,"Great product...produces excellent sound.  Easily paired with my iPhone and Apple Watch.  I've only had these wireless headphones a couple days, but wore them while out jogging and walking.  No real problems; stayed on well.  I did notice on a particularly windy walk that the earphones didn't block out the wind which tended to drown the music I was enjoying.  But I doubt any earbuds would have eliminated the sound of the wind on this particular day.<br /><br />I consider the SENSO Bluetooth Headphones a great buy!!!"
1,Worked well right out of the box. After a use or two while working out on the weight machines and stationary bike I noticed a little looseness in the earbuds so I changed to the next larger size and it seems to be a perfect fit. These are the first earbuds that stay in place and they are comfortable too. Nice job and they sound good too.
1,Absolutely even better than advertised.
0,sounded great until they wouldnt stay on for more than 20 seconds. my best guess if that the battery failed. i would charge it and it made no difference
1,So far so good for about a week of use. Device works excellent as described. I'm impressed.
1,"Great headphones at a great price. I have bought multiple pairs of these and they all performed stellar. Had a small issue with one set, and Senso Support took care of me right away.<br /><br />These sound as good as products that cost 5x as much, and are quite durable. If you're purchasing bluetooth headphones for less than $100, these are for you."
0,These headphones will not last. I have bought 2 pairs that stopped connecting after 6 months. Someone please help me find quality headphones that last longer than 6 months!!!!
1,"The only problem I have with these is that I bought two pair, one for me and one for my husband - and our signals will sometimes get crossed, so I will sometimes get his Pandora station, while he gets mine.<br />Other than that, I love these Bluetooth ear buds!"
1,My only complaint with these is that the piece that wraps around the ear actually routed sweat into my ears when I would run with them and I did have to resecure them somewhat frequently.
1,The headphones are great.  Easy to set up and sinc.  Works will with my Vivosmart HR+
1,"Ive gone through three sets of beats by dre headphones and all broke.  These are very durable headphones that pack a punch In sound.  I liked them so much, I bought a pair for my girlfriend."
1,"They're very comfortable and the hook that goes over the ear is really soft. They're also a lot louder than my old pair (different brand), which is good because those were too quiet to use them for phone calls in the car even though my car is pretty good at keeping down the road noise. So far I'm very happy. They seem well made too."
1,Easy to use.
0,I'm returning the headphone when I'm talking it makes this weird sound every few seconds & I have my phone next to me.
1,Great
1,"These are great earbuds for a great price, the sound they put out is crystal clear and they are loud. Would highly recommend these if you like to run out in the rain as well as these ear buds do well in rugged wheather. Why would you spend hundreds on beats when you can get these for a fraction of the price."
1,"These are fine if you don't use them outdoors.  However, the slightest amount of wind will create enough noise to overwhelm any music or voice reception.  I think because they are so large they stick out into the wind but whatever it is awful."
1,Bought this product on sale.  Amazing sound!  Charging port broke within days and stopped working altogether. Very cheap product!<br />Spend the extra money and get a real brand.
1,Great product with excellent sound. Want to buy another pair for everyone I know.
1,I am really satisfied with my new ear phones the sound is great and they are very comfortable I didn't really get to use them yet but I'm sure that they will be all that I expect so thankyou and if I have any problems I'll email you
1,Seem to work fine...so far. I don't expect stellar sound from earbuds anyway.
1,"Easy to use, fits great, sounds great. These are the best bluetooth headphones I've tried so far."
1,"With the Laws on cell phones while driving, can you make it to get into contacts so you can make a call from your contacts?"
1,So far I'm very pleased with these headphones! Now I'm interested in other products you have. Thank you
1,"Good wireless headphones. I did not like the fact that they do not seem to loop around the back of my ear very good, I think it should be adjustable. Also, the placement of the of and on button is awkward and I seem to always push it when I am trying to adjust my headphone on the right side, then it pauses anything I’m listening to. The sound is pretty decent. I really enjoyed all the extra accessories it came with."
1,"Awesome Bluetooth headphones! Great features! Also, bonus with 1 year warranty!"
1,The over the earpiece seems completely useless to me. It's very flimsy however that may be the design so that it doesn't hurt your ears after a while of wearing them. You definitely have to find the right size in earpiece that suits you best or it will slide out once you get sweaty during a run Etc. The sound was amazing. I have never listen to beats or anything of high value brand name however I was pleasantly surprised with the sound and the value of this purchase.
1,"I think this product mostly functions well and sounds good.<br />My big complaint is that it doesn't keep any wind noise out. If there is any wind at all, it really takes over the sound. I've tried all three earbud sizes it comes with, and none of them keep the wind out.<br />I've found myself mostly using my old wired earphones because I can't hear anything on windy days.<br /><br />**changing my review from two stars to four stars because after i posted this, the company contacted me and sent me a replacement set. i actually haven't tried them yet, so i can't say if the wind issue was just a fluke, but i appreciate their good customer service."
1,"The SENSO Bluetooth Headphones are perfect.  The sound is full and clear at all volumes.  They are light weight, yet stay in place while working out at the gym.  They come with a nice case, changing/USB cables for both iPhone and Android, and rubber tips to fit different size ears.  During and after my purchase I have received emails from SENSO making sure that I know about the one year warranty, as well as making sure I'm satisfied with the purchase."
1,I lovey headphones. I bought a pair for my dad for Father’s Day and he loves them. His still work perfectly and he does the yard in Texas heat and works out with them—they still work great. I bought myself a pair and I like them. I have really small ears and they still stay on pretty well. Sometimes one will slide off when I run but that’s no biggie. They pair easily to my phone and last for a decent amount of time on a single charge! They work for me!
0,They were great for a month until they completely stopped working.
1,Very pleased with my headphones! Like the cute storage case and extras!
1,"Excellent headphones. They fit on my ears perfectly with other optional ear piece sizes. The sound is excellent. As far as volume it can get really loud because you can adjust your phone volume along with adjust the volume on the headphones itself. This comes with obviously the headphones, 1 headphone case, 1 car charging port, 2 optional ear pieces, 2 chargers one charger is like a dual charger with an iPhone and mini USB charger on it then the second charger is just a short cable charger for the headphones. The headphones charge with a mini USB connector so if you're not an iPhone owner, more than likely your phone charger is the right cable for the headphones. They charge quick only takes about an hour or so for full dead to full charge. The headphones last about 6 hours on full charge"
1,These things are the best. Super happy with my purchase.
1,"The sound is decent, but they murder my ear canals."
1,"I've owned a couple of Bluetooth Headphones over the past years, some better than others, but I have the unfortunate tendency to break them. I just bought these ones and am very happy so far. Excellent sound quality, sturdy build, good battery life. Can't ask for much more at this price range!"
0,They worked great until the on button got jammed and they were no longer functional. I had them for maybe a month. I only use them for jogging. Very disappointed.
1,Only thing lacking is adjustable cord. Good sound.
1,"Had these for a week. Used them every day for 2 hours at a time and so far no problems. Comfortable, very snug.<br /><br />I own a pair of Shure SE215's which are imo a bit overpriced but second to none in sound quality, so every pair of headphones/earbuds I compare to my Shure's. These hold up surprisingly well in comparison. Now obviously it's not the most amazing quality. The bass hits hard and full. the mids and trebles are a bit lacking causing the overall audio to sound a bit muddy or hollow (depending on the song). the high's are normal. But overall, for the price, they are fantastic and you'd be hard pressed to find a better bang for your buck. Easily outstrips skull candies. Make's beats look like an overpriced status symbol.<br />The only potential issue I can see are the ear loops. They are flimsy, but not useless. They do their job and provide further security but I can see how some people complain about the sturdiness. As long as you're not flipping you're head around like a punk rocker, these will stay on your head.<br />Battery life is good but we'll see how long that holds up. Buttons are simple and easy to use. Pairing is fast. Mic is a bit lackluster but expected considering the position and price. Overall if you're looking for a good balance between price, build quality, and sound quality, get these."
1,"Good Quality and Sound compared to other expensive brands. Have been using on my jogs and during travel. Would have giving 5 stars, However the bluetooth range is very short. Keep your phone near"
1,Works geart
1,"Sound isn't as clear as I expected, based on all these reviews.  Honestly, sound isn't bad for pricepoint and bluetooth connectivity.  Perfect for exercise situations.  SUPER comfortable!  Good battery life."
1,"I love these headphones! I wear them when I run, to the gym, and even in the steam room. These are the best headphones I've ever had."
0,"I liked these. I run in the heat and they were light and stayed mostly in place. Cord behind the neck always settled and pulled to one side but I used to be in wearables and I know how hard it is to get electronics to be elements proof and wear the way they're supposed to. Then the headphones died on me after ~6 months of use (probably used them 3-4 hours per week). I've tried everything possible- I get flashing lights and an error message. Unsatisfactory, my airpods take more of a beating, have been in use longer, and are still going strong."
1,the ear pieces could be a little stiffer on fast runs they tend to get loose
0,"I bought these and loved them, great sound, easy to work long battery life and then.....After using no more than 10 times the battery life went way down, one workout and they needed to be charged again.  Then they didn't even last through one 45 minute workout, and now they won't start at all.  I'm not sure my head sweats a lot so maybe they aren't as sweat proof as you might think."
1,Wow! I can’t believe we spent so much money on other brands. These are so great and even better that they’re so inexpensive.
1,"Awesome headphones, great bass, delivered quickly... not quite as good as my professional in-ear monitors, but pretty darn close (and not $1000, either). A little distortion when listening to heavy bass at full volume, but MUCH better than anything else I've used in this price range... and I've used a LOT of headphones and earbuds (I've been a sound guy for over 40 years)."
1,"Just got them, as so far GREAT!! So freaking comfortable!! You stick it over your ear and it's like it finds out where it needs to be and goes there. Listening to some Stevie Ray Vaughan right now and loving these things!!!"
0,Worked great for 6 months then just stopped connecting to my phone.
1,The ear buds fit comfortably in the ear and have a comfortable feel. Also a very nice sound quality.
1,Great sound and product.  Long battery life -love it!
1,A mi esposo le encanto
1,"they have real good sound quality, stay in well, don't tangle. its a must have"
1,For the cost this product over delivers.  Great accessories with the purchase
1,Sound quality is excellent. Great for jogging
1,"Arrived quickly, nicely packaged, instructions are clear and simple, Bluetooth connected quickly, everything works well. sound is clear and brisk, a nice pair of earbuds!!! I would buy again!"
0,Very poor fit to ear hooks. They are not adjustable at all with no wire in the rubber hooks.
1,No hassle pairing. Perfect for my workouts.
1,"I really like these headphones and for what I payed, I couldn't be more happier. They are conformable on my ears and sound great. The only thing I would say that could be better would be the distortion of sound when you turn up the volume to a certain point. I don't know why you would turn up the volume that loud anyway but if you wanted to the sound starts to get bad, but if you keep the volume about half way you should be pretty good."
0,they didnt work verty long about 3 months
0,Stopped working under a year.
1,So far they are  awesome I would recommend  them to my friends.
1,"Pros: Fits well and stays put through workouts and sound is great for the price range.<br /><br />Cons: Constant disconnects, like record/ cd skipping about once a minute. Did test with different phones (Apple and Droid) and issue was consistent regardless if phone was 1 foot away or 10 feet.  More testing found just tilting my head in certain positions would cause this to the point of full disconnect. Not sure if the Bluetooth receiver is in the ear buds or the connecting strap but definitely an issue that at times will have you wanting to just drop them in the trash."
1,Love these headphones. If you leave them in for a long time they hurt your ear a bit.
0,I was looking for Bluetooth headphones for jogging and I found these 4 star rating. I order them they came on time with a nice case they work great for about 4 months then they stop working tried to fix them but couldn’t. 1 star for the case
1,"I was a bit surprised when I first used them. 20$ how good could they really be. Well the 30k ppl are right. They Rock!!! Great sound all around. The ONLY thing I didnt like was the case that it comes with. I can see how ppl break the buds. It's to tight in the case for the buds. I recommend using the box it comes in. The box is way better fit, harder, more room if you'd like to take a few extra items with them. All around I love these buds. I would 100% buy them again."
1,I take long walks or hikes up to 15 miles (occasionally more) and got tired of carrying my Kindle Fire with plug in ear buds that necessitated carrying the fire in my hand and would occasionally pull out. I like to listen to audio books as I walk and with the Bluetooth capability I can pack the fire in my leg pack (that I also bought on Amazon) and be able to remotely control sound and stop the book when necessary. I have no trouble with the Bluetooth connection and it maintains a charge for at least eight hours if properly charged. I plug in the 3 foot cord to the ear buds and the other end into my kindle charger for charging. When I want I can also listen to any other audio available on my Kindle Fire. For my purposes this is an outstanding purchase that really makes it easy to listen to books on hikes. It is also comfortable to wear. I have also shown this item to young teenagers that I have seen having trouble with plug in ear buds while on hikes or on the street in the city and some have tried them and really seem to like them. (They are listening to music of all kinds.) So apparently at least some people listening to music do enjoy the practicality of the Senso device. They also make it easy to hear traffic and hear the warnings bicyclists give when they are passing pedestrians on the trail.
1,"a perfect, inexpensive, solution for my cellphone with broken headphone jack."
1,"Smart buy! Very pleased with these Headphones, great sound, comfortable and easy to use."
1,"I bought these a few weeks ago and have had a chance to use them in a variety of workouts. During my first few weeks, I haven't had any problems with these headphones. If that changes, I will update this review.<br /><br />1. Quality- They have a solid feel. Easy to use buttons all on one side with a few helpful short cuts built in (ie answering phone calls, skipping, pausing, etc). They have a great sound for working out. They definitely have more than enough noise to hurt your ears, so heads up on making sure they didn't sneak to full volume. I'm not an audiophile, but these definitely have a solid, well balanced sound. If you're looking for a workout headphone with good noise, these will work.<br /><br />2. Comfort- The earbuds are soft and fit well inside my ear. They send an array of sizes, so everyone should find a fit. The soft rubber that hooks over your ear is just enough keep them over your ears, even while running, but  isn't a solid piece pressing into your skull. .<br /><br />3.Charge- These have a pretty decent battery. I used mine over four 1.5-2 hr workouts. On the fourth one they started telling me low battery. You can get a quick charge on them and be ready to go. They come with a variety of charging accessories. It charges off a micro usb, but they send you a lighting cable charger too. Also, a car charger with two ports and a short usb cord. Lots of extras<br /><br />4. COST- Best bang for my buck as far as Im concerned. I'm super happy with these for what I paid and what I got in return. Hope this helps you out with your shopping!"
0,"Ok. I love these headphones in theory because I am a runner and these stay on and they are comfortable and not too expensive.  I have had one pair that lasted almost 2 years until one side died and I decided to order another pair since it was no longer in stereo.  Here is where the 1 star comes in.  These headphones are really hit and miss. I have ordered 4 different pairs of these and 3 out of the 4 died or were defective within the first month.  Since I had one pair that lasted awhile, I really wanted to believe these were flukes and people were asking me why I would order these so many times—-nope.  Time and again these died and I don’t mean the battery died and had to be recharged. Something in the wiring makes these really sensitive and they just don’t work.  Won’t turn on. Charge them fully and still nothing.  I even tried not letting them sit on the charger too long. I tried not charging them until the battery was completely dead...to make a long story short.  I am now going to reluctantly look for a different brand.  The one pair I had that worked for almost 2 years was the fluke.  Don’t waste your money."
1,"My brother. I have one, and liked it so much, I got one for him."
1,"very comfortable and don't fall off. sound quality is good. I always seem to have longevity troubles with Bluetooth headphones and I have only had these for a week, but the year long warranty helps with that. I have heard some people say they here a static like noise when talking on the phone through the headphones. This doesn't happen every time though."
0,"These work OK. I debated returning, but for the price I'll probably just keep them.<br /><br />Issues:<br /> - Mediocre sound quality<br /> - Multi function button doesn't work as described in manual (doesn't pause/play, answered calls are routed though phone not headphones)<br /> - Can't adjust much about the way they sit on/in your ears, for me the main body rests a bit uncomfortably"
1,I have only had the earbuds for three days but in that time I can say the sound is fantastic.  I have a couple high-end ear buds and headphones and these are equal or better than those. The fit is light and comfortable. The extras you get are great also. I highly recommend these ear buds.
1,These headphones are the bomb. I actually both a second set for my daughter. Great buy and easy to use.
1,I love these head phones. I have smaller ears and the buds are just the right size and the over ear arms are comfortable and easy to adjust.
1,They sound great and work so well
1,"I really like the light weight, easy of Bluetooth connection, well balanced sound quality without any equalizer, with equalizer is even better. I really like the kit with various mounts; thank you SENSO team!<br /><br />I didn't like the design of the upper part that goes over your ear and not sure how it will hold up for runners"
0,"Got these head phones (ear phones actually) for when I walk and run. They start out good, but within about 5 minutes, if you have the transmitter (phone) on the wrong arm, the unit starts to miss the signal, cutting out etc.  Switch arms with arm band phone holder and it's better, within another 5 minutes, it starts to wig out again and cut out sound with the position of your arm.  If you hold still, you can even use it on the opposite arm or across the room. Would not recommend these for anyone being active."
1,"I was initially very happy with the headphones.  It has been about two weeks and now I seem to be having more issues with transmission/connection between my phone and the headphones - i.e. songs skipping, video transmission of sound lags behind what characters/actors are actually saying.  I am going to give them more time but it seems like the longevity of these headphones just is not there.  May have to consider spending the crazy amount of money for the higher end wireless headphones :(<br /><br />The sound quality and quick pairing have been great to this point however."
1,"Ear buds arrived with a nearly full charge. The box cam with everything needed to charge, use, store the buds. Pairing with bluetooth was simple and straightforward.  The earbuds sound great. I highly recommend this product!"
0,Headphones will not turn on. I was hoping that they would have been as good as the first pair I had
1,Awesome headphones that stay in place even during the most aggressive workout. Battery life isn't too bad if you don't leave them connected for long periods of time.
1,The quality is fine if your just listening to music 🎶 but if you want to use it to talk on the phone I would definitely recommend you try another product because the person on the other line won’t b able to hear you.
1,No issues! They sound great. Very good wireless headphones for their price.
1,"Like most of us I’ve had my fare share of bluetooth headphones but these stand head and shoulders above the rest. The sound quality is very good and I’m comparing the sound quality to similar headphones in its class Kinivio and trent bluetooth headphones. Pairing with iPhone and Apple watch was flawless. These unlike other earbuds I’ve tried are actually quite comfortable to wear. The ear strap doesn’t hurt my ear and the battery life is superb.<br /><br />You can’t go wrong with these earphones it even comes with a carry case which comes in handy for me since I usually just throw my headphones in my bag along with my laptop and school books. The case provides some protection for them.<br /><br />In conclusion, I highly recommend these headsets it’s going to be hard to beat the value and quality these headphones provide."
1,"These were great starter headphones, but they'll leave you wanting better quality. If you're hard on electronics or just don't expect them to last, then these are perfectly inexpensive."
1,"Very nice sound quality! Given this price tag, and it comes with a case, a charger cable, car charger adapter, multiple sizes ear tip, wire tie,... what else can I expect!! Love it! I have it hang loose on my neck when I need to stop using it for a while, and I don't feel any weight on my neck at all. The ear bud is very comfortable. Again, given this price, you won't regret."
1,"Sound is good; flexible ear hooks are nice & keeps them in place; the cord is flat so if you wear them with the cord on the back of the neck while working out the cord does stick, it would be nice if they came with a cord clip to clip to the back of your shirt; used with an iPhone the volume control syncs with the volume level on the iPhone - love that!  But the volume level at the lowest setting is already pretty loud."
1,"These are my third pair I’ve purchased. Each time, I’ve let someone try them, they fall in love, and then I give it to them. Great sound, great quality!"
1,"I bought these headphones for my husband about 5 months ago. He wear these things in the morning while cooking, mowing the lawn, PTA meetings, while driving, and on camping trips. So, naturally I bought myself a pair and they are amazing. I thought maybe my husband was exaggerating, but these headphones are lightweight and very comfortable, so you can literally wear them for hours without any discomfort. I'm no music expert, but sound quality is full and detailed. The bass is not overwhelming. If you receive a call, you can talk using the microphone and it automatically starts back playing the music. They fit very snug in your ear, basically eliminating or limiting outside noise. They are compatible with any BT enabled device. Also I was able to connect to two different devices.<br /><br />Downside:<br /><br />1.The were several times I thought something was crawling on my neck. It was just the cord.<br /><br />2. When connecting to multiple devices, I think the headphones get confused. I found out that it will cycle through connecting between all the devices that has its BT saved. There are no options of selecting which device you want the headphones to connect to because it connects automatically once turned on. Even when I went into the device settings and manually disconnected from the headphones, they would still try to connect automatically. So I deleted the BT profile off the other devices until I needed them. That solved my issue. So now when I want to use my headphones with a different device I have to go through the pairing process and then delete it when I'm finished to connect back to my main device.<br /><br />3. They don't work well for bedtime use. I have to lie flat on my back. If my head turned left or right, my headphone would pop out ear. If they didn't popout then they were just uncomfortable to lie on.<br /><br />Overall I would purchase these headphones a dozen more times because they are really that good. The downsides are more of a personal preference and a very minor inconvenience."
1,My son loves them!  Just like Beats for a fraction of the cost!!
0,"Hurt my ears big time, returned them."
0,For the price they are just okay. They don't stay around your ears very well.
1,I love it
0,Uncomfortable fit on my ears!
1,"I had to write thia review because if a headphone works ok after it gets washed in washer machine and six months of daily use when working out, Well done guys this is my top headphone, I only wish if you can make one that can work with multiple devices at the same time, it will be awesome"
1,"For the price, you can't go wrong with these Bluetooth headphones, good sound, and holding together during my workouts, highly recommended."
1,Very good product. Works very well when running listen to music.
1,"After one year, its still rockin.<br /><br />Don't waste ur money on expensive bluetooth headset when you can get these for much cheaper."
1,Good headphones
1,"These lasted just under a year of heavy use. The left ear just stopped working today. Battery lasts an 8 hr work day. Fit was ok for me. The cord would stick to my neck sometimes if I was sweaty and pull the  headphone out of one ear. I was happy with these for the price but I will be trying something else, looking for a better fit."
1,"Fantastic head phones. Bluetooth is seemless, cords don't tangle, customer service is above and beyond what would be expected, and they are comfortable.<br /><br />The price is right and they work, can't ask more from a product."
1,I really like these headphones. Wish I'd cut that cord sooner.<br />Sound quality and volume range are great.<br />Quite a deal for only $24.
0,"Ear hooks are non-adjustable. Too big for ears, likely made more for men than women."
1,"It doesn't last a complete 8 hours and does not cancel all the noise, I do not think it should be called noise cancelling, it reduces noise but does not cancel it . It also disconnects if you go more than 20 feet, it said 30 feet, but it is not 30 feet . I wish it would last even longer, and actually cancel out the noise, but you get what you pay for."
1,Work really great and good customer service.
1,"I have had this product for over a month now and I have had no problems at all. The sound quality is great, they stay in my ears, and it comes with a little rubber piece that restricts the extra slack so it is not in the way. I use these when weight lifting and while running."
1,Seems to be of very good quality.  Easy to set up...connected quickly to my Iphone 7.<br />Nice carry case and extra charging cables and goodies.  Sound quality is very good for music.  Above average for phone calls.
1,these stay put during vigorous activity levels.
1,"No way I was spending over $60 on headphones, but all the 10 Best Headphones lists had headphones with jaw-dropping prices. So glad I got these. Fantastic fit (multiple ear bud sizes provided); rich, clear sound without the annoying bass boost intended for twenty-somethings who want to go deaf; multiple charging devices (dual port car charger, lightening port, and direct charge USB cable); firm protective carrying case;  and it pairs with the Apple Watch instantly. I can't believe I can go running with just my Apple Watch Series 2 and these...without my phone! I feel like I have a stereo system in my ears even with the volume on low. If you've been hunting for a great pair of headphones, look no further."
1,"Great Product! Took a couple minutes to get used to the controls, but I love it. Wonderful for running."
0,They’re great for 2 months then they stop connecting to my phone. I run a lot and workout in the gym and these are my second pair. So I have been around them a while.
1,"The range of these headphones is insane. Sometimes I leave my phone in my room and go outside to do yard work! They get loud too, but are very VERY bassy (don't be expecting audiophile-level clarity). The ear hooks are made of a soft, floppy silicone and feel more ornamental than anything - the earbuds themselves hold themselves in. Considering the price and all the accessories you get, I'm happy."
1,I LOVE my earbuds!!!  I will carry them with me everywhere I go. Great product!
1,good fit and sound
1,"I had these for over a month before I decided to write this review. The sounds are clear and definitely bass. Great use for talking, and listening to music. Where it didn't sound great was using it for gaming like Player Unknown's Battleground. Where tiny footsteps and directional sound are key factors. With that said, these are great wireless headphones. Yes get them for this price its a steal.<br /><br />I've had the lg wireless headphones prices ranging from $60-$199 several sets and I'm greatly impressed by these headphones there clarity is on par with the expensive brands. I've even accidentally stepped on these a couple of times and they didn't break."
1,"I tried several pairs of wireless earbuds, including Beats, before I got these and had found drawbacks with them all. Either they didn't fit right or the battery life was poor or the microphone didn't work particularly well on phone calls. These are exactly what I wanted when trying all the others. I use them quite a bit some days & have yet to have the battery run out. I just recharge them at night & I'm good to go for the next day. Couldn't recommend them more highly. Wish they had an inline controller/microphone but the lack of one does not detract for their overall outstanding  performance for me. Well done, Senso. Very well done!"
0,"Work just for one day, after had it charged in my car. Its never work again after that."
1,"My husband and I each got a pair of these and we both love them. So glad we purchased these!<br />*UPDATE: I had to return one of the pairs I purchased due to a twisted ear hook. The exchange was painless and I received the refund the day after I shipped it back. I also ordered a new pair the same day I requested the return and received the new pair the day after that. Great pair of wireless headphones, good price, great packaging and return service was awesome."
1,"I watch tv on my IPad and the sound is good. When pairing, I never did get the audible message, but it did pair. The problem was when I tried to use them to talk to my mom via iPhone. She heard an echo, and thinking it was her phone, hung up on me before I could explain. When she called back I had disconnected the bud, and while I was talking, turned it back on. She immediately heard the echo. Not good. I'll continue to use it for tv, and skip talking with it. I haven't tried pairing with Fire TV yet"
1,"Amazing sound, received on time and in good condition. Highly recommend"
0,"I suppose they work but the button on the side that controls everything is right where you push the ear buds into your ears which can pair, unpair, turn them on off etc- very impractical"
1,"Like the ease of use. Little bulky, but stayed in my ear during first runs. Battery life is a question, but it is too early to tell if it is a real concern or if I just really used them longer than I thought.<br />The distance between phone and ear buds really is limited to a short distance, which is good for not picking up someone else's device but can also be frustrating when it clicks or quiets when you are doing a sit up. Certainly the right price!"
1,I purchased a activbuds s-250 2.5 years ago. I've run multiple half and full marathons with them and loved them.  When they got stepped on I researched and purchased activbuds A1. They have the same great sound. Better bluetooth (my opinion). Better range. They seem to fit better since the ear hooks are easy to adjust. Plus for the money it is hard to find a better value.
1,Great earbuds!!
1,"Great sound, but the requirement for 14 words or more will keep me from posting another review of anything else."
1,"I just bought these and they were easy to link to my iPhone - They are still new to me, I have only been using them for 3 days at the gym now but they work great.  No issues.  They stay where I put them and the sound is good.  I am very happy with my purchase and I also love the little carrying case that I can pop my headphones into when I am done working out."
1,"Nice little Bluetooth earbuds, especially for the price.  Good sound quality.  The earpieces tend to get a little loose on you if you're a jogger, but not annoyingly so.  My problem came after about a year to the day from my first use.  The charge port on the earbuds stopped working.  If you can't charge the wireless earbuds, you can't use them...goes without saying.  Just put in an order for another wireless earbud brand.  Hopefully I get a little longer use with that one."
1,I tugged on one just a bit it stopped working.
1,"Excellent headphones to hear music or make and receive calls, love it"
1,"I am satisfied with the delivery and the functionality of the senso Bluetooth headphones, I enjoy my workouts wven better and is comfortable to move around. I definitely recommend this product."
1,"Great headphones for my workout.  Very comfortable, sound is great, doesnt fall off during workouts.  Also, it shipped to me pretty fast.  Great buy."
0,But they crapped out pretty quickly. The battery life was never amazing either.
1,finally! loud enough BT buds
1,Love them!!
1,"Okay, I don't know WHY it took me so long to get wireless headphones for my training runs.  I am a distance runner, and I was so used to having wired headphones, but they kept popping out of my ears while running.  I have only used these once, and need to figure out how to &#34;shorten&#34; the cord so that it doesn't hit against my neck with every step, but there is a round cord thing that I assume is to be used for that exact purpose.  I'm in the middle of training for a marathon, so this will be used heavily for the rest of the summer and into my fall training.  If there are any changes, I will update my review."
1,Great set of headphones for the price you pay
0,I noticed there was an issue when the music sounded distorted at a low volume. Who ever tuned these earbuds cranked the bass to 11 without regard to how distorted it would make the music. I picked these up hoping I could use them for working out but can’t hear the music through the distortion caused by the poor tuning. Even EQing my phone didn’t help with the distortion problem. This purchase was a waste of money.
0,The sound quality is good but it is absolutely awful at maintaining a connection. Tiny amounts of electronic interference causes the connection to drop.
1,"add me in as a totally satisfied customer.... for me, the fit is perfect, and the sound is pretty amazing... love that they stay in place and are comfortable"
1,"Spotty connection.  Can't figure out how to consistently connect.  Sometimes I can workout and leave my phone on the bench, no problem.  Other times, I get really messy audio unless I'm holding my phone and wearing these.  Microphone is garbage, I have not been able to use this for phone calls.<br /><br />I did think there was a problem fitting these to my ears, but it comes with different sized ear-buds, so I went with the smaller ones and fixed that issue.  Charges relatively quickly, though the lightning charger that comes in the case worked for less than a day.  I threw that out thinking the rest of the package was good, so when I started encountering all the problems with bad connection, I couldn't even return the device.<br /><br />I would recommend this to someone listening to music at their desk, or on a train, or somewhere relatively sedentary.  Would not recommend for workouts or anything that separates you from your device more than 2 arms' length."
0,Do not work!  Do not charge up and just not a good product!
1,"So far so good. Set-up went amazingly well.  Will give thorough use in February. I like the simplicity of set-up and ease of use, and the extras with case. Jury still out."
1,These have been great headphones for me.  The sound is better than I'd have expected at this price and the battery life is also very good.  I've had them for over a year and still use them 1-4 times a week.  Am so happy to not be tangled in wires anymore!  :)
1,I've only used them a couple of times so far. But so far so good. They are comfortable to wear and sound great! Very satisfied so far.
1,"I could not believe the quality of these headphones - and they stay in my ears!!  Great sound, crisp, clear with super balance.  I run frequently on the beach in southern MS and it can get pretty windy but the earphones stay put nicely in my ears.  Very Very happy!!"
1,I just received the earbuds and they seem to work well. It was really easy to link to my iPhone and they sound good. Easy to adjust for ear size and have a couple of extra gifts.
1,I loved these... Until they only lasted about a year and 3 months.  Now they just randomly turn off and won't reconnect without a struggle!
0,"Garbage! The sound is very good. The fitting options for ear bud sizes is good. The connection distance is less than 2 feet! I tried connecting them to 4 different phones, and they would start cutting out if the phone was more than 2 feet away! Absolutely useless for Bluetooth!"
0,The sound quality is average.  The battery life is average.  The range is maybe 25-30' if you walk directly out in front of your phone.  Turn a corner and you get maybe 15' from your phone and the reception starts breaking up.  I learned if I place my phone on top of 6' high lockers sort of in the middle of  my gym I can get a little better reception.  I replaced my old ones because they would not stay in my ears.  These do stay pretty well but average in all other areas.
1,My granddaughter loves these.
1,Amazing quality headphones and so convenient for running!
1,"Great product and nice price.  Wonderful customer service, very professional and quick to assist."
1,These broke within one year and had a short battery life.
1,These headphones are well worth the money
1,Battery seems to last a long time - great sound.
1,Great outdoor wireless headphones and technical support!
1,"I love my SENSO Bluetooth Headphones.  I like that I can walk freely with my phone in my bag.  When listening to music is great and very clear.  My husband disbnitnknownthet I was speaking to him with my headphones on.  He said that I sounded very clear with no background interruption!  If you are looking for a great gift, this is it!!!  I have very small ears but it came with different sizes of earplugs so I was able to change them and now the fit is very comfortable.  The only complaint that I have personally have to get use to the look of them in my ears.  When I where my hair up, they stick out.  Otherwise I am very happy with this purchase and so will you!"
1,"These are great headphones, great sound and construction. And great support."
1,"This newer headset is awesome. Long battery life. I use it on my phone, TV and entertainment center."
1,Quick shipping works as described.
1,These were super easy to pair with my iPhone and use right away. They are comfortable and don't fall out while running. I love the long battery life so there's no worry that they'll quit during my long runs.
1,Bought these for my husband and he's extremely happy. He said the sound is clear and they block out other noise great. He was weary about trying a new style ear bud but for the gym etc. he said these are perfect. It comes with an awesome charger and if my husband uses the little carrying case they may last him a while.
1,I would have given these a 5 star but the blue tooth connection keeps disconnecting and reconnecting. Its annoying.<br />The sound quality is good for the price.
1,"Really good sound quality for such a cheap price. Earbuds are relatively comfortable, but the glaring problem here is the blinking blue light. I don't know who decided this was a good idea, but when the headphones are connected it blinks a blue light constantly. I wear glasses, and every time the light would blink it would reflect in my glasses and annoy me to the point that I cracked open the earphones and jammed a knife in the blue LCD. That stopped the light from blinking and the headphones still work, so 4 stars."
1,I really like how it was packaged . The sound is great.. I'm going to have to hide from my grands😂👍🏽😍
1,These earbuds were purchased to replace Apple Air pods. I looked over many brands including the Bose QC 30 and Powerbeats 3 before settling on these. I could not believe that the price would be a good reflection of the quality of the sound and figured I would give them away if I was not happy with them. I was pleasantly surprised at the volume especially compared with the Air Pods. Finally I had to actually control the volume to decrease it. I initially had 2 problems with the Senso buds. The fit was not correct and for my usage was uncomfortable and the battery charge did not last and I had to charge them every day. Before I could change the cushions I got an email from the company and I explained the issues to them. The person responded and we had an email conversation to rectify both issues. The recommendation was to try the different sizes and even the foam cushions that come with them and that both ears might not be the same size. This worked and I am comfortable. The other issue required a reset and they gave me the instructions for that and the charge lasts for more than 24 hours when not in use.This was outstanding customer service considerably better than Apple or Bose.<br /><br />For the price these are great and I use them now on a daily basis.
1,Awesome for the price!
0,"Honestly these are the worst wireless headphones I've bought in the $20-40 dollar range. They don't stay in during the workout, quality of the sounds is no bueno, and if a tiny peace of sweat get into them that's it they're done for the workout because the sounds goes away for some reason. Honestly stay away from these if your buying them for your working out not sweatproof at all."
0,"Product worked well, however, there is far too much wind noise and the ear piece made my ear sore after only 6 miles."
1,still adjusting to in-ear headphones and thus can't speak to their comfort.  They were easy to pair and have a good bluetooth range.
1,These fit great and sound great.  Love the price.
1,Sound great. Fit in ear good and don’t fall out while lifting weights.
1,"Sound quality excellent. Ear bud fit not so good, but I've had fit problems with other ear buds, so it might be me. Good value for the money."
1,Best wireless headphones I ever owned
1,Senso headphones connect quickly to my iphone and sound quality and tone are very good. These are very bright headphones so normally have to reduce the volume but all of the buttons are very responsive and easy to operate.
1,I purchased these ear buds 2 years ago and they are used every day since. The quality is excellent and the extra rubber buds are useful. My only issue is that the cord attaching the left and right unit has frayed. That is a small price to pay for earbuds that have help up this well on a daily basis for and excellent price.
0,Cheap.  These sounded great.  Worked like a charm.  The Bluetooth quality was excellent.  Until the earpiece fell off of the ear box part.  Now it hangs by wires.  I threw them away.  But for 3 weeks they were awesome
0,I have two complaints every few songs the headphone get static and seems like they are going to turn off and the second is i ordered a four year warrenty with these headphone and i havent recieved anything about my warranty
1,"I haven't had them long but I was recommended them by my uncle who loves them and I have already work them to the gym and hiking and love how comfortable they are , I've dropped them and they still work perfectly fine, and the carrying case is so amazing!!"
1,"I bought these to decide if I liked wireless headphones before jumping into an expensive set. Overall they are okay with one drawback. If I am walking around with my phone in my pants pocket they start cutting out. I didn't expect the range to be amazing but that is flat out annoying.<br /><br />Audio quality is actually decent. Not audio snob level but not $5 headphone level either.<br /><br />I have used them for phone calls a few times and they work well, I can hear the person I am talking to and they can hear me without the need to shout.<br /><br />Whoever Senso is they spent some money on packaging. I expected cheap packaging but this came in a nice case with a decent USB cable, and an expensive feeling box (there are probably other things that I pitched with the box and case).<br /><br />Overall they are about what I would expect from $30 wireless headphones."
0,"They're nice headphones in the way they sound and fit, but have a few major issues.<br /><br />Bluetooth is weak. It skips out easily, even with you phone just in your pocket.<br /><br />Battery life noticeably horrible, I will charge it for hours and get maybe 20 minutes out of it. I bought these a few weeks ago.<br /><br />When the battery is low, it very loudly yells &#34;battery low&#34; every 30-60 seconds. You cannot even enjoy the battery you have left because it screams at you. Mine are almost always low because of the poor battery life.<br /><br />This is a well designed product with some serious hardware problems. And fix that &#34;battery low&#34; voice. Very annoying."
0,"these are NOT waterproof. They do NOT work in the water at all. I had my phone right next to the pool and the second i started swimming, they went out. The second they got wet, they stopped working. If you want headphones for swimming, do not get these."
1,"Wonderful headphones, light and adapt well tobthe ears."
1,"I've bought 2 sets , so I like the product , connects with no problems and has good sound quality."
1,"They're alright, I was expecting better sound. But since they're just work out headphones, I'm okay with it. As long as they Last a good time"
0,"Very disappointed with this product.  Bought it as a gift.  Would not play or work unless your wireless device was LESS than 2 feet away and has no obstructions.  Inaccurate description of produce.  Since is was a gift, and wasn't used right away I cannot return it or fix the problem.<br />Would not recommend."
1,"I really like the quality, sound, and clarity of the SENSO headphones! Even though I have yet to use them when working out, the added feature of being water resistant and having ear 'tabs' to hold them in place for when I'm active is wonderful! Thank you!"
1,Fits in the ear great and has quality sound. Easy to use and connects quickly to my phone. Terrific. Barry.
1,this headphones feel like $300 i just had to get another one
1,"Great sound quality for the price, and good battery life."
1,"I've had my Sensos for a month and I waited to make sure I have them long enough and used them enough before I did a review.  Having gone through several different headphones in the last couple of months I am  extremely happy with these.  The fit is great; comfortable, secure, stable.  Furthermore the controls are integrated into the ear phones so there's no annoying control area that hangs awkwardly.  For the most part sweat is not an issue; the only time I've had some issues with sweat on the buds is at the end of an intense 30 or 35 minute run where I've been sweating for most of the workout.  And even then all it needs is a quick wipe and it's ok.  I'm not an audiophile but soundwise it's as good or better as any Skullcandy or JBL headphones I've had.  For the price I can't think of what more you can ask in regards to that.  You also get a lot for your money: a case which while not crush proof is pretty good for keeping them from getting knocked about in a bag and got keeping things like the charging cable and ear buds together.  Speaking of ear buds they give you nice range of tips, silicone and some some foam ones if you prefer.  There's a few other things they add but those are the key things.  Overall I think these Sensos are the best I've gotten for the price and I'd pick them over headphones I've paid more for."
1,"These buds are the most comfortable of any type I have used. The inserts are made of a soft pliable neoprene that blocks out other sounds unlike other foam material I have used & they stay in place. The hard buds used by other brands tend to cause discomfort for me after some use and tend to fall out when doing and active workout. The sound is excellent and I would say exceed the sound quality of the pair I purchased for my wife that were much more expensive and a very popular brand. I haven't had them long enough to know how long the charge will last when they are 6 months old but I am very happy with them at this point. My Ratings: Comfort Rating -10, Sound -10, Ease of Use - 10, Value for Cost - 10, Overall satisfaction - 10, Recommend to Friends - 10. I want to update here on my experience. I have owned these for 22 months and they have worked well up until about 30 days ago and the charge wouldn't last more than a 45 min workout and the next day I had to recharge. Now they wont charge at all but that is nearly 2 years so I am happy with the life of them but like anyone was wishing for more or possibly the option to replace the battery. I purchased another set as I really like them."
1,"I use these for running and love the fact I’m not wrestling with wires anymore.  The battery lasts for hours, they connected easily to my Bluetooth and the sound is great.  My only challenge is the way they fit.  I am a woman and they are a little too big. The ear piece is comfortable, but the part that holds them over your ear is too big. I thought they were adjustable. I have to use a headband to keep them in place, but sometimes have to fidget with them when I’m running.  They fit my husband perfectly.  They do work very well and are a great value. I’m still using them, but will continue to search for the perfect fit."
1,Very good!!
1,"Great battery life, water proof for my needs, great sound, fairly comfortable.  My main two criticisms are you can peak on the low end and it doesn't tell you how much battery power it has left."
1,Great product and great customer service.
0,"Pros: Seem well built; all the buttons operate well and as advertised, and the voice confirmation is a nice feature.  I also like that they connect to my iPhone 7 Plus easily.<br />Cons: 1. The sound quality is absolutely terrible and quite muddy and makes all my music sound like it’s being played in a closet.  None of the equalizer settings in my phone are able to overcome the poor sound.  The setting that improves it the best is called “Bass Reducer”.  I honestly don’t know where all the 5-star ratings are coming from(?). I tried resetting the headphones as the company recommended but that didn’t work.  The sound quality is my biggest complaint.<br />2. When running, the wind noise is picked up by the microphone and amplifies it, I think.  It sounds like I’m sticking my head out of a car window at 40 MPH…while trying to hear my music.<br />3. They wiggle loose in my ears when I’m running (I bought them specifically for running) and I constantly have to keep jamming them back in which is annoying.<br />4. The flat silicone cable connecting the two sides sticks to my skin and/or shirt so if I turn my head, the wire gets pulled to one side and when I turn my head back or to the other side, the wire stays put and pulls on one of my ears so I have to continually reach around my neck to center the wire.  This is a pain.  They give you a little rubber clip to cinch the cord up but that doesn’t work at all because the cable came mal-formed in the box and the permanent twists in the flat cable prevent the clip from staying on.  I could try another way to hold the wire off my neck but I hate these headphones so much, I’m probably just going to toss them.<br />5. Lastly, when I put my hand to the right earbud to operate the buttons, it seems to interfere with the Bluetooth signal and the music cuts out while my hand is near the headphones.<br />This was my first pair of BT headphones and I chose them based on all the 5-star ratings.  Now I don't know what to do since Apple appears to be forcing its users to use BT headphones over the wired ones.  By the way, my $30 pair of Sony wired headphones is my go-to favorite but since the last iOS update, they no longer work...  Good luck."
1,I love everything about these ear buds! The sound is just as amazing as the fit!!
1,Not the best sound but for working out they are great.  They stay in place and they are pretty good for noise canceling.
0,"My Senso earbuds worked great when they didn't fizzle out. But within 6 months of it arriving the right earbuds died. I emailed their support team and was able to get a replacement.<br /><br />However within 6 months of receiving this replacement, the earbuds died again.<br /><br />I tried to get another set of replacements but my warranty had already expired. I'm disappointed at the cheap quality of this product."
1,They seem to work just fine. Only used once so time will tell.
0,Can not walk away from my phone . It stactic
1,"These are my first wireless headphones and I can tell you, the quality is amazing. Not just the sound, but the physical feel to them. Took about 10 seconds to setup and that was it. Would gladly pay $100 for these."
0,"Headset stopped working after 6 weeks, 2 weeks after return window closed."
0,won't work with chromebooks without a metric ton of hacking
0,The on and off button did not work very well.
1,"I am enjoying my new headphones, bought a pair for me and my wife as we wanted to have hands-free music while we ran and rode bicycles. These headphones provide great sound and at the greatly reduced price are a good value.<br /> They are a bit bulky and I am still learning to connect and disconnect to Bluetooth conveniently. Thus far I have to go into my phone to disconnect or cannot return to normal sound/audio on my phone when I'm not using the headphones. Further,  it is easy to turn the headphones off while pushing the earbud further into the year, I keep forgetting that the red button on the outside will turn the headphones off."
1,Worth every penny.!!! Very impressed!!!
1,This is the only set of ear buds I can keep in my ears while running! The back part bends so you can create your own little structure around your ear. So nice. Love these.
1,"The last pair of wireless headphones I purchased absolutely tanked, so I was a bit nervous about selecting a new set. Wow, was I pleasantly surprised. These headphones have great sound quality, pair easily, and charge quickly. They're lightweight and comfortable, and the accompanying case makes them highly convenient to carry safely in my purse. I'll be buying another set just in case something happens to the one I just received Totally recommend them."
1,I love these earbuds! They work great! Recommended them to a friend!
1,Good
1,Still trying to find the proper fit but overall not a bad value
1,I got them this week and I am enjoying my workouts listening to music so far. They stay in place even when I'm rope jumping. The Bluetooth  can operate in a good distance.
1,"I don't write reviews often but here is why I have for this product:<br /><br />1) Great Quality Sound, Great Price, Second to None Customer Support<br /><br />This is my second pair I have purchased from them as I have bought one for a family member as the quality of the product and sound is amazing. I will continue to purchase these high quality earphones for other friends and family as this product has not disappointed and their support team is one of the best I have worked with.<br /><br />The battery life lasts very long compared to its competitors, the Bluetooth feature makes it very convenient to walk around your workspace and continue to listen to audio instead of having to constantly take off cabled headphones/earphones everytime you want to take a snack/drink/bathroom break or walking around to get away from the desk.<br /><br />Their customer support team replied very quickly to my request, resolved the issue, were friendly, and went out of their way to help resolve my needs. I will continue to buy these earphones for other friends and family!"
1,Great sound quality.  Light and comfortable
1,So far all is good no problems.
0,"I received these headphones as a gift and was super excited to have my first pair of Bluetooth headphones. Unfortunately I'm on day 3 of ownership and the left earbud is pretty much dead quiet and the right one is blaring. The box the package came in was in good condition but the headphones box was banged up, I assumed the contents would be fine. I'm not sure if the headphone are just faulty or if it was a result of the damage from shipping. Regardless of what caused it I plan to get another pair they are nice headphone aside from the fact that they don't work. Once I get the new headphones I will update my review."
1,"Its a dragon, amazing sound quality.<br />Though for sports, you will find magnetic beads more comfortable but this one is worth the money"
1,over all these are good headphones. good battery life. sound leaves a bit to be desired but thats to be expected with bluetooth. it def sounds good enough to where it wont bother me during a workout. they stay on very well while running which is why i considered them in the first place. worth the money.
1,"These are way better than the more expensive popular brand (beats, I owned at least 3 of them) these are great for intensive workoutswaterproof (from sweat) and has long lasting battery. Only reason why I'm purschaing again is because I accidentally stepped on them and broke the ear piece. Had it for over a year with no issues."
1,Khurah Javed in customer service was great and addressed each question I had and helped me set up my headphones quickly. They work great and I'm happy with the product. So much better than my last set of earphones
0,"I bought these as a replacement for what I thought was the same set that I had bought previously. They no longer have the very nice moldable earhooks (the main reason I liked the headphones) and now include some low quality, flimsy plastic ones. These are useless to me as they now fall out of my ears while I am running.<br /><br />I don't understand how they are selling this as the same product, it is blatantly false advertising. They should have to delete all the positive reviews as they are for a product they no longer sell."
1,"I orginally purchased another set of earphones but returned them due to them pinching my ears and giving me a headache from it. I saw these and read the reviews and thought I would give them a try. These are amazing! Incredible sound, comfortable fit (arm is a softer more flexible silicon material than most I have owned), waterproof (got caught in a rain storm and had them on) and great value!&#34;"
1,"Nice headgear.  Comes with a lot of extras.  Sound is way above average and basses are clear.  Well priced for this quality Bluetooth headset.  I agree with the other reviewers.  These are  not a $200 headphones,  but for the price, a solid buy.  5 stars at this price point."
1,"Not really waterproof. I went into water with the earbuds in I was under water only about 1-2 feet. I had the thick red noise cancellation earbuds on them, but after just a few seconds of being in the water they stopped working, but as they dried off they came back to life. the right ear audio was absolutely fine, but the left side was about 50% volume of what it was. after a month or two the left seems to finally becoming back. I do not recommend getting these wet at all."
1,Great pair of headphones that actually have bass and clear sound quality! They stay connected and charge quickly. Customer service is also phenomenal! Definitely a great alternative to the more expensive bluetooth headphones around
1,"Two thumbs way up! Battery lasts full 8 hours, great mutlifunction buttons, and comes with car charger!"
1,Product works as described..Fits comfortably in the ear...Great sound and adjusts to existing conditions...
1,"These are great for the money. They sound fine and are fairly comfortable. My only real grievance is that the iPhone charger doesn't work with my iPhone for some reason, but the earbuds are awesome!"
0,Doesn’t stay in your ears while skipping<br />Will probably give it out<br />I had a cheaper version which didn’t have ear support and it performed better
1,Work great
1,Great quality for the price. Customer service/follow up care top notch.
1,Great! for the price. I am pleasantly surprised on the quality of sound and comfort fit. Does everything it says it does.
1,"I really enjoy these and how the earbuds stay on my ears, unlike other buds that are always falling out and a struggle to keep placed in each ear.  The sound quality is not as good as I had expected, and the range of bluetooth is excellent and the battery capacity seems to be very good since I haven't run low on charge yet.  I like the design of having only the wire fall loosely on my neck rather than other designs where the in line switch dangles there and the volume/on switches are easy to operate mounted on the ear buds themselves.  The color scheme is excellent and these are attractive!  Also, the in-line mic for phone is able to pick up my voice pretty well and I don't have to yell when I am on the line.  I am really happy with my purchase."
1,"I don't like running with anything on me, and headphone wires are annoying. These are light weight with great acoustics. Perfect for my runs and fit perfectly. They don't fall out of my ears when I run which is a huge plus!"
1,I purchased these headphones as a gift for my wife. She uses them @ night while watching TV. She said that they are very comfortable & the sound clarity is excellent. Better than her Sennheiser which were more bulky. Also with the Sennheiser the sound would fluctuate due to the design of having to keep the ear pieces spread.
1,Good sound quality and a good fit.  Easy to connect to bluetooth.  One of the volume switches went bad within a week so disappointed in the qualify.
0,"Lets face it they are no beats. I have had beats before these and the beats are far superior in sound and comfort in my opinion. I actually think they're an ok deal for the money but what really pisses me off is when it beeps and shuts down for no reason, battery will be fully charged. I restarted them and it temporarily fixed the issue but happened again. I also dont like having to push commands on the ear piece. I prefer the commands on the wire."
1,"Not bad. Sound is very good with Good Bluetooth range.<br />The ear hook is very soft, which is good, this and makes for a comfortable fit. The cables impart quite a bit of vibrational noise into the bud as your head moves.<br />The Audio level steps are kinda big. In other words, one click up may make it too loud but one click down is too quiet. This brings me to my biggest complaint.<br />When connecting to the headphones the Phone Bluetooth audio level is used. The headphone them selves don't have there own &#34;remembered volume&#34;. In my car or other devices the phone Bluetooth volume is 90-100 %, so when I switch to the SENSO the volume is PAINFUL. add to this that there is no soft on when connecting. SO the quiet of the in ear buds goes to Max volume instantly. Other Bluetooth headphones I've owned in this price range have their own volume control that is independent of the Bluetooth volume of the phone and the level is saved connection to connection. I am going to order a different brand put these in my office drawer permanently."
1,"These are great headphones. They pair easily. I use them with a Samsung S7 and a Samsung Gear Fit 2.  The sound quality is good, and callers can hear me clearly when used for phone calls. They come with multiple eartips so they fit perfectly. The ear hook is soft and comfortable and keeps them secure. All the extras in the box are nice and the carry case is great. I'm very happy with my purchase."
1,"Just received my set of headphones and I'm pretty happy though I can't speak for long term reliability yet. That said they come with a year's warranty so I'm not worried. The headphones come with two charging cables, three sets of silicon buds in different sizes, and two dongles to adjust the cable which sits behind your neck. Oh and it all comes with a vehicle USB charger and carry case. I needed the small buds and with the dongle on the cable adjusted to fit around my neck they were much more stable while running. Not the most comfortable I've ever worn but these are half the price too. Sound is perfectly adequate for their price point and purpose, plenty of volume but don't drown out sounds around me. This is important if you're using them while out exercising. All in all I think it's great value for under $30."
1,"So I'm a guy that looked for the cheaper price for some headphones to use to work out. I bought one for like $8, and it was alright, but then I decided to upgrade and looked and compared with other headphones around the same $30-$40 price range, and I couldn't be more happy. Everything in every way has been upgraded compared to my old $8 headphones, so I recommend you don't go for a cheap deal, it's worth the extra $25. Comes with a 1year warranty too"
1,Probably the best wireless earbuds out I even compared them to my beats and it's only a very slight difference
1,"Really great range on the Bluetooth, sound quality is great, good mic, really solid battery life (especially with such a small package) and awesome accessories to boot.  Earbuds without the hooks will fall out of my ears within the first few seconds of any activity so earhooks are a must for me.  Some people make them out of hard plastic though which can hurt my ears after a while.  These earhooks are nice soft rubber and feel great.  My only knock on the earhooks (and it's a tiny one) is that I wish they were just a bit denser material as they are a little too floppy and can move around a smidgen.  Overall, highly recommended."
1,Excellent product for the price
1,is very good
1,Audio quality very good at a great price. Prompt delivery no problems. Excellent battery life and light weight.  As with most earbuds base response could be better with a more snug fit in the ear. Only thing preventing 5 stars.
0,"Great sound, very unreliable. I used them for 3 days and they stop charging - bye bye $30.00"
1,Great sound and easy to work.
1,Good sound quality for the price. They really need to come up with a way to make bluetooth headphones smaller. Unless you enjoy the Urkel look.
1,"Definitely the provides the most (in this case) ""boom for your buck"". The sound quality is amazing for how inexpensive these headphones are. No problem with battery life. Gets plenty loud enough. If I lost or broke these today, I'd buy another pair, no questions asked!"
1,I was torn at first. Although The great majority of the reviews were great there were some who gave the headphones horrible reviews. I'm so glad I bought these despite reading a few bad reviews for these headphones. I'm not quite sure what product the bad reviewers were comparing these to but these sound absolutely great with awesome bass. I've had the very popular and very expensive Beats headphones too. That's what made me skeptical about buying these. The charging time is less than an hour for me and after the charge they last me the entire workday and when I go to the gym afterward.
0,"Sound is good listening to music, but the mic isn't clear when talking on the phone. Also, these are quite a bit larger than I expected them to be. I bought these expecting to be able to wear them under my helmet while riding my motorcycle, but there's no way these are gonna fit under my helmet. I tried and it was a painful attempt to say the least."
1,Pretty awesome little headphones!! We'll see how they hold up. They have great sound though!!
1,Great headphones. They fit well and cancel out noise. They stopped working within eight months but the company replaced them hassle free  Immediately.
1,great product for the price
0,"Update:  It's a little over a year and they have died.<br />Work, good price, pair reliably, mute button would be nice though.<br />Pause function only works with certain apps."
1,Works great.  I have since ordered 3 more pairs.  High quality.  great sound.  Noise blocking. Easy to charge.  Charge lasts 8 hours.
0,Got these for my birthday less than a week ago. They won't charge and they're completely dead. I guess I should have spent a little more for quality headphones.
1,They are a Christmas Gift and have not been opened yet.
1,Great sound and easy to use!
0,"Great while they lasted, but 5 months later they will no longer charge....no indication at all when plugged in."
1,The product is to use and has a long battery life.  Fits in my ears without falling out and has excellent sound quality.
0,"These worked fine for about 6 months and then started to ""crackle"" and switch on and off. Maybe I expected too much from them"
1,The Quality is awesome.
1,"After 11 months the headphone will no longer stay connected to my phone. They will connect for MAYBE 3 minutes before disconnecting altogether. The headphones are charged to 100% and I've tried some ""troubleshooting"" I've read online but nothing works. Looks like another pair of headphones are going in the trash.<br /><br />I will say that while they were connected the sound quality was great and so was the battery life, which to me is what I look for in a pair of bluetooth headphones. Something that will last all day during work and these worked perfectly for me, until they didnt."
1,Overall a good earphone for the price range. Sound was good enough not much of tear ( in my experience).
1,"These fit well and have great sound.  For the price, these are hard to beat.  I liked them so much that I bought a set for my wife."
1,"These are great headphones! Battery life is longer than I expected, which is a nice bonus. The case is great for protecting them in my bag, which is what keeps killing my other headsets. Only disappointment (and it is really small) is that the ear hooks are not adjustable in any way, so if they don't fit your ear, you're out of luck. They're flexible and easy to move, but not particularly useful for small ears."
1,These just arrived today so I'm not sure on battery life or how long they will last. My biggest complaint is that they are way too large for my ears and there isn't anyway to adjust them. Also a bit bulky(for me atleast)  The sound quality and noise cancelation is great though.
1,"Edit: I recently had to contact customer service because of an issue with these. Not only was the service friendly but it was SPEEDY. All communications happened in the same morning and my replacement earbuds were shipped out that same day.<br />This is my first pair of Bluetooth earbuds and I have to say I'm enjoying the experience. The product is easy to configure and is an overall great pair of earbuds. The part that goes over the ear is very comfortable and I appreciate that even more since I typically dislike the type of buds that go into the ear. I get about 7 hours continual use with each charge. It blocks the sounds of the office perfectly, sometimes a little too well. These are also a MUST for me in the gym. It keeps me focused on my workout and not the sounds around me."
1,"These earbuds are pretty impressive. These are my first pair of BT earbuds and I think they're awesome. I typically sit my gym bag (with phone inside) in the corner of the weight room and I can travel around the whole area without losing signal to my phone or experiencing any degradation in music playback. I took my first call on these recently and the call quality was great and the caller had no trouble hearing me.<br />All-in-all I would guess that at this price point, these ear buds are probably the best you could ask for.<br />The music playback quality is great and the bass quality is super impressive for an earbud.<br />The only negative remark I can even think of is the size of the earbuds may not be satisfying for some people. They are a little bulky, but for all of the capability that is packed into them, I think they're great."
1,"For the price I would say this bluetooth earphone is worth it. I used bose non-wireless earphone before and obviously the sound quality for that one was a lot better but the price would have been totally different if I bought a wireless version. The music sounds like I'm listening to a song I played with my iphone in another room which is probably because of the background noise (edit: I tried it again and now there's no bg noise it sounds amazing! @.@ maybe there're some inconsistencies in quality I'll update after several days). However, I've never owned any other bluetooth earphone so I'll give it a benefit of doubt since my iphone earphone jack is broken so this is a special case... Also, I would have complained about the car charger thing if I needed it because there were some obvious scratches on the silver part that made it lose its shine but I dont even own a car so whatever. The earbuds were comfortable to wear so that's a plus. The small bag and different earbud sizes were cool."
1,Excellent head phones and customer service. Fits great
1,Excellent sound quality and you cant get more bang for your buck..
1,The packing came in just right and the earphones came with a lot of things! I think it was a good price for all the things they included and I have tried the earphones and I love them so far!!! Hopefully they will last me!!!
1,Love it
1,Comfortable and very comfortable
1,Headset has good sound and range and for the cost it's great. The only thing is the over the ear partis a little flimsy but still helps to hold on to your ear.
1,"The first thing I did after removing the headphones from the sturdy box is to lose the instructions manual. BTW, Amazon, putting a small box carrying electronics inside of a larger box with a wad of brown paper to protect it seems dumb. Paper compresses and stays compressed, leaving the contents able to bounce around inside of the external box.<br /><br />That said, the headphones are nicely nestled inside of the sturdy, padded, zippered clamshell carrying case, and Senso's packaging is a small, hard box. I found the instructions manual online.<br /><br />The sound is quite good. These are not ridiculously-overpriced-rhymes-with-Dose-you-would-sell-your-toddler-to-the-circus-if-he-flushed-them-down-the-toilet headphones. No tingles-down-to-your-toes bass nor the sound-of-a-pin-dropping high notes. However, the sound is crisp and clear. The headphones are very comfortable. They come with a variety of squishy earbud thingies for a custom fit. The noise cancellation is good. You can hear an emergency siren, but not the drunk with Tourette's yammering away to a captive audience on the bus. Bliss.<br /><br />I personally would not wear these while riding my bicycle because I think it's dangerous and makes me kind of clueless to people/cars/bikes around me. Use your common sense and do what's best for you."
1,Incredible sound for a modest price.  I can't say enough about how good these sound.  The customer service offered by Senso is outstanding as well.  Highly Recommended!!
1,"I bought these for a number of reasons, almost all of which were satisfied, but the wind noise almost ruins them for me. The slightest air movement, even walking into a breeze, creates so much noise that the volume needs to be really cranked for them to work. Since I bought these, in part, for biking, I am disappointed. It's really too bad since they are comfy,  sound good, and connect well."
1,"These are my first bluetooth headphones, and so far I am very impressed. The fit is very secure - I have tried doing yoga and haven't had a problem with them falling off. The sound quality is surprisingly good and are similar to my usual $15-30 connected headphones. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and the value."
1,"Great product ,works very well"
1,"I bought these for biking and couldn't be happier.  Comfortable on long rides, great battery life and easy to use controls.  They connect to BT quickly.  Sound is decent.  Ear buds aren't able to deliver state of the art sound but these do a good job.  Better than any wired ones I've owned."
1,Great product!!
0,I loved my Headphones when I first got them. Now they will not pair with my iPhone which is the only device I have been using them with. I am very unhappy with this I have not had them even a year and they are useless to me.
0,"Most times, with my phone IN MY POCKET, these things cut in and out badly. Even if I take them out and put them five feet away, they still cut out. I would not recommend these to anyone. Unfortunately I will invest in a more expensive pair rather than junk like this."
0,"Bought these to go running with.  They worked great at first, have a long battery life and sound is good.  HOWEVER.  I went to charge them for the second time and got nothing.  Tried multiple charges and I stored them in the case they came in.  I'm very sad with how this product lasted.  I would say DON'T BUY"
1,These things rock. Perfect audio. Most of the time I'm turning them down since they knock soo hard. Comes with multiple charger cords for length and ear bud cushions. Don't hesitate they're great!!
1,"Headphones work great. I trail run and these headphones are light and secure. The sound is also very good with more bass than I expected, most headphones I have used in the past are a bit tinny! Still waiting for my 10% of so I can order a second pair."
1,The volume control doesn't seem to work on the right side earpiece.  The volume from that side is barely audible when the left earpiece is not in place.  I will contact Senso and hope for a resolution. Jury still out.
1,Gets the job done without catching on things and jerking my phone or my head
1,I really like these and wear them when i workout
1,The sound quality is great. The pairing instructions took a little time for me since I am an older not so tech savvy user. I am enjoying them.
0,"Sound quality is pretty good for working out, they sometimes lost connection on the bike outside, but running is fine most of the time. They lasted exactly 15 weeks of training before pooping out. Battery life is plenty for marathons, I would even take them on 4 hour rides sometimes and the battery was fine. I'm just disappointed how short-lived these guys are..."
1,"These earphones are perfect. Besides great fitting into the ear, they have amazing sound quality"
1,"I've had these for nearly 3 years,  the sound quality is about what you'd expect for such a cheap product: bassy but muddy. Passable. But the battery life,  wow. 3 years on using them almost every day at work and i still get a full 8 hour day on a single charge.  Don't know if i just got lucky or what,  but for under $25 that's an incredible value."
1,These are Great head phones. Sound is Very clear. Best headphones I have purchased.
1,"I was worried from the beginning that a cheap pair of earbuds would stop working, and sure enough they did. They no longer hold a charge and I've tried what the manual has said related to the earbuds not charging. Other than that, the earbuds themselves are fine - they are worth the price. They have good quality sound and are comfortable. Pairing is simple enough, and any connective issues I had were solved by forgetting the device in my phone's Bluetooth settings and reconnecting. However, the fact that they stopped working after 5 months of light everyday use is extremely disappointing. However, as disappointed as it was, their support service is phenomenal. I received a reply to my email the same day, and within 2 days I already had a replacement coming in. Senso genuinely means it when they say 1 year warranty. This product is terrific for the price, and nobody should be worried about theirs going bad since they can get a new pair within the same week."
1,"They work great and have good sound. Like the fact that case, ear buds for different sizes, charger, and cables."
1,Great pair of headphones. I wish that the part that goes around the was adjustable. The sound quality is great. I was completely surprised
0,Not the best. Worked good for a week now it drops connection after about a minute of use
1,"I use them mostly for workouts, and they're fine for that."
1,"I have tested the transmission and it does not support 30 feet, even inside my house if I move about 10 feet from my phone, it distorts hearing. I don't know why advertising says it supports 30 feet? That's a big negative point in this device."
1,"First impressions:<br />pros -- relatively cheap, does the job, comfortable ear hooks, solid connection<br />cons -- white noise-ish buzzing behind audio is noticeable because it starts and stops with a soft clicking noise, turns on with audio and turns off a few seconds after audio is stopped"
0,Lasted a year and a half.  Should last a little longer for $40.
1,"Not bad, but sometimes the sound is not really smooth even when I sit right in front of my TV (I tried it on my TV)."
1,Love these. They have great battery life and make life so much easier when I'm running!
1,"I love the sound wow. The accessories are also amazing.  My friend had one of them and i said I had to try these. Love them. If you want to buy it, just do it.  Great sound"
1,Worth the buy especially for people that work out! Highly recommend it!
1,"I've just received my Senso Bluetooth headphone, packaging was impressive.  For me the sound quality is very good, I'll continue to use them and maybe buy some as gifts."
1,"I purchased these without high hopes but needed something wireless since I'm a new parent and the little one grabs anything within reach. These far exceeded my expectations for the price. While they don't have the sound quality of my corded headphones, these match or surpass the quality of my other earbuds. Easy charging/pairing too."
1,Love these! Use them daily and highly recommend for the price and quality!
0,Usb port for charging broke off
1,"This is the second pair of these headphones I’ve purchased. I clumsily stepped on and broke the first pair but was more than happy to purchase a second. With the price they are now, they are an absolute steal. I’ve had at least ten different brands of Bluetooth headphones over the last 3 years and these are the best hands down. The battery life is excellent, sound quality is good, no skips and jumps in audio like I’ve experienced with others. The charge time is quite reasonable, maybe an hour or hour and a half from dead to full charge. My first pair I used 8 hours a day every day for work for six months and they held up great. I seriously cannot recommend these enough. One note: these are not headphones for audiophiles. If you are looking for incredible base and amazing sound quality, you’re gonna have to spend at least 100 bucks. That said, these still perform extremely well for their price point. I was not given a discount or free anything for this review, just my honest opinion that I give willingly for a great product. Thanks so much to SENSO for making these. I’ll continue to be a loyal customer as long as they are in business."
0,Cheap quality
0,I am using Google Pixel2 and it loses connection many times. Sound and Music is Good. Doesn't work on WhatsApp video calls. Not satisfied but lazy enough to return it.
1,Very fast shipping.Very GOOD sound! Worth 3X what I paid! 100.00 LG wireless will be laying on computer desk.
1,Awesome headphones. These usually last me all day at work (8hrs).
1,Love the sound clarity and comfort
1,"I bought these for my wife to run with. The sound quality is great, and the bluetooth connection for music and telephone usage she loves.<br />Her only complaint is the piece that goes behind the ears, is too flimsy, which she feels prevents the ear buds from staying inside her ears as secure as she would prefer. She is currently changing the ear bud sizes to see if one size works better than another."
0,This is a generic product sold under a few different brand names. The fit of these buds in my ear canal is poor for my ears - they will not stay in place no matter which ear tip I use. The sound quality is muddy base that washes out the entire sound. I will return these and continue my search.
1,"Great headphones overall. Packaging is great as well, comes with a bunch of additional things"
0,"Worthless! Bought mid-October, the battery is useless by mid-March...a whole six months of use. Avoid, avoid, avoid!"
1,"I like it , it stays in my ear even when im doing lots of movements. Definitely recommend this product to anyone. This is not paid reviews by the way, as im not really good on reviewing any product."
0,"I was surprised that after a weeks use that it stopped working. I could charge it but when I took it off the charger it flashed red and blue lights consistently and there was nothing I could do to correct the issue. I say I was surprised because I understand that these aren't supposed to be the best Bluetooth headphone but the reviews made them seem great. They were not. The sound was muffled, Bluetooth broke out terribly when my phone was just in my back pocket and then they just stopped working.<br />I don't recommend buying these headphones."
1,Good head phones and very convenient. Has decent sound clarity would recommend.
1,Probably the best bluetooth headphones I've gotten yet.
1,Great headphones and great customer support​.
1,Great Product - Thanks
1,I use these headphones while I lift weights. They offer great sound and they don't fall out of my ears. The battery last a long time with no interruption in the connection.
1,Even when you fall asleep the chance of losing the headphones is much less than those without the strap
1,"They are fantastic for sound and quality, but for the life of me I can not keep them in my ears.  Why?  I have tried ever one of the ear bud sizes.  Nothing works.  Every single time I turn my head they pull on the cord and the buds slip out of my ear.  Plus if you have long hair they are super difficult to put the ear pieces around your ear because they get caught up with your hair.  I don't always like to have my hair in a ponytail just to wear these headphones.  So I am happy with their sound and battery life, but keeping them in my ears is a problem..."
1,"Connection time is ok. Battery duration, even after the low.bateryy announcement, is enough. Hardware is enough. I even took a shower with them . Price is.even better"
1,"These earbuds work great as advertised.  Also, I must add that the customer service department is OUTSTANDING!  Great experience."
1,I have a horrible problem of sweating out my headphones- even ones that claim to be water or sweat proof. I work out twice a day and these have already lasted me 2 years with NO ISSUES. They are easy to pair with any device and clearly have stood the test of time. Amazing quality ESPECIALLY for the price.
1,"I have used these for several weeks and they sound fantastic. The high and mid point ranges are clear and crisp and the bass is equal to headphones that cost much, much more.  They hold a long charge and the additional accessories show the company was thoughtful (case, extra ear buds, several different charging cables, power plug and well written directions). You can buy these with confidence. SENSO is the real deal."
1,Only used them a couple of times so far but they are awesome
1,The included adapter was a nice bonus
1,Great bass. I went about 2 weeks without having to recharging. I dont run but walking and weight training perfect. I wear glasses and they actually fit around them. The material is very flexible.
1,Im loving them so far. And the battery life is A+
1,in general works good but lowest volume setting sometimes is still to loud and the strap can stick to the sweaty skin and when you turn your head head phones pop out.
1,its great for a Bluetooth
1,LOVE my new headphones! They are comfy and stay on when I'm running. The sound is crystal clear. Not to mention they are good looking and come on such a nice carrying case.
1,The power button is a bit sensitive and drains the charge when in the carrying case.
1,good
1,"Mixed emotions on these. I have weird shaped, sensitive ears so the ear hanger thingy doesn't quite sit right. Probably not the earbuds fault though. Otherwise, easy to use and holds a charge well. I use them for cycling. A coworker purchased these at the same time I did and she loves hers."
1,"&#34; So far so good! Easy to connect and good sound quality, especially for the price &#34;"
1,"Love it! So easy to setup. Excellent quality, worth every penny if not more!"
1,"Just received these but so far I'm very pleased.  The quality and sound are both good, and I'm pleased with all the accessories.  I had no problem connecting to my phone and the bluetooth range is as advertised.  I initially purchased another brand that broke on first use (volume knob popped out) and didn't have all the extra stuff.  I'm looking forward to using these when working outside, and not having the chord catch on everything."
1,"I love these Headphones.  They are great quality, and I use them for a little over an hour Monday-Friday.  I charge them on the weekend, but I've never had them lose charge.  Works great while you're running, or on the elliptical."
1,I bought these as a gift for my husband and he loves them!  Sound quality is great and he loves that he can change the earbud size.  The package arrived in good condition and on time.  Now I am thinking of getting myself a pair!
1,"I have had these earbuds for almost 2 months. I use them when I work out for about 10 hours per week. I am just barely having to charge them for the first time. The charging cable would not charge the earbuds, and no indicator light would go on on the earbuds. I tried other charging cables that I have, to no avail. I called Invotek, and was met with professionalism and apologies. I was offered a new set of earbuds, to be here in 5-7 business days. I must add that these are the best earbuds I've ever used! They have a great, clear sound with great noise cancellation."
1,So far so good. I have had trouble with other bluetooth headphones in that they would cut out when listening to my iphone. I have gone on 2 runs and mowed the lawn and these headphones worked great. I like how they go behind my ear to help them stay securely on.
1,I do a lot of walking and these work very well. They are light weight and stay in place without bothering my ears. The sound quality is good with the right amount of base. I haven't had the opportunity to really check out the battery life yet.
1,Love the headphones they sound great but never got the car vent mounting magnet for the phone
1,"After a little over a year, the headphones have stopped working. They worked marvelously as normal this morning, then I put them on to charge and now the power on, say connected and then go silent and turn off without the customary beeps. Once this happens, they won't respond for 10 minutes of trying to get them to turn on again. Then after about 10 minutes the whole cycle starts again.<br />While they worked, they had decent sound, great range, and were very reliable."
1,"I really liked these headphones. I eventually switched to a different brand after I loss mine, but they are a good quality purchase at a great price! The sound is amazing and on par with some of my high quality brand name headphones."
0,Does not pair with my phone...worthless
1,"Great earbuds, easy to pair with my iphone/ipad. Very comfortable fit. Like the 30 foot distance as I listen to audio books when traveling and also some at home."
1,Much bulkier than expected.
1,Great Value Buy! Good audio quality.
1,"I love the quality of sound for music, however using the Bluetooth is a different story. Sound quality is not the best. I have been told I sound like I’m under water."
1,Great earbuds. Fit good and sound good.
1,"Great,product"
1,So far so good.  I really like them.  So I've had them for awhile and I still love these head phones.  Especially the memory foam ear buds because I can never find any that fit great in my ear.  My son actually lost one and when I emailed them to ask how I can get some more they sent me replacements for free.  They pretty much go everywhere I go and will probably buy another pair just to have as back up.
1,No cord to get in the way while running
1,"I bought these headphones in March, just about two months ago. I like them. They are comfortable and sound great. However, they have started to turn off while I am listening, even when the battery is fully charged. Sometimes I can turn them back on, and sometimes they won't turn back on until I charge them overnight."
1,The headphones have terrific sound. They put off great bass and treble.  However I have some problems with Bluetooth connectivity. Sometimes they don't pick up well if my phone is in my pocket. I literally put my hand in front of my phone while it was in my pocket and the sonos ear buds lost connection. I have other Bluetooth devices that do not have this problem.
1,"Great sound, comfortable, stay in place... perfect."
1,Quality earbuds that don't bounce around when running.  Chord is a little annoying only because it always seems to twist up no matter how many times I try to straighten it out.
1,Works just as well as beats but a cheaper cost love them
1,"Super happy with the product so far. Sometimes battery life seems a touch on the short side, but not by much."
1,Just what I expected!
1,"It's a very good value for the price, very durable, battery life is up to 7/8 hours, but it does suddenly it shows 100% on phone untill it starts giving low battery warning, and turn off within minutes of first warning."
1,"I use these nonstop, mostly listening to audiobooks. We have two or three pair around the house. They last all day and I have had no problems until they just shut down. I contacted customer service (a human answered (I know...!)), answered a few questions, and they shipped a new pair right away. Have bought again, will buy again if necessary."
0,Fell apart in less than 3 months😢😂 so now only one side works
1,"My first Bluetooth Headphones, and they work great and they sound great. I answered a phone call for the first time and was afraid the mike would sound distant, but the other party said it was very good sound on their end. Great product for the money."
0,"The Bluetooth Headphones were purchased for use with my Samsung Smart T.V.  Unfortunately, this product was not compatible with the device I wanted to use.  I will be returning it while continuing to find a compatible product."
1,I bought these about 5 years ago because I read a review that said they were better than beats. I’ve never owned beats but these are way better than any other ear buds I’ve had in the past. The noise canceling is AWSOME and the sound is great. AWSOME customer service as well. Can’t go wrong with these.
1,"great sound, comfortable fit"
1,"Calls were great using these headphones!  I would work on my car, have the phone in the car and talk on the phone with no issue whatsoever.  Sound quality for music play was a little tinny and the ear pieces never did quite fit right.  Then, after only 2 uses, I lost them. I think my next pair will be the ones that look very similar at half the price ($21.99).  It will be less painful to loose the cheaper set and hopefully the fit and music playback sound is better.  I liked the call quality but mostly what I bought them for was the sound for music while working around the house and such."
1,As described.<br />I would recommend and /or buy again
1,They sound really good. Stays in well after I changed the ear pieces to the next size smaller. It was nice to have a small package of different size ones to choose from. I have used them for two weekend's bike rides.<br />I generally ride for two to two and a half hours and they have not ran out of power yet. If I was to have any complaint it would be that if you reach up to adjust the one on the right you have to be careful not to hit the buttons.
0,Do not stay in place very well. Around the ear pieces are flimsy.  Stick out to far.
1,Great sound and lightweight.
1,"Great buds, easy sync"
1,"Very lightweight and comfortable for my ears. I’ve had a hard time finding phones that would fit, but are great. Other than my music playing, its hard to even tell they’re in! I’d like more bass but one thing at a time..."
1,"They are fantastic!  Great sounds, lightweight, great battery life.  I was using them for close to 8 hours, and I still have over 50% battery.  Battery life is displayed on the phone next to the bluetooth symbol.  For some reason, the makers of this product decided to throw in a phone magnet for your car, and a phone wallet thing.  It also came with a bunch of different size ear pieces and a carrying case.  Very nice of them to include all of these accessories.  The magnetic phone holder for the car works really well.  I am very pleased with that as well.  The only small complaint I have is this: upon receiving the headphones, one of the ear holders was slightly bent, and it was not fitting on my ear correctly.  This is slowly correcting itself and I'm sure it'll be fine in a week or two."
1,Absolutely the best ear buds you can buy for under $100 as of May 2017.
1,"The first unit went belly up after a few days. Customer service was quick in its response and a second pair was sent out within a day. This pair works reasonably well. I only use these headphones at the gym to listen to podcasts and watch videos while exercising. This hardly tests the sound quality, so all I can say is that the volume is adequate. The fit is fine in one ear, but not the other using the large ear bud. I'm in my 70s, so maybe it's the fault of my parts, not the headphones. The UI is kind of clumsy with one button doing all of the work, but maybe that's true of all wireless units.<br /><br />Seems at this point (about a month) to be a good value."
0,Super bulky and awkward.
1,Best 20$ ever spent. I own a power washing company and I have been through several high dollar water resistant buds and these actually sound great and handle my abuse. Great buy!
0,I just had my third pair die on me. I take good care of them. They just don't last.
1,I just received my headphones I was  pleasantly surprised  with how comfortable they are and the sound was amazing I recently gave my old headphones to my daughter not realizing it was going to be so difficult to find a new pair that were comparable I had purchased three sets of headphones and return them I was about ready to give up and asked for my daughter for my headphones back and then I ordered these  I love them and actually considering ordering a second pair
1,I would recommend they work great and it's very easy to connect to Bluetooth actually very quickly as well.
1,"The volume buttons are loose, so there is a clicking sound in my ear while jogging.  I contacted customer service, and they told me to return through Amazon and repurchase.  I purchased them on a lightning deal, so this option would have cost me an additional $10 to repurchase.  The company said that was the only option for warranty replacement.  This is very poor customer service, and do not recommend this product.  Sound was sufficient, but battery life was average as it isn't reaching 8 hours on average.  I still use them for non active listening, but not for their intended use.<br /><br />Updated from 1 star to 3.  Almost one year later the headphones will not turn on.  The company is sending a replacement under their 12 month warranty.  I think my first issue was within 30 days, so they wanted me to go that route.  I still don't use them for jogging, but they are nice to use at work since the battery lasts a long time."
1,My son loves them so far
1,I do need to return these because of the piece that goes around your ear.  They don't stay in very well when I'm exercising and my glasses knock them out of place constantly.  Do you have something that just goes in the ear and not around the outside?  Please let me know what I need to do.  Thanks
0,"I was very excited to get these today - but was immediately disappointed, as only the RIGHT earbud was working. Not great news -- package is going back..."
1,Gift.
1,"Quality: A+, loved these headphones my wife got me for Christmas. About a half a year later, I accidentally broke them, their Customer support got me a new pair shipped in just one exchange of emails. Really appreciated the quality of the product, and their continued support! Highly recommend."
0,"We're great at first but only lasted 4 months. Never exposed to rain but did get sweaty. Good sound, just wish they had lasted longer."
1,Just used for a few hours and it's amazing. The ear plug stay in your ear even while running and the sound quality is very good. I am very happy with it.
1,"I've had these for two weeks now, and I must say I'm rather pleasantly surprised by how much I'm enjoying them. The audio quality is good, with a rich bass, and the convenience of not snagging a cord on everything (drawer handles in particular) is such an advantage I regret not having bought a pair years ago.  The only downside is that when you have these in you can't hear anything BUT what you're listening to.  This comes in very handy when mowing the yard or working out at the gym, but when someone is trying to speak to you it's quite annoying having to remove an earpiece and say, &#34;What?!&#34;  Overall, however, I love these little jewels, and would recommend them."
1,Im no audiophile but these are seriously the best earbuds i have ever had. I really don't think you could get a better pair for the price. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY TO ANYONE LOOKING FOR HEADPHONES BUY THESE!!!
1,The Senso wireless headphones are fantastic ...one charge last all day...Good quality sound...I would definitely buy or try other Senso products
1,"Amazing value, good sound quality, close to an 8 hour battery life. I haven't closely tested the battery life but I've only ever had the batteries run down all the way once. They have held up daily use with no problem. Also great price!"
1,absolutely love them!!!!! sound is great!!!! great bass. they are up there with my sennheiser headphone!!!! Great product
0,"Left ear phone buzzing during playback. After I pause a song, the buzzing last another few seconds before cutting out. They are also tight in my ears and/or about to fall out at any second. If not for the buzzing I would have tried out the other sizes or the ear bud attachments, but the buzzing was to much to stand and I'm sending them back. My estimated return is $10 less than what I paid, so I'm paying $10 to wait a week for broken headphones and sending them back... Hopefully the estimate is wrong and when they see that they are indeed defective I'll get a full refund. If that happens I'll change this review to 4 stars instead of only 1. But at the moment I got a product that is defective and I'm stuck paying for it."
0,"I purchased this unit and was quite pleased with the sound quality.  Finding the right size ear plugs was not too difficult.  The unit came with three different sizes.  The malleable over the ear loop took a little getting used to.  I had very little issue using the phone function.  Most of the time people could hear me when I called them using the phone and the bluetooth function.<br /><br />My biggest gripe is that after six months, the unit has stopped working.  I press the power button on the fully charged headset and...nothing.  No voice stating that my headset was powered on and that I was connected.  I figured it was just a glitch, so I didn't use it for a few days.  I made sure the battery was fully charged with the blue light (blue light = fully charged versus red light = needing a charge) and, still, nothing.<br /><br />I am just going to wait a few days and just keep my fingers crossed to see if this situation changes.  If not, I will try to contact the vendor and find out what my potential options are.<br /><br />Good luck to you all."
1,Super fast delivery. Item looks very nice. These are a gift for my son.
1,Using just for noise cancellation at this point and it does the job!
1,Excellent value. Nice sound quality. Good battery life. For 30.00 with the extras it’s a nice buy!!!
1,Good sound  quality and they fit great
1,Very impressed with these headphones!
1,Absolutely awesome!! Great sound and stay in my ears. I love that I have 2 different charging cords so I can keep one in my car. Work just as well if not better than the more expensive wireless headphones out there.
1,"They sound very good, I love em.wish they were a little smaller"
1,"Finally switched to Bluetooth for my active headphones, should have done this earlier, now can wear my phone on my ankle and not worry about it sliding down my arms. Plus no irritating cord. Battery life is long enough that i charge it once every 2 weeks. They sit pretty nicely and don't pop out your ears for no reason, even when doing jumping exercises. Ear bud membrane makes popping noises in your ear when fiddled with and that's annoying. Headphones are not too bulky so you look only slightly douchy, but when you are at the gym I'm sure there are people that can beat you to the podium. Sound quality is decent, bass is super strong so don't ruin your hearing. Got these for around 30$ and for this price it totally is a great deal."
1,"I wear my headphones on my daily walks to and from work, and they are great for blocking out the noises of traffic while still providing a great sound."
1,"Sounds is OK.  Base is a little boomy.  With excessive use, the button will stop working.  I fixed it myself by opening and aligning the metal contact below the button.  Holds charge very well and has great battery life.  Pairing drops every now and then.  For the price is a great buy as a back-up headphone to keep in gym back or travel backpack."
1,&#34;Love the SENSO Bluetooth headphones. They sound great. Thank you!
1,"Worked well for few months, then all of a sudden, they wouldn't charge anymore.  No damage, well cared for...just shirt life span.  Too bad."
1,Battery life is great with only 2 hr charging time. Phone call quality NOT high definition. Playing music sound is ok. Comfortable
0,Horrible sound. I do not recommend the product
1,I can't hear ANYTHING when I have these in. Complete noise cancellation and simple to connect.
1,not bad for their price
1,Good deal for the price
0,"This is the second time I've purchased the Senso Bluetooth Headphones.  My first pair lasted 2 years, the second pair lasted less than 5 months.  The headphones started turning off, would restart, but only last a minute before turning off again.  I'll be searching for a better better quality product this time."
0,The Bluetooth link keeps dropping in and out very frustrating
0,"Worked great while it held a charge. Good sound quality. Fit well on my ears. However, it stopped charging in a little over 9 months. I expected them to last at least a couple years."
1,"Pros:  Sound quality, battery life, Bluetooth ease of pairing<br />Cons: Silicon hooks can't hold up to running<br /><br />I really like the sound that these headphones produce, but only when I'm relatively stationary.  When I run or work out at the gym, these headphones flop around and fall out (at least in my experience).  The silicon tips don't stay put and the the hooks aren't rigid enough to hold things in place.<br /><br />Battery life is pretty awesome and pairing was super easy."
0,"When they worked, they were a good product. I bought them 1/28/19 and by yesterday, less than 3 months later, not working at all."
1,I can hear wind blowing
1,Loved it until about month ago when it just died.  Never used it under water.  Just crapped out.  So I figure it's good for 5 months of once/twice weekly use.
1,"They are good and battery lasts long. They stay on during all my workouts on all different body weight exercises and machines w/ different positions, so that is nice.<br />They don't get as loud as I'd like them to get.<br />Sometimes the bluetooth would not reconnect to my phone (issue started at 7 months ownership).<br />At 10 months ownership, the plastic casing fell apart on the right earbud where the power/vol controls are, and tiny pieces fell out and all the king's horses and all the king's men couldn't put SENSO together again."
1,Way too much wind noise.  I have tried all ear cups to no avail. What do you suggest?
1,"I would expect to pay MUCH more for wireless headphones of this quality. They are comfortable, easy to use, and come with lots of accessories."
1,"I’ve had these for a few weeks now and while the sound is good, I have bluetooth connection issues.<br />The sound is balanced and can get fairly loud, there is no excessive bass, so if Rap/Hiphop is your thing then I wouldnt get these. It plays rock and alternative as well as audiobooks really well though.<br />The battery life I’ve clocked at around 6.5 hours  with the volume at 50%. The fit is secure and comfortable for me while at the gym and on my bicycle.<br />The Bluetooth connection. When I first got the headphones I noticed that randomly I would hear the sound pop in and out like it loses signal for a second or so. After weeks of testing I can make it happen pretty reliably by…<br />1) approaching my car (2006 Lexus with no Bluetooth but with keyless entry) with the phone in my pocket.<br />2) covering the right ear bud assy with my hand while wearing it. I found this while I was try to figure out the volume buttons.<br />There are random times it happens too while out and about on my bike, Its slighting annoying. It happens on my iPhone 6 and my friends galaxy s7. I have another cheap insignia headphone that this does not happen with.<br />Ultimately I’m keeping them cause they are comfortable and water resistant"
1,Love it so far great headphones for a work out and it comes with a  charger. It's really lightweight and has great quality sound.
1,good sound at great price.
1,Sound is very good.  Solid value for the cost.  Everything arrived on time and the extras are very nice.  One thing that woudl add to this would be the ability to use the cord to charge from the Lightning port of iphone so that long conversations don't deplete the battery at desk for instance - the cord provided is for either iphone charging or head phone charging from standard  USB A and not the other direction which would be Lightning to MicroUSB.
1,Excellent sound quality. These headphones have better bass notes than I thought possible with small ear buds. I have tried them with an LG V10 and a Samsung 4k smart tv (just out of curiosity). No issues with either. I am going to buy a second pair for my wife.
1,Sounds good and stayed in place during a 90 minute cardio session.
0,very short lifespan of the product<br />they promised to replace it....never got the new one! sent in three requests too~
1,"Great quality and sound,  but my son did not like the way they felt unstable on his ear while wearing them, so we returned therm unfortunately.  Really liked the product, but uncomfortable to wear.  Great follow up by Senso!!"
1,"sound is great but the bud has a little trouble staying in ear due to over-ear loop being very loose, might as well not even have it on there.  Needs to be much stiffer and form fitting."
0,"The headphone as good sound quality and texture, however the earbuds stopped working after 2 months of routine use. In addition earbuds keep falling out during jogging."
1,"I rarely write reviews so if I’m writing this, it’s because this product delivers.<br />Let’s be realistic, if you buy this product and expect incredibly high quality performance out of it, you’re nuts - if you buy this product, and have hopes it’ll be good, you won’t be disappointed!<br />Out of the box, the product is already quite impressive. The wrap around ear pieces are “soft” to say the least, and unlike most ear pieces of similar design, conform to the shape you bend them! A big plus! The product also comes with everything described, with the quality hard case being the most impressive.<br />The next noticeable thing about this product as a whole is the voice commands it outputs when being operated - another leg up on other competitive brands.<br />The sound quality delivers base wise - however, the wholeness of the sound, more or less the treble, isn’t quite all there. THIS IS NOT A DOWNSIDE! The product delivers way beyond the price it is being charged.<br /><br />If you purchase this product, I would be suprised if one were to be disappointed in their purchase!"
1,Bought these for use with Peloton bike. Super easy and quick to connect. Sound quality is excellent. Great noise cancelling. I sweat a lot and it hasn’t caused any issues. I wear them walking the dogs and they’re great too. I end up with the wire in front of me bc sometimes it catches on my neck and then pulls but once I flipped the wire to the front it’s perfect. Would order again. Took me a few times to figure out how to wedge them into my ear canal. I usually keep them down on the bike and will charge them weekly but one week I has forgotten and got 6 hours of use in without charging. Don’t know how long charge lasts but so far so great. Quality of sound is rich and loud which is what I was looking for but there are plenty of lower levels that it sounds good at also.
1,"fit well, sound quality good."
1,Great headphones at a way cheaper price.
1,"I absolutely love them! The sound is clear and precise, and the design is nice also. Recommending to all my friends."
0,Bought these in March and they have been having pairing issues for the last three months.  Now they cut out every few seconds and then refuse to pair at all.  Wasted money.
0,"Worst sound ever. Decent battery life, but other than that, do not waste your money on this thing."
1,This was a decent pair of bluetooth headphones but it felt uncomfortable.
1,Everything is great so far. The included car adapter and lightning/mini USB cable are already coming in handy. There's a weird sound coming from the left ear piece though.
0,"Poor battery life. Sounds good, but the battery life bothers me."
1,The sound quality is just as good as my beats headphones. They stayed in perfectly for a whole marathon. Battery life is ~4 hours per charge. You don’t get a low battery warning until they’re on their last leg so I’d just recommend charging them every few days if you use them regularly. Would recommend.
0,"I'm disappointed. I was really looking forward to using these headphones during my workouts because I wanted hands free where I could place my phone in a location and walk around &#34;at least&#34; 3-4 feet away and still get the reception I need to listen to my music. But it seems like when I turn my head to the left or to the right while working out I lose reception.  If I have my phone in my hand and start walking I lose reception.  I could be sitting at  machine at the gym and the phone is on the floor, and I would lose reception.  I'm having to place the my phone inside my sports bra to be able to get the reception I need when listening to music while running on treadmill or working out.<br /><br />After reading all the reviews I was excited, and there are a lot of reviews on here.  So I'm not sure if this is a defect or if anyone else is experiencing the same thing?"
1,"Price Five stars,Sound four stars,<br />Material three stars. Functionality three stars.<br />Kind of annoying to answer the calls and use the volume on the ear. Again...... the price make you forget everything."
1,Great price great sound!<br /><br />Update 12/2018 ***  I bought these headphones twice I lost the first pair.  But I loved them so much I bought a second pair in March of 2018.  For the last two month the left side has had static feedback.  Now the left side is going out and this unfortunately disables the Bluetooth and my music starts playing out loud.  Since I primarily use these at work they are basically no good anymore.  Can someone tell me how to go about getting a replacement pair since they are still under the 1 year warranty?  I wrote Tekatron a few days ago and have not heard back as yet.<br /><br />Thanks!
1,"Nice features but not good for people with narrow ear canals.  I have very narrow ear canals, so even the smallest tip won't stay inserted in my ears.  If the tips won't stay inserted, then not only do you not get the noise-isolation feature, but you also won't get any bass.  Unlike, say, the earbuds that come with an iPhone, these have to create a seal with the ear canal in order to produce any bass."
1,"At first I was thinking of Apple's Bluetooth headphones, but I don’t like the excessive price and the delivery time, so I searched at Amazon website and after reading very good reviews I came across with this product and I decided to buy it.<br />I’m so happy with this because there a lightweight, with comfortable fit after long time of use it and plus the sound it is very good. I paired with an Ipod 64 GB easily.<br />The building quality is very good; and it came with a bunch of accessories like advertised."
1,I use this product for enjoy my tv show on iPod.
1,Love Love Love them.  Exactly what I expected
1,So far so good 😊🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟.<br />Thanks  you for your help. Everyone has been very helpful. It’s a relief that the warranty was helpful. Again thank you for being a great help.<br />Robert Newton
1,Great sound.  Great fit.  Great service. Great price.
0,"I would not buy this product again.  About 2 weeks ago, they stopped working after using for about 6 months.  Product warranty states 1 year.  I contacted them and got a canned response to troubleshoot.  I did what was asked and have attempted to reach out to them with this response and they have yet to respond back to me."
1,Got these for my wife to listen to her e-books on her kindle. She is very pleased with them!
1,These work very well for me. I like that there are ear loops to help keep them in place. Good sound. Great value.
1,Awesome sound and love the fact that it can read your text messages to you while your driving.
1,"This is only my first pair of bluetooth headphones but I love them. I have a small head and small ears but they stay on well, even when working out. I've even slept in them a few times. And the specs are correct - they change very fast and last up to (if not longer than) 8 hours."
0,It stops functioning one week later of its first use!
1,"They are comfortable and work well. The sound quality is good enough. My only complaint is that the lowest volume setting is still quite loud, which makes it difficult for me to sleep while listening to music.<br /><br />— UPDATE 05/01/18 —<br />Unfortunately, they did not last a year. It’s a shame because I really liked them for working out."
1,"Sounds fantastic! Comfortable to wear, easily connects, charges quickly! Light weight."
1,I have used this a whole month. It was okay. Sound quality is good just like the beats wireless. Feels and looks bulky in the ears. Charge only holds for almost 8-9 hours. Worst thing was pairing with my iPhone. It takes 5-10 min to pair I just have to keep trying which is very annoying thing to do when you gettin ready to workout. For the price it is okay. I ended up getting a beats wireless which I am very comfortable with now. If you want something basic to start this is a good affordable wireless pair. But there’s few cons like I mentioned earlier!
0,"The likes: Wireless, stays in ears, nice case that I never used<br />The dislikes: Died abruptly after 15 months of purchases, and warranty was for a year, had connection trouble with phone when jogging (realized I had to have phone on right arm/side of body, where the main headphone component was, instead of left), had to recharge after 5-6 hours of use, great for realizing how loud wind is when the earbuds aren't aerodynamic"
1,"These are great! I use them mostly for working out, and also when I'm working at my lab. They charge very quickly, they are very comfortable, the sound and microphone are great, and battery lasts for a while. I would definitely recommend these to everyone!"
1,"One thing to watch out for is that these are not really shaped aerodynamically - so if you run with them you will hear the air hitting it. Even if you're just walking and there is a breeze, you will hear the wind.<br /><br />That's the only issue I have with these. Everything else I like. These are sturdy, durable, long battery life, light-weight, reasonably comfortable and they never fall out of my ears. The sound quality is also great. If only they shaped these so the wind wouldn't be so loud."
1,Like. Very good sound. Good for the price
1,Descent sound quality. I was looking for a good Bluetooth set of headphones for running and these hit the spot. Stays snug on my ears without any pulling.
0,"I really liked these...until about a week ago when they just stopped charging. It’s not the cable, I’ve used several. There’s no wear and tear on them because I kept them on my nightstand to use when I didn’t want to wake my husband. I like the fit and function...and they came with a cool case, but bottom line...they don’t work anymore. Only 9 months later."
1,"The headphones are easy to use, charge quickly and have great quality.  The only reason I didn't give them a 5 is they don't go quiet enough.  I tried using them at night and the lowest noise setting was a little too loud when trying to play music to get me to sleep."
1,I think a great feature would be the ability to attach and detach the earbuds.  Great sound and fit for me.
1,"Work very well, & at their price point, they are a very good buy."
1,Great sound and great product. Very nicely packaged and simple to sync with my iPhone 7.
1,I didn't know what to expect when bought the earphones but they are fantastic so far especially for the price I was expecting less and received a very nice pair of earphones! Thanks Brian
1,Unbeatable product for the price!!!$$$
0,I takeback my previous high rating. I’ve had these for only 2 months and they quit working....Do not buy
1,"These are every bit as good (and in many ways better) than the $200 beats that I also have. I keep the beats in my locker and use the senso at home. I prefer the senso especially at its price point. After about five months of use my Senso stopped working and the company was very responsive immediately sending a new pair out. The same thing happened to my beats and I had to go to the apple store and wait in line, have them troubleshoot where they said they had to send it back to the factory to repair/replace. I highly recommend this product!"
0,Despite being advertised as IPX7 or whatever they are not waterproof.
1,"These are super nice! Great sound, great case, great product! Now, if you do have a smaller head, the headphones don't really wrap behind your ear"
1,I bought these to work out in and I love them!  They have lived up to everything the description described.  I would definitely buy them again.
1,great headphones! will buy again
1,These are very nice. They are comfortable and sweat proof as advertised.
0,"If I could give this product zero stars, I would do that.  I ordered this and it skipped.  I returned it and the second pair was even worse.  Horrible, horrible, horrible!  Total garbage-don't waste your time on these!"
1,"Love the high quality sound, as well as how loud they can go. Also, the use and distance is great. Great product!"
1,I really like these headphones. They are comfortable and very easy to pair wifh my devices. The sound is quite good.
1,Beautiful I love them
1,"Lightweight, great sound, great Bluetooth connection with my Samsung G7. This whole-package deal with all the extras is a great value, and customer service is personal and caring."
1,Amazing product and great price
1,Shipped fast and work perfectly. Couldn't be happier.
1,Tried a couple of other expensive brands but they couldnt match the bass or the volume of these.
1,I am really pleased with these airbuds. They allow me to use my hands while driving and doing house chores. The only thing I had an issue with was they didn't come with the free car charger and the long charging  cord.
1,First impressions are very positive. Great sound for the price!!
1,"I've had these headsets for a couple of days.  I bought them to replace some wired ones that no one could hear me on.  So far so good.  I'm happy with the fit/finish of the product and the functionality is pretty easy.  For what this comes with, the value is really there.  They toss in a lot of extras, charger for the car, cables (short and long) and different sized ear pieces."
1,"Muy buen producto, bastante ligero y comodo, y con una buena autonomia de bateria, el sonido es bastante bueno, recomendado"
1,Good
1,Got these for my husband. He seems to like them. No bad news from him is good news. :)
1,I like the ease of wearing them and the quality of the product for the price
1,Great look  great sound
1,Work really well and what was included was above and beyond what was needed! Great price for great value!
1,Love how easy they are to connect. Sound is great
1,"Only the squishy foam ear pieces don't fall out of my ears.  However, they are decent headphones for the price.  I must have my phone in my right back pocket or they skip.  And don't even think about bending over or turning your head away from your phone.  I managed to kind of fix that problem by clearing the cache on my Bluetooth settings on my phone, but I have to do it literally every single time I turn these things on.  The price can't be beat, though."
1,It linked so easily I thought I must have done something wrong.
1,"Bought these for my wife.  She LOVES them.  Very easy to use and very lightweight and stay in place. She's happy, I'm happy!"
1,So far so great!<br /><br />Rating is based on price to value ratio (kinda snobby as audio engineer in the past). These more than meet my portable listen needs.<br /><br />Bass is impressive and connection distance seems good so far. Haven't really tested max battery life but several 4+ hr uses and no problem.<br /><br />Buds are comfortable and nice options.<br /><br />Especially like the little nub that helps guide your finger to the volume up control. Nice touch (no pun intended).<br /><br />Generous accessories and the multi plug flat cable with end covers is super cool.<br /><br />Great value.
1,"Paired my Senso to my pc to play a game today and the results were amazing. Great sound quality, stereo effect, good bass and treble, earbuds fit perfectly. Lots to be happy about."
1,Easy set up.  Excellent sound quality!
1,I am enjoying my buds for a change.
0,I bought the headphones brand new and the first time I used them after full charge the left side does a nonstop buzzing sound due to static! This are very low quality headphones and I am very disappointed!
1,"These are great for audio, the mic on them is very bad but for the price they are great"
1,They fit great and the sound is perfect. I never listened to music when I ran because I hated the headphone cord getting twisted all the time. This is the perfect solution. I highly recommend.
1,"They aren’t the best, by by far not the worst. There are a lot of little things that make these not a great set of headphones. One being the connecting. On mine, if there is already something like music or a movie playing on my phone and then I truth these on, they won’t connect. I have to shut the media app completely off, connect and then they will play. The range is pretty darn good though. I can easily walk 60-80 feet away before they start crackling. This means I don’t have to have my phone near me at the gym."
1,Amazing sound quality. Fast delivery exactly as described.
1,GOOD FIT &GOOD SOUND!
1,The ones I sent back work great. I haven't tried the other two I ordered yet.
1,I bought these for my husband as a bday gift so far so good. They stay on his ears as he runs and he likes the way they feel. He says the sound is good and he sweats a lot and it hasn't interfered with these at all. He also said he likes the volume control right on the ear. Hope this helps.
1,"These headphones are solid! When I say that I mean in many ways. I actually bough them to go inside my motorcycle helmet while riding but they a bit bit to fit in the helmet. I was a little disappointed with that but I audit even listened to them yet. So I charged them and linked them with my phone and BOOM! I was blown away by their sound!!! And the fit is amazing!! There was no way I was sending these back!! They're really, really, really solid and now I use them to work out or do.many other things that used to annoy me with attached headphones! These headphones are top quality! As I said solid all the way around!"
1,"Comfortable, light weight, great sound. Although they are not noise cancelling, they do block quite a bit of noise. So far, the battery is lasting plenty of hours. Very happy with the purchase."
0,"Product should be hassle-free. While the setup is easy, (you set it up like any other bluetooth device), there are many downsides and reasons why I regret my purchase:<br /><br />1. The sound works clearly maybe 50% of the time. I am using an iPhone 6, so bluetooth capability on my device is not an issue. It cuts in and out constantly.<br />2. Battery life: lasts a few hours, which means I am charging it everyday.<br />3. Volume control: The lowest volume setting is way too loud, especially considering the earbuds are directly in your ear.<br />4. Price: They advertise that it was originally $160: no it wasn't. It has never sold for more than $60.<br /><br />Recommendation:<br /><br />Buy a name brand headphone and spend a little more to have a stress-free experience."
1,Excellent battery life
0,"Wouldn't power on. Wouldn't charge. Nothing. Very disappointing. They sounded and worked great prior to that and I really enjoyed them, but they didn't last long. I would not recommend these earbuds."
0,Terrible product. The right earbud was about 5 times quieter than the left one. I'm returning this.
1,Great headphones
1,I just bought the head phones for my workouts and they are doing a great job as of the 3 times I used them so far. The only issue I’ve had is with phones is mild discomfort sometimes and when a song with good base comes on I have to lower the volume a little bit. But all in all not a bad pair of head phones.
1,"I bought these for myself, but my son liked how they looked and thought they looked better than the headphones I had bought him for Christmas, so these now belong to him.  He had told me that they stay on really well while he exercises and he cannot get over the sound quality.  So, they seem to be really good and now I'm going to have to buy myself another pair. I may just go ahead and buy one for my other son and my husband to decrease my chances of losing the next pair too."
0,Haven't had these long at ALL.  Already not working properly.  I can hear others and music just fine...but they cannot hear me.
1,Amazing headphones at a great price.  I would absolutely buy these again.
1,Love them brought some lg head sets from Walmart for 60 bucks waist of money never again senso headphones are awesome at a great price
0,"worthless not worth the money for the purpose of blue tooth. had them for 2 weeks for the purpose of working out, but distance for blue tooth on cell phone was just a few feet. maybe 10 feet. has lots of frequency interference based connection at times and doesn't stay on. a lot better products available in comparison."
1,"great headphones, but mic picks up way too much background noise (people tell me it sounds like a speaker-phone conversation)"
1,Good product for the price.
1,Great headphone especially when running they stay in ears perfectly.
1,Great fit for my husband and great sound.
0,I have used these maybe 15 times total and the right ear is already cutting out and not working properly. While I'm running the cord bounces some and it cuts out in the right ear every time the cord moves. I had pair of corded running headphones that were $7-$8 and they lasted me hundreds and hundreds of miles. (about 3 years) I was expecting more out of these headphones.
1,"Great headphones for the price!.  Quick pairing, easy volume adjustment."
1,Good set of affordable headphones
1,"I bought these to replace my Bose (heavier & much more expensive) headphones. Pleasantly surprised the sound was comparable to Bose, especially since I paid a fraction of the cost. Customer support was awesome. I would give it higher than 5 stars!"
1,Works awesome.  One thing I realized is that the Noise Cancellation feature is not for the sound quality but for the voice quality when using the built in mic for phone calls.  But still awesome.
1,"Sound quality is good, my first pair failed after a week, however, customer service was top notch and replaced them within a couple of days, so far so good!"
1,"These headphones are great!  Lightweight and comfortable, they fit snugly and have good sound quality.  I generally struggle with earbuds not fitting or staying in, but I have not had that issue with these and I imagine its because of the various size ear pieces they include so it isn't a one size fits all solution!  The noise cancelling feature works great as well, I sit in an open office with a great deal of background noise and when I am wearing these I do not hear any of it!"
1,Headphones arrived on time.  Only took 5 minutes to fully charge.  Adjustable sizing makes for a perfect fit.  Great sound.
1,They work great! I use them at the gym. The connection goes a long distance. The controls are easy to learn. Great buy!
1,"Nothing but kind words for this product and customer service. I use these headphones as gym buds which are great. They are lightweight, quite durable and come with numerous bud attachments suited to fit all ear sizes and comfort preferences.<br />Sound quality and noise cancellation are great for an often noisy gym I always feel like I’m working out in my own world.<br />Customer service was amazing as well, they sent me a replacement after about 6 months of use due to their 1 year warranty on damages/defects.<br /><br />I would surely purchase these again."
0,"I loved these in the beginning. I have purchased two pairs now both have quit after about three months. They will not charge, they will not turn on... they just quit. Not sure what the deal is but they would be absolutely perfect otherwise in terms of comfort, sound quality, bluetooth range, and convenience."
0,sadly this product broke completely while I was on vacation and could not return it within the allowable &#34;return time frame&#34;. The botton on the ear piece that controls on/off simply stopped functioning. Super disappointing. Not much more to say. All the positives are negated by the remarkably poor quality.
1,me encanta buen sonido
1,"Not an 8 hr battery, usually last about 4-5 hrs., sound quality regular, bulky earpiece is uncomfortable after 20 minutes of use"
0,"I expected these to be amazing because of the high reviews on Amazon, but they're nothing special..in my opinion. I've been using them for about a week while at the gym and at work. The fit isn't very comfortable, especially in the gym. I end up having to adjust my plugs during my workouts, which gets annoying.<br />3-stars for nice accessories and good sound in quiet environments (work, home, etc.).<br /><br />*update* dropped to 2-stars because the poor frequency. I literally walked down my hallway from the kitchen and the ear buds started to lose reception. I'm surprised and confused as to why these received such high reviews."
1,"Great headphones, sound quality was great, fit was great...most importantly the customer service was excellant!! 6 stars"
1,"I'm only on my second pair of these because I accidentally crushed the first after taking them off post a 25-mile bike ride, by stepping on them. What follows is my first, and still relevant review: Can't believe the price I paid for these. Hands down the best sweatproof Bluetooth headphones I've ever owned or heard."
1,Small box packed with everything needed for Bluetooth headphones
1,For the price point it’s a spectacular deal and product. Got them today. Worn them a few hours straight out of the box and didn’t have to charge. Sound is decent but remember the price point. I’m satisfied
1,The headset appears to work fine so far. I have not tried them driving to see how the noise canceling feature works. That is the  main reason I purchased them is for taking phone calls while driving. In a phone conversation with no background noise so far the other party can hear me clearly.
1,"I love these headphones! I'm an elderly lady, and these were easy to set up. I found the perfect fit. No more wires catching on stuff😁"
1,"I love these earphone!  They work great, are comfortable in the ear and on top of that they are waterproof!"
1,"The sound quality and batter life was good, but they fell out of my ears constantly. really distracting."
0,"Worked great at first, but stopped working altogether after about 6 weeks of use"
1,So far so good! I love the ability to listen to audiobooks now without having to carry my phone along.
1,Cheap but good quality ear buds easy to connect to Bluetooth very happy thanks
1,Went by the review's and I'm more than satisfied with my purchase. Got bang for my buck with these one. Thank you Amazon and thank you Senso
0,"Good sound, but cheap material. These stopped working after about 8 months of gym wear (gym sessions consisting of cardio: bike/elliptical, lifting, and 30 min. sauna 2-3 times a week for 3 hours)."
0,"Really not happy with these. Ear loops are dangly and not snug - cannot change them. Sound quality is alright. Choppy playback is a very common problem. Requires resets to start working again. Battery life is decent. Once your battery is low, it cuts out your music or call to give you a spoken warning every 90 seconds or so. Within 5-10 minutes, they shut off. So you don't get much time before low battery means no battery.<br /><br />edit: after a few months of having them, I still feel it's not worth it. would rather have something with wires"
1,very handy and good sound quality. Helps a lot during workout sessions.
1,"I love these headphones. I have three pair of them. I ordered the third pair wanting one like the first pair (unbendable earpiece) but got the bending kind instead. I get that it is because they are the newer ones, but I liked the other ones better. Either way you cant go wrong with these. That is just my own personal preference. The sound is great and battery life is outstanding!! Great value for these earphones!"
1,these were exactly what I wanted and they work perfectly
1,Excellent headphones for the money.  The earbuds fit perfectly and are not irritating to my ear.  These headphones are very lightweight and the Bluetooth feature works perfectly with my Android phone.  I would highly recommend this product.
1,"Love these!  Fit great and easy to use, pairing was quick and easy."
1,These wireless earbuds with the “loop” around the ears make sure they don’t fall out during a workout!
0,Just quit working after about two months.
1,Sometimes even with the phone a foot away it cuts out. Other than that I would have given it 5 stars
1,The earbuds sound great. my problem is that I purchased them to listen to my FM MP3 player.<br />When listening to FM the head set is the antenna. With Blue Tooth I have to use a 1/8 jumper to act as the antenna (not exactly convenient).<br />  The problem is not with your product but with the FM MP3 player.
1,"""I live in an apartment and use my headphones everyday so I can enjoy music and youtube documentaries in full, clear, and beautiful sound! Thank You! Victoria"""
1,Sound isn't all that great - but it's only $30. No complaints but no raves either.
1,"At first, the sound felt a little off but I got used to them.Had them for a couple of months now and they work and look great."
1,I was looking for wireless headphones to use on the bus and while mowing my lawn.  These have excellent sound quality and battery life.  They are well worth the money.
1,"Worth every penny. Go ahead and buy, really great sounding, handy, wear it to gym.<br />I am really happy with the purchase."
0,"Worked first time, now it won't charge properly at all."
1,I absolutely love these bluetooth headphones! I have smaller ears and these are the first ones the actually stay in place with running and working out! I highly recommend them!
1,"I was looking for a set of wireless (i.e., bluetooth) headphones to wear on my walks because I kept swinging my arm into the cord leading from my pocket to the wired headphones.<br /><br />After much research and reading, I decided to give these a try and they are great in nearly every way, falling just short of a 5-star review for points I'll hit at the end. First the good stuff.<br /><br />These puppies are smartly formed, cleanly designed and are easy to use and hook up. Like any bluetooth device, I simply clicked on the multi-function button, put it near my iPhone, selected the choice in bluetooth discovery and I was on the air. 10 seconds, start to finish.<br /><br />Sound quality is exceptional, better than my wired headphones actually. That's helpful, because I walk in high density traffic areas (and schools) so ambient noise is loud and continuous. But I also like the fact that I can hear the world around me, so I don't, oh, let's say, walk into a truck (or bicyclist), so it's good that the headphones don't wipe everything out.<br /><br />Signal strength seems fine, too. I keep my iPhone in my shorts pocket and the headphones have no trouble picking up the signal nor operating the controls (volume, track. play/pause). I have not experienced a dropped signal yet.<br /><br />I've primarily used over-the-ear headphones in the past, because (1) I have smaller ears and (2) I don't like things sticking inside them. I was a little nervous at first that I couldn't use these as straight over-the-ear headphones, but the included smaller buds are reasonably comfortable (we'll see how they fare for the full 10 miles).<br /><br />Operation is easy and fluid, with forward and back track simple and direct. Volume controls are similarly straightforward and, as with most headphones, are located on the right earphone.<br /><br />The cord is more than long enough for my average frame and I suspect it would manage beefier people as well.<br /><br />There are a couple of cautions that force me to drop the rating from a full five stars:<br /><br />1) I have an iPhone and. as yet, have not discovered a way to talk to Siri with these headphones. In all my wired sets, simply holding the multi-function button for 2 seconds triggers Siri, but in these headphones, that is the &#34;off&#34; button and the headphones shut down. I've posted a question here to see if anyone has managed the feat, since Siri is useful for switching apps, checking the time and other valuable hands-free functions.<br /><br />2) While the quality of the sound is great (and really, who gets true audiophile sound out on busy streets?), the volume through these headsets is amped up pretty high. When I checked my iPhone volume settings after manipulating them through the headphones, it was down to about 25% of full. While that's great for listening through the headphones, it's a little annoying if you don't remember to reset your iPhone volume after you're done (otherwise you better listen really hard for your ringtones).<br /><br />I am quite pleased with the ease of use and performance of these headphones. With a couple of more convenience features, I would happily give this a full five-star rating. In fact, if Siri is not that important to you (or you're not an iPhone user), then consider this a 5-star vote!"
1,"Great product especially for the price. I am a fan.<br />You may want to use a clip to attach the cord to your clothes so if one earbud is not in your ear it will not pull on the other earbud that is in your other ear. It is an easily solved issue. Maybe it is just me.<br />surprising power, clarity and function.  5 star for sure."
1,"So far I really like them. Comfortable, good sound and easy to use"
1,They are very comfortable and provide good sound. I would recommend them to my family and friends.
0,"Have owned the Senso ActivBuds S-250 wireless bluetooth headphones for over one month, and having a lot of issues with them even after a reset.<br /><br />They won't connect to my devices, I sometimes have to turn them on and off up to 15 times for them to connect.<br />When they connect, the audio is not redirected to them.<br />When the audio is redirected through them, the audio sounds garbled like it was recorded over 100 year ago with crackling and distortions."
0,"Do not buy! These headphones died on my THREE separate times within the year. Yes, I took care of them, never overcharging them to burn out the battery. Three times they just stopped turning on after a few months. The company refused to refund, only offering a laughable 5% discount on future products. I will never buy from them again."
1,Really good value for the price
0,"I have only 6 months with these hearing aids and it already has faults in the left earphone, the basses are very loud and the calls are not clear at all, I need a response from the manufacturers for the year of warranty, that they replace the product or me Receive the damaged headphones."
0,"Suppose to be 8 hours, bought mine maybe 6 mos ago and might go 2.5 hours that's it.<br /><br />Why lie?<br /><br />Why not just tell us how long it actually will last. It is a waste of my precious time performing more critical situations."
1,Nice sound quality. I sometimes have trouble syncing them with my iPhone 6.
1,"Wish I could give these a better rating but no can do. Sound gets cut off randomly when riding my bike or sometimes even when walking. I've owned them for about 4 months now. They worked well at first but over the past month the sound has been getting worse especially in the left earpiece, as it has progressively gotten quieter leading me to have to play my music louder. To cap things off, the left earpiece has now completely gone bad to the point where I could barely hear any sound coming out of it if any at all. Tried resetting but didn't help. Having owned multiple different bluetooth earbuds like this, these have so far had one of the shortest lifetimes, in terms of how long I've owned and used them for, before they stopped working properly."
1,It works very well after charging it fully.I am totally satisfied with it and will recommend it to my friends. Good device !
0,"Exactly a month and a day after receiving these headphones, they broke."
1,My husband bought these for running a few months ago and he runs long distances like 10-15 miles in one run and he loves these. He says he never has a problem with them staying on and they are comfortable
1,Great sound and easy to set up.  They fit my ears too with one of the smaller inserts.  Even when I run they don't fall out.
1,I purchased these for my husband but occasionally I use them. I like that I can wear them and I don't have to worry about losing them while working out.
1,The headphones are greatt
1,Great budget headphones
1,"Love these! These are my third pair. I use these 5 days week and take a shower with them on afterwards. They have improved the quality and the addition of adjustable “ear straps” is nice since my first pair. Their customer service is ASTOUNDING! After 3 months, my first pair went bad and they immediately replaced them without me asking. They just read my review. That second pair lasted for over a year. You may think, “only a Year?!” But I wear them 4-5 times a week for an two hours in sun, rain and snow. I only wear one bud while biking so the other dangles under my shirt so it is bound to break from the extra pull. My third pair suddenly stopped working and I emailed them about the issue. Within a day they answered back with a diagnosis and fix. Perfect! My only problem it sometimes can skip once in a while while I shower. I wonder if it is something to do with moisture sneaking in. I mean, really they weren’t built to take a shower with."
1,Really good for the price - deeply discounted to their actual value - but I ended up losing these headphones. Bluetooth headphones are incredibly easy to misplace.
1,I really liked these at first but they stopped working well after a few months of use.
1,"So far they are great! They quickly connected to my phone and the sound quality if surprisingly good.  They stay on my head well so far, although I haven't done a workout with them yet, although they feel like they'll stay on fine. Hopefully they last and don't fall apart but for an approx $35 price I highly recommend."
1,"They work great , just disappointed you can't make a call like my LG tone pros  you can receive a call, just can't make one unless you dial it first on your phone , otherwise great . Well worth the money."
1,The ear buds are great!  It was really easy to setup Bluetooth with my phone.
0,"As soon as you take these outside, they get interference from something and start breaking up constantly.  Totally unusable outside.  I have had the same experience with other inexpensive bluetooth headphones."
1,These are by far the best headphones I've ever bought. They work perfectly through bluetooth and they cancel out sound very well.
1,"I received my ActivBuds yesterday.  I am VERY VERY HAPPY!  Sound quality<br />is exceptional.  I had a little challenge pairing my headphones to my smart TV<br />but after that.... I was extremely PLEASED!!!<br />Love that you gave me a car charger and an extra USB charging cord with 2<br />types of connections.<br />I consider those &#34;extras&#34; a STEP ABOVE THE REST.  By the way, I do own<br />a pair of Beats, you guys kick them out of the ball park!<br />Also, your method of turning the headset ON/OFF is 10 times better than Beats.<br /><br />Also, your method of turning the headset ON/OFF is 10 times better than Beats."
0,"Mine is not that good as described in the overview of the product.<br />The bluetooth signal is easy to lost and then immediately reconnects in 1 seconds even though my ipad is only 20 cm away.<br />The jacket(power plug) is also lose and 80% times I will find it open, which makes it easy to be corrupted by sweat when I am doing exercises."
0,I bought these in black and it lasted almost 6 months before the left side gave out. I ordered then in red December and already I've had to change it. It  wouldn't stay connected. It wouldn't hold a charge. Its ridiculous. That was certainly my last purchase from senso. And to think it was so great I ordered a bunch and gave it out as Christmas gifts.
1,The hooks are way bigger tham my ears
1,I have a pair I bought a month ago and bought 2 more for my wife and granddaughter have not picked up the new set yet but mine has worked well for me I use it when I mow and work around the house.
1,This is my second set of these headphones. I had the first set for six months and they held up well to daily use. Unfortunately they disappeared when I left them overnight at work. They do everything advertised. The only slight fault I found with the first set was the wire for the ear hook seemed a little soft. This newer set seems better in that regard.<br />Really good value for the price.
1,My first experience with this product. I am very impressed with the quality and the price. But even beyond that I'm extremely impressed with the customer service emails asking about my overall satisfaction. I will definitely buy from this company again.
1,"Great product.  I have spent much more money on headphones, but find these easy to use, durable, and good sound quality."
1,Quality product for the price. So far it's been working great without any problem. I only have it for a week so can't comment on longevity of the device. I would reccomed this product to others based how well it's performing so far. I would definitely buy from this seller again.
1,These are great. They feel high quality and the sound really can't be beat for the price. I also had a question once they arrived and customer service got back to me within an hour.
1,"I was totally amazed at the sound quality and level these ear phones provide. I have had The Monster Tour, Jabra Coach and others and the Senso is far better! Totally thrilled with my purchase!"
1,Working excellent. Delivered on time nice product
0,"I liked my last set of headphones of this style,  but I hate these. Even with the biggest size of them, they fall out and off of my ears. The connection is wonky and I have had issues where I couldn’t pair them, but also it was on and refusing to let me restart them. They also travel way too far down the ear and are very uncomfortable. I’m so sad these didn’t work out."
0,low quality
1,"The in-ear headphones have never worked me for but these have been wonderful! Not only do they fit, they stay in place. I use them while I work out and run and for the price, you simply can't beat them."
1,"Easy to connect, very nice range of sound which helps when external noises are excessive. I'm happy with this purchase. Came with a nice travel case which helps when I pack them in my luggage."
0,now its not charging anymore i tried everything.<br />it was great product for<br />few months tho<br />. so wt should i do since its not charging anymore ?
1,Got 3 of these for adult kids and they love them!  They said the sound is very good and the quality too!
1,"I've been testing out the bluetooth headphones I ordered in the past few days, and I like them so far. My only problem with them is I wish they were adjustable as I have small ears. But other than that, they are pretty great! The item arrived just as described, and delivery was quick too. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase!"
0,Flaky connection. Interrupts all the time.
1,Headphones arrived on time and were exactly as described.  The kit comes with a both a short and long charging cable and are compatible with both mini-USB and Apple connections. Setup was easy and the headphones were easy to connect to my cell phone via the bluetooth connection.  The phones are a snug and comfortable fit and the sound is incredible. The kit comes with three different size earbuds to ensure a snug fit.  I've used this headphones while running and working out at the gym and I'm very pleased with their performance thus far.
1,Excellent sound quality and durability.
1,Nothing special. On par with similar offerings in the price range. Others can be bought for $5 or more cheaper.
1,These are the best headphones I’ve bought in terms of price for quality. On my 3rd set and will buy again if I lose these or they break (first set lasted about a year after daily HEAVY use). No complaints.
1,"I've been a fan of the older version of this product for a few years.  I think my first pair lasted more than 24 months of regular gym-going a few days a week.  They were an amazing fit, and once I found the right cushion for my ears, never fell out during vigorous use.  I did have issues keeping two devices paired.  The voice that came on for connected/disconnected can be problematic if you range out of the second device.  It was annoying.  But I also noticed intermittent, momentary sound interruption on my listening device when it was paired to both.  So I only use them on one device.<br />The left side of my old pair eventually failed (an honorable demise), so I replaced them with this new unit. In this version, I've had the same intermittent sound issues when pairing two devices.  The connected/disconnected voice is still present, but... okay.  I had some very big issues getting them to stay in my ears as well.  But I later discovered that the over-ear armatures have a wire in them, and between that adjustment and some wear I've made the fit tolerable.  There is a bigger issue though in this new pair I have.  These devices periodically loose Bluetooth connection to my tablet: usually at 5-10 minutes of listening, and then about every 20 minutes thereafter.  I do not have the same issue with my other Bluetooth headphones and the same listening device (an iPad).<br />The negatives now outweigh the advantages of this product, and I am likely to look for a different make in my next purchase.  I appreciate the price point of this device, and my experience with the older version was fairly good.  But I find this new version far more irritating."
1,Great bass!  Great quality!
0,Cut out constantly would not recommended just buy LG tones
1,"Wow, I have been very impressed with these headphones. They are my third pair of Bluetooth headphones I have owned, and they rate at the top. Everything has been great about them from the very quick shipping to the packaging and all of accessories you get with them. They are very well built, and the quality of them for the price exceeded my expectations.  The clarity of them is incredible for the cost. They appear to be very durable and I feel confident they well last a long time. They paired up the quickest of my three Bluetooth headsets."
1,They work great
1,Great headphones. 3rd time buying these last pair lasted a long time. Worth every cent.
1,I love these headphones!! Used for the first time yesterday to mow grass and they're amazing. Background noise  virtually disappeared and bass was great!!! Will definitely recommend to my friends !!!
1,Very Best  :)
1,"My second pair in 6 months. I use them a lot outside in the heat. I sweat a lot. For the price even if they only last 6 months, it's well worth it!"
1,These are awesome now I can workout jamming out at the gym
1,Quality was surprisingly good
1,"EXCELLENT PRODUCT! I've never found ear buds that would not fall out, so I tried the SENSO set. Finally I can wear a Bluetooth headset that is comfortable and stays in place. It's unobtrusive and the sound is incredible. I would recommend this product to anyone."
1,"These earbuds are well worth the money, I have had them for over a year and they still work great. I run almost every day and the constant use and sweat doesn't seem to affect it's battery life which lasts me about a week per charge. The over ear things that keep them on are easily bent to fit my ear shape and hold the position very well. Bluetooth connection is easy and fast too. Only problem is that when you press the pause button twice quickly it redials the last person you called unlike any other earbuds/headphones I have used where this action skips the song you are listening to. Other than calling people randomly during my runs every now and then these are a great purchase and are definitely worth the money.<br /><br /> P.S. Im not sponsored by SENSO in any way, but a free pair would be awesome :)"
0,"These are garbage wireless headphones, but I guess you get what you pay for. The cap for the charging plug broke off far too quickly. It never connects to my phone on its own so I always have to go to settings. Sometimes if I am trying to turn off the headphones by holding the button, it will instead decide to redial the last person you called. Lastly, now it’s starting to become staticky if I move my head to any position but looking directly at the screen. Don’t waste your time with these headphones."
1,"The see are robust ear buds that settle into your ear comfortably but firmly. They push a rich, mellow bass that is surprisingly good for ear buds this size. Treble seems a bit muffled, but I think that is a result of how I am inserting them into my ears. The ear buds fit snugly and with the over-ear loop they will not pop out<br /><br />Operation of the headphones is mostly centered around a red multifunction button so it is easy to learn what enables Bluetooth to make the buds discoverable, to turn them off and on, to accept phone calls, and to hang up.<br /><br />The higher treble tones aren't as crisp right now as I hope they would be, but I am thinking that it also maybe a fault of the app Imuse and not of these buds. Because of that, they can sound somewhat muffled on various frequency ranges. That said, I am still discovering how to wear these, and it may be how I am wearing them that is causing the problem.<br /><br />Battery charging is short at one to two hours to go to a full charge. Some of my older ear buds took much longer to charge and didn't proved anywhere near the battery life these provide."
1,These headlines are the best! Don't bother getting a pair of beats wireless ear buds. Ive tried both and couldn't tell the difference between them. Invotek is a great company and really give you your money's worth with this product. Would highly recommend!
1,"So far they are fine.  I charged and connected them to my cell phone with no issue.  They also seam the be secure and comfortable, though i have just worn them on one walk."
1,These headphones work great. They feel like a quality product when I hold them in my hands. The audio sounds great.
1,These things are great very impressed
0,I am very careful with my electronics. I only use them in gym 3 days week. They died July 2. 2018. Purchased these in March 2018.  Dead as a door nail no way contact them.
1,"These are awesome, work very well and would buy again."
1,nice set just they dont last too long as far as the batteries go.
1,"Great sound, great product for the money and very comfortable."
1,"good device, i recommend it."
0,Lightweight great for exercising !
1,These came exactly as described and are perfect for the price point.  The volume/overall sound I get from these is amazing and I have yet to turn them up to even the halfway point.
1,Like earbuds slot difficult to pair with my Moto phone
1,"Really impressed by the quality of the sound on these earbuds. It is the best I've ever gotten from a $40 pair, wired or Bluetooth. These headphones are also very light and seem to be built well. I plan to mostly workout in them, so I'll soon see how durable and sweatproof they really are. So far so good though."
0,When I wearing them doing yard work and I lean down then the connection is lost until I stand back up.  Very frustrating.
1,Good friend comfortable headphones. Decent sound quality. Slight delay on bluetooth.
0,My only complaint is I ordered first time n never received...waited 2 weeks...ordered again n so far so good..actually recommended to friends n coworkers...<br />Updated review..after a year...I've been taken very good care of this product and I was wearing them when suddenly the left ear bud detached from the ear piece...if you plan on wearing these for under a year this product is for you...for me personally I will never purchase this product again!!!
1,"Really good, I also have the beats by Dre and these work the same as my beats."
1,"Fits well, sounds great so far!"
1,I love it
1,"These headphones are awesome!  I use them when I run, and they do not fall off.  I usually have to charge them about once a week, and I get about 5-7 hours of use before needing to charge.  I highly recommend these products because the sound is great, and they are a much cheaper alternative to other products on the market."
1,"Good sound and microphone for calls, fit is a little loose but they never fall out, I find the (hard) plastic part that goes almost in my ear to be a little large and that can be painful sometimes if I wear them for a long time but I'm finicky. Battery life is good although the low battery notification is a bit annoying.<br /><br />All of this is totally acceptable for the price, but I am very disappointed that after 1 year and 2 months of ownership they have stopped working. (I think perhaps a connection broke, because one headphone is fine and the other one fuzzed out and eventually stopped working over about 3 days.) My use was pretty normal wear and tear, I kept them in the same small pocket in my purse during my commute."
1,Great sound. Wife loves them.
1,"These earbuds have a good distance,  even through walls"
1,Very good product
1,LOVE THESE. Right out of the box. They’re amazing. Sound quality is perfect. Why are you still reading the reviews ?!?’ Just buy already. Jeeeesh.
1,"At first they were great. Love being able to talk on the phone, and the music sounds great too! However now I have more and more trouble with the connection to my iPhone 7 Plus. It’ll randomly cut out, make beep noises and randomly say “connected” very distorted in the middle of listening.<br /><br />Over the last few weeks the quality has been degrading. Hoping to reach out for a warranty replacement."
1,"I needed a pair of Bluetooth headphones for the gym. These worked out perfectly, they stay out of the way and don't interfere with my workouts. Battery life is long and they sound Great!"
1,"I love these headphones, they are great, good quality for the price, i will absolutely buy again..."
0,"These are crap, I have returned two pairs now with whining in the left ear. Steer clear of these guys."
1,"Well finally.  This is my 4th pair of bluetooth over the ear and earbud headphones for use with the treadmill, etc.  At an older age, I need a product that does NOT fall out of my ear and cause me to fall when trying to put it back in.  Most sets, even much more expensive than the Senso ActivBuds, have difficult controls for volume, telephone calls (a feature i do not sure), and advancing the playlist.  These are pretty well placed.  The different sizes of earbuds is a plus as i have discovered I needed smaller ones (do our ears shrink with age?).  They clip over the ear okay and if the bud is in tight, stay on over the ear.  The connections included with this item are also a special feature. Having it for the car will help some.  The battery life a plus  I would give it a 5 if the silicon ear hook somehow loved my ears and stayed close.  I definitely recommend this over many of the products you will see on this website."
1,Just received yesterday but they seem great. Fit well and seem like they will stay in during workout. Sound is good.
0,"I liked these headphones until the left earbud stopped working a couple months in. Occasionally the bluetooth would wig out, but in general they seemed to have a good range and I could walk around the gym with them with my phone in a cubby. Sound quality was fine and connecting was easy. Battery life seems to be around 8 or so hours. But now I'm looking elsewhere, as only one side is fully functioning, the other having dropped its volume down to almost nothing."
1,"If you are really just wanting these to listen to music while you work out, then these are excellent. I was really looking for something that would work as a Bluetooth for my phone as well. However, when you are wearing just one in your ear, the other side tends to pull the one out of your ear. People did have trouble hearing me, so I'm back on my quest."
1,"Worked OK, but died after about 4 months of use.  Wouldn't take a charge.  I struggled with the fit compared to other similar headphones."
0,"I loved them at first, but now I think I'll return them.<br /><br />They would work fine for an hour or so, but then the connectivity issues start. Every single time I use them. The phone is always within 3-4ft of the headset but the headset won't reconnect.<br /><br />This has happened essentially every time I used the headphones, so my recommendation would be:<br />If you want to use your headphones for more than an hour at a time - keep looking, don't buy these."
1,These headphones have amazing sound.  Much better than some that cost over $200!
0,I've had these for 5 months and they just died. I can't even get them to charge. I used the charger that came with them. They are great quality for sound but they need to last longer
1,These are the third pair of bluetooth wireless headphones I've owned and by far the best.
1,"Primary purpose for these is for work outs.  So far so good.  I have had some trouble fitting one ear, although I've tried all three sizes - I suspect my ear is not formed to create the same secure feel that the other one does with these very standard buds.  Fortunately, the buds are light enough that with this design, I'm not having any issue keeping it in my ear.  Have yet to try the microphone for quality in use with my phone.  Will update the review if there's an issue there."
0,Was fine for about 18 months. Then just stopped working for no reason at all.
0,I have an older set that were and still are amazing. I purchased this new pair to use when i run at work.  I have used these less than 10 times and now one side stopped playing music.  They are still sk new the cable has the original creases. I mist have gotten a bad set....
0,"Worked great for the first year, now sound quality is terrible.  Never dropped or moved from desk at work, did not get them wet, did not exercise with them, sweat on them, etc.  I don't know what happened but they're unusable due to sound quality."
1,great product for the price!
0,Issues with the product:<br />  1) Audio quality not that good<br />  2) Did not fit around the ears.  I was always tightening the wrap to keep the speakers in my ear.<br />  3) One side frequently fell out of my ear while working out.<br /><br />I am trying an alternate brand today.
1,"The Head phones are amazing. .I Love everything about them. Nice Fit...Good Looking, Beautiful Case that comes with it. .Extra accessories, Can't beat it. 😊"
1,"I love them! The sound quality is loud and clear. At first, they fell out of my ears when I was running hard but then realized that only happened when the chord was twisted. After a while of daily use, I had technical difficulties where they would shut off randomly on me. I contacted SENSO and with ease and apologizes they sent me a brand new pair. I am very happy with the product and the company :D"
1,"So far, sounds good.  Put 3 or 4 hours on them and no issues so far.  I love all the gear that came with headphones...4 different earplugs sizes, duel car charger and hard case."
1,Use them all the time
1,Applies a lot of pressure to the ear as the tension keeps the bud in place.
1,"Used it for at least two weeks now and thoroughly enjoying these headphones. Light weight and easily portable. Love the amount of accessories that came with it: car plug in, charger that's comaptibale with android and iphones, extra buds, and best of all the carrying case for the headphones. That was always the reason why I needed to buy new headphones, the ear pieces break due to lack of conventional holder. Glad I made this purchase!!! Boyfriends eyeing mine so he'll be getting one really soon"
1,"Just awesome! It's so nice that they are sweat proof too so when I am running, I don't have to worry about damaging them!"
1,"They’re too large for my ears, and cause pain when I have them in for more than 30 minutes. If I reposition them, they just fly out of my ear. I bought them in April 2017 and they stopped working now, the sound cuts in and out, and only out of one ear. They’re okay, but I’d be willing to spend a little more for better quality."
1,"So far, so good. Excellent reception and they actually stay in my ears! LOVE IT! :)"
1,"Great fit and excellent audio quality. I was initially  disappointed when the sound would breakup when linked to my Note 4 cell phone in my pocket. However, when linked to my Amazon Tablet I get a clear Bluetooth signal from 30+ feet. The issue is with my cell phone. I'm happy with this product."
1,stopped working but they send a replacement with no problem.
1,"So far, I love them. They are comfortable and loud enough to play my drums. I was tired of a cord head set, so these are working great so far.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Will Dillard"
1,Comfortable during training.
1,Easy to use and comfortable to wear.  Looks to be well-made and durable.  Unit comes with many useful accessories.  Sound is great!  I am pleased with this purchase.
1,"These are simply amazing, load and clear. worth every penny"
1,Was a gift to my wife and she is happy with her new headphones... Good product...
1,"Great headphones for the price, and they hold a charge for a very long time."
1,Buy far has exceeded my expectations unbeatable for the price point
1,These head phones work great! I got them because they were discounted for an insanely low price. I love the sound quality and the distance that the Bluetooth reaches. They are comfortable and the case they come with makes for easy storage and packing.<br /><br />There are only two minor things I would change about these headphones. First of all the wire that connects them sometimes gets stuck in weird positions behind your head. I wish they were made of that rope-like wiring so then they would lay flat on your back. Secondly some Bluetooth headphones come with magnets on the sides so that when no listening to them you can connect them around your neck like a necklace! I've always thought that was a cool function.
1,"I really love my new earbuds.  They are comfortable and the sound quality if good.  when my husband saw the outstanding packaging he said they must have cost me $100.  &#34;Not even close I told him,&#34; and showed him the cost (under $35).  I'm not great with technology and these require more than just a plain pair of earbuds.  The instructions that came with the earbuds was complete and easy to follow. A special &#34;thanks&#34; for that."
1,Great sound and good fit grat packaging
1,"I have went through several brands costing from around $40 to $140.  I have to say by far this has been my favorite!Sound quality is excellent! Using it for a phone calls, people can hear you very well.They can be a little too loud but I wouldn't call that a con."
1,"I've used these on 1 run so far and was happy with them. At first they seem to have a lot of bass, like being in a tunnel. I tend not to like as much base as most, but that just might be my quirk. By the end of the run though, I thought they sounded great. So far very happy with them."
1,I use the ear buds for running. They fit great and stay in place.
1,I love the headphones!  It's very portable and easy to pair.  It sounds great and the battery holds up really well.
1,"great headphones, great sound. I use them at the gym and they are the best I have ever bought."
1,The headphones are amazing. Great sound quality and very comfortable. I would buy again!
1,Very comfortable and easy to use.
1,"I have only had headphones for a week, but so far the sound quality for listing to music is great.  They are very comfortable and come with a nice case for storage. As a bonus, the seller provides car charger and an extra charging cord that is compatibly with both Android & Apple connection (very nice touch).  Pairing was simple and adjusting volume on ear piece was easy.  The only reason for 4 star vs 5 is if you want to use as a primary headset for making phone calls, the sound for hearing caller is excellent but I was told by the caller on other end that the voice quality when I was talking was not as clear as speaking directly into the phone and sounded like I was using a speaker phone.  For the price, the great packaging and case with bonus cord, I would definitely recommend as an excellent buy."
1,"So far, awesome!  Love it, especially at this price!"
0,"I bought mine in April, it’s now Mid August and it stopped working. I really liked it too. So pissed that it’s not working anymore."
1,Very good product
0,Starting with the positive. They fit well and are comfortable. They also have good sound including bass! The big negative for me is they don't have a range over 8-10 feet before it starts to crackle and break up. So if you're using it for something that you will have your phone on you then it's a great deal!
1,"I am very pleased with my Senso headphones. I tried them immediately upon receipt and could not have been happier. The sound was clear. I am not a big headphone person so these did the trick. In fact, I noticed little difference between Senso and the more expensive brand which I've also tried."
0,I have bought around 3-4 of these and this will be my last time. They work fine for around a month or two but then an issue always occurs whether its connectivity or the earbuds falling apart very easily. I'll be taking my money elsewhere.
1,Great product great price
1,Good sound
1,Great sound. Excellent service.
1,Setup was easy and they charged so fast! Sound is awesome and very comfortable to wear. Love my purchase!
0,"Had these for about 2 months and they just don't seem to hold a charge past 30-40min.  Have to recharge after every use.  Other than that, seem to be ok."
1,Great fit and good sound.  I travel a lot and it cancels quite a bit of the noise
1,"Great quality for the price. Bass sounds great, very loud. Battery life will easily last you through the day! 10/10 would recommend"
0,"Maybe I got a bad set, but mine had terrible sound quality. I am sending them back."
1,"They are loud, clear, and aside from coming loose from my ear during workouts (but don't fall out), they're great"
1,"This product arrived quickly and works great.  Beautiful sound, it comes with 3 different size buds."
1,"Great sound, very easy to connect and operate."
1,great sound! easy pairing and little to no dropoff or static. They fit comfortably and are great for working out!
1,Great headphones for a good price
1,"These are great earphones!  Trust the reviews, I am training for a 5K, and they work great!"
1,Great headphones!  My husband was given the expensive wireless headphones from his boys for Christmas.  They broke within 3 months.  We replaced with these and they work great
1,"I've had these earphones for a couple weeks now and am pretty happy.<br />Comfort -- I was a little concerned about the size of the earphones, that they might be heavy and uncomfortable.  They're not.  The hook that goes over the ear is soft rubber (or something) that is very comfortable and flexible.  It doesn't irritate.  The earphones come with several sizes of earbuds.  I use the ones that came on the earphones.  They rest on the entrance to my ear canal rather than inside.  I find that most comfortable while they still seal to the ear.  The earphones are not heavy; I forget that I'm wearing them.  The cable that connects the two earphones can be worn under the neck or behind the neck.  My wife says I look dorky with the cable under my neck and she is tempted to pull on it.  When I'm around her, I put it behind my neck.  I frequently listen to audio books in the evening in bed.  Just don't put your ear into the pillow; they're too big for that.<br /><br />Performance -- I'm pretty impressed with the sound.  I would say it sounds pretty natural without a lot of extra bass.  Compared to my stock iPhone iPods, I think these have better dynamic range too.  I normally listen to podcasts, books and music but nothing very loud.<br />The battery life is about what is specified.  I haven't measured it because that would be difficult since I listen for a couple hours then stop, then resume later.  The key is to turn the earphones off when not in use, don't just put the audio device on pause.<br /><br />Operation -- The earphones charge via a USB to micro-USB cable.  They charge pretty quick, maybe an hour or less.  An LED on the right earphone tells you status.  Better is the indicator on the iPhone, a picture of a headphone to tell that it is connected via Bluetooth and a vertical bar to show the charge status.  There's a pleasant voice to tell you when the battery is low; it's insistent.  The voice also confirms when you've turned the earphones on or off and when the Bluetooth is connected.  ON/OFF, pause/play are all controlled by a button on the right earphone.  The same button is also used to answer and hangup calls.  The microphone in the right earphone works OK.<br /><br />So far I'm pretty happy with these earphones, especially for the reasonable price."
1,Excellent product. No problems at the moment.
1,"I loved it while it was working. It worked well from March 6, 2018 until yesterday August 1, 2018. I don't know what it going on, but this thing stopped charging on me. I used 4 different USB charging cables and still nothing. The blue light which turns on and that lets you know that the Bluetooth is charging doesn't come on anymore. I left it charging from last night until this morning to see if by some miracle it would charge and I was greatly disappointed. So sad!!!! 3 stars and I'm being nice."
1,My wife has struggled with ear buds but these seem to be working great for her.  They were easy to set up.
1,"I loved these ear-buds. I bought a pair about a year ago and they still delivered good sound comfort and battery life (I could go my entire 2 hr work out without a hiccup). Recently, I lost them and came back to buy another pair, but I see there is a newer model. I'm really skeptical about getting into the newest model, since the old worked so good for me. Any one had try the old and new to compare?"
1,"I purchased this product last month, and it worked great. It stopped charging today, nothing works, tried different cables, kept it plugged etc. Apparently im not the only one with this issue."
1,These are a christmas present so dont have a review😂
1,"I like these headphones, they sound good, battery life is good, I would buy again, but the manufacturer needs to change to a more resilient wire between the two ear pieces. I have had the outer layer of insulation break open and expose the inner wires, now in four paces. I'm able electro-mechanically, so have installed heatshrink tubing over the cracked part, all was fine until a year or 18 months later the insulation cracked again at new positions. So I fixed that again. Good headphones but expect the outer insulation to go bad."
1,My beats headphones were stolen along with my jay birdX2 so when I ordered my headphones I wanted them to be along the same quality. I was pleasantly surprised. I read all of the awesome reviews and decided to give them a try. For the price these are incredible. I really Love them and plan to buy more to give as gifts.
1,These are awesome. I usually hate buds in my ears but these are soft comfortable and incredibly light so you forget you are wearing them. The packaging is great for travel and they paired first time with my Apple ⌚️ sound quality is great. I love them.
1,So far these have replaced my normal ear buds for when I am working in the yard or in my garage on wood projects. They are very comfortable and allow more movement without having to have my phone on my person to listen to music. Im happy with these. Thank you
0,Originally these worked fine but then after around a month of use they would no longer pair to any of my Bluetooth devices. It was particularly frustrating because it took my awhile to realize it was a device issue and not user error.
1,The look and quality of sound is good.<br />The only issue i found with this is connectivity.  It breaks a lot  which irritates me.
1,Wow!  I should have gone wireless long before now!  The sound is awesome!  Perfect for my running; stay in place very well!  Totally satisfied!  Thank you!
0,"worked for two weeks, stopped charging"
1,"Senso Bluetooth headphones are not only an excellent  product, their product support is the best I have experienced.  You can count on<br /><br />Senso support team for top notch support.  They will contact you quickly to adress and or help solve your issue.  If your teoubleshooting does not solve your issue, they will work with you on a solution.  They stand good on their warranty because they are confident in the quality product the provide at a very low and dair price.<br /><br />Beats By Dre., i will never purchase again.  They charge you losts of money, and they only care about selling more bluetooth headphones which sound great but dont last.<br /><br />Thanks Senso team!  You outperform Power Beats 3 wireless headphones in customer support , you sound just as good, including the bass, you are 4TIMES CHEAPER in price, and you actuallly care.  Thank You 😊"
1,"Maybe it's just my ears, but I can't get them to sit just right when I run. Otherwise, they're great"
0,Broke very quickly
1,"Waited until after I went on a beach trip to post this review. In short, I am hard of hearing and wanted a way to hear in the water when I could not bring my hearing aids in. Essentially, I paired the ActivBuds with my phone and routed audio from the microphone (inside the headphones) to my ears. I found the quality and clarity of the bluetooth microphone to be very good.<br /><br />I went snorkeling for one hour with these in and they are still working like new afterwards. These are rated IPX7, meaning they should be able to withstand submersion up to 1 meter for 30 minutes. I also showered with these a few times and they maintained connectivity throughout. However, I do not recommend swimming with them as connectivity in water is absolutely terrible by no fault of the headphones themselves; it's just how Bluetooth works. I constantly heard &#34;Connected... Disconnected... Connected... Disconnected...&#34; while I was snorkeling. You are better off getting something wired like Swimbuds (which I also purchased).<br /><br />The fit is comfortable and snug and the carrying pouch is super convenient. Different sized earbuds are included in the box. Battery life is great but remember to turn it off when you are not using it as it does not turn off by itself.<br /><br />Prior to buying these, I did exhaustive research on all the IPX7 bluetooth headphones out there and I feel comfortable saying that these outclass all others. It is a bit pricier than other headsets but worth the premium if you care about waterproof-ness, durability, and comfort."
1,For the price these are fantastic headphones! I am quite active and I find they stay put really well whatever I'm doing. They also can be adapted for a variety of ear sizes/shapes. The sound quality is good and the battery lasts a long time as well.<br />My only complaint is they don't have a fantastic range and can cut out if I'm more than 10 or 20 ft away from my phone.
1,"Still early but works great so far.  Got what I ordered, came on time, in good condition.  Surprised by the carrying case.  I didn't expect to get one so I ordered one - wasted 5.99 but I'm sure I can put it to use."
0,"My wife bought a pair that broke after about two weeks.  We thought it may have just been a bad pair, so she bought a second pair.  Those broke on the second day she used them.  This is not a quality product."
0,Not a good quality earphones at all. Sound cracks while listening to music with high beats. Voice is also not very clear when used for talking. Sometimes other person on line hears echo while talking on phone.  I bought after getting good feedback from a friend who is using it for months. But I didnt like it at all. May be a defective piece or I dont know - not buying again.
1,When I work out I sweat heavily and these earbuds are perfect!
1,"Purchased as a gift for my son who requested Beats.  Beats had not great reviews and were super expensive so I purchased these.  He loves them, says they sound great and is very happy.  If you can please a 17 year old you've done well!"
1,"Very happy with the sound quality, much better then my lost beats headphones which cost $199"
1,Bought these to use on my daily three mile walk.  Got tired of fighting with the connecting wire for the earbuds that came with my Samsung Galaxy S6.  Sound and fit are great.  I am happy with them and would have given them 5 stars except for one issue.  I am experiencing intermittent signal disruption . . . about a half dozen times in an hour's use.  I saw another review where Senso recommends a reset to factory settings.  I'll try that to see if it will solve the issue.
1,Ecellent Bluetooth Headphones!!!  Very good quality for the purchase price.  Charge very easily and connect very easily to your phones Bluetooth.
1,Great Product.  Charge lasts a long time.  Use them for the gym and running.  I tuck the back cord loop in my cap when I run to prevent it for moving around.
1,"So far so good. The bass is really not there but I knew to possible expect that from other reviews but didn't really care because all the other features are what sold it to me including the price. My kid has used them in a limited capacity so far but they stay on, connect pretty easy and the cost is perfect if you don't require that good base sound. My son turns on the music and puts the phone in his pocket or right next to where he is working out and so far he is pleased."
1,"Definetly worth it so far, just testing out the battery life but other then that I highly reccomend. Don't waste your money on expensive headphones and put the extra $10 in verses buying a really cheap pair!"
1,Holy crap. Best things ever. Feel like I'm in my own little world when I put these on! Such a good choice!!!
1,The headphones are a Christmas gift.  I am including your emails to me with the headphones when I present them to the recipient.  I appreciate you reaching out to be sure all is well.
0,This thing lasts for like 3 months. Ive gotten it three times. Its cheaper to just buy good bluetooth headphones than go through 4 of these per year
1,Great headphones and easy to set up! Comfortable. Quality sound. Great gift idea!!
1,"I ordered these headphone because they received good reviews on line and I needed another set of bluetooth headphones for the gym and the car.  They cam already charged and were very easy to set up with my devices.  They are comfortable and feel secure as they have a plastic extension that wraps around the ear to keep it stable.<br /><br />If you are looking for BOSE sound quality, you will be disappointed.  To be honest, not many sound as good.  if the BOSE sound was a 10 then these are about a 7.  Don't get me wrong they sound good and they are comfortable and for the money they are a good value.<br /><br />I have only had them a week so the long term review will come later."
1,Would buy again if the need ever arises
1,"I love these headphones. I use them for running when it's cold outside, my wireless ones don't work under my beanies. Sound quality is perfect for what I need it for. The main thing I'm impressed with is that I washed these with a load of clothes and they work perfectly fine, still. WOOOT!<br /><br />UPDATE 2 DEC 2020<br />I used these while running an ultra marathon and they lasted connected by bluetooth to my phone for 7.5 hours.  WIN"
1,"I like the product very much, is amazing sound."
1,Love them.. worthwhile investment!
0,"Worked perfectly for 5 months. Then, one random day they just decided to stop pairing with ANYTHING. I would stay away if you looking for a product that will actually work for longer than 5 months."
1,"I absolutely love these headphones. These are the best headphones I've owned. The sound is excellent, they are extremely comfortable, and the noise cancellation is perfect."
1,Wish it fit my ears better. It’s on the big side and I can’t fit them in my ears well. After a while it hurts to wear. The sound quality is great.
1,"not bad - they work well on the bluetooth, easy set up, great packaging and extras including in-car charger and cable to work with either iPhone 6 or 7 and also works with microUSB"
1,great
1,Great product
1,"Just tried them today and the sound is very good.  Works well with my Apple One=Touch.<br /><br />These headphones paired easily with my Apple One-Touch 6th generation IPOD. The sound quality is very good … in my opinion. This unit enables you to adjust the volume. It is tiny control switch on one of the right ear piece.<br /><br />I like the feature that when you press a red button the side of right ear piece, you will hear, &#34;Power on&#34; and press it again and you will hear, 'Power off.&#34;  The right ear piece on has an indicator light when the unit is on and will indicate when charging the battery if it is fully charged or is still charging.  I am impressed by the sound quality."
0,"I had them for just over a year. The sound quality was decent however the bluetooth signal wasn't strong. I had to wear my armband with my phone on my right arm when I ran to make sure the headphones stayed connected. Then one day I pulled them out of the case and they were busted. Pretty disappointing. They do have a one year warranty so I contacted the company hopefull they would replace them since I was only 2 weeks out of warranty. Nope, they offered me a 5% coupon. I will NOT purchase these again and would NOT recommend them. I'm sure there's another product out there that won't break after 1 year of moderate use."
1,"Very good sound, stay on good when I am jogging, very pleased with the purchase! Enjoyed the extras too, excellent value!"
0,Stopped working within a month.  Will not buy again.
1,"1/3/17 - Used today at the YMCA pool - easy set up, good range, and a surprisingly good fit in my ears (I have ears that don't fit just any old earbud, the flex and additional sizes were awesome).  Excited to continue using and hope to report further great reviews."
1,"Sounded great, charges fine and used 8 hours straight no problems, 2 months of frequent with no problems. 1 day mid use the headphones got hot and stopped working. I should've read more reviews. Id like to return or get them repaired a.s.a.p (update - customer service has contacted me personally and have already started on sending me a replacement)"
1,"I work with them around my neck all day and for the most part I keep them well protected, but they have started to disconnect from my phone randomly. That being said for jogging and other instances where you might not wear them all day, these are a pretty decent pair of headphones. Sound quality is good and they are comfortable over long periods of wear. Very good price point for what you get. The customer service is great! When the pair I bought started having issues they replaced it for me."
1,"awesome headphones, for the price."
1,"great in every aspect, great great great and great is great."
1,"I like the sound. Use when exercising. Like that I can adjust the earpiece around my ear. But, as usual, I have difficulty keeping an earbud in my ear. However, Senso fits better than any other brand."
1,"Very pleased with the fit and sound quality. I do not like in ear, ear buds.  I didn't think these were but they are. The ear clip is comfortable and the silicone tips seal out unwanted noise. As far as sound quality goes, for the price I'm more than pleased. The range is pretty impressive too !<br />They have a great product here as long as they last awhile.  The price point was impressive as well. Amazon prime had the at my door in a day, they charged quickly and off to the gym wireless...fantastic  !"
1,"I love these buds.  They stay in, stay charged, and sound great.  They pair immediately too.  Comfortable, convenient and $30 bucks.  If and when I wear them out, I will buy another."
0,Worked fine for many months but has stopped charging now.
1,Unknown at this time.  My wife is happy to recieve
1,Great product after 3 weeks of use and also great customer service.
1,The sound is great. They work perfectly and fit perfect.
1,So I went to Best Buy to buy some Powerbeats 3s. My nephew had just bought some and kept telling me I needed to buy some for the gym. We went and I tried to get a discount because Best Buy matches Amazon prices and I couldn't find the black ones that had been on sale for $150. I couldn't bring myself to pay $200+ for some earphones. I looked at Amazon the next day and came across the Senso earphones and started reading reviews and watching some YouTube videos and found some very good reviews. I ordered them and my nephew started saying they wouldn't work blah blah blah. I bet him $50 these would sound just as good as his Beats. Well I got them in and I was blown away by how good they worked. As soon as he got home we compared them to his Beats. There was a small difference in the sound of the bass. He was surprised at how good they sounded as was I. So I won $50 but told him to keep it. I figured him realizing I paid $35 for some earphones that are just as good as his $200+ earphones was good enough for me. DON'T BE MATERIALISTIC YOU DON'T NEED BEATS!!
1,"I got to say for the price they work exactly how i want them.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Price is better than the others<br />Battery Life last all day ( I have them on for majority of the day)<br />No fuss with syncing with your device, super easy peasy<br />Cons:<br />When the volume is on full blast (in the gym) the quality isnt fully there<br />I find myself fussing with the earbuds, they sometimes fall off or dont feel secure<br /><br />All in all I plan to purchase these again for my husband i really do like them."
1,"Love them for my morning walks 👍. Blocks noise and my sweat from the FL heat, I've even walked in the rain with ease. Thanks for such a innovative idea 💡 for people like myself who won't let the ☔️ keep me from being healthy!"
1,"I have now had these for 2.5 years, and last night I accidentally ran them through the washer and dryer, and this morning they still worked perfectly! The connectivity is not always perfect when I go on runs with them, but the battery life is great - I can usually exercise about 5-7 times between charges. I’m not much of a sound-quality snob, so I can’t say much for that, but they are good enough for someone like me who just wants music during exercise. I would absolutely buy them again."
0,This thing got busted after just 3 months of light usage.
1,"Finally found headphones that fit, sound good and don't irritate my sensitive ears as soon as I wear them."
1,Item received as scheduled.  These headphones were easy to pair to my device.  I actually received more in this package than expected.  The sound quality is really good and the charge last a long time.
1,"Ummm,  yeah..... so are these supposed to do something?  Just got them today.  Had them on the charger for several hours.  No visible charging light.  Tried different cords,  different charge plugs.  Nothing.  Wouldn't turn on,  does nothing.  Not a good first impression.  Am I missing something?<br /><br />UPDATED<br />Customer service was excellent.  Quickly replaced my defective headphones with new ones.  They sound great,  deep bass,  comfortable with no connection issues with Bluetooth.  I wear them working out,  no issues with sweat as of yet."
1,Just got these and so far it has lived up to the review and the advertising.  Can't wait to road test them on workouts.
1,"Love these.  Wish they were magnetic so they aren't falling off my neck. Music, phone calls and YouTube ready."
1,"Surprised about the sound on these, need a longer running battery, last about 6 hours, worth buying if you’re looking for a good not expensive headphones, worth the price"
1,Excellent sound. Easy set up.
1,"Bought them for my wife who has small ear canals and has difficulty wearing earbuds. She loves them. Great fit, great sound and stay in place during exercise. Will definitely purchase a set for myself later."
1,I love this!! They're my go to headphones. Last 3 days at least on one charge. Have actually bought these more than once since I've lost previous ones.
1,Great price point. They are very easy to set up and use. Great sound. Well worth the money.
1,great pair!
1,I LOVE my new earbuds. So far they have superceded my expectations and the price was fantastic. Recommended to a friend and she is buying a pair too!
1,"I’m a musician (a bass player).  When I got these, I started with the plastic eartips that come already on the ear buds.  The sound had WAY much bass.  It overpowered the music and I was really disappointed.  Someone said on another review to swap out the eartips with the foam ones that come with the ear buds so I gave it a try.  WOW!  Fixed the sound instantly!  I have had other earbuds that have the plastic eartips like these come with and the sound is fine.  Not sure why these plastic ones suck but TRUST ME, swap them out.  The sound quality on these with the foam tips is INCREDIBLE!  My only thought is that the plastic tips somehow muffle the sound and create more bass."
1,nothing
1,Great headphones
1,"These headphones fit my small ear canals and stay in place.  The sound quality is ok but not great, I can hear distortion in some of the higher frequencies. I do wish the parts that go over your ears were more mold able instead of only retaining one shape. One way to solve this may be for the manufacturer to put a metal rod in that can bend to your shape.<br /><br />Overall for the price point not bad."
0,Purchased this and it worked great but the bluetooth stopped working after a week. It won't sync.
1,These are great. They are lightweight and comfortable in my ears during any activity im doing. I bought these to use almost exclusively for running and have had no issues. They come with adjustible ear inserts so finding a perfect fit is only a matter of finding the right set. All in all a very good- reasonably priced- item that sound better than much pricer wired earbuds..
1,This is my first bluetooth earphones. I am using iPhone 7 and it works well with it. Bought it to use during workout and haven’t tried yet. I did not expect that they sent two types of chrging cables and one of them is convertible! I did not expect nice sound for this price and actually it is not bad.
1,"I started to have problem after 6 months when my battery lost the ability to hold a charge. Knowing I had a 1 year warranty, I contacted Invotek and they shipped a new one within 2 days. Very happy over all with the product quality & custmer service.🤓👌thank you."
0,Love the headphones. Little sad that they don't include everything they claim to. Feels like I got ripped off a little no wire tie to be found. .
1,Great product
0,"Water rating is wrong, not able to get very wet and continue. Worked for a week."
1,We got our truck broken into this past weekend and had our beats headphones stolen. Not wanting to pay again for the beats I ordered these and they sound better than the beats!! For this price! And somehow the last longer too! My boyfriend loves them and he is very picky! Really great product just hope it lasts!
0,"I have only had these for a little over two months, and they no longer work. They won't charge, and have essentially turned into a useless piece of plastic. The fit was medicore, and the sound was okay, but now no matter what I do they don't work."
1,my active duds S-250 don't go of what can I do<br />Nick G
1,"So far, great! Sound great, fit well, stay on during exercise. The charging cord works for both my iPhone and the earphones. A very good product. I've only had them for a week or so, so we'll see how durable they are, but very pleased so far.<br />Update: had them for 6 months or so and they worked great. Then I stepped on them and broke them, urrgh. Liked them so much I bought another pair (exact same)."
1,Great for the price.great reception.im going to get another set for my wife.
1,"My second pair ordered so When one dies, another is already to go!"
0,I’ve had these 6 month and they don’t hold charge any more
1,Good sound  great price good battery life  so far I like them
1,So far so good. I had the hassar Bluetooth headphones and had a lot of issues. These are great and I like the earplug style buds that came with it.
1,"You know how some electronic cords are higher quality than the cheap stuff? The better cords have a sort of rubbery, strong feeling. That's what these ear buds are like. In fact, the bands that fit around the ears are that same sort of rubbery, flexible and comfortable material. I use these buds exclusively now, my other pair, similarly styled but not as comfortable, remain an unused back-up. I bought these buds at full price from Amazon."
0,"UNLESS YOU LIKE THROWING $29 IN THE TOILET DO NOT BUY THESE<br /><br />I finally went ahead and purchased a regular plug-in headset from Amazon on 10/13/2018.<br /><br />I took a flyer on a recommendation on this site just to go ahead and buy....knew better, but thought it wouldn't be a big loss.<br /><br />Of course they broke when I was out of town, so I was stuck with no headphones<br /><br />Will not pair up with my iPhone no matter what I try.<br /><br />I don't have another 5 hours to spare to make it work.<br /><br />I'll pay more for quality next time."
1,Just really happy with the product... I recommend...
1,Great sound quality and great customer service! It was working fine for a couple of months and then it stopped charging. Contacted customer support and they sent me a new one without hassle. New one works and charges fantastically!
1,"They sound good, but I feel electricity passing to my right ear with the foamy ear buds, very uncomfortable. I don't feel the electricity any more! They are ok for the money."
1,Bought these to workout in at my boxing gym. Needed<br />Something with the ear hook. These do the trick and the sound is good as well. Good value as well.
1,"These are great. I ordered these based on the reviews and I was not disappointed. Sound great, don’t feel like they are about to fall apart in my hands, and comes with a case and the coolest charging cable for iPhone/microusb, and a car charger."
1,"I purchased these for my wife when she works out , I was pleasantly pleased once I got them charged and tested them on my device . The music was very loud and clear , a very good buy for the price !"
1,Used them first time at work and the sound quality is great. So happy I got them
1,"I wanted to wait a bit before reviewing.  I'm impressed! Super value.<br />Had my reservations when I ordered but after using them in different situations, I'm sold. GREAT sound and with enough noise isolation to mow the lawn with only music in my ears. Really remarkable for the price. Very efficient speakers with low distortion. Coupled with the ability to block out extraneous noise,  I find myself looking forward to using these on a regular basis. The instructions are clear, the buttons well placed and so far the fit has been exceptional. The ear hooks don't intrude at all and are virtually unnoticed. I have used them for lawn work and workouts and can't say enough about them. No slipping, the ear buds stay secure ensuring solid bass response without constant fiddling. I thought I'd have to spend three times as much to get this quality. VERY pleased."
1,"These earphones, I have purchased in December 2016 were the first wireless set that I have used and they had an exceptional sound quality to them that could not be beaten for the price that was paid for them. These earphones were able to pick up other sounds in songs that other earphones in it's price range simply missed. The 8 hour battery life claim is accurate on these earphones, since I could keep listening to music for most of the day before having to recharge them. The IPX7 waterproof claim is also true for these earphones, since you can run them under some water and they would still work. Just don't expect them to survive when being worn for swimming. The overall comfort of the earbuds are so great that you shouldn't have any ear pain after wearing them for long periods of time. I will warn you that the noise cancellation in these earphones are powerful too, so expect to turn your volume down very low if you want to hear someone talk while wearing them. The only real problem I've run into with these earphones is the mic, which had it's times of being mediocre when others would mention that my voice sounded too low.<br /><br />Unfortunately, my pair reached the end of their life span after almost 2 years, as there was a short in the cord that caused one of the earphones to go out. Earphones were never made to last forever, but with that... I leave my parting honest review for these amazing earphones, so that others can see that they are worth giving a try."
1,"Great sound, people can actually hear me when I make calls now! Great value."
1,These headphones were very easy to use and sounded good. They last about six month and then suddenly died. The company honored the warranty with no issues and sent me a new pair.
1,The true i like a lot the sound is amazing compare to anoter an expensive headphones but microphone sound have echo the person say me speak can understand
1,"They are a little bassy but they fit well and have a good range. Linking them with my Iphone 6s was a breeze and I have been enjoying the freedom of not being tethered to my phone while I listen to music. The mic sounds good but is also a little thumpy owing to, I suppose, it's location on the inside of one of the earpieces. I like these and would certainly recommend them at the $37 price point."
1,"While I enjoyed the sound quality, the left ear piece constantly fell out of my ear, and seemingly no matter what wifi I was on, there was constant skipping when playing music via Pandora."
1,They work like a charm sound great I use them everyday while working thank u
1,Left head phone has a constant ringing like the speaker is messed up. Right head phone is clear and great for listening. Thought it would be the device attached it to three other devices same low tone ringing. Is there any suggestions on how to fix it. Or is this normal?
1,"1st pair of wireless earbuds. They stay in and the sound quality is great.  I got them for working out, but i use them at work too. I realized after getting them how much my corded buds were in the way and out of habit I go to reach for them and then I realize I  didn't have then in.  When I bought them I didn't realize I could use them to answer and make calls.  That is purely a bonus."
1,"First off, there is 0 noise cancelling in this device. It is an earbud that has a mic that is all.<br />The sound is pretty good for what it is. I wear them while running and get a lot of wind noise somewhere on the device.<br />The battery life is about 4-6 hours<br />It comes with a case but I wish the case was hard because they get activated often with random pressure due to the case and their shape. If it were a hard case this would be eliminated. I wouldnt recommend storing in a pocket or bag.<br />Definitely a good buy for workouts."
1,"Considering the price, I feel it's a good deal. Sound quality, materials quality, in box extras, all what you would expect or slightly better. 3 ear buds included are not the most comfortable or best fitting. Signal gets a lot of static if the battery is low it seems.  Curious to see how well the battery will hold up to recharges.  End of the day it fits the bill for what I was looking for. Happy purchase."
1,"Very impressed, good bass and great sound quality"
1,The sound quality is great.  There is an echo on the mic when talking on the phone.  I'm very happy with the overall performance of the ear buds. I like so much I bought my son a pair of them.
1,The charging cable thatcame with them is'nt right its a lightning cable and the headphones are mini usb
1,Nice value
1,Great product
1,I love these headphones. Great quality sound. Easy tho operate. Fits great and has adjustable ear hooks to fit all sizes. For less than $50 these are the best Bluetooth headphones on the market. Extra bonus for the carrying case.
0,İt got out of order in two weeks. After five minutes working its not seeing ios device my iphone 8 plus.i wish i didnt buy it. Because im trying to connect again its not doing job
1,Good sounding headphones.  Better than I expected.
1,"[[ASIN:B01G8JO5F2 SENSO Bluetooth Headphones, Best Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7 Waterproof HD Stereo Sweatproof Earbuds for Gym Running Workout 8 Hour Battery Noise Cancelling Headsets]]<br /><br />i had bought these headphones a few months ago.<br />the sound is excellent, they sit comfortably when sitting or running, they dont fall out or get uncomfortable after a long run.<br />i had a question about the waterproof of the headphones since a piece of the rubber fell off somehow.<br />to my surprised the support answered me right away.  we had an email correspondence on the same day which they decided without my asking to send me a new pair.  i was amazed at the great service which ended up with a new pair of headphones being sent to me on the same day that i posted my question!<br />the only drawback i can think of is that sometimes i confuse the right and left earpieces.<br />to sum it up<br />pros:<br />Great Quality<br />Great and quick Service<br />cons:<br />hard to differentiate between right and left earpieces.<br />no way of knowing how much battery life is left until its low.<br />verdict:<br />i would definitely recommend buying this pair!"
1,"Really durable and long lasting battery, spilled some water in my gym bag and I didn’t have these in their case but they’re seemingly unaffected! Sound is great and I don’t ever hear myself breathing hard or the loud steps I take on the treadmill which allows me to focus on getting my workout done. Recommend these if you’re looking for earbuds to work out with. Only downside is that my ears are a bit small so I do have to adjust the band that goes up and around my ear but it’s not that bad."
1,It works well...
0,There must be a manufacturing defect - the blue tooth connection goes in and out  - when the left earbud wire is moved it loses sound.  I'm sending them back
0,"The charge does not even last through a workout. 20 mins linked to my phone, then it dies."
1,Best earbuds I have
1,"I just received these earbuds today. Just wanted to leave a review to confirm some of the other reviews in case you're looking through the reviews and see conflicting information. I workout 5x a week and have ruined 4 pairs of wired earbuds within a year so I decided to get these.<br /><br />Pros: They are lightweight and the sound is pretty good for this price. I don't think the bass is too much on these. Comes with plenty of accessories and a nice carrying case. They pair easily.<br /><br />Cons: As other reviewers have said, the wing tip is pretty much useless. It's just for decoration and does nothing to keep the earbuds in your ear. However, the earbuds are light and won't fall off so it isn't a real &#34;con.&#34; Plenty of eartipd and a foam eartip for people with different ear size. Choose the one that best fits you and you shouldn't have any problem with it falling out.<br /><br />Hope that helped!"
1,"Connects easily, comfortable wear. Quality sound"
1,"Very comfortable, nice design, love the travel case.  The sound quality is not that great...plenty of base but not much treble and clarity."
1,"Work great, low profile."
0,Have to plug in the charge cord in exactly position to make it charge
1,Great product. Everything was great!
0,"Earbuds kept turning on while inside case. Returned after a week. Seemed to work ok when on, but large case that did not protect the buds properly."
1,work great
1,Not too sure how these were originally $160.. they fit good and do stay on very well but the quality of the music is like a regular pair of headphones. I honestly think the earbuds that come with an iPhone have better quality sound.. oh and there's little to no bass. The set that it comes with is really nice as well
1,Great product. Works wonderfully. Easy to set up and use. A must have for runners and workout buffs. Stop fighting with wires connected to your phone that get in your way and get a pair of these.
0,"After 3 months of light use, the right side has stopped working.  The Bluetooth connection was spotty initially until I emailed support and they gave me a procedure for a reset that made the connection much better.<br /><br />You get what you pay for.  Spend another $50 or so and buy a quality product.  You will end up doing it anyways once these break."
1,"Surprisingly great value for the price. Battery is great as is the quality of the sound. The red ear inserts are pretty much earplugs and do a great job of passively blocking outside noise.<br /><br />Surprisingly amazing Bass (I’m a SVS home theater dude) for theses little earphones. But they keep falling out of my ears a little  when lying back to do sit-ups or running. They stay in your ear, but the sound drops in that ear and the bass goes away leaving an irritating un-balance of the music  between each ear."
1,We love the quality a d connecability of these headphones.  They mold to your ear and we did not expect that.  They were charged and ready to go out of the box.
1,"These headphones are awesome! The sound, range, fit, and battery life is dramatically better than other bluetooth headphones that I've paid 3x the amount for in the past! Thanks for such a great product and great service!"
1,"I would definitely recommend this product and I would buy them again. I’ve had them for a few months and I am impressed with how long the charge stays on. I also enjoy the feature that if you don’t have any sound coming through the headphones they will automatically turn off to reserve your battery after a period of time.  I was mainly looking for headphones that I could use when I do water  aerobics , light swimming, or just walking the pool they have gotten wet and they have held up just fine.  I have not fully submerged these underwater but they serve the purpose that I bought them for"
0,"PROS: these have sound that I can only assume is meant to rival with headphones like beats. They do get really loud without distortion. Has a deep bass if you like your music with more bass than you’re used to on standard headphones. Packaging was great, comes with travel case, a car USB charger,  and cable that is a combo iPhone/USB Micro.<br /><br />CONS:  These ear buds would not stay in my ears. I tried all the various cup sizes from small to large and they kept popping out when running or rowing. I’ve also used them while cycling and they pick up a HUGE amount of wind noise. I could barely hear the music. iPhone cable may not be compatible with aftermarket waterproof type cases."
0,"These headphones suck.  I guess that's to be expected for $30 Bluetooth headphones but I still expected more.  They skip whether I am walking or running with them which is extremely annoying.  The sound quality I would describe as adequate but not great.  To make up for the lack of quality, Senso gives you a TON of extras: case, multiple charging cords, extra ear buds, etc which really aren't necessary.  Better quality would be more appreciated.  They describe them as &#34;noise canceling&#34;, but in reality I could hear plenty of street noise, more than I expected.  Going back to my Tao Tronics Bluetooth headphones. Disappointed in this product, especially based on how many good reviews they had."
1,Great headphones I highly recommend it the sound quality is good battery life is good & sweat proof for the price its worth it ...included is a carry case extra ear buds & charger
1,Very happy with purchase! The sound is great and the earbuds are very comfortable. Setup was very.
1,"Received it today and tried in office and subway. Here is my first impression on Senso ActivBuds S250.<br /><br />Original price $169.99. No it's not. (False advertising No. 1).<br />I don't think anybody will seriously believe it's a bargain from $169.99 to $33.97, but here you are.<br />Factory's website is listing selling price at $49.97 each.<br />[...]<br />ActivBuds S250 came with a nice package including many accessories, so It is still very good value at $30~40 range.<br />Do I pay $170+tax for this earphone? No I wouldn't. Nobody does since Senso does not sell it at $169.99.<br />I understand it's business but it just makes Senso look bad so they shouldn't list it this way.<br /><br />Noise Cancelling (False advertising No. 2):<br />I did not expect Bose level noise cancelling with $30 headset, but I don't think ActivBuds S250 has any noise cancelling function at all.<br />I put it into my ears and turned it on/off with different environments, but could not recognize any ambient or subway noise cancelled.<br />Yes, it does block outside noise, but it's thanks to the noise isolation of the earbuds that you can find with any other in-ear canal type earphones.<br />Senso should put &#34;Noise isolation&#34; instead of &#34;Noise cancelling&#34; (False advertising No. 2). it's a bummer for me since noise cancelling was one of reasons I picked this.<br />Senso may object that ActivBuds S250 does have noise cancelling and I just don't recognize it. Well, if customer can't recognize the effectiveness, it makes the product ultimately useless.<br /><br />Sound quality: okay<br />It all comes down to personal preferences, but to me ActivBuds S250 has very deep clouded sounds with emphasized bass.<br />I know many people like rich bass and treble but I like clear sound and wish it has clearer mid too.<br />ActivBuds S250 does not sound anything like my audio-technical M50x or other cheap/expensive headsets I own from AKG, Sony and Bose.<br />I guess if you are fun of Beats by Dre headphones, you will like the sound of ActivBuds S250.<br /><br />It's very very loud. I don't know if I received defective one, but it's loud enough with the minimum volume with my iPhone.<br />I can't imagine anybody using it with more than 50% of volume.<br /><br />Overall it's a nice value, but overrated headphone.<br /><br />I will try some more time and see how it works in gym and how good the battery is."
1,"Amazing headphones for the price.  I really like them, but have only tried them for a week."
1,Is just best I loved
0,Dissapointed. Sound quality is good but Bluetooth device has to be close. I put my phone in my jacket.pocket and they lost the signal.
1,Great headphones!
1,"Great for when working out at the gym, which is what a I needed them for."
1,"The sound is a little bit muffled.  But I think that's probably normal for waterproof headphones.  Otherwise, they're really good."
1,More reliable than Powerbeats3. Battery will hold its charge and this item is highly recommended
1,I think they are made to go around really big ears... they keep falling off (the part that loops around the top/back of the ear is just too tall).
0,"I really want to like these headphones. But there is a constant background hum which really distracts from the music. Other than that, there's a lot to like. But the hum is really a dealbreaker."
0,Stopped working after I used them about 10 times
0,"I was intrigued by the reviews, and I wanted to find a pair of Bluetooth headphones that fit over the ear. I was concerned about the size for use while running, but they were comfortable. I charged them up and connected them to my phone. The connection was constantly dropping in and out from the moment I first used them, but after 45 minutes they just quit working. The phone was never about 12-18 inches from the headphones at any point. I have owned a few Bluetooth headphones, and these are by far the worst."
0,"Good set of earbuds, they have some connectivity issues from time to time with my LG K7 when turning them on but it works eventually. Also don't like the rubber like feel of the ear hooks, especially if you have curly long hair. But on a budget, these are amazing and I would recommend it.<br /><br />Update: apparently it stopped connecting to my phone now, even after syncing them over and over again and I can never hear anything. Giving it one star, gonna save up money for some more reliable earbuds."
1,"This is presently the best Bluetooth Headphones that money can buy in my opinion. It's like they think of everything. I put off writing my review until I had used it for a while but I feel better and better about my purchase everyday. It's easy, convenient, durable, clear quality sound, easy to move around, long lasting battery power, connects easily, does not fall out of your ears, does not accumulate sweat, the list goes on...if you're considering wether or not to buy it. Just do it lol"
0,"I bought these headphones based on many thousands of reviews, and after using them for some time I still don't understand why they are highly rated. The earbuds fall out constantly, no matter what size insert I use. I bought them specifically for the gym, and every time I lie down, sit up, lean over or generally move, one (or both) ear bud(s) needs to be placed back in my ear. I rarely use these anymore largely due to the frustration factor of them not staying put. Also, by ""sweatproof"", the manufacturer clearly means ""sweat phobic"", because at the first bead of sweat anywhere near them, the headphones come out of my ears and will not stay in, no matter how much I try.<br /><br />The ear hooks are also gigantic and not pliable. I'm reasonably certain that my ears fall somewhere in the ""normal"" spectrum for size, but the ear hooks are completely useless and provide no support for holding the earbuds in place. The size of these probably adds enough weight to the earbuds to contribute to them falling out of my ears constantly.<br /><br />Sound quality? Pros: They do block out much of the outside noise, which allows me to keep the volume lower. Cons: I could best describe the sound quality as ""extremely muddy"". Not bass-heavy, but there is a huge low-mid range EQ boost that makes everything sound unclear at best. The sound quality was supposedly one of the best features, especially when compared to (much) higher-priced Bluetooth headphones, but in my experience, this is not at all the case. Perhaps the other headphones sound equally terrible.<br /><br />The microphone transmission quality is garbled and basically terrible. I tried to answer a few phone calls while wearing these, and the callers could not hear/understand me. I had to hang up and call them back using my phone every time.<br /><br />Battery life is great, I'll admit. I've only had to charge these once! However, that's also partially because I became so frustrated with these falling out, and disenamored with the poor sound quality, that they live in my gym bag, unused. But I did probably manage 8-9 hours of use before I had to charge them.<br /><br />They do work consistently and have a good range, and the accessories are decent.<br /><br />Caveat emptor."
1,"The ear piece wouldn't stay in when running.. keeps coming out, but this product provides great accessories.. it's not for universal ear..only for certain types of ear anatomical.."
1,As expected they are great!
1,"These headphones are great. The sound is amazing, they fit well, and the controls are easy to use. My only wish is for the cord to have something to adjust the length, so that they don't dangle while running. Even a tightening option will be awesome."
1,As described
0,"These things honestly are junk. Claim of 50 ft Bluetooth range, but ONLY under ideal conditions, otherwise it's about two ft. Don't bother using them outside, because they cut out non stop unless you hold it chest high. Sound quality is poor for this price range. Very muddy bass notes, muffled highs. I've used numerous LG Bluetooth ones, Samsung's, and a few cheap Chinese knock offs, and these are by far the worst ones I've used as far as getting a clean signal. Thank god I only spent under 40 bucks on em. Definitely not worth list price, or even close to it."
1,the product is just what i needed
1,Awesome headphones for running. They do not fall out of my ears at all. Battery life is more than adequate. I even accidentally ran them through the washing machine once and once they dried they were like new.
1,"I normally dislike ear buds because they are uncomfortable for me but for the price I figured why not.  Got them and was impressed by the case, extra ear pads, car charger and two cords.  Charged them and listened to them and they sound nice with good bass.  I haven't had a chance to put them to use while I'm working to see how well they stay in place but there is no way they can be as bad as the headphones I had previously.  They feel comfortable and it looks like I won't have any issues with them falling out."
1,Excellent reception. A little disappointed in their ability to stay all the way in my ears but that is only when running. Made my cardio part of my workout easier
1,"These are, without a doubt, the best earbuds I have ever purchased. Super comfortable, handy controls, and excellent battery life."
1,"The headphones work great, I can hear abs be heard very clearly. It’s been years since I used any type of Bluetooth device so it took me a while to get started, but I’ve read and re-read the instructions. I would give 5 Stars if my eyesight was better and I could see the tiny volume buttons better."
1,"I've had these headphones for under an hour and already believe they are beyond worth the money because of the quality of the product and the customer service. They sound great, and fit very well and comfortably. They cancel noise pretty well in my limited experience with them. I've yet to test the waterproofing but may make an edit in the future about it. The main reason I leave a 5 star review is because of the impeccable customer service. I contacted Invotek through Amazon and got a response on how to fix a problem I had with the headphones and the response answered a couple questions of mine. I got this response no more than 20 minutes after I sent my email. The issue was not fixed on my headphones, but new ones will be sent immediately because of the 1 year warranty. I am in disbelief how quickly my problem was taken care of and I cannot wait for my new headphones to come.<br /><br />As for the issue I had. The left earpiece very quietly buzzed while music was playing. I believe this is a rare problem and will update my review when my new headphones come on if the issue is still there.<br /><br />Highly recommend these headphones. I plan to shower while listening to music with these. And also work out with these. They definitely sound great for the price"
1,I like the sound of these OK (good enough for what I paid for them) - but I'm about to toss them because of the battery life.  The directions say you're not supposed to leave them charging over night - but I did that on about day 2 by accident (it takes more than an hour to fully charge them and I forgot about it).  There's an audio warning when the battery is running low while you're using them - but that doesn't do much good when you're in the middle of a 60 minute workout!  And there's no way to find out in advance as to how much life is left in the battery.<br /><br />Super frustrating - makes them practically unusable for me
1,"Let me start by saying that I NEVER write reviews but...I LOVE these. I am so picky when it comes to how earbuds fit. I bitch and moan about any earbuds I've ever tried. The apple earbuds hurt, most fall out or slide around too much when i sweat and workout. These are seriously amazing, and for the price (insert jaw drop). The sound quality is fantastic. The last pair of bluetooth earbuds I bought were not loud enough, and its not like I'm listening to heavy metal trying to blow out my ear drums. I listen to them about 75% of the way up and can't imagine putting them any louder. If you are borderline, just order!"
1,"Edit: Senso ended up contacting me after finding out my previous set went out and had me do some troubleshooting to test it it just needed a factory reset. It turned out to be a bad set, so Senso sent me a new set and I couldn't be happier with their customer support!<br />Pros:<br />sounds good<br />Fits snug<br />Battery lasts 3 hours at the gym.<br />Cons:<br />After 3 months charging light stopped working<br />At 4 months battery started to drain when not connected to charger.<br />Now at 6 months it still sounds great but randomly will try to call the last number dialed while I'm working out.<br /><br />Honestly, I love the feel and sound of these headphones. I actually chose them over my x2 earbuds.<br />Side note I used these almost every other  day for 4 months. So I have gotten some use out of them. That's why I'm giving them 3 stars."
1,"Sound nice, and they stay in my ears while working in the yard. I like that I can tap the button on the right ear to start and stop my iPhone playing music. The volume has plenty of range. I was able to pair them with my Kindle Fire as well as my iPhone.<br /><br /> I think the cord could be a little shorter."
1,Very good.
1,"Just as described, maybe even better. Great quality sound and secure fit during my running, workout & driving needs.<br /><br />The 1 year warranty & excellent customer service followup were a winner for me. I feel comfortable knowing if anything goes wrong with the earbuds within a year I'm covered.<br /><br />What more could I ask for."
1,These things work great and I use them all the time. They stay in my ears well in the charge last for at least 8 hours.
1,"So far so good. I just started using them yesterday and I'm getting more comfortable with them. There's always a learning curve, right? Especially for a 62 year old gramma. I love listening to music, podcasts and TED talks and these will be perfect besides using them for hands free phone conversations."
1,Just got these a day early. Connected to my iPhone with no problems. Sounds great. Was able to walk around the house without losing the sound.
0,"The sound quality is decent for cheap bluetooth headphones. However, these are the only headphones that make my ears sore. I can only wear them for about 20 minutes, the size doesn't fit well."
1,Good sound. It really reduce the outside noise you are available to hear. The only problem is that is a bit difficult to put in your ears for them to don't fall.
1,"Excellent headphones, great sound and easy to sync!"
0,I could not recharge them so I decided to return this product and got a refund. At the end I bought different headphones.
0,"Sent them back! The hurt my ears, the hook does not shape to the ear."
1,Wow these things look great.  After wearing them for a couple days I can now review them.  They are so comfy and cancel out all the loud noise from working in a factory.  The sound quality is amazing with music and even sounds great listening to an audio book.  Not even sure how this is possible for $35.  It even comes with 2 charging cables and a car charger.  Amazing.
1,Just bought these headphones and I'll be honest I was impressed by the way they sound and the way they fit. I was skeptical at first before buying since I wanted some alright headphones not too expensive not too crazy and these were great in sound and the comfort level. For the price its amazing the bass isn't mind blowing but it's there and these have a crisp clear sound. I'd recommend these if you're looking budget replacement headphones they're awesome. If you're looking for better bass though I wouldn't recommend these and are better off shelling out more cash.
1,"Good price point, comfortable and long lasting battery...as far as the sound goes, it's not as clear as I'd like. I have little experience with bluetooth headphones as for the past 3 years I used a set of JVC xplosivs earbuds. What's missing is the clarity on the treble scale. They are heavy on the bass and have an overall base tone over everything, which for some music is fine, but for many others leaves something to be desired. Overall, I plan on keeping these for the price and convenience, but I don't know that I'd purchase again due to the musical clarity issue. For the price, I'm satisfied with these. long battery life is hard to find and these definitely have it."
1,Best headphones in the market for this price range... It was delivered earlier than the promised time.
1,Love the adjustable ear pieces and noise cancellation.
1,Lasted longer than the 100+$ I have purchase. Great buy.
1,I wasn't sure about these ear buds when I ordered them. I listen to audible books all day. I have gone through so many ear buds while working and listening to books. It doesn't take long until I have broken a wire somewhere and I can't hear with them any longer. This is the perfect solution. I'm not tied down to my kindle but I can hear every word. I'm really loving my Senso ear buds.
1,"Work as expected. Great fit, quick setup. Clear sound."
1,Great product. Very happy with them.
1,"So awesome! Great sound, lasts long! Love em!"
1,"The earphones arrived on time, fit well, and will be just perfect for traveling"
0,Battery fried out 3 months after reciept
1,"I have only use them twice with phone calls, but love walking my dog and listening to music.  If I walk or jog the Senso Headphone stay it perfect. Music quality is wonderful."
1,Great earbuds. Customer service is fantastic. The earbuds had a slight issue at first so I emailed them. They responded in a few hours and gave me great advice on what to do. Would definitely recommend for anyone who needs a budget pair of wireless earbuds but wants something that's high quality.
1,Love these. Adjust the audio settings to your liking on your phones sound settings. Charging takes about an hour or less. Battery lasts about 4 - 6 hours continuous. Work out in these and I talk on the phone with them. I absolutely love these and would put these up against any expensive pair. Highly recommended!
1,These are very comfortable and stay put while I run. They blue tooth connection is very quick to my IPhone.
1,"I bought these to replace my IPhone's stock headphones, and a bluetooth set a friend gave me. The Senso's fit and stay in place well and while they have a very strong base, the treble was a bit weak, but that may be me more then the headphones.  I must add that the Senso's really do sound so much better then the $119 bluetooth headphones I am replacing them with and I was able to find a happy balance swapping out the settings on my IPhone's equalizer settings.  I am very impressed with the quality and workmanship of them.  For the price and service,  I would recommend them to a friend."
1,"I have a Samsung S8 phone.<br />pros: sound quality, battery life and volume<br />cons: Horrible when making and answering calls. I've been told that when I speak background noise is very loud and I sound muffled."
0,Updated my 5 star review. This product stopped working exactly one month after purchase.
1,"I wasn't sure about these headphones, but I was tired of the iPhone earbuds and dealing with the cord plus crummy fit. I can say these really are nice! I am very happy with the quality and ease of use."
1,Excellent ear buds
1,The headphones are crystal clear and plenty loud. Great quality for the price point.
1,Very nice sound with this headphones but they do stick out on the side of your head if you are looking for the aesthetics as you are wearing them. I have had several issues with them losing signal with my phone in my back pocket and when I bend over. I had to do a factory reset but then it happened a second time as well. Definitely a great pair of headphones for the money.
1,Excellent sound quality and easy to use and pair up with my iPhone.
1,They really great. Work perfectly. Thank you
1,Great sounds
1,Great sound. It is very comparable to beats by Dre
1,"I bought these to wear at the gym to play from my iPhone. They work great - good tone, volumn, and connection speed to the phone. I now also use them with my TV when the kiddo is asleep or my wife is working from home. Only complaint might be the blinking blue light, but that's just nit picking."
1,Love the fit and functionality; wish the ear retainers held the shape a bit more fairly.
1,"This is DEFINITELY one of the best Bluetooth headphones you can buy. And yes, I'm taking into account the powerbeats. And especially given the price, you might as well buy it RIGHT NOW. I've yet to try the heavily popular taotronics, which as a bit cheaper than these, but as of right now, this is probably the best I've tried. It comes with extra ear tips, case, charging kit, and a car charger.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Overall sound quality is amazing. You will have a very hard time trying to tell the difference between these and the powerbeats.<br />- It has very good comfort and it wont hurt your ears after prolonged use.<br />- amazing battery life; 8 hours seems to be right<br />- base is REALLY good. Very punchy and compare very much to the powerbeats.<br />- pairing with iphone or android phone is very easy.<br />- Remote is on the earpiece and is easy to access.<br />- $35!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Cons:<br />- These are $35. Are they going to sound like the Jaybirds x3? No. But the sound to cost ratio is high. (In my opinion the x3 are better than powerbeats)<br />- Do they sound completely better than the powerbeats? No. The powerbeats are a bit louder. However they sound 95% as good as the power beats. Would you like to spend $199 for a 5% difference?<br />- Very light weight. However, in some case they do fall out of your ears. Is it a major issue? If you are a heavy runner, it could be. However, you you work out and run casually, it should be a problem."
1,Great headphones.  Stay in place and provide great volume.
1,it is good
1,"Very nice sound! I like very much accesories like Iphone cable/connector, the car charger... Will be updating this review after my first impressions."
1,Very good sound quality
0,headphones broke in less than two months
0,NO!!! NOOOO!! AND NOOOO!!! DON'T BUY THIS CR(@&#^#AP THE SOUND QUALITY ITS HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!! PLUS THE DEVICE ITS TOO DAM BIG!!! BUT THE SOUND QUALITY IT'S  THE WORST DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY LIKE I DID
1,I’ve been using these headphones almost everyday since I bought them. Amazing.<br />Bluetooth works perfectly with the iPhone 7plus. Haven’t had any problems with falling out or being uncomfortable. I use them for working out and just leisurely listening. Have a pretty good range as well.<br />Will be purchasing more.
1,"These cancel out outside sound a bit too much for me on my trail runs, but the sound quality and charge are great.<br />The hooks on the ear pieces are a bit too big for me making them kinda pointless, but they don't tend to fall out."
1,"Love them, thanks a lot!!!"
0,They broke after 2days. What’s the return policy.
1,Love them quality sound perfect nothing better order more for family
1,thank you
1,"These headphones have incredible sound quality for the price tag that was recently reduced to half of what they sold for a year ago.  I have a $200 pair of PowerBeats and can’t stand their thin, treble sound compared to the Senso’s.  You do need to buy more than 1 pair because they are not long-lived.  I power walk 10 km a day in Thailand and combination of sweat and humidity breaks down the glue and they fall apart.  Superglue can extend the life but then the battery starts to go and when that happens, it takes multiple tries to connect up and then one day it doesn’t charge at all.  No worries, just grab your back pair for this price.  They recently changed the part that wraps around your ear from fixed plastic to a pliable rubber coated metal that you shape.  Horrible idea, now they don’t stay put and you loose the bass when they pop out."
1,I use these everyday when I run. they are working great. Super fast shipping too. Recommend!
1,It was purchased as a gift for a family member.
1,"Sound great, fit great."
1,very light and comfortable earbud and the battery life is as advertised!
1,For music listening and block out noise
1,"So very comfortable, sound quality is awesome. Bought these with hopes of pairing with my new Samsung TV for late night, sleepless entertainment without disturbance to my better half. No bulk and excellent range. Previous attempts with other devices were frustrating due to audio delay but these are dandy."
1,"Sound quality:<br />Not amazing bass for but clear and much better quality for music and conversation than other Bluetooth headphones I own.<br />Comfort:<br />I use them all the time instead of other pairs because of how long I can wear them in the gym, running, wherever without discomfort or them falling out.<br />Durability:<br />No wear or loss of sound quality in nearly 2 years. The only thing that wore out was the zipper on the case.<br />Functionality:<br />Occasionally minor problems connecting automatically with phone. Resetting it in iPhone settings is an easy fix.<br /><br />Would definitely recommend and will purchase again if they ever finally die."
1,fit very well and the sound is outstanding
1,Quality sound and comfort. Great price
1,"Almost to flexible, made entirely out of rubber except for the ear plug"
1,Best for the money!
1,Pleasantly surprised by quality of sound;  pretty good for use with cell phone in answering calls.  Clear reception and sound most of the time. Great packaging also!
1,Great sound! They fit my ears perfectly. I usually hate ear buds but I love these. They stay in my ears even while I'm running.
1,Good sound. Needs more bass but still terrific.
1,"Decent product.  The quality is in line with the price, so I feel like I got my money's worth.  The sounds cuts in and out sometimes when I'm holding my phone and swinging my arms while walking--it happens pretty consistently...kind of odd.  I never owned a wireless headset before, and these have made working out and listening to music much more enjoyable."
0,"I wanted to wait a while before I rated this product. I have enjoyed these headphones for almost 2 months. Nice sound, fit well and for almost 2 months they rated  5 star. All of sudden I start to use them while working out and they will not pair with my I phone. I thought it was just a glitch and rebooted my phone. I tried to pair again and it was unsuccessful. I fully charged it and waited a couple of days. Still will not pair. I have had 4 pair of blue tooth headphones and have been out of luck. I paid more each time thinking they would be better quality. Nope. I read some reviews on Bose, and other top brand and reviews are not always good on those. Anyone happy with their blue tooth headphones and they last longer than a couple of months?"
1,"So far, so good! Received on time and product is exactly as advertised.  It was super easy to pair the earbuds with my iPhone. Really good sound quality for music. Have not yet used outside, so I can't rate for wind/background noise during conversation."
1,"Great headphones for working out, running or any other activity that requires you to move! My only concern is that the cable is a little bit too short, and it feels weird/sticky when you are sweaty, but other than that, these are just perfect... the battery lasts a lot and are super light and comfortable."
1,Great sound! Even the background sound in songs and movies come in so clearly.
0,"I had purchased these for both my wife and I and after about 5 months of operating, I can say I've never made a worse purchase in my life. Well, maybe one or two others but as of recent these things are hot trash. Maybe it says somewhere on the product description and I missed it, but the bluetooth connectivity on these is about a foot. So, if you plan on wearing these headphones and putting the phone in your pocket, good luck as it won't pick up the reception. If you hold the phone close to your ear or leave it on your nightstand while you sleep, maybe you'll be good but for what I purchased these for - working out - they can't do the job. Also, there's only 3 buttons on this: volume and a &#34;connection button.&#34; You press the button, it does nothing, you hold it down, it turns it on and off. Trying to get them connected within that 1ft range to new devices can be a pain.<br /><br />Now, I will give them some pros and say that the sound quality when it is connected is fine. No deep bass issues or anything, not crystal clear, it's just fine. It get's the job done you know.<br /><br />In addition, being able to charge with a micro usb is good and the over the ear setup works and the adjustable ear plugs are good. The length of the headphone wire between buds is a little comical and I don't think it's very well thought out.<br /><br />Also, I realize you get what you pay for, but after reading the reviews I figured these would be an ok pair, just for the gym you know, nothing fancy. But, nah. I'd rather just spend 2x the amount for headphones that work, so if you know someone selling some, let me know!<br /><br />Thanks..."
1,Definitely recommend by me!!! Can’t beat the sound and quality for the price.
1,I love these headphones.  They are inexpensive and sound great.  I lost a pair and was devasted so ordered replacemnts within 2 days.  I found my first pair but have not plans on selling the second set as I love them and will keep pme at work and one at home.  HIGHLY recommend them.
1,"$30.00, they always connect, twice as loud as any other wireless headphones. Ear loops keep them from falling out."
0,I dislike the battery life
1,"These are the best bluetooth headphones I have found to date.  For the cost of these headphones they are probably excellent.  The sound quality had a full range and they are noise cancelling.  I use them primarily for weight training and running, and they stay firmly in my ears.  I have tried several other headphones from Skull Candy to the iPhone OEM and the SENSO are absolutely the best.  The bluetooth connects every time without fail.  The only issue I have with them, and I'm not sure if it's an issue with iOS but the iPhone reports 30% charge on the headphones when they start beeping every 60 seconds stating &#34;power low&#34; then shut down in about 15 minutes. This is only after 4-5 hours of use not nearly close to the 8 hours claimed by this listing.  It's not a major issue I just have to charge them a lot more often than the Beats headphones...but then they are less than half the price as well."
1,I was on the search for Beats and a friend suggested these. I absolutely LOVE them. Sound is clear and they are great for working out. I also love talking on the phone with them. The range is awesome.
1,"Occasionally the sound sputters, bu for the price this is a damn good headset."
0,These were fantastic out if the box. Great sound fits well on my ears. Then suddenly yesterday the battery drained super fast and now refuses to keep a charge. Very disappointing..
0,"My husband bought these based on good reviews, but when he uses them for running and starts sweating, the earbuds fall out and the flimsy ear hooks don't hold the weight of the devices. He can only use them for short bike rides if he doesn't sweat much."
1,"Just arrived, have only used a couple times, but so far so good!  I would say the sound is as good as the Beats that these replaced, and the price here is way better!  They stay on my ears pretty well, and I have always had trouble with over-ear clips due to the shape of my ears.  If you are looking for a good pair Bluetooth headphones, similar to Beats but without the hefty price, give these a try."
1,Perfect
1,"Lost mine on the Marine Corps Marathon when I stopped to say a prayer at mile 12 the Blue Mile. Anyway, I’m ordering a second pair after owning the first for four or five months. That should tell the reader enough, I’m buying them again.i run marathons so long runs, these are great. That means between getting to the run and after the run at events, I’m satisfied with the quality of battery life... and I am a year old runner who takes over four hours to finish a marathon.<br />Sound quality... I listen to books thrpugh my iPhone on Audible. I’m happy with the sound. When I do have music on, the quality is fine. I have 60 year old ears damaged from years on nuclear submarines.<br />Appearance... they seem bulky, but again at 60, I’m more in favor of what works than what things look like.<br />Charging... the cord it came with died, but I just got a spare micro usb cord and it works fine.<br />So to sum up... I. Buying again. And at this price, I skip warranties."
1,Great Sound and comfortable fit
1,"I have never had any blue tooth item before, so I am still learning what I have to do. So far so good though."
1,"So far I've went thru 3 power beats wireless & yet these headphones outlasted them all. Great sound & even better price! A must buy, you're most certainly gettting more out of these headphones than what you pay for it. Great quality crisp, loud sound. I highly recommend these."
1,Great price for a great product. Super fast shipping! I was leery of ordering these. I ordered different ones from a different company and was completely disappointed. But these were a pleasant surprise. They charged quickly and held the charge! The sound quality was excellent too. I highly recommend.
1,Used on flights for music and videos. Great sound and very comfortable!
1,Great service! Great warranty as well! I have enjoyed using these while jogging!
1,"These seem like a high quality, great set of headphones. Unfortunately, I have pretty small ears and since they are not adjustable, will not be able to use them. The part that wraps around my ear falls off very easily. Great case and gadgets included, however!"
1,"I've tried all the different buds it came with, but they still fall out of my ears every 60 seconds or so, so then they just kinda hang by the ear things. Sound quality is fine, but it's super annoying they keep falling out."
1,Very nice quality product.
1,My wife likes her set when working around the house.  She liked my set and finds not needing the corded ear buds much easier to use
1,Works well and easy to sync with phone.  Battery life is about 6 to 8 hrs.
0,I would absolutely give it an even lower rating if possible.  After maybe five uses the button used to turn the earphones on pushed completely inward and broke.  This is NOT a good deal.  It is a seriously flawed product.
1,"Good for the price but bass is muddy. To be fair, I play a form of EDM, drum and bass music- which is hard sweeping/ vibrating bass. The bass was so muddy that I had to turn the volume down. Then I could hear cars driving along side me, and on my iPhone earphones this wasn't the case. These will do for now. They came fast, look nice. I did have to use the smallest earbuds because they didn't fit, but I ran 6 miles without having to adjust much.<br />UPDATE 4/29/2017: They do not work all of a sudden. I have been charging for a few days... They finally work again. I also had to delete them from my phone and then reactivate. I had to run with no beats for a few days and I wasn't too happy about that. I am investing in a pair for my iPhone."
1,They came on time and worked as advertised. All good.
1,These wireless headphones have to be the best ones I have ever had. The quality sound on them feels like they should be priced over $100 but these are so affordable which is even better. I ended up buying another one for my husband and he loves them and wears them while he's working all the time. I've worked out in them and they sturdy and don't fall out like other headphones I've used.
1,Sounds great and it was pretty easy to install on a Moto G4.
1,absolutely worth it !  Good for indoor work outs than outdoor ! Quality acceptable of such price range !
1,"quick delivery, just as advertised"
1,"I bought these for my husband and he loves them. He has wireless beats that are very similar and he says the sound quality on these is much better. They have a good battery life. We purchased these about 6 months ago and for some reason they stopped turning on when unplugged, we contacted the manufacturer and they walked us through resetting the headphones. This did not work so they immediately sent us a replacement. Could not recommend more."
1,"Battery lasts forever, they're very comfortable, connect easily, have a great range and sound great for the price. I love these headphones. The only *small* negative is they're a little bulky looking."
1,"love them - great sound and value for money, staying well in place, very good battery life"
1,"I've had them for 10 months already and let me tell you these cannot compare to those that people pay over $100 for. Still amazing quality, durable, sleak. I use them everyday and all day. For work and gym. Must buy!"
0,"Excellent quality at first, but I used them daily and after months of use they started to play audio on just one side and when I got it replaced this one only lasted 4 months and now won't even turn on despite charging it!!<br /><br />Please do more research before buying this product!!!"
1,A great product and a very functional packaging.
1,Every thing sounds very nice
1,"These headphones are pretty good. The battery lasts for a good long while without dying, but I have yet to push it to its limits where battery life is concern.<br />The sound quality is pretty good, but there is a faint, odd electronic hum in the left earpiece when no music is playing. It's not all that irritating, and you can't hear it when music is playing, but I thought it was important to mention.<br />They fit well, but would probably fit me better of I had bigger ears, but I'm a smaller person with smallish ears, and this is a problem I personally run into with all sorts of headphones, so if you're average-sized it shouldn't be an issue. But I do like that it came with different size earpieces, and the smaller ones seem to work well. They cancel noise very well, and they don't fall out, even when I'm riding my horse, which is why I got them.<br />Now the main reason I give it only 3 stars is because of the call quality. The sound is great, no complaint there, but because of the location of the mic and its proximity to the speaker, the person you're talking to has an echo of their voice on their end, making it difficult to talk, much like those speech jammer challenges on youtube. If it wasn't for this and the hum (which could very well just be a singular defect in mine because it's only in one ear) it would get five stars. But for the price, I wouldn't say these are terrible, but they're not perfect either. Just okay."
0,"after about 2 months of use, this product is failing. not holding a charge and today, I lost volume after the first 30 minutes of a full charge.<br />would not buy this product again"
1,"Only had for less than one week but I am extremely happy with these. So much so that I ordered a pair for my wife. Was looking for something with good bass, these deliver. Comfortable on my ears and good sound quality."
1,"I love these they are the best most affordable headphones ever, I recommend that everyone get a pair for the entire family, they changed my life"
1,Not water proof or submersible ! Descrption is misleading ! Otherwise great product ! Dkund is great & very light weight ! I have bought two of them & took them swimming.  Both hsd issues. Returned them. Yes usb charging door was closed. Description states  you can take them swimming you can't. IPX7.  Great for sitting by the pool or bicycling . Ok if they get splashed
1,Good product
1,5 stars FOR WHAT THEY ARE.<br />They don't stack up against my $100 headphones but they are way better than expected at this price point.<br />For someone who isn't much of an audiophile or someone like me who just doesn't want to bring nice headphones to the gym or for nasty chores these are good.<br />Charge seems to last about as advertised and they paired easily.
1,"These headphones are second to none in quality for your money and customer service. I had a pair for about 5 months that worked well, synced fast, and played music clearly. Loved it. Then for some reason the charging port stopped working and my battery eventually died because I could not recharge the battery. I was perfectly fine with buying a new set because of the cheap price before I realized that I was still covered under the one year SENSO warranty. I emailed customer support and told them about my issue. They replied to my email immediately with troubleshooting tips and when that didn't work, they immediately sent me a new set of headphones. I've already recommended them to people in the past and I plan on doing so in the future. Great pair of bluetooth headphones."
1,Great value for the BEST cordless earphones I have owned to date!
1,Very easy set up and sound is great.
0,as title
1,Bought these after losing my wireless beats headphones. These are honestly just as good. I was impressed with the packaging and accessories it came with. Sound is great. Very comfortable to wear and doesn’t budge while it’s in your ear. Great buy
1,"I've used these earbuds for outdoor and indoor work and they have performed very well, so far. Battery life is very good, as well as the comfort. The noise cancellation is adequate enough for me to hear music fairly well, while vacuuming or mowing the lawn. I haven't had an issue with them falling out of my ears constantly like other headsets I've used. For the price these are a solid buy."
1,It was exactly as expected a pair of good wireless headphones that don't bother you when you exercise. I couldn't fined the power button at first so a little indicator would be nice like a power indicator. But overall it's a great product worth the sale price of $40 I got it for.
0,This is my 2nd pair 1st pair was perfect 2nd pair the way the wires are in the ears That will  Adjust around your ears keep straightening doesn't grip your ear and you always have to adjust it why did they bother it.
0,After using these for 4 months they started to fall apart with the ear pieces especially. Reached out to customer service 4 weeks ago with a promise to next day a new set and they have yet to replace them as promised so I've ordered another brand to replace these. They were great for the time they worked
1,Great value for price. Not an issue yet love them!
1,"I have used SENSO Bluetooth headphones for 2-years and love them. I can’t use the iPhone earbuds as they don’t fit my ear canal. The SENSO wraps around the ear and is adjustable. The sound is very good, especially for the price. I wear them exercising, working in the yard and on plane trips. They fit well and are very good with noise canceling. I highly recommend!"
0,For sounds quality it's good but when I talk to anyone it's loosing connection with my phone so I have to connect again and again
1,I bought these to replace my old Yur buds I bought some years ago. The sound quality is solid. They lasted throughout my marathon training program and held up for the most part from excessive sweating.<br /><br />One downside is sometimes  a drop of sweat would get into my ear canal which would release the suction of the ear buds. Probably could be prevented if the wrap around part had a little more rigidity to it.
1,Love that it has its own case so I don’t have to worry about it getting tangled with other stuff.  The ear piece is comfortable and I have used them everyday with no issues.  Great deal!!!
1,These work great. The sound is awesome and lasted all day.
1,"This arrived quickly and complete.  I am struggling a bit with it being complicated because I have never used my bluetooth before.  No doub, my grandchildren would find it simple.  Battery needed recharging soon but maybe I wasn't turning it off when I thought I did.  Sound is wonderful whenever I figure out how to make it work!"
1,Awesome headphones. Work perfectly connecting to many Bluetooth devices.
1,"I run a small car audio company and I know sound.  I will tell you right now,  after going through 5 sets of crappy bluetooth headphones, these are the closest your going to get to Beats without spending a fortune.<br />*Update After a year and 4 months, the left side wire is finally starting to develop a short. Turn your head to the left and it will come back on. If I would've bought the extended 2 year warranty I would have a new pair right now."
0,"Price is absolutely the best part. However, I thought the sound was muddy. The fit was not good - I tried all 3 tips. And, worst, I got lots of wind noise when running. I'll probably spend more money to get something better if possible."
1,"There are lots of things that I like about this headset:  they are comfortable and the over the ear loops keep the buds snug in my ears even on a bike.  The sound is also very good when I'm working out in the gym.  The issue is that the way the units are designed, I get excessive wind noise on my bike, which greatly reduces the listening experience.  I may try to block the airflow with some tape or something, but I would not recommend buying this headset if you plan to use it primarily for bike riding."
1,Works great easy to connect to devices
0,The GOOD : Senso was he best designed blue tooth earbuds I have had -- easy to use fits great in my ears Great Sound and volume control.  The BAD:  I have bought two and these and neither has lasted a month.  Both had the same problem the ON OFF button stopped working . I purchase the first one and it stopped working shortly after I received it - Amazon honored the return.  I thought that maybe the problem was an aberration and I liked the  design so much that I bought a second one with the same result.
1,Very well packaged.  The earphones come with a nice assortment of accessories. They are very good quality and the sound is clear.  The product is light and very comfortable. Just got them and so far so good.
1,"I am really impressed with the inexpensive Senso Bluetooth Headphones. The sound quality is good, the ear fit is better than any other earbuds I have owned and the length of charge is longer than I expected. It takes only couple hours to charge which is also a plus. For the price I Definitely recommend Senso"
1,"Good charge, good sound quality and fit well on my ears"
1,"These are a good buy for the price. I use them for running. They don't have the highest quality sound you've ever heard, and they don't cancel noise from wind very well (and traffic noise not at all), but they're great if for running in quieter areas. I'm happy to be free of cords going into my phone for an affordable price."
0,"Broke in the first week, the side came off and lost the button"
1,So far so good. I have a pair of power beats that are 5x the price and these are just as good and comes with more perks. Quality buy. Get them.
1,Great design of the ear buds which hang nicely and securely around the ears. The sound delivered is fantastic.
1,"Awesome and slip proof, pairs easily and fits great!"
1,"Tried it with weightlifting and running, it stays on the ears and at times you do not feel its on. Good product with a marvelous price entry."
1,Have
1,Best headphones I've used so far!!
1,Great product!!!! Great sound!!!!  Long lasting charge!!!  Very comfortable!!!!
1,So far so good. I've honestly purchased cheaper ear buds that have failed to come close to what I need or looking for. They're comfortable and sound is amazing!! I have to say I'm impressed and have already started spreading the word.<br /><br />Matter of fact I got another pair for my niece and she loves them as well. Thinking about getting a pair for my girlfriend as well.
1,"These were purchased as a gift, but after giving them to the recipient, I may actually be back for a set of my own.  They were very well received and from what I've heard they are fantastic.  A big plus is that there isn't some bulky thing that has to sit on your neck like a lot of other bluetooth earbuds."
1,"The headphones are on par with some wireless headphones that cost much more. The quality, sound, battery life and ease of use is what stood out to me. I would definitely recommend to a friend. If I had a gripe, the right ear hook kept coming off even after I bent it to fit my ear. I’m come to the conclusion, it’s probably my ears, they stick out a little more than normal."
1,good price and easy setup.  still trying out to see which of the 3 earpiece sizes works for me.
1,I've been using this since this June! Highly recommend!! Very strong volume! Only have to put on volume 5 on my iPhone and it has a good and strong volume! Buy it! I think it's worth it!
1,I love them!
1,"I liked the sound the most, plus the fact that I didn't have to be tethered to my phone.  The phones fell off my ears a couple of times, and the plastic that went around my ears seemed loose.  But maybe I need to push the earbud parts further into the ears?  Anyway, I would have given 5 stars if the phones had stayed on snugly."
1,&#34;These earphones are perfect for my daily walk/jog. Very comfortable to wear and easy to set up with my phone.&#34;
1,She is very happy with the headphones.
0,The light doesn't come on when I'm charging? How do I fix this?
1,Great quality for the price! They don't hurt my ears at all (unlike other products). Highly recommend!
0,The headphones shut down about a week after I purchased them. Wouldn’t turn on or charge.
1,One year later and not that frequently used at all... just stopped working. They won't charge. Good while they lasted though.
1,Good headphones thanks
1,I would give it 5 stars if it didn't looks so bulky and wide when looking from front.
0,"I've purchased these three times, the first two being satisfactory. This time, however, the fitted plastic around the ear has no wire in it, so it does not stay. At all. No one can hear me when I use them for phone calls, and they constantly disconnect when I am listening to Audible. Will not purchase again. Also, not for small ears."
1,"I liked the price point on these headphones and I am satisfied with them. The only thing that I wish was that the battery lasted a little bit longer and that the clips over your ears were a little more comfortable. But, I cant ask for much more at this good of a price."
0,"I have had 3 replacement headphones within the last year. The company refused to issue a refund the last 2 times my headphones have died. They are great headphones when they work, but every single pair have quit working in about 3-5 months. I would not recommend these headphones to anyone or buy from Tekatron or a Senso product again. They do not refund when their products don't work."
1,Really like these earbuds.  I had no trouble pairing with my phone. The flexible over the ear loops are very comfortable. The sound is pretty good for bluetooth. My only criticism is that the volume buttons are a bit too small and a little hard to find when exercising.
1,I use these all the time. Very happy.
1,Mom loves them
1,These really work well. I recommend them everywhere
1,Worked well for a few months and then they crapped out on me.
1,"Bought these as a gift for my husband and he loves them! Great, quick service. Thank you!"
1,Decent sound for daily commute. Mic is TOO soft for the receiver. I stop using it for phone calls.<br />Treat this more like a headphone without a mic.
1,Best I've had - so comfortable with great sound & no outside noise / feedback.
1,Love them. They are great for running and you can’t beat the price.
1,"Hubby was impressed!  Great sound, lots of bud choices came with it. Great Product!  THANKS!"
0,These headphones died during their warranty period.  Manufacturer will not stand behind their product.  Don't waste your money.
1,"I purchased these after my current pair (different brand) died in less than 6 months. I use these during mowing my lawn down here in hot and humid Florida. The sound quality is wonderful and they are loud which is great because it drowns out all the outdoor noise. It was very easy to pair and lets you know when it powering down and connected with your phone. It also alerts you when receiving a phone call by announcing the number, great feature. I love these headphones for the price you can't go wrong"
1,Before these I has to return two sets of Bluetooth headphones that simply did not work or were uncomfortable. These are exactly as advertised and literally the most comfortable ones I've used in the past 4 years..
1,"I have only had these a few days so far there good doesn't quite have the bass response I was hoping for like some of the reviews i read. I have not used them yet for working out, do not know how they will hold up to sweating and normal everyday use. They are pretty user friendly figured them out right away without using the manual. I gave it 3 stars because I haven't owned them long enough to give them a fair grade."
1,The senso earbuds so far have performed better than any others I've tried even Bose.  Volume is terrific. The product packaging and included items are first rate. The charging cable with lightning connector is heavy duty. Strongest looking wires I ever seen. Ends are reinforced to extend life fight fraying.  Comes with multiple ear pieces so you can find that perfect fit. Pairing was quick and easy with iPhone.  Haven't had a chance to try them while riding the motorcycle but with the volume performance should work. Highly recommend
1,So far they seem to work great. Comfortable and good sound quality
1,"Great product for the price.  Easy to use, good sound volume and quality and waterproof which is essential for me as I am using these to work out."
1,Good
1,Sound awesome
1,"I purchased two sets of these, one for my husband & the other for me. We both like them s lot. We both agree they block out surrounding noise very well."
1,Good sound quality. Comfortable in ears
1,"I am very pleased with the quality ear buds. They have great range, and Have a nice clear sound when listening to music. I would recommend them to anyone."
1,excellent for the price
1,"The sound quality, comfort and ease of use of the headphones is excellent considering the price. I use them for running and lifting seven days a week. After a few months they did suddenly stop working, however I contacted Senso Support and was eligible for a replacement pair. Obtaining a replacement pair under warranty was an easy process and customer service was great!"
1,This product is easy to use. I oly wish that it had better background noise cancellation capability when talking on the phone.
1,"Great earplugs, but they aren't very waterproof due to me having them 6 days and one side is quieter than the other."
0,I really enjoyed these headphones but after a year or so they stopped working so I reordered. This new pair has not lasted me three months. Really disappointed by this product. I have tried all the resets for the product that are online. I used to be a big supporter of this of this product because of my pervious experience however I would not recommend them.
1,"Excellent product.  Packed with useful features which are logically enacted.  It has a very good charge life and comes with all of the accessories necessary to charge the headphones under nearly any circumstances.  Great sound quality and noise cancellation.  These headphones are so good, I bought a second set."
1,Well made and the sound is great!
1,I haven't had the headphones long enough to give a review but so far I am pleased but time will tell give me 25 days to try them out! After further evaulation I find these earbuds to be very comfortable and they rock the music so loud I have to cut down the volume on my iphone! They are a little pricey 35.00 but I have a pair from Coulax and they were 25.00 so the Senso are waterproof and I like the ring that goes over your ear to help keep them in place when I trian or run.
1,"Love this product, this is my second set of these exact headphones!"
1,I've been testing and testing all sorts of earbud headphones and some were really nice but after a while something would stop working ... so far these have had the best sound quality and the memory foam ear piece is comfy... I'm mainly concerned about the range these will be able to go when I'm working out ...I will update as time goes on
1,Great sound nice beat love it
1,Work great!
0,"Oh my God, no.<br /><br />A) Wire pulls. Wire tie does not help.<br />B) Ear clip hurts my right ear after just an hour or two.<br />C)It says that it's connected but it doesn't actually work. Tried restarting everything and still broke.<br />D)The power cord all-in-one android/iPhone charger is very ineffective with connectivity issue.<br /><br />Every thumb down."
1,I ordered the Bluetooth 250 Senso Activbuds. They arrived very quickly and I love them! They’re very comfortable and the sound is very good. They paired up to my iPhone and to my Samsung Player very easily. I haven’t used them near water yet but I’m sure that they won’t disappoint me. I also like the case that came with them. It’s so easy now to keep them safe while I carry them in my purse. I’m thinking about ordering another pair!
1,Wanted to give these things a solid month worth of use prior to reviewing. These are fantastic! The sound is good and the fit is wonderful. I run and cycle in these on a daily basis. No cutting out or bad sound even when it is really windy outside. When there are multiple Bluetooth devices paired around the headphones I notice that I have to reset my Bluetooth connection with my Ipod but other than that it has worked flawlessly. One of the biggest concerns I had was fit. My headphones prior to these was an expensive pair of Jaybirds which never really fit all that well. They barely stayed in your ear while running and sort of worked while cycling but for a pair of headphones that were six and half times the price they were junk. The SENSO's stay in my ears while trail running and mountain biking. For the price these cannot be beat!! The customer service also seems to be good as well. I haven't had to use it but almost immediately once I received the headphones I got an email asking if everything was alright. I cannot recommend these wonderful headphones enough. I'm writing a long review because before I bought I read as many reviews as possible.
1,You can not beat these for the price. The sound is good. The battery life is good enough to get me through a full work day. They do not skip like my very first pair of Bluetooth headphones I bought did. The only issue I have with them is they tend to hurt my ears after wearing them for a while (I think they are just too big for my ears.
1,"I loved these until at about a year old, they lost sound on one side. Really bummed they break that quickly with average use."
1,"Easy to set up, controls are straightforward, solid battery life."
0,"These headphones WILL break. And when they do break, Senso will send you another broken pair.<br /><br />My initial headphones set lasted 8 months until the headset stopped charging. I called the office and received a new pair but this time the pair didn’t last longer than three months. It’s cheap so do not expect anything that’ll last long. My advice, keep your money for a nice pair or know you’ll only get a few months out of them."
1,Headphones are great for the price.  Reached out to company when they temporarily stopped working and the company was extremely quick and helpful in fixing my problem! Highly recommend!
1,Excellent headphones for gym
1,"comfortable, affordable, and they get the job done!"
1,This is my second pair. Amazing quality and value. I can’t think of anything I would change about these.
1,"I really like these, especially the increased battery life. My old Bluetooth earbuds were nice, but they only lasted three hours on a charge. These purport to be able to go eight hours, though I have yet to test that out. Of course, the limits of rechargeable battery technology means that these are a bit heavier than my old ones, but the weight is well-balanced and does not feel burdensome. All in all, a fine pair of earbuds. And they sound good, too!<br /><br />Update: these lay claim to eight hours of continuous play on one charge, so I decided to do my own experiment. I tracked all my use, which was decidedly NOT continuous (an hour here, 30 minutes there, ten minutes another time) and on one charge they actually lasted for a total of TEN hours. I was very pleased with these already, and this just cements it. Really first rate."
1,"I recently purchased Apple air pods....these earbuds blow them out of the water, and I am trying to sell the air pods. They are so good, that I showed them to my 16 yr. old grandson, and he got right on Amazon and ordered his own set. Easy to pair...great to have!"
0,"Sound quality is good, durability is pitiful.  I've gone through 3 pair of these things.  They simply don't last.  Burn your money instead - you'll save time and aggravation."
1,Works great and love the accessories
1,"Update....These have been great for me, but today the right one fell out of my ear while in the pool, maybe 5 inches in and for a few seconds, as I was putting them on when it fell.  No more sounds out of this side.  IPX7 does not seem to be the REAL rating...<br /><br />I LOVE THESE!!  They work perfectly for me and even use them for running/exercising in the pool!"
0,"Good price, but sound quality is not there. I didn't expect too much and didn't get it."
1,Love them and the adjustable ear pieces. The instructions booklet has been helpful. Thank you Senso
1,"I purchased these headphones on July 5th, 2017. I have been using them for just about 4 months now and they work fantastic! I am in the pool 5-6 times a week."
0,"The earpiece is somewhat uncomfortable for me because it tangles with my curly hair but otherwise fine, it does adjust properly to the ear and does not hurt. I don't think they will fall out while exercising (I bought these for work and haven't used them while moving much) and sound is clear for me BUT the mic does NOT work and I need to take them of (and untangle from my hair) to make/take calls because people can't hear me instead of just switching between calls and music."
1,Great headphone. Comes with a large array of options and ways to customize the product. I would buy again
1,These are good headphones... they served me well for a solid years then pooped out on me ... I’d buy them again!
0,No e recibido nada y supuesta mente ya lo debí de haber recibido.
1,"What a sound!!! I use it for my running routines, and it performs just perfectly. Highly recommended. Super sound!"
1,"Easy to pair, sounds good, water resistance is good. After 2 months, the Bluetooth connection was intermittent for the first mile of my run, then worked normally. Contacted customer service via email, response was same day with instructions to do a simple factory reset that took less than a minute to complete and connection is great again. Well worth the money and the customer service is great, very responsive to email, even in the weekend"
0,"When using them just as headphones, music sounded very muted and somewhat muffled. Overall I would rate the sound from these as &#34;terrible&#34;. Using them to make phone calls, the sound was still muted and muffled, but outgoing sound from the microphone was even worse. Call recipients reported horrible sound quality. So to check for myself, I had my wife call me using theses and I confirmed the sound was absolutely terrible. It sounded as if she was 30 feet from the mic, no matter how loud i turned the volume up on the receiving phone, I could not hear her.<br />I imagine it is possible that I received a defective unit since I saw many positive reviews on them. But I am unwilling to try another pair.<br />I would not recommend these for any reason."
1,great headphones for the price only complaint is when the headphones experience a large vibration the audio skips.
1,Just received ear buds and they are very good only small problem when walking outdoors i hear the wind  sometimes
1,I was impressed by the quality of the product as received.  Also no problem in getting started.  Works well with my iphone. Appreciate the useful set of accessories. The company does a good follow-up to make sure that there are no issues.  This is my initial impression.
0,"Sound is meh. Apple wired earbuds have much more bass. Perhaps it's the Bluetooth vs wired but I think not. Having no wire to bother with is a huge plus. Great packaging. Nice accessories.<br /><br />If you like dynamic range and good base you won't like these. I tried for a day, put my OEM apple earbuds in and noticed ow much better the wired earbuds were so I returned these."
1,"These little bluetooth over the ear headphones are great. They have an impressive range, and still work with clear reception when my phone is downstairs and I am upstairs. They're quite comfortable in ear, and the grip around the ear is soft and very flexible to keep the earphones in place. The sound quality is great, very clear, but not fully noise cancelling. For me, as every day headphones, this is totally fine. For an airplane or a loud situation, I'd probably still opt for higher end headphones (bose, etc), but these are very good for day to day stuff. They stay in place, don't shift around, and all of the controls are easily on the headphones, so you can turn them on/off, adjust the volume, etc. without having to touch your phone. For the price, these are great, comfortable headphones for blue tooth enabled devices."
1,"I was very hesitant, since for years ear bud/pieces always fell out of my ears and I was convinced none would work for me. I seriously had to update my headphones, so after careful reviews and searching I chose these.  I was impressed, and they not only stayed in, but remained on my ears too.  I ran with them, and their light weight was enough that they stayed put.  A 7 mile run, I maybe had to adjust them once. The sound is good, no vibration, or other distracting noises when I ran or worked out.  The simple buttons on the right ear piece, makes it easy to skip a song, or increase/decrease the volume.  Battery charge was very decent, on a full charge, they lasted about a week, with 3x workouts, approximately 9 hours of being on.  The blue tooth range is excellent:  I was on the other side of the gym, before I realized my ipod was not on me.  These work great, and the fact that they stay in my ear when I run, it's a deal maker right there.  For the cost, you can't beat it, and I am glad I purchased them.<br /><br />Pros<br />- They stay put when running.<br />- Battery charge (so far, these are new).<br />- Blue Tooth range (on my ipod).<br />- Cost.<br />- Decent sound quality for the size and weight.<br />- The case it comes with is very handy, and protects them too.<br /><br />Cons<br />- I have to re-sync with my ipod every time I use them (minus one star).  My only real complaint.<br />- The volume/song skip buttons, are backwards to me, but it's not enough to deduct a star.<br />- Little to no bass, as others pointed out, but it's expected in small devices such as these."
1,Good
1,"For the price, these headphones often a decent sound. The mic picks up too much surrounding noise to the point that the person on the other end cannot hear my voice very well. The ear clips are too big for my ears and aren't adjustable, so with movement, they eventually fall off my ears."
1,"My daughters both have these and said they were great!  I decided to give them a try.  The price is amazing and it is a great thing to be wire free!  They receive calls and people can understand you!  The sound quality is better than you would expect and thanks to the 3 earbud sizes they fit my little ears!  Of course there is wind noise during a run, but you can't avoid that.  For bang for the buck, you can't go wrong!"
1,Love the Headphones.
0,These did not last near as long as I thought. Did like at the beginning. Would rather have put money toward the APPLE I PODS. THey are amazing!!!!! just love those and feel they are worth every cent.
1,"Fit well out of the case, charges fast, long communication range and lasts longer than I expected, love it!"
1,"I've had these headphones for over a year now and I think for under $20 they're fantastic. They charge quickly and provide hours of listening. The sound quality is excellent and has nice, deep base tones. These are also comfortable in the ear. Would recommend and would buy again."
1,"For the style of earbud these are great. I have tried a few different types of these and these by far are the most comfortable and best sounding of them. The ear hooks are a bit flimsy, not to say they are weak but they have no rigidity to them causing them to slip if the bud is not fully secured in the ear. On the other hand I'm sure that is what makes them more comfortable. The only other complaint would be the position and stiffness of the multi-function button. It causes you to push the bud tighter into your ear. If not a more tactilely responsive button then a position further forward so you push into your cheek. But none of that takes away from the quality. The wireless range is incredible. The first day I had them on I got out of my car to pump gas and go into the store. I forgot my phone was charging in the console. I didn't realize until I was inside 150ft away and they started to cut out. Most bluetooth devices would have cut out before I made it 20ft from the car. Amazing!!!!<br />All in all a well made set of earbuds. I would recommend, especially for the price, and all the stuff included. Most companies give you one short cheap usb cable and a couple extra buds. With these you get a shorter decent quality usb cable, a secondary, longer cable with both micro-usb and lightening ends, a dual port car charger, various sized replacement buds, and to top it off a nice stiff shell carrying case."
1,"Ok, but not quite what I wanted"
1,"""Yes, item works well and is a great buy."""
1,"Wow! Reviews are true! Great sound, easy to setup and use. Love the charging cables, especially the one with the iPhone adapter to charge my phone. Nice job putting this packaged item together Senso! Btw, I paid for these great earbuds and loved receiving them a few hours later. Thanks for same day delivery Amazon!"
1,Bluetooth connection is so-so while outside. Sound quality up to par but nothing special
1,I went through mutiple pairs of headphones. Senso is actualy everything I was looking for in one. Sits well while I am in the gym or running. Great value for the buck.😀👍🏻🏋🏻
0,This is not acceptable!!! They died and I can’t get it to charge again. I’ve tried everything from using different USB ports to changin the wall I plugged it into. It won’t a charge at all. I want a refund because I know I did not spend this much money to use a pair of headphones once.
1,"Great headphones! In fact, this is the second time I've purchased them as I lost the previous pair. I use them for running and they are perfect! They stay put, on my ears (even when sweaty), work great in the rain, have amazing sound quality, and the battery lasts for hours! Moreover, I found that with other headphones I had to always increase the volume to nearly deafening levels to hear anything when outside... but with these, I can keep it at a nice level as the noise cancellation is above par. Well done!"
1,"I am very happy with the sound quality and ease of use of these headphones! Even when I had an issue with the sound in my left earbud after quite a few months of use, Senso support was quick to troubleshoot and resolve the issue. Would recommend."
1,I didn't know what to expect considering I had never owned wireless headphones before. But I will never go back to regular headphones again. These are really good quality as far as the built and the sound quality. The over ear attachments and the earbuds fit my ears perfectly and doesnt come off during strenuous workouts. They have a long battery so no need to charge them ever two hours. It comes with mutiple types of earbuds as well as a charger cord. I can never leave the house without them because I truly love them so much and for thirty dollars you just cant beat these.
1,"For the price as compared to the big name brands, these are wonderful.  Easy to charge, comes with a wonderfully thought out set of accessories to be able to carry and charge.  I'd been warned by the owner of one of the expensive brands not to overcharge the headphone (who watches that carefully) because they could burn out.  I've never had a problem with these.  Plug them in, leave them until you need them and they are ready to go.  Easy to pair.  On-device controls are easy to use.  A great value.  Comfortable to wear.  Use it at the gym, in the car, around the house."
1,"The headphones were a gift for my nephew.  He was surprised and very happy with them.  Being as how he knows more about these things than I do, I was glad I made this choice."
1,These are lightweight and comfortable
1,"I don't like the position of the main control button. When it is pushed it pushes the bud into the ear, cutting off all external sound. Why not have the button on the top so that you could squeeze against your thumb. Seems like a much more natural way to do it. Related to this is a couple of times the device got turned on while it was put in the the case -- so a fully charged device came out flashing red, pretty annoying. A top button could require more force to actuate, reducing unintended &#34;power on&#34; states.<br /><br />Also, the printed doc says it will audibly announce &#34;pairing&#34;, but it does not. You hear &#34;power on&#34;, and nothing else."
1,"Purchased for my husband. He says they're comfortable, great power life but range is really short. Overall very happy with purchase. He recommends i get a pair."
1,I recently received the Senso headphones and I can say they work and sound great. I'm impressed that I received an email directly from them making sure that I was happy with my purchase and that there is a number to call for any issues or questions I may have.
1,Work surprisingly well for the price.
1,This is awesome will buy again
1,I've had them for a while now and they are fantastic.
1,"This product for me is amazing. it got that when I rode through a thunderstorm for about ten minutes and still works. The sound quality is great. Connects to most devices seamlessly. Has only three buttons but you can make calls with the headset (the last number dialed), skip songs and end calls. For some reason when I get a WhatsApp call though and I press the multi-function button it ends the call. All in all a great product I would recommend to anyone who wants to talk while on the go or being productive OR who just wants to work out and don't have to worry about headphones dropping out of their ears and still be able to have the music in their ears."
1,"It's a good product with fast connectivity.<br /><br />Good: Audio quality is great, connectivity is fast and effortless, the case is beautifull, the cables and car connections are good add ons<br />Bad: The ear hooks are too much flexible but the real bad part is the mic. It is not good positioned (in ear) so it's too distant from your mouth and you get a lot of unwanted noise in the conversation and a low volume. It would probably be a better choice to place it in the cord"
1,"Believe the hype, really great set of earphones. Tried them for the first time this morning. Stayed in place for my run. One downside is I have really small ears (especially the left) so I had to readjust my left ear piece several times even with the smallest bud in."
1,It’s really easy to use
1,These work great and get pretty loud. The bass gets a little distorted at the high volumes but the audio is still pretty good. Excellent buy. I've gone thru 2 of the beatsbydre versions
1,"I've only had them for a few days but I think they're great.  Quality built, sound fantastic. Easy to set up"
1,They are amazing so far. Getting some for my family members. Good product
1,Good sound!!! don’t feel like they fit snug enough but they haven’t fallen out!  Just need to get used to it.
1,"No issues, these work great for wear while exercising. I've only had them a little over a week but I wear them everyday at the gym and I whole running."
0,stopped working after 1 month.
1,Me encanta
1,great sound and single charge lasts a while
1,"I've had 2 pairs of these now for a couple of years and I recommend them to friends.  I wouldn't say they are great sound quality but they are certainly good enough for me.  Some people complain about the microphone but all in all I think it is more than adequate -- especially since the microphone is back by the earbud.  I get hours of battery life out of them although these days (2020) when we are in our homes, I am happy that I have 2 so I can charge one since I'm on them all day.<br /><br />I really hated the over the head phone which gave me a headache all of the time.  These are very comfortable for my ear shape and stay on.  I've also done limited running with these and they work really well.  They stay in place well and I immediately forget that I'm wearing them.  I bought a similar looking set from another manufacturer and the rubber around the earpiece is just too hard."
1,Sound is so loud. Amazing for the price
1,"It sounds great and are very comfortable to wear, no complaints on this side!"
1,"I am a very active person and sweat heavily when I workout. I have had issues with almost every set of head phones I bought, until I got the senso head phones. They work well with my phone and stay in place while working out. I did experience some difficulties and the head phones required a factory reset. Support was prompt and fixed the issue. I am considering a second pair"
0,"Nice packaging, numerous rubber and foam bud replacements. Good customer service as they contacted me a week after receiving my product. However, these simply do not stay put while actively working out. I didn't pay for customer service, I paid for good working 'athletes' headphones. Barely a month in and these now randomly connect/ disconnect and call my last number dialed whenever they want. Wish I had returned the but I missed the window while on vacation. Absolute waste."
1,Super
1,"These are a really good buy at an exceptional price. I use them outside of workouts (as headphones for work), but so far the clarity and sound are amazing. My only problem is with the fit of the headphones over my ears and the bud fitting snug inside my ear. I have to work with them for a few minutes before they are a doable fit so that I can get on with my work. Once I do, they are fine for a while then slide right back out of place. (Side note: is there a trick to solve this issue?)  Again, I do realize I am utilizing them different than most probably, but I was looking for a good, inexpensive product and this one had solid rave reviews. I think they serve my purpose,  except for that one small glitch in design."
0,I got them in July and now I can’t get the battery to stay charged for more then 1 hour. Once again I’m let down.
0,Product was defective!... Would not turn on!.. Very disappointed.
1,"There are several things I like about this product. To name a few: long lasting battery, cheap, good sound quality, different ear tip attachments, and easy to use. The come with a 1 year warranty as well incase anything does go wrong. They are quick to respond if anything does go wrong and replace head phones as soon as you do your part of the process. I will be buying these headphones again in the future if the current ones I have ever fail me and suggesting to friends as well."
1,I just received these head phones and they sound really good. Great packaging with high quality charging cords and auto jack. Seems to hold a charge well. Very happy so far!
1,"For the price, these are some of the best. I have used them for both phone and music with no issue. Setup was incredibly easy and came with a lot of great add - ons (different size earbuds, charging chord). Would absolutely recommend these to anyone looking for a great price and great sound for bluetooth headphones"
1,Headphones work great. Charge holds up for quite a long time. have been using them for a month and have yet to use them to dead battery. Sound is great. Mic is effy but still efficient. Great headphones
1,Sound quality is good. Much better than what I expected for $35. Pairing happened right away. Not sure the range but i keep my phone in my pocket or hand and they never cut out. They come with multiple ear adapter piece things(not sure what the term is :p). I had issues while jogging with them at first as they would fall out constantly. They come with a red ear plug feeling adapter that worked great for running once I used those. 6 miles and they didn't even budge. Those ones cancel outside noise really well so make sure to pay attention to your surroundings with those in. Headphones didn't feel uncomfortable at all after wearing them for a couple hours straight. The headphones themselves have a volume control as well as taking your devices set volume into account so they can get ridiculously loud. Definitely would recommend as a nice budget headphone.
1,I just got these as a few weeks ago as a Christmas present and I absolutely LOVE them!!  They are so comfortable and they are the first headphone that stay in my ears well when I run!  The sound quality is really good!  I also love all the extra stuff that comes with the headphones!  I am so happy I got these!
0,Completely stopped working. I followed all reset directions and nothing. Disappointed. Were also super uncomfortable- maybe I have small ears.
1,Fit great and they have great sound for the average user. Love the duo charger for the headphones and my iPhone!
1,"i have had many sets of headphones/earbuds but have never had a set that fits as well as these. once there in they don't fall out ,they don't move they stay where you put them."
1,"Awesome sound quality. Having trouble keeping it in the ear though, doesn't seem to fit very well even with the replacement buds, but that might just be me. Amazing battery life!"
1,"Excellent,great sound and comfortable fit. Now more clumsy cord. A great value"
0,Stop working after a month
1,"Ok, after reading the reviews online, many which seemed great I decided to try this bad boy out.<br />The sound is awesome, great bass, and gets LOUD but in a good way.<br />The earphones that go inside fit well, but the part that goes the ear can get cumbersome at times. They give you plenty of extras too, but overall I'm very pleased and definitely would recommend them."
1,"Excellent product came as promised and easy to use.  I have big (large ears) which the wrap around didn't work well for me, causing me to drop a star. Arrived earlier than I expected...Great Job folks."
1,You will not find better Bluetooth headphones at this price point. The sound quality is amazing with a very nice base. The foam ear insert forms inside your ear for a tight fit and stays in place while working out (running and weight lifting). Highly recommended!!
1,"I liked the earbuds at first. I don’t normally like earbuds but I found these very comfortable when the right earpiece was used. My problem came after about a month and a half to 2 months. It started to behave like it had a loose wire. It would cut in an out I one ear bud until finally it just stopped connecting. I haven’t been able to use them since. They won’t connect to my phone or do a factory reset. It will power off and power on but not connect or do anything else. Very disappointed, I really liked these at first.<br />I gave it 3 stars because the sound quality, noise cancellation and fit were really good. It just didn’t last."
0,"Brought this on 03-2017, originally was very impressed with it's sound quality and battery life (only charge it about once a week or until the battery dies on me) and it stays securely and comfortably on the ear. Definitely a 5 star worthy product, one major issue and a minor one prevents it from getting a 5 star. The minor issue is that when you're in an area with many Bluetooth users (aka a busy gym) you will most definitely will experience interference.<br /><br />The one major issue with these is that the longevity, what I mean by that is I've had these headphones for a year and seven months and the left side is starting to go. Now you can believe me or not, but I make sure to take care of all my electronics (Never once expose them to extreme temp. (sauna/steam) or water, and with these I kept them in the case that was provided when not in use. So I am definitely disappointed with these, since they only lasted me a year and some change."
1,"Good suction on the ears, volume is great! Just did a 5k with no neg issues."
0,"I've had these for close to a year. The sound is clear and crisp, and unlike several Beats headphones I've tried, not muffled. I made the mistake of following the crowd and buying beats in the past, only to have to return them twice (two different types). These are much much better, and you can't beat (pun intended) the price deal. Customer service was also great when I made inquiry. And delivery was sooner than expected every time I ordered (I ordered some for friend)<br /><br />(UPDATE)<br />Although the sound quality of these headphones is great, soon after writing my last post they stopped working--shutting off sporadically, even when fully charged. I contacted the seller and they were super nice and sent another set. The new set worked well, but about two months ago I had to stop using them for phone calls because persons on other end complained that they couldn't hear me when on the blue tooth. Last week I noticed they started shutting off sporadically, just like the first set, and I haven't had them a full year.<br />Although the sound quality is good, it seems that there's a defect with the design of the product, given my repeated experience.<br /><br />I downgraded to 2 stars from 5 to give credit to sound quality (when working) and customer service, however, the best product is no good if doesn't perform as it's supposed to"
1,"Everything you need in a pair of workout headphones. Good range from Bluetooth and stays consistent in range with a long lasting battery life. Well fitted with flexible sweatproof ear bands that fit various sizes of ears. Comes with wire bands to prevent swaying or catching of wires. The solid hard case with quality accessories (chargers, ear buds, wire bands) comes in handy when traveling.<br /><br />I have used Beats and Photive, and these by far are the better ones. You get your best bang for your buck with the quality of the sound these headphones put out. Bass is not overwhelming but gives a good pump to when you want to get to hard work. Mid and high ranges are not distorted. Noise isolation is great so you can focus in on what you're doing at the time.<br /><br />Lastly, you don't need those famous brands when you have good quality and well-priced headphones like these. Their customer service is great, for they follow up with you to make sure everything is okay."
1,"I use my head phones at the gym, during yard work, etc!"
0,Bad quality and connection.
1,"Beyond amazing!!!! Great sound, easy setup, and comfortable. Some of the best headphones I ever had."
1,I have used it twice and I get a lot of static and some disruption in the seed when I'm listening to music it's either fades in and out a bit or speed up or down
0,Didn’t enjoy these at all. Won’t stay on a small ear.
1,"Sound pretty decent,  noise cancelling is so so.. Very uncomfortable so far."
1,"I love these headphones!  Very comfortable, much better sound quality than the previous ear buds I had, and no cord jack to the phone that constantly gets tangled. They synced up to my phone and worked right away. The headphone has controls for volume and track skipping, so I don't ever have to pull the phone out of my pocket to make changes.<br /><br />Some other reviews said the part that goes around the ear is too soft and flexible.  I don't find that to be a problem.  That part just needs to hold the ear piece so it doesn't fall off, it works fine and I don't notice it at all.  A stiffer plastic part would probably be irritating."
1,"Mr Kenneth Backstrom thank you for the purchase follow up, great product. I was eskeptical at first but the good reviews pushed me for the purchase, definitely I will get another extra pair just in case I misplace the ones I purchase, Two Thumbs up, very recommended for future bluetooth headset buyers."
1,"Out of the box not great do these few tips and they will sound like $200 pair,if you like a more treble sounding music use smaller ear bud if you like more bass use bigger ones,adjust eq on your phone to your liking,if you are using a streaming app like spotify use there custom eq ,if u do these few things you will have a great sounding ear buds at a cheap price"
1,I have had these for 6weeks. Love how the Bluetooth let's me go anywhere in my gym and not loose connection. Sound is really good. battery charge last around 8 hrs.
0,These headphones are constantly cutting out. I have to reset them constantly. My other pair does not have this issue but these are really bad.
0,"Just like every other cheap bluetooth earbuds, these are not sweat proof even though they advertise it that way.  I've been through three cheap bluetooth earbuds in less than a year from various Chinese manufacturers.  They are all built horribly and will stop charging within one to three months.  Do yourself a favor and spend some extra money on a known brand.<br /><br />I think these company's strategy is to make minor revisions VERY often so that they can post the new model, get an initial injection of five star fake reviews, get a burst of people buying them, repeat."
1,Received the earbuds on time. Documentation was readable and good. Earbuds worked as described. Price was reasonable. Overall very satisfied with this purchase.
0,"The headphones worked initially, but the build quality is pretty low. As time goes, the outside plastic started to peel off and became sticky, and (maybe months) after that, the headphones stopped working."
0,Broken after 3 months<br />Return window not available after 1.
1,Excellent product!
1,Great headphones! The best customer service! If you have any questions or problems they respond immediately. Amazing!
1,Over a year going on these with daily workouts.  I have paid 5x for other “sports” Bluetooth headphones and they always die within a year.  Can’t go wrong here.
0,"terrible product and horrible support. I contacted them on dec 25th to tell them that the replacement set they sent me no longer holds a charge. They emailed me back with instructions on how to reset them. I tried to reset but because it doesn't hold a charge, the reset does not work. I emailed them back 45 minutes later indicating it would not reset. 5 days go by and I still haven't heard from them. I email them again. several days go by, I email them again. several more days go by (today) I email them again. Finally, I look up their number and call them. I'm told that my warranty expired Dec 29th and that because it's Jan 6th, I'm out of warranty. I explained to them that I contacted them 5 days before the warranty expired and indicated the product was no longer working. The reply, ""It doesn't matter. You're now contacting me today and the warranty expired on the 29th"""
1,nice sound
0,Received these and used them for a week and they stopped working.  Didn’t have packaging anymore so I was SOL.  Don’t buy.  Pay a few dollars extra for better ones.
0,"I enjoyed these headphones until I woke up one morning and one left bud was unattached and rendered the product useless. I had it for about....2 weeks and I thoroughly enjoyed them. The range was good for the price, the battery life was decent, and the sound quality was enough for me to be able to wear them and sing along for a while. Sad that that I did not invest in in the extra warranty as I still am confused as to how they broke. Left on the table when I slept over at a friends house and somehow just broke. I would recommend for the price but the downside is the cheapness in the build."
1,"Very nice package, the product is with high quality.  There's extra car charger to charge both iPhone and Android phone with additional charging cables.  The sound quality is pretty good with crispy high notes and strong base notes.  I like the sweat proof feature.<br /><br />The reason I give it 3 star is for the wind noise when I run.  I think it's because it's design not as streamline as the others I used before, the wind noise is very much noticeable.  This is very disappointing.<br /><br />I switched out to use different ear tips, it doesn't resolve the wind noise issue.  Even if I turned off the unit, and run with it hang in my ear, the wind noise is still there loudly.  So this is definitely a design issue on the shape.  Because it's not worth pay for the return & shipping back, I will keep it to use in the office only.<br /><br />I end up purchase the Phaiser BHS-530, similar price, also water/sweat proof, but much less wind noise.  The Phaiser's shape is more streamline, so less wind resistance I guess.<br /><br />--- Update December 2017<br />I used this weekly running outside or in the gym.  After running for 20 minutes, the volume of the music will go lower, this wasn't the problem a couple months ago.  Maybe the battery is getting week?  Leave it as 3 stars since the piece is not dead yet."
1,Bought these to use while soaking in a spa bath.  They are working beautifully. I don't have to worry about the occasional splash and I get soothing music to relax to.
1,"The only I found kinda hard to adjust to, is the way the headphones wrap around the ear."
1,Great!!!!!! sound is awesome!!!! Love the accessories that came with it. Would definitely recommend.
1,Nice sound- not too much base and well balanced. Easy to pair with phone . Good the variety of gel options for different ear sizes. Great price. Recommend and would buy again
1,These sound amazing!
0,At first I really enjoyed these headphones but lately they keep losing the blue tooth connection even when I have the phone or iPad in my hand. I just bought another brand because the problem was so annoying
1,"So far I am loving these wireless headphones. Bought them for long distance running and they last the duration of these runs. I have also been using them to listen to Audible during road trips. Dependable and good battery thus far. The sound isn't the crispest, but great headphones for the price!"
1,&#34; Love the look and sound on these innovative ear buds !&#34;
1,"HEADPHONES WORK GREAT BUT PART THAT GOES OVER THE EAR IS WAY TOO LARGE. I DON;T KNOW WHO HAS EARS THAT BIG, BUT OVERALL THEY ARE GREAT QUALITY AND SOUND IS FANTASTIC PLUS IT COMES WITH ALL KINDS OF EXTRAS. LOVE THE CHARGER CORD- UNIVERSAL APPLE/MICRO USB - VERY NICE."
0,Bluetooth range is short and it dropped connection too often.  Didn't bother returning it.
0,"The sound quality has been so poor, so fuzzy from the moment I got them, and they cut out frequently."
1,"They are really good headphones, its just that my left earphone is now making buzzing sounds everytime I stop playing music or watching a vid for 5 seconds then stops."
1,Great sound quality at a very affordable price
1,"Great quality!  Given as a gift to two people and both really like them.  The microphone works very well.  Clean, crisp sound."
1,"Purchased these in January 2017. It is now March 2018 and the Bluetooth connection is really spotty now. There had always been some connectivity issues but now, no sound plays from the left ear piece. Nevertheless, I’d say it was a decent purchase for less than $40. Lots of accessories included for the price and the sound and battery are pretty good as well. Decent amount of bass. I would recommend sticking to a more well established electronics brand here on Amazon."
1,So far they have worked great...only negative is that they slip out a little when I'm sweating a good bit.  But I'm sure most do.
1,These are the best headphones that I have ever bought.  The bluetooth is spot on (even though my Galaxy S8 continues to be plagued with Bluetooth problems).  The charge has last up to 6 hours and they stay on my head while running.  I would recommend trying these if you are looking to cut the cord of traditional headphones.
1,Good sound at a great price!
1,"I am very happy with these earphones. I use them in the shower and haven't had a problem. The sound is as good as you can expect from water resistant earphones and much better than I expected for this low price. If you're looking for a good set of Bluetooth earphones that are quite water resistant, you won't get this quality at anywhere near this price, elsewhere."
1,Went looking for an inexpensive but quality ear phone for my exercising. My old ones took constant fidgeting and the rubber ear pieces kept coming off. The design of these earphones allow them to stay put given I can wrap the piece around the outside of the ear and hold the actual ear piece in place. Sound quality is excellent and battery life is perfect (I haven't run out yet so don't actually know how long they will last).<br />Great value with excellent quality.
1,👍🏾
1,"I'm no audiophile, but these headphones have a real quality look and sound, including the packaging and accessories.  I like having the controls on the earpiece instead of  on the connecting wire like my wife's $199 powerbeats which don't have the volume of these when connected to a generic bluetooth device."
1,"Here’s what I can tell you: I’m what my friends and family consider a gym rat, and I love to run. I’ve had multiple headphones, ear buds, Bluetooth things, etc, but this is the only brand I’ve ordered multiple of. The last pair I lost during a 12 hour commute home (they fell out of my bag somewhere) and I cried. Literally. I was exhausted and delirious, but I still cried.<br /><br />It comes with all the components to make Bluetooth earbuds worth it. Multiple types of squishy things? Got it. Charger? Got it! Container to keep them safe (which I clearly forgot to use)? Got it. It even comes with a sleeve you can adhesively add to the back of you phone case, and it works WONDERFULLY. I’ve always been in love with this brand and it comes so highly recommended. Will it stop when you take them out of your ears? No. But they will withstand all the sweat, the tears, the anxiety, anger, and everything else you throw at them that other brands can’t. You won’t be disappointed.<br /><br />Also, I have a long term dating relationship with an audio engineer who says that they’re not bad for their sound quality either. “Great for a bargain” were among the phrases used."
1,Fast shipping great headphones so far just had a week.
1,I was very pleased with the quality and sound from the earbuds considering the low price point. I was very pleased with the product.
1,I've only used them once .. so far so good !
1,"Best earphones out there. I usually have a problem with earphones because my ears are very sesative. When I wear senso's earphones I don't ever feel them which is great. Would recommend them to anyone. One more thing, it does cancel noise and the songs I play sound great."
1,"Love them. Great sound, they stay put and tune everything else out. My 6 year old wears them for her little dance parties and they stay put!"
1,"Haven't had them long but so far so good! Connect easily to my phones bluetooth, fit well in my ears, and are working perfectly!"
1,"Had to get a second pair after the first ones proved such a success, good quality pair of headphones."
1,Good earplugs
1,i have never used any wireless head phones and these are just what the doctor ordered. They sound great and am able to take calls using these and am happy with the results.
1,"Connects easily, great sound, easy to control"
1,"These are really good headphones!! I am throughly enjoying them. However, the charge doesnt last as long as I would like. Still a great buy."
0,I used these for running all time and they were great for that. I used to have otium but my wife wanted them so I gave them to her and wanted to try something different so got these and the quality of these are better then the otiums but my wifes earbuds still work 3 years after buying then and my do not after almost 2 years of use.
1,"great product, was given as a gift and they loved it"
1,"The over-ear holders are super floppy...sometimes making it slightly difficult to get over your ear.<br />I don't know how it will handle if you go running...I just use it at the gym on the machines cycling/stair/elliptical machines.<br />Pairs up timely for phone calls, but sometimes takes a minute or two longer to pair up for media audio."
1,"These are great headphones.  I have not used them heavily, but they appear to be sturdy.  The controls take some getting used to, but I am sure that is a function of my inexperience in using Bluetooth headphones."
1,Awesome product.
1,"The biggest pro of using this product is that it's wireless. Also, it has buttons on it which I can press to pause videos/songs and so I can be handsfree and don't need to reach my phone to perform those actions. The only con I felt after using this for over 4 months is that the noise suppression is very bad. Whenever I am on a voice/video call, the recipient of the call is always disturbed by the noises around me which they can hear even clearly than my own voice."
1,Best headphones ever!!! Great quality for the price
1,"These are great, simply. Compared to other wireless headphones I've used these are at the top of my list. The wire connecting them is perfect. I mainly use them for yoga and when I mow yards and i love how if i have to take one or both out that they just stay around my neck"
0,Well once again I learned you get what you pay for. The bluetooth keeps disconecting constantly. I had read that in other reviews but thought I would be better. So its not. And if you use them with something loud like a Lawn mower the engine interferes with the bluetooth as well. I have more expensive ones that work all the time but i wanted a cheaper pair for yard work. They don't work so good.
1,Can't believe the price Sound like $300 pair
1,I've used these once so far on a 4 mile run but they worked great. They didn't bounce around or come loose and the small connecting cable on the back of my neck didn't noticeably bounce around and irritate me. The sound quality and volume is pretty good. I only say that because one or two songs sounded a tad off when compared to iPhone provided earphones but not so much that it was a distraction. I'm enjoying them so far and the price was great.
1,"Good sound, pairs well with my phone but will not pair with my iPad for some reson"
0,"After a few months , there is connection to Bluetooth problems...."
1,It’s been 2 years and they are still going. What more can I say. They have a great sound. The ear puffs get hard after a while but you can always buy new ones.
1,"After a few weeks of use, the headphones repeatedly disconnected and reconnected to my phone, annoyingly interrupting whatever I'm listening to or whatever phone conversation I'm having.<br />----Update------<br />Quick conversation with customer service revealed only a factory reset was necessary. After following the directions they provided, things are back up and running.<br />There is a small background hiss during idle, which is my only complaint about the headphones generally. Otherwise, very pleased for the price."
0,"Unfortunately they are cheaply made, the cable on one side broke briefly after purchasing. Wouldn't recommend this."
1,"These earbuds work really well.  I can conveniently listen to music or (more often) to podcasts while on the treadmill or exercise bike. Just what I wanted.  Quality is excellent.  I am sure some may be better, but for the price these are great."
0,"Loved these headphones until the power button broke and is stuck inside the body of the ear piece, rendering them unusable. Not sure how it happened they were in my pocket during work.  Of course it's just past the return period through Amazon."
1,"Only had for a few days, but so far, so good!"
1,I love the earphone. Sound is wonderful.
1,I love these earphones.  An amazing value!!  Two thumbs up for SENSO!!!!
1,"I bought these after losing a much more expensive/popular pair, and I honestly believe these have slightly better sound quality at a fraction of the cost.  The over the ear clips are very soft and pliable so they are quite comfortable, and they hold in the earbuds very well."
1,Easy to set up and they work GREAT!  I'm also very happy to see a 1-year warranty.
1,"These headphones are the BEST that I have owned.  Gone through 5 pairs now and these by far are the best. They fit in my ear nicely, the arm behind the ear is NOT annoying and they cancel out all the other noise and music at the gym. The sound is awesome! Thoroughly pleased!"
1,These are great!  Used them with my new Apple watch at the gym and they worked very well.  Would recommend them.
1,"I love them!!!!! They are very comfortable to wear, they don't move, the sound is very clear and the battery last a long time. I wear them when I mow the lawn and we have a large property to mow and it takes me 4 hours and the headphones held up.<br /><br />I am very happy with this product. I bought a pair for my sister and would definitely buy again and recomend for somebody else."
1,Pros<br />Great Battery life<br />Great sound<br />Easy to pair<br />Easy to fit in ears<br /><br />Cons<br />none
1,I love it! The carry case makes it special!
1,"So far so good.  I tried out some beats headphones and didn't like them.  I purchased these after doing some research.  I like them.  I love the 1 year warranty!  Great sound but it's a little bassy.  Maybe I can adjust it from my phone.  But either way, great product!"
1,Back ground noise
1,"work great,sound awesome!"
1,Very nice sound and stays firmly in place when runnning
1,"Love these! Sound quality is great, and material is lightweight. Cannot beat this quality for the price point they're offered at. Added benefit is that they can connect to multiple devices at the same time, perfect for smart watches."
0,"The headphones themselves seem of nice enough quality and come with a nice assortment of accessories. They are also comfortable. The problem though lies with heaphones primary job - playing great sounding music.  Yes, they'll play music but they are far from great sounding.  The main problem lies in the bass - boomy AND muddy or non-existant. The mids and highs are just ok. I tried each of the 4 setts of ear pieces and while there was a marked difference among them all none sounded as good as my cheaper (and discontinued) bluetooth headset that sadly died after a couple years of use.<br /><br />I'll probably order another brand and send back whichever of the two sounds worse. I suspect it will be this set as the bass issue is nearly unacceptable. I'm listening to pop/rock. I can't imagine how bad they'd sound with really bass heavy music."
1,For the price the get the job done. What I don't like is that when I have my phone in my pocket the sound will break up and once I pull the phone out of my pocket everything is fine again. I bought these because I need some ear bugs that I can you when I ride my bike. The microphone feature is nice for conversations and the quality is not bad either. If you make a not model of ear buds. I would say work on the distance with the Bluetooth connectivity.
1,Some of the best headphones I've ever owned!
1,"Customer Service: 5 Stars<br />Headphones: 5 Stars for Music, 3 Stars for Talk<br />Included bonuses:<br />Car Charger: 5 Stars<br />Charging cord (converts into either micro-usb or apple): 5 Stars<br /><br />DETAILS:<br />I bought this back in March 2017 primarily for music. These have pretty decent bass quality when using both sides of the headphones with the right size buds. In July, the left side decided to stop working. I called Customer service and they tried helping me reset, then when that didn't work, they told me they'd replace it. That was around 10pm Thursday night. I got the new headphones free Saturday. TWO DAYS!! Talk about good service! In addition, I didn't have to wait on the phone, and the conversation was maybe 10 minutes tops because of problems on my end. If it wasn't for that, it could've easily been 5 minutes or less.<br /><br />The new headphones have some improvements over the old ones. Firstly, they come with a new type of foam earbud in addition to their previous rubber-like ones. These buds are superior in comfort and sound cancellation.<br />Secondly, the batteries supposedly last longer and charge quicker, however, I have not tested that as of this review. EDIT: The charge time is still 2 hours. I have not noticed longer battery time.<br /><br />Does it work as advertised?<br />Well, the old ones advertised 7 hours play time and 1-2 hours charge time. They actually lasted about 7 hours and charged for 2 hours. The charge time was long, but it was nice that they lasted as long as advertised.<br /><br />Range: Moderate quality. Both my coworker and I have these. Your quality of range will depend on the source of the music (presumably your phone). Different phones have different generations of bluetooth and will offer differences in range. We have tested a few different phones and ranges. I can go anywhere in my two-bedroom apartment with doors closed and be fine. I can go a decent distance in open area with nothing blocking the line of sight. Overall, I was impressed as I wasn't expecting quite so much range on these.<br /><br />Other Pros: The volume/skip buttons are very easy to find and use, as is the power button.<br />Sweat really doesn't seem to bother them.<br />They stay in without issue in all sorts of activities.<br /><br />Cons: These advertise for music, and they're great for that, but if you use them for talking on the phone, I'd only give this product 3 stars. I can hear with amazing sound and clarity anyone on the other side, depending only on their connection. HOWEVER, they cannot hear me as well. The mic is very soft and somewhat muffled. This does not defer based on your source.<br />Another minor issue is the blue &#34;connected&#34; LED light that flashes every couple seconds. In the dark, especially if you use headphones while driving, this has the potential to be distracting.<br />In addition, the first pair did fail on me. Of course, it was replaced quickly without issues.<br /><br />In Summary,<br />These are great bluetooth headphones for music with good quality and a reasonable price tag, however, I would not recommend these to use primarily for phone conversations."
1,"Used for walking and watching streaming TV, have been excellent for both."
1,"Sturdy and moisture resisitant , comfortable for use during fast paced activity"
1,"Excelente product, highly recommended"
1,"Great sound, easy to connect to my iPhone and comfortable to wear at a great price point. Buy these, you won't be missing anything but money with higher priced ones!"
1,"Good Product, Comfortable, works well, easy to set up, nice packaging.  Not the best product... but it is the BEST for what they offer.  highly recommend!"
1,Great quality. Sounds great and very comfortable and affordable
1,Very pleased.  Battery life seems longer than my Bose headphones
1,Good headphones with nice bluetooth distance range. The sound is pretty good and they are comfortable. Easy to use too.
1,"I’m now on my third pair. - I use these all day long, from my long daily bike rides to my long walks to around the house when I don’t want to disturb my housemate.  They hold up to abuse — sweat, rain, whatever. And the controls are intuitive. I see people with expensive earbuds and such and I just don’t get it.  I find the wire is an advantage - it’s not in the way and it allows me to keep them together to prevent loss and to pull them off and keep them around my neck without fear of loss.  Still don’t get why people pay a fortune for those other silly things."
1,"I use these headphones while working out and I love them! Sound quality is great, battery life is amazing, what was even better was the price. These headphones work greay compared to other high end wireless headphones I’ve tried previously. High quality for a great price!"
1,I've used them for two days nonstop in the gym and other outdoors activities and so far so good.<br />If you are not bothered by the wire in the back (with i completely forget after a couple of minutes)<br />this are the headphones for you i guess<br />they fullfilled my expectations.<br />Good Job SENSO!
1,We. It's ghibk that the Earbuds are fabulous.  I alwYs wanted something to hang on my ear.  My wife even went downstairs and. Ouldhear everything load an clear.
1,"Excellent fit, stay in place during gardening and running. haven't tried the microphone yet but that isn't a priority for my needs. Great sound quality, too!"
1,So far so good. Working as expected with great sound quality.
1,Fantastic product!!! Everyone should buy.. better than my bose
1,"Great headphones. Can’t beat the price. Easy connectability with iPhones. Sound quality is good. Fit snugly around ears. Not as secure as my Jaybird Bluetooth earbuds, but they get the job done. Highly recommend"
1,"So far I am pleased with these SENSO headphones.  I have very small ears and have a difficult time finding earbuds that work for me.  These fit securely and comfortably.  Fantastic!  Having the option of different sized earbuds is great!  The sound quality is quite good.  They are comfortable and extremely lighweight.  The headphones came charged and ready to use.  Only negatives are: 1) Callers hear background noise. 2) USB port on the device is supposed to have a tab to pull it open.  It's just a nub, so I had to work on it with my fingernails for quite a while to get it open.  It seems a little easier to open as I use it.  3) I like to wear a headset around the house and not have to have my phone on me.  When I do this I notice that if I go in another room the connection is spotty.  If you are wearing it for working out and your cell phone is on you then there is no problem."
1,Good for listening to music
1,"I purchased mine based on the Amazon reviews. Everything looked good.<br /><br />However the one I received had an issue. I sent the seller an email and  I got a reply back in less than an hour. They certainly wanted to help and provided a suggestion on how to resolve the problem. The next day I tried, and it didn't work.<br /><br />Sent another email, and again, less than an hour for a reply. They let me know another was on its way.  In a few days I had a new working unit.<br /><br />So it's great when the product works, but I think it says a lot more when the seller is so invested in making things right. 6 Stars."
1,Just received the ear buds and so far so good.sound quialty is very good for the price.
1,"Excellent for the money. Quality is good. Only thing I can say is, the cord could be thicker made. Just seems too thin but the sound is decent. Would definitely recommend to anyone"
1,I love the headphones!!!!
1,This product far exceeded my expectations. Incredible sound quality and comfort.
1,Great Headphones. No issues connecting. Sound is clear and clean. Came with a handy kit with spares and different sizes. My only issue; if I leave the device away from me while I'm a home it works perfectly. But when I'm out and it's in my pocket the sound gets choppy and I end up having to hold it in my hand to keep the sound clear.
1,"Good sound quality, but the bendable arms that hold the earbuds in place aren’t stuff enough to do the job. They bend too easily. Unfortunately I figured this out after the return window closed."
1,Bueno
1,I've had about 10 different pairs/brands so far and these SENSO headphones will clearly be my favorite. I highly recommend them.
1,"I just received my headphones.  I can't report to how they will hold up over time, but so far am very happy with them.  They fit well and stay put even when on the treadmill.  They are comfortable and have good sound.  I also love the mic included so I can answer calls if needed.  My husband and I tested them for distance and we were both impressed.  I also love that they tell you they are on, connected or off."
0,"These buds are fine when they work which is 80% of the time.  I am using them with a Pixel 2 to listen to audible books while walking, about 1 hour 40 minutes per day.  I can use them for three days like this on a charge.  Sometimes they disconnect from the phones Bluetooth for no apparent reason.  Recently it took me 30 minutes to get them re-connected.  Often the sound is ""pixelated"" and you miss about 30% of the content.  I cannot wear the cord around the back of my neck or the pixelation of sound is terrible.  This means I get to wear it like a chinstrap, looking like an idiot.  sometimes you can start and stop play from the button on the buds and sometimes not.  They are janky to say the least."
1,"These are great headphones! They are comfortable, fit well and stay in place through all types of workouts. The sound is great too.  These are really worth the price and are better than some higher priced earphones I tried out. I highly recommend them"
1,Great headphones. highly recommend
1,"I admit I bought these based on reviews here, and though I am satisfied with them, for what I paid, I have to say they are about what I expected. I have a very similar pair by another manufacturer, but I expect these are identical, just sport a different logo.<br /><br />They play sound nicely, fit pretty well, stay in place, and the charge seems to last a good while. But someone explain please how they can label these &#34;noise cancelling&#34;? I can hear everything around me. I suppose if you jam them into your inner ear canal and blast the volume to 1,000, they might drown out the awful music my gym plays. But otherwise, no.<br /><br />That being said, I don't regret buying them."
1,I really like the SENSO Bluetooth headphones. I bought a pair on Amazon Prime Day two years ago and was very pleased with the quality an price. My family was so jealous of them that I decided to get them all a pair for Christmas. I bought four for Christmas two years ago and I just got my 11 years old grandson a pair for his Easter basket. Everyone is very happy with the headphones.
1,Best for the price. Buy these.
1,Muddy sounding...have to use equalizer to balance the mud and bass
1,"I bought these for my girlfriend so should could have tunes when she's running without a long cord. They were simple to charge and connect to the phone. Best of all, she loved them. She switched out the ear buds to the small size and ran right out the door and came back very happy. Obviously, this made me happy too. They were super affordable too. I might have to get myself a pair."
0,"Very uncomfortable.  When I have pandora on and am listening to music, it sends all my phone calls to voice mail!"
1,Work great! Stays in the ear when run for a long time. Battery lasts a long time.
1,Senso are great headphones and definitely noise blocking.  They fit comfortably and great for working out.
1,I’ve had these for a while now and they still work amazingly. The battery lasts for a long time if you don’t over charge it every single day. They’re very comfortable. I would recommend everyone get these headphones they’re dope af!
1,"I bought it for around $20 . The sound is excellent for the price, the bass is very powerful but with no expense for the mid and high range. I use the headphones in the gym and I love the flat cable because it doesn't hinder your movement in the gym and also doesn't tangle. The headphones are sweat proof and the pairing with my iphone works 99% of the time.  I also got a pair of Mpow for almost the same price , however Senso has much better quality sound."
1,Im happy with these they work great and keep me listen to music and every thing else that comes throw.
1,Amazing headphones. They stay in the ear very well and have amazing quality sound.
1,"They work really well.  Love them.  When they wear out (my line of work is pretty hard on them), I come back to buy these again."
1,Pretty good with a low range of distance between the phone an it but anything else is perfect
1,Very happy with the headphones and very happy with the Senso company. The headphones do everything I need them to do. Senso has made a great product and made it affordable. They have also gone out of their way to make sure I had a pleasant buying experience.
0,Won't hold charge anymore. Stayed on for 1 minute then turns off. Didn't even use them for that long.
0,There is no way to answer your phone and you can not change songs with these. I wouldn’t have bought them if I knew that.
0,"I paid full price for these headphones. These are good quality and the customer service is excellent. The phones came in a great package, with nice extras (3 sets of ear tips, a nice case to keep them in, a very short USB charger cable, a dual port car charger and a 3' lightning charger that sadly, does not work on the headphones.) All for $37. Why did I only rate them 3 stars? Because I was looking for waterproof headphones that I could swim with. Sadly, these did not fit the bill. I feel like there was a little bit of misleading advertising; the explanation I received from the vendor was,&#34; ...these have been tested by being submerged for a short period of time. Although they have a IPX7 waterproof rating, we do not recommend you submerge them.&#34; Sweatproof? Sure. Good in rain? Probably. Work in the pool? Nope. Sadly, they have to go back.When Invotek make a truly waterproof set of headphones, I'll be the first in line.<br /><br />Edited 5-26-17: I changed to 1 star because of Senso's condescending and patronizing response. I do not feel that I should have to learn international waterproof designations when deciding on a pair of headphones. They either are usable in water (i.e., waterproof) or they aren't. Senso's advertising is misleading, as they don't tell you anywhere in their advertisement (and believe me, I looked) that IPX7 means you can't submerge them."
1,These are great and the sound is awesome couldn't believe how great the sound was on these!!!! Best earbuds for the price
1,"Nice piece, just the one in my right ear doesn't stay in, the wire around the ear is very flimsy just on that one.  probably just a mistake with this one, but i don't know"
1,"Great headphones at a great price. Only thing negative is when it needs recharged a voice states ""battery low"" then in one minute it turns off.  No bueno if you are already at the gym or out running."
0,broke down really quick...will not charge or work period
1,"Great...for about 2 months...then they don't hold a charge anymore.  During a run they will just &#34;beep&#34; and die.<br />Once when I manually shut them off when they were cutting off, it said in slow speech &#34;pow---wer offffff&#34; (because of low battery)<br />So, after 2 months, the service options are over...you I now have headphones that are truly disposable.<br />I want another pair...if they'd even last 6 months I'd just buy another pair...but 2 months?  that sucks."
1,Surprised by the quality and functionality these headphones offers!
1,I only had for a few days but shipping was fast and senso was very involved in the purchase. They emailed me to make sure all was ok and how my purchase was. I recommend the product as of now due to only using for a few days. They are well worth the money and I was happy to order from senso. I would order from them again with no question.<br />Update haven't used for a while but won't charge didn't use very much. Probably wouldn't buy again because they didn't last.
1,Awesome!!!  work perfectly and with the 3 different sized buds the fit was very comfortable.
1,"The customer service really cares about their product and that the customer is 100% satisfied.  A real rarity in today's business jungle.  Thank you customer service.  The ear buds sound, feel and work great."
1,Good product
1,Good
1,"I have only used these headphones for a couple of weeks, but they are pretty good for short periods of time. I use the smallest size buds and they still hurt my ears after only an hour."
1,Exellent goods!
1,"Excellent noise cancelling headphones! Love that they stay comfortably in place while I'm working out or doing chores around the house. Also, the handfree Bluetooth capability makes taking phone calls effortless and I don't have to stop in the middle of a task in order to take the call.<br />Best wireless/Bluetooth earphones ever!"
0,"Great for the gym, not so great for bike riding wind noise interferes with sound. not good for use while working with lawnmower or string trimmer."
0,"I LOVED these at first.  The fit comfortably, sounded great and worked when my phone was a LONG way from it.  But after about 6 months, they would sound like a skipping CD with my apple watch.  Now it does it with my phone.  Great if you only need them to work for a short while."
1,I was looking for some new headphones but wanted wireless with a long receiving so I can walk away from my phone.<br />Found these and tried them out and loved them instantly.<br />But a couple of weeks later and my new puppy found them and chewed them up.<br />So I just ordered another pair and they are awesome
1,"Wired headphones tend to get pulled out of my ears when I jump rope or run hard, that's why I bought these. They are comfortable! They've not fallen out and have worked through intense sweat, while the Trumoto Trufusion's I had did not. The costumer service was extremely friendly and sent an email checkup after shipping to ensure that I was satisfied in full with their product. Nice Product!"
1,Very good sound
1,Worth the price. Does not fall off while exercising.
1,Can't tell you About durability or they would be a five star but I actually can lower the volume they get too loud.<br />I haven't had one set ever that would get loud enough<br />Great sound too
1,Great battery life.
1,"Love them. Great sound. Bass is good too, not tinny like some other similar headphones in the similar price range."
0,"This does not work well with Mac. Every time it drops the connection. Even if it is connected, the sound does not come to it but it does show up as connected to mac."
1,"Pretty good sound... I was surprised! hey wrap around the ear well and the buds sit well in the ear also even when you get sweaty, from the gym of course.  They paired in a matter of minutes and I was ready to go right out of the box! The only reason I did not give it a 5 star is that at times the volume goes up and I didn't touch the volume button. My Bose never did that, but overall great headphones!"
0,I used to love this brand! This pair doesn’t charge
1,"As a boxer, runner, OCR competitor, and weight lifter, I have used these headphones for all of my activities. The sound quality is fantastic. They are waterproof. They stay in your ears no matter what. BEATS KILLERS"
0,"The concept is great, but the sound quality leaves a lot to be desired.. I would have enjoyed them as the fit is great and comes with varies sizes to ensure a good fit. I am returning to get something a bit better. Save your money,  spend a bit more for better sound quality."
0,"the description appears to be a little misleading:&#34; SENSO Bluetooth Headphones, Best Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7 Waterproof HD Stereo Sweatproof Earbuds for Gym Running Workout 8 Hour Battery Noise Cancelling Headsets<br />Sold by: Invotek&#34;<br />I put in two inches of water then they stopped working. so disappointed."
1,Love these!! I use them all the time when I work out. The sound is wonderful! I was impressed with all the accessories that they came with. I did have an issue with the headphones where the charging light wouldn't turn off and it would drain the battery. I contacted the company and they gave me a couple suggestions for troubleshooting the issue. When that didn't solve my problem they sent me a new pair no questions asked!  Very satisfied customer!
1,"A great price when I bought them for my boyfeiend for Christmas. He said a 4/5 for usage because &#34;sometimes when you turn them on and connect via bluetooth, the music won't play so I will have to power the headphones back off and on.&#34; He uses them when working out in thw gym and he really wanted cordless headphones that were great with noise cancellation- he rates the noise cancellation as 4.5/5."
1,"bluetooth headphones that sound great and work while i'm across the house from the device it's synced with? All for the $36 i paid for them?!?! Psshhh, killer deal! So glad i bought these!"
0,I had troubles keeping these to connect to my phone.  Last night they died.  Didn't last me 6 months.  Really disappointed..
0,Didn't even last 4 months
1,"Worked great at the beginning, but now after a few months loses signal easier and has a hard time connecting"
1,"Thank you for the email, I'm impressed that you took the time . Most companies wouldn't and that says a lot.<br /> Yes! I love them so far and I'm really surprised how good the sound quality is , for the economic price! They are very comfortable. Thank you for a product that does what it says, all at a great price!"
1,"Awesome wireless headphones.  Came with additional accessories case, cables and extra ear tips. The sound is great and they are comfortable to wear."
0,I only have it for 3 months. Now is defected ( a lot noise in most of time). I have to buy a new one in other brand.
1,"Wonderful wireless headphones. Love everything about senso bluetooth head phones.They are exactly as advertised.Great  and clear sound,noise cancellation is a plus.stick so well on the ears no need to keep adjusting."
0,I have had these less than a month and they will no longer pair.
1,"For the price can't beat the value, you get hard case car power outlet adapter charging cable small, medium, and large ear adapters. The sound is very good too."
1,Love these. Lightweight and fits great
0,The part that wraps around your ears are extremely flimsy.
1,"So far so good. I've used them twice to do one hour + workouts at the fitness center. Very nice sound, a lot better than my apple earphones. Paired easily with my iPhone6. No luck pairing with with my iWatch yet."
1,These head phones sound good and they stayed in place during my workout.
0,"I""m no audiophile and It's hard to overstate how cheap these sound. If sound quality is of ANY importance to you, avoid these. I'm not sure why these are well reviewed at all, this is the first product from Amazon I've literally thrown away 10 minutes after use, the sound quality really is that bad, trust that."
1,Awesome sound
1,some of the nicest earbuds to date
1,"Good product, easy to use and good sound quality. I would purchase again."
0,"Pros: Easy pairing process. Good fit, finish, and comparative light compared to other wireless earbuds.<br /><br />Cons: The range has become unreliable and spotty over time. Especially when connected to an Iwatch.<br /><br />Bottom line: Good for about two months but not much longer in my experience."
1,I received these earphones the other day and have used them some the sound is great volume are really loud and crisp. The battery life seems to be on par with what they advertise. Well worth the price and their CS seems willing to help if any problem a rises. Pus they have a year warranty.
1,Sounds great. Range is 20 feet with no obstacles.
1,Pleasantly surprised by these headphones. And they come with so many little things in the box! Will definitely recommend. Sound with my iPod is amazing. And they are noise cancelling. Can't hear anything once they are on my ears
1,I really love these. Small and convienent with excellent sound quality. For $30?  You can't go wrong!
1,Quick delivery and synced up easy. I'll test them out later this week. Hoping they work well. I have tried a few different headphones with not much luck.  Thanks!
1,"Great sound, fit very well, never fall out! Easy to use and the case is easy to carry in your purse. Even has a charging cord with two heads. I didn't expect a car charger, but there is one along with a plain charging cord also included. Great value and great product."
1,They worked
1,"I had recently returned a set of wireless headphones from another company because the sound quality was so poor and they wouldn't stay in place with the slightest movement. I opened these senso wireless headphones last night, charged them up and tried them. The sound was great and they were so comfortable. They stayed in place even when I tried to shake them loose. Very pleased. Thank you."
1,"I like to listen to audiobooks while I’m doing yard work, doing housework, or cooking.  As wireless “ears” became available, I was so excited that I would no longer have to have my iPhone tethered to the phone jack. Well, easier said than done! I have small ears on a small head so the buds would fall out when I bent over with the “necklace”style, the ones with “ear prongs” either didn’t fit or hurt my ears, I have no interest in full headphones as they are bulky & the headbands tend to flop forward or backwards as I move around.  These SENSO earbuds are perfect!  The earbuds stay in place, the sound quality is excellent, the instructions are clear, concise, and complete, & the connecting cord is flat and sturdy.  They charge quickly and they really DO have 8 hours of juice. I also didn’t have to mortgage the dog to afford them, which is another plus.  Great job, SENSO!"
1,"The base surprised me, in a good way. Great sounding headphones. Can't beat the price."
0,"These earbuds stopped working after a few weeks.  They turn on, announce that they are connected, and the button controls play and pause.  However, the sound continues to come from the iPhone, not through the earbuds.  My other earbuds (Taotronics) and my headphones (Jabra) work perfectly, and so the problem is clearly with the Senso earbuds."
1,"There great,  sound good. But.... they don’t fit right around my ear... too high"
1,These work well for me
0,Finally decided to give up on these headphones.  Unless you are indoors and seated with your phone out of your pocket-- you will not get a good connection.<br />While working outdoors with the paired phone in my back pocket-- bend over to pick something up-- lost the signal and sounds like a distorted call.  Leave it out of the pocket and bend over--same thing.<br />I'll be going to Costco to buy a replacement for these that I can truly count on-- done with this brand and done buying cheap junk from Amazon.
1,"5/10 you get what you pay for,  crappy sound, would not buy again, only the foam tips fit my ears for running, the other 3 pairs fell out all the time to the point where they became unusable, so don't lose the foam ones !!!!!! i did:("
1,Great battery life and sound
1,"Could not be any happier.  Easy to use, sound quality is excellent, the price is right and the headphones are reliable.  Much better than the ones I have collected over the years.<br /><br />I do have one question.  The enclosed ear pads include 3 sets of black ones and one set of red ones.  I do not get a good fit with the black ones but the red ones are perfect.  I believe they mold themselves to the shape of my ear.  Is there any chance I could purchase 4 more sets of red ear pads to keep as backups?<br /><br />Thank you agin for a great product.<br /><br />Larry Kamin"
1,I am very happy with this well-made product.  Easy to pair with my smart phone and tablet.  It is everything I wanted.
1,Working great!
1,"This is my second one and the quality is very good, I recommend to buy this item"
0,spotty connection and not very clear audio quality particularly when connected to my laptop<br /><br />update: it has only gotten worse and now they keep disconnecting constantly. it's hella annoying and they're basically useless now
1,"These are great wireless ear buds -- great sound, range, controls, etc. -- BUT, they only last 3-4 months and then something goes wrong. I am on pair 3 or 4, and all of a sudden they won't charge anymore. BOTHER. Last time it was something else -- can't even remember. So, three (or four) strikes and you're out. I will have to try another brand.<br /><br />UPDATE: I just spoke with Senso customer support, and they are sending me replacement sets. Very impressed with my phone experience with them. I will update my review when the replacements are received."
1,"Easy to set up and use. I charged the headset for 2 hours the first time and after 10 days, it is still going strong. I use it about 30-45 min each day."
1,"I really like the product. I had never had wireless headphones before, so I wasn't sure what I was getting. I like how the over the ear part can be formed to fit tightly. I'd recommend to anyone who is looking to go with these. Great product for the price."
1,The are one of the best earbuds that are reasonably priced. They easily pair with my iPhone and have great battery duration. Sound quality is very good. I lost my first pair and I quickly ordered another set. Highly recommend!
1,"I know these look like knock-off Beats by Dre, but I don't care.  They're cheap as hell and work great."
1,Third pair of these I have ordered. Work great. Nice bass sound. Last around 8 hours as said. Can’t beat these for the price!
1,"Very good sound,  the fits are good on ear, on head very comfortable with no snagging with the connecting cables with head turning side to side.  Volume is great.  Would recommend for the price and the accessories make these head phones a great deal."
1,"For the price these wireless headphones are fantastic. I've tried EVERY single brand under $30 and these are the best. You can tell just by feeling these ear buds the quality is much higher then other cheap brands. The sound quality and noise cancelation is also considerably better. I would buy these ear buds before any other brand under $50 no doubt about it. Also BONUS they include a magnetic car vent mounted cell phone holder in the box! Works great! Those sell for $15 alone! Buy these ear buds people, dont waste your money on other brands."
1,"update: as of may 5th 2019<br />unit has started shorting, similar to a speaker going bad. overall the unit has worked very well. now i am just wondering whether one year is the life span of it.<br /><br />I love this bluetooth device."
1,"My husband LOVES it!! So glad I bought two (it was by accident), one for driving as well as for workout time.<br /><br />Comes in clear and seems to have great outside noise blocking. SO very light and comfortable!!"
1,Good set of headphones.  Fit a little loosely on my ears.
1,Great headphones!!! Sound strength and quality are excellent; noise cancellation is quite decent too.
1,Both the packaging and the headphones are very impressive. The packaging looks very professional and the headphones sound better than anything I have heard in a while. Well done Senso!
1,Works great! Very satisfied with both the product and customer service!!!
1,My husband runs marathons and adores these headphones.
1,Awsome product
1,It is my first Bluetooth headphone. I used it at the gym and for my online yoga class. Terrific!!! I love it. The sound is clear and even in an inverted yoga position the earbuds stay in place. Great product.
1,"Great earbuds. Soft, yet will stay firmly in ears. Very good noise cancellation. Note the instructions to not leave them plugged in for protracted periods presumably to protect the battery."
1,Excellent seller. Buy with confidence.
0,"This is my 3rd set of Senso, honestly they’re just okay, nothing great but it does the job on a budget. I don’t think the sound is amazing but it’s not bad. They usually last me 9 months to a year with working out pretty often. This 3rd set I couldn’t even get the ear bud on to go smaller so just going to return."
1,"Purchased these for our grandson, and to date he has been very satisfied, especially for the price."
1,I owned and loved these headphones from Senso as of January 2017.  They operated flawlessly until I dropped them 4 days ago and they met a lawnmower.  That lawnmower was the only thing that stopped them from working in almost 2 years!<br /><br />I should have bought the 3 year accident protection plan!  I plan to replace them ASAP!!!!
1,"Great sound, I use the medium inserts and get great bass and highs. I wear then all day at work and am able to take calls and not stop working"
1,"Work really well and pair with everything that I own so far. The battery life is pretty good too, although I have not gone on any super longer to test the battery fully. The price is right and the extra charger and cable are a nice bonus. The buds are nice and I'm getting the size dialed in."
1,"Curretnly have Jbl wireless headphones which cost me $120.00 i needed a second set so decided to to try something cheaper i seen the reviews on senso and gave them a try. The packaging was nice, easy to set up, sound quality was comparable to jbl but best part was when i put my cell phone in my backpack the headphones still was able to pick up on the bluetooth. The jbl cuts me off."
1,"My boyfriend and I love these headphones. They're very good quality and do not fall while running, biking or skating."
1,"Not bad for the price, but the sound is glitchy."
1,"Ive been using the headphones for about 3 weeks, Sound is good, no issues getting connected to my phone. Battery life could he longer, but overall excellent value."
1,"I am pleasantly surprised at the quality of this product. I have run twice now with these. The sound quality is really good, and they stay in place while I run."
1,These headphones fit really tight in the ear as to create a sound vacuum.  Audio quality depends on how piece fits in ear.  if it doesnt fit right sounds like underwater.  If i had to buy again id spend at least $50 for something like this.
1,Good sound ...
1,"Good sound, blocks everything else out, just find the right size ear buds and clean your ears first. Not uncomfortable and stay in place. Easy to sync and use."
1,Inexpensive but poor sound quality.
1,"Love these... they are a bit heavy in my ears and sometimes when I adjust, I shut them off, because of the location of the on/ off button... Minor problems, overall they are wonderful, and the charging accessories were a nice surprise!"
1,Attaches well and looks much better than the tape I was using!
1,These work very well.  I use them to watch Netflix on my Kindle when I am in a situation where I have no wifi.  They make long waits quite bearable.
1,Amazing for the price!
1,"with 9000 reviews you don't need another glowing five star review to make you get this, but what the heck...here's my two cents, this is my first wireless sports headset and while I had some loose right ear problems (ear bud selection fixed that because it came with a bunch of them to see what works for the ear)<br /><br />I made it through a few gym workouts / walks / jogs / treadmill with full sound -- I keep it slightly higher than half for a full block out -- which is a huge step from the previous headset.<br /><br />I really like the foam grip ear thingys much better than solid plastic (which starts to hurt my ear after long use). The battery life is a solid 6-8 hours of use.<br /><br />Stop reading and give this a shot..."
1,"Opening the box they come nicely packaged with a nice case to keep them in. Very easy to pair with phone. They have great sound, they blow the ear buds that come with iPhone out of the water. Alot of bass for an earbud, wireless at that. Assuming they hold up (time will tell) I would highly recommend these, you won't be disappointed."
1,"awesome...so far has exceeded my expectations...lightweight, easy to pair & use"
0,"LOVED the fit and sound, but they suddenly stopped syncing with bluetooth, even though the voice said ""you are connected.""  Have to return them..........."
1,Finally found a pair of wireless headphones that sound great and stay in my ear at an affordable price.
0,I was looking forward to receiving this item as it got rave reviews.  Reviews were correct in that you get a lot of bonus accessories and the earpiece is soft and comfortable.  The reason I am giving this item 2 stars is because I can't carrying on a conversation with this headset.  Everyone I've tried talking to while wearing this headset says they can hear themselves speaking.  The feedback is horrible. I had to turnoff the headset to talk to them.
1,"I bought these to wear while motorcycling. I normally wear earplugs while riding, and wanted a set of headphones that can act as earplugs and headphones. These work pretty well. They provide four sets of earpieces, and I was able to find one that works well for me. The Bluetooth connection worked perfectly. It also came with an iPhone cable that can charge either my iPhone or the headphones - I wasn't expecting that!<br /><br />They work OK on the motorcycle. The wind hits the earpieces a little hard, so its not perfect. That's a lot to ask for a set of earbuds though. Luckily, its very easy to adjust the volume on the headphones itself, even with gloves on."
1,"Bought these for my husband for when he runs.  He loves them.  The sound is great. They come with a case, charging cord, different size ear buds and adapters.  I just ordered a pair for myself!"
1,"I'm really quite impressed with the headphones. The sound is nice, the noise cancellation is quite good. The only minor complaint I have (and it's very small) is that I wish the cord connecting the two headphones was an inch, maybe two, longer. I have a big head, doncha know. ;) (And even that probably isn't a real problem - it may just be the fact that I haven't used the cord enough for it to straighten out from when it was in the packaging.) Definitely a product worth purchasing."
1,One of the best recent purchases I have made. The ear buds work wonderfully and stay charged for a long time. Highly recommend this product!
1,Were a gift for my brother and he likes them. He uses them when he goes jogging.
1,"I've only had these a week but so far a love them!!! Very easy to use, Convenient, Good Sound, no mess of wires like regular plug in buds with a long cord. So far I have used these to mow the lawn, ride my bike, work out and I have no complaints! I also use them for making business calls and the voice sound is great on my end, very clear. No complaints from the people I'm talking to either!! I like them so much I may buy another pair for my girlfriend."
0,ok when it worked it was great then after a few weeks  doesnt turn on  it charges but doesnt turn on wast of money
1,Great headphones for a affordable price.
1,"Sound quality is good and it's easy to use. The downside I have is the over ear pieces and fitting. Now it comes with extra earbuds in attempt to fit all ears which is nice but if you press in more to secure them it can muffle the sound quality slightly. The over ear pieces and very rubbery. Don't really give support at all but they do stop them from completely falling off the ear if they buds come loose. Haven't had any connectivity issues and the battery life does pretty well. Plus it charges with a mini usb that most phones, aside from iPhones, use so it can be easy to find a place to plug it in."
1,All of the controls are in the earpiece so you don't have the control box dangling from one of the wires which often times  makes them unbalanced and pull to one side or the other.  Durable cable and fits snug in the ear with great bass.  i bought another for backup which I haven't had to open yet!  Battery lasts quite long as It hasn't run out on me while using them.
0,Headphones worked for one month and 4 days!  Main multifunction button stopped working 4 days after return date closed...window to return/replace wasnt available.  I guess you dont get what you dont pay for.  $30/month is a bit much.  Do not buy this headset.
1,"I'm very impressed with these headphones.  I wear them for my indoor workouts six days a week, alternating three days on elliptical and three days combo of elliptical and weight machines.  They are comfortable, the sound quality is the best I've heard from ear buds, they cancel most external noise, and they don't slip off.  I'm very happy and will be keeping these hopefully a long time!"
1,How to charge
1,"These were the highest rated “waterproof” ear buds.<br />Tremendous value!!!<br />However, having brought them to the pool...<br />They still worked after Getting wet, but you could barely hear them. Once they dried out they appear to be fine.<br /> Now that I know the imitation, they are great quality.<br /><br />PS: I broke the internal on one of the ear loop, through constant fiddling. My bad.<br /><br />I like them well enough to buy a second pair. I would recommend them."
0,"Speakers used to be clean and crisp. On par with wired headphones. Now it just sounds like a radio from the early 80s. (Or a children's walkie talkie.)<br /><br />When you buy the same model for over two years, one would expect the quality to improve, not decrease."
1,"Works like new after over a year of moderate usage! Battery life has held and water resistant features tested and passed many times over.<br />--Update--<br />After 2 years, they've finally died on me...battery no longer charges. I used to rotate them with another pair but for the the last 6 months or so they were used exclusively daily. Still very much impressed, just ordered a new pair!"
0,"Sorry had to return these, too uncomfortable, although they were otherwise nice"
1,"Excellent so far! Great sound and great packing. When you receive an e-mail by the company's owner just a few days after you buy his product, you have to give him a credit."
1,"I love these headphones and that they come with a carrier for when you’re not using them. I especially love the changeable buds —the red squishy one is my fav. The only problem I’ve had is the earphones coming off my ear or completely out while running. I’m really trying to find a solution, the tip is flexible so maybe they can be bent? I’m not sure but still worth 5 stars."
1,This is my second pair. I purchased this item last year and they still sound amazing to me. I then recently bought a second pair for my wife. She loves them.
0,These no longer charge!  Not even a year old!
1,"I'm really impressed with the sound of these WATERPROOF headphones. I've tried several $100 + bluetooth earbuds and returned them because of the audio quality.  I was skeptical about these, but they are great so far. I hope the waterproof parts holds up to paddle boarding and kayaking. GREAT NEWS. THEY FLOAT!"
1,Very stable for an active lifestyle. Well priced. I seem to have 2 different sized ear canals & the variety of ear pads is useful. I would recommend them to someone that doesn't want to go crazy expensive. I saw these on someone's YouTube channel. They were recommended there but I am unable to recall which one. Old age I guess. Listening to Scorpions on MTV Unplugged right now.
1,fit  great and sounds good
1,Easy to use and so far reliable. Sound quality is better than I expected. I highly recommend for both music and for phone conversation. Using in gym with foam ear pieces.
1,Outstanding price/quality balance! Love them :)
1,Amazing company and amazing product. These headphones work great and the battery life is so good compared to similar style headphones of different brands but the most amazing part is definitely the customer service. After 5 months my headphones broke during an intensive cardio workout. I did not originally register my warranty bit did so once my headphones broke months later and they offered to send me a new pair no questions asked expect they just wanted a picture of the broken ones. That was easy enough and in 3 days I had my brand new pair. This is a great company that's stands behind there warranties.
1,"They are simply awesome!!!!<br />I waited few months before posting this review because everything that I have bought breaks within few months...<br />The sound is amazing ( better than beets by far!!!!) , they don’t loose power as fast as the beets and they also charge fast!<br />I’m very pleased with them!!!!;)👍🏻"
1,"Excellent sound for price, build quality is average."
1,They work well. I deducted a star because the loop over the ear is a bit large for my ears. That part appears to be nonadjustable.
1,I've been using the headphones for about two weeks now.  Still not sure if should return them. They feel like they are going to fall off whenever I'm running which makes me constantly have to push them in. I did burpees yesterday and they did fall out. I did have the smallest ear plugs on them and changed them to the biggest size which made it a little better but not a fan of the loop around the ears because I can't adjust it. For those reasons I might return it but other than that the sound quality is fine and so are the features.
1,They have great sound and are very comfortable to wear! I am very happy with these headsets!
1,The Senso Headphones I received are great. They were easy to set up and pair with my Note 9. I used them mainly when I go jogging in the morning. The sound is good and it is easy to operate. I really like it that the controls are located on the actual earpiece itself. I definitely recommend these!
0,NOT worth your money.  Sound quality is horrible.
1,The sound for me is not as impressive as higher priced ear buds but definitely worth the money.
1,Loved them
1,Beautiful sound and very comfortable!
1,Works well!!
1,Today I did a fast-walk for 4miles and all functions worked as promised.
1,"These are the best wireless earphones I own. Some of the others have poor volume intensity these do not. They have excellent sound reproduction throughout the entire range. I like them better than my Bose over the ear wireless. They're very comfortable to wear. I have used them around the house so I cannot comment on how they would be during a workout.  They were recommended by a friend who had them on a 5 hour flight.  I don't know how long the charge will last, haven't check that yet."
1,The wire keeps getting stuck on my ponytail and they don’t really fit in my ears. But they sound good
1,Amazing sound quality!  Love these earbuds!
1,"Sound quality is decent, they are a little bulky and uncomfortable but nothing unbearable. The charger they included did not fit in the charging port but luckily I had one that will fit."
1,"Best bluetooth ear buds or headphones I've ever had.  The over ear loops work for me since ear buds don't stick in my left ear, these stay on with very good audio quality."
1,Best ear buds quality is the best!
1,"Have used the headphones twice and already are far superior to previous ear buds / headphones I have used.  I have trouble with ear buds and typically favor an over the ear design, this product meshes both seamlessly and provides a true fit while running."
1,Works better than my Beats and allows me to fast-forward and rewind!
0,Terrible quality used them for a month and don't work anymore
1,Great quality product. Comes with everything you need and then some.
1,great sound easy set-up...these are very good bluetooth headphones for the price.
1,"I'm no audio expert--but definitely like these earbuds.  Sound quality is good, and the range is more than adequate--I wear in the office and have no problem leaving phone at my desk to walk to different points of the office without losing reception.  Great value!"
0,Do not stay in my ears when I jog. So they are pretty much useless to me at this point.
1,I LOVE these headphones. My first pair broke do to unforseen circumstances. Since the damages weren't covered under the warranty I was given a 10% off coupon to purchase a new set. I purchased them the same day and they work very well!!!
1,"Got this almost 2 years ago and it had worked well. Sounds nice, good battery life and a sufficient amount of ear pieces. I don't use it too much and I'm pretty gentle with all my headphones. However, right before hitting the 2 year mark, the wires started peeling off right where they connect to the buds on both sides. I've wrapped a tape around them for now until I find a new one, but it won't be another Senso, that's for sure."
0,Intend to return the earbuds-could not charge it after many attempts
1,Very good product at great price.
1,I love my senso earbuds. The sound is incredible. Not having wires in the way feels great. Ease of use is a big plus.
1,"The headphones sit so comfortable in the ear. I am not a hugh fan of ear buds but love these. Great sound for me but no else near me unlike headphones where sound can bleed through. Cute little case and the fact that it has a dual port car charger, 1 short charging cable and a 3' charging cable gives me options on recharging. can use on my trips with my cell phone hands free. Great price on a very nice set of headphones."
1,"Sound quality is very good, even though a little heavy on the bass to my taste. Battery life is excellent so far and I was surprised how quickly it charged. I didn't quite time it, but it must have been around 1.5 hours for a full charge. Play time is around 8 hours or more. The fit in my ear was a little loose on one side (weird ears?) but the headphone set comes with plenty of interchangeable rubber options for the earphone tips. It even came with a foam option that I found quite nice. It also came with a very nice dual-port USB car charger and a phone charging cable."
1,"Ok I can't say enough about these headphones. Awesome sound quality, solid 10 hour battery life, good volume, decent bass, I love the ear overlaps for working out, etc. Yes, the ear piece is flimsy and I have to adjust it after sweating a lot to hold it in tight, and the bass could be better, but honestly for this price ($30 when I bought them) you will not find better quality headphones."
1,Easy to use.  Paired with phone quickly.
1,Really liked them until it quit holding a charge. Wish I could get a replacement. They are only 6 months old.
1,"Pros: After 2 weeks of using this, I find that the sound is fantastic considering the relatively low price, it connects fast, and has more than 20 ft of range before the bluetooth disconnects.<br /><br />Con: Ear hooks are NOT plastic like other headphone with similar design. The hooks for these headphones are soft rubber, and often slip off of my ears when I run, especially when I sweat. You can imagine how annoying it is trying to put them back on while running on the treadmill."
0,"If you looking for headphones to where while running that will not constantly fall out of your ears, do not buy these headphones. These headphones are not secure and would not stay in my ears while I was running. I tried all of the different sized earbuds and adjusting the wire clip, but nothing worked."
1,Excellent product for a fair price
0,"Sounded good for 2 months and started to produce hissing sound on one side.  The hiss sound is getting louder, almost unusable now."
1,The sound is great.  Talked to my husband and he didn’t complain about the sound or anything he usually does if the voice quality is crappy. The one complaint I would have is that I did not receive the bonus items that said was suppose to be included.  But other than that I’m satisfied so far.
1,"Was very skeptical, but after reading the reviews I thought I'd give it a chance. I was impressed by the sound quality. Good product and I would recommend it."
1,"Comfort is excellent and the sound is good. The challenge I have is that I am experiencing signal distortion whenever my exercises (ex: leg stretches, phone in my pocket) put more of my physical body in the way of the direct signal line. For reference, I am about 6’1” and 200lbs. Once I straighten up, the signal strength restores and sound quality is great. Due to this experience, I am convinced that the published distance between device and headphones is drastically overstated.<br />I wish there was a way to send the signal from the headphones to the phone that would skip the song. Currently, I can stop/start the song and adjust volume, but must pull out my phone in order to skip the song.<br /><br />Update: the charge port overheated and melted the plastic frame. Now the charger cannot fit back in to continue charging."
1,Great
1,"Surprise surprise, you get what you pay for here, folks. If you think you're getting away with a top quality pair of headphones, then you're wrong. I directly juxtaposed these headphones with a pair of Ink'd Skullcandys (albeit wired ones) and found the Skullcandys to be much clearer. It sounds as if the Senso headphones have the higher frequencies (treble) attenuated, giving the headphones a muffled sound.<br /><br />Otherwise if you're not concerned with high-quality these are great headphones for the value, especially given the car charger and the carrying case.<br /><br />I will be returning these and will be content with my wired headphones for the time being."
0,"Not water proof. The noise cancellation interferes when you move your head around ! What's worse is that it cover falls easily which caused the volume rocker to be lost. Finally, the wire that goes into one of the buds became loose causin' it to be nonfunctional !!<br /><br />But I guest, what did I expect with this price ?"
1,work perfectly on both Iphone 5s and Macbook Pro
1,The headphone works just fine.
1,I love the noise canceling  feature
1,"I keep losing them and I keep reordering them... it's with it though,  I love these wireless headphones!!! 😘 great sound and clarity!!!!!"
1,I ordered after watching a review video comparing them to the beats product. The review was spot on! Excellent sounds without the price!!!
1,They are perfect for what I need! I might buy another set for my husband!
1,"Got this SENSO Bluetooth Wireless Headphones in 2 days, came with a nice round hard case.  According to the enclosed paper, I notice that everything is in the box except one item for putting the wire away?  But it is ok cos the important items are there.  Firstly it is so comfortable to wear them.  Secondly, I paired it with my Samsung S7 Active, the sound is very good, according to my friend who knows his sound.  The announcement &#34;Connection is on&#34; and &#34;Connection is off&#34; are very clear and in proper English (lol) that I understand.  When you get a call while listening to music, there is sound of charms and announcement of the phone number.  This is a great product at a reasonable price.  I sincerely hope it will last.  I have a question: &#34;how can you tell when the charge is so low that I need to charge it?&#34;  Do I have to wait until there is no sound?  Can SENSO give me an answer?"
1,"I just love everything about those earphones.<br />I interchangeably use Bose QC (latest), Sony MDX-1000, Apple AirPods, and those. I use mostly the SENSO. Controls same good as MDX-1000, stays in ears good. I changed to included red foam insert. Was doing same with my shure-500, but the sure is wired and I can’t use it anymore.<br />Bottom line - love love it"
1,"I love these headphones for working out or walking around the house.  This are so useful especially with an iphone so I can charge my phone and enjoy music/podcasting.  I can't wait to use these for traveling.  Some reviewers mentioned the headphones are too large;  I have a smaller head and these are perfect.  The part that wraps around the ears is totally customization, so these are perfect for any ears!  The sound quality is great, the extra accessories are great.  I would definitely recommend purchasing these."
1,Great quality comfortable fit. Would Absolutely recommend.
0,Cannot pick up blue tooth signal and pair with any mobile phone we own.<br /><br />Really a waste.  Disappointing.
1,Great product. Received quickly
1,Great sounding headphones for an unbelievable low price.
1,Very good product. Prime shipping took over a week . Baddddd
1,I've had several more expensive headphones before and I can honestly say that these are equal in quality and very affordable.
1,Love them! They are great to wear during a workout I even wore them when I handwashed my car today they didn't slip or anything! I highly recommend them! Sound is great too😃
1,"Amazing quality for the price. So happy with my purchase. Came with multiple ear tips, including a squeezable expanding foam tip, like with earplugs."
0,They didn’t last a year ☹️...the battery isn’t holding a charge..the sound was average.
0,"The sound quality and battery life was great! I grabbed these for work because i have to move around alot and its too easy for a headphone cord to get snagged. However this became a problem with these as well, it says 30 feet, but really it means 30 feet if angled the right direction. Besides leaving my phone(fully charged) on the table top while walking around the table I also tried leaving it in a hip pocket with the top poking out and I still got a choppy signal. Icant carry my phone in my hand while working, back to cords for me I guess."
1,"These headphones are well worth the amount paid.  They come with a car charger and a longer cord in addition to the short computer charging cord.  They hold their charge well and connect easily to my Iphone 7  The sound in the headphones is great, but, the only downside is that the people on the receiving end will say my voice is a bit fuzzy.  However, the sound they receive is a 100 percent better than the flash drive headphones that came with the Iphone 7. Oh yeah, in addition you will receive a very nice carrying case for the headset."
1,The rubber hooks the go over the ear do not have any wire in them. If your ears don't  match their shape they can slip off thus not providing extra support. Everything else about these ear buds has been enjoyable.
0,Amazing sound! But...<br />The mic is TERRIBLE!! You can't be heard.<br />Sending these back
1,"I was looking for some headphones that had great sound, easy to use, simple features and would fit in my small ears. These were perfect."
1,"The sound quality of this wireless SENSO headphone is good. Control of Bluetooth connection and ON/OFF is not so straightforward. But the worst part was that it broke so quickly within a couple of months of random usage in bed or at my desk the earbud where ON/OFF is hosted was lost. Unfair for something not so cheap.<br /><br />update since I reported the broken/lost earbud from where the Bluetooth is controlled:<br />08-22/2018The company was quick to get in touch with me. Literally, as soon as I posted the review. I followed their instruction on how to get my SENSO replaced since they were still under warranty. The support team was understanding and sent a replacement to my new home address under 3 days. Fantastic job standing by the product. I wish LG did the same when my phone kept quitting on me and had to send it 3 times for repair,  and never got actually fully repaired despite being under Warranty.<br />Excellent job from the support team."
1,"Too much bass. It can drown out the music in a song that features lots of bass. Would be nice if I could town it down, then they'd be perfect."
1,"So far so good. Easy to charge, affordable price and good quality sound while working out in a busy gym. Would recommend and may buy a pair for the office."
1,"Great sound, good fit."
0,"After going through 3 pairs of wireless Beats headphones in 18 months, I decided to give these a shot and figured how much worse can they be?  They lasted one month.  They will no longer turn on or charge.  The other noticeable difference vs. Beats is the plastic ear piece that wraps around your ear is very flimsy and does not stay in place very well."
0,"I would love to write a really good review on this because it had great sound quality, It was comfortable around my neck when I worked out, and sounded great when I was speaking to people on the phone. However, one day the power button just stopped working out the blue. I've only had the product for 1 month. I did a lot of research before purchasing these, and I really loved most of the reviews. Maybe I received the lemon."
1,"Love the sound on these, they stay in your ear even during a good workout. String that connects the ear buds is long enough to stay around your next when not in use.<br /><br />Not a fan of the lights that indicate several things that are hard to see."
1,Perfect for running. Stays on ears. Good sound. Fast connect. Fast shipping. Great seller!
1,"Amazing!<br /><br />Sound is good<br />Bass is good<br />Fit is good<br />Charge is good<br />Chords are awesome!<br />Car charger is awesome!<br /><br />If your on the fence, buy it. You won't regret it!"
1,"These headphones were definitely great for the months that I could use them.<br />However, they stopped charging after a while of use. Be careful during workouts, I think some sweat might have got caught in in the actual headphone and disrupted the internal components."
1,"Just got them today,  they work great and so easy to sync with my IPod,  nightly recommend these ear buds. They fit very well and stay in my ears. Oh, price was right too!"
0,Broken<br /><br />I  didn't get to use it I took it from the package to charge<br />And found out it was Broken
1,"Great sound for the price!  I use these for listening to music while exercising and for hands free phone calls while driving.  These ear buds work better than I had expected for both applications.  The sound is extremely clear.  The microphone seems to work great (no one complains about not being able to hear me like they did with my old set).  They are comfortable to wear and don't fall out while I exercise, not even when I'm doing yoga.  I cannot use the hard plastic type ear buds that came with my iphone because they hurt and fall out.  I give them two thumbs up!"
1,Talk to boyfriend when he is at work. So I can move around the house so I can still do my work.
1,arrived quickly; easy to use and ear piece choices made wearing it very comfortable.
1,"I bought these for my wife as she is Professional Athletic Trainer for a Valentines present.  She works out several times a day and does sweat much.  Other Headphones did not last well or the sound was bad.  We are a couple of weeks in and she loves them.  I'm also impressed with the sound quality.  She has these paired with both her iPhone 8+ and iWatch.  When I call her when she's working out with just her watch, the mic works great and does not sound 'tinny'.  She tells me I need to get a pair.  Maybe that would motivate me to work out with her?  Nope, but I may get a pair at this price for my easier workout sessions."
0,"To rubbery, don't say in the ear and can't adjust the piece that goes around the outside of the ear"
1,"I just started to use it. It was easy to connect, I really liked the sound. I can use it with my apple watch and my IPhone. Good purchase, well worth of the money."
1,"These are seriously great! After purchasing my first pair, I bought two as gifts and bought another for myself as a replacement. Like any bluetooth headphone, these give me freedom and convenience. Now I can lay on my side watching Netflix on my laptop and not have to worry about ruining the headphone jack. I can also walk away from my phone or laptop and keep listening to my music/show. If your TV is bluetooth-enabled, these are also super convenient if the other person in the room doesn't want to hear the TV. What's specifically great about these headphones is that they're really great at noise cancelling, which is a godsend when you're in a noisy environment and need to focus ;P. They're also fairly water resistant, so I can still listen to my music when it's raining out or when I'm washing my face. Also, the controls (play, pause, skip, rewind, volume up, volume down) on these are pretty easy to use and again convenient. I have three different bluetooth headphones, but these are by far my favorite. These headphones also have a longer battery life than most. Other headphones, which retail for far more ($50-70), typically have a battery life of only 6 hours, but the Senso ones have a battery life of 8, which means they'll last you through the workday on a single charge. If you need to hear what's going on, you can keep one headphone in and use the ear clip on the other headphone on your shirt neckline; this will keep it from pulling on the other end, which can be annoying."
1,This is the second pair I purchased. Good quality and value. This pair is for my wife. I have had the same earbuds for over four years with no issues.
1,"This is are pair of headphones, loving them. The price tag that comes with them is even better. Sound quality is great, volume range is ample and the buttons do what they are supposed to, they are a direct replacement of the ones on my iPhone's earbuds."
1,Wow. Really great headphones! They charge fast and hold a charge for a long time. I've been using them for 3 hours and they're only 70% used up. They're loud! But without losing sound fidelity. They came with all the buds and cables you could need plus a way cool charger that does lighting or micro four my other devices including the headphones! Yay! They're water proof and sweat proof. That's why expensive beats broke and had to be replaced!
1,"Good sound quality (It punches well above it's weight in SQ, sounds as good as my Jaybird X2).<br /><br />Awesome accessories including cables for the price."
1,These are so great I just purchased another pair for myself after ordering them as a gift for my boyfriend. Sound is impeccable and earbuds are actually comfy and stay in your ear EVEN WHILE RUNNING which is so hard to find!! Even the packaging is amazing quality plus I loved that they came with a nice carrying case!
0,I've had them for 1 month and it broke down. very disappointing!
0,Initially I loved the product. The sound was excellent and the battery life was so much better than the $100 headphones I bought last year. Then suddenly all I heard was “low battery..low battery.” Now it won’t even take a charge!!!
1,"These headphones are wonderful! Especially for the price. I bought two sets one for my boyfriend and one for myself. I mostly use them to listen to music but occasionally to chat on the phone. The only downside to these is that people on the other end of my phone conversation have a hard time understanding me. I have attempted to reset via the manufacturers directions but nothing changes. Aside from that the sound quality for music is wonder and they are great to have in the gym instead of my plug in ones that get wrapped up in the gym equipment. My boyfriends gave out almost a year after purchase, but he used his every single day so I am impressed."
0,Manufactured poorly
1,This was one of the best purchases I've made on amazon!! These are amazing headphones that come with more than you could ever need!! Customer service is second to none as well!! First stop shopping for this seller from me!!
1,Great product  sound quality real good getting one for my wife soon real soon too.
1,Good sound quality for music and calls.  comfortable for ear buds. It's a little hard to wear on one ear only when driving as the other earbud tends to snag the seat belt and pull out the other earbud. Perhaps a little more rigid ear fastener hook would solve this issue but that also makes them more comfortable for running etc.. so it's a trade off. My newer car is blue tooth enabled so this is probably not a big issue for most people.
1,Bought these for my husband to use at the gym.  He called me on my cell phone using the Bluetooth headphones and his voice was more clear than when he calls via the phone itself!!  He said they were great at the gym and didn't fall out of his ears or get wet from sweat.<br />He said 2 thumbs up!!
1,I bought these when they were on sale for about 16 dollars. For what I bought them for they are good. They seem pretty solid and I've been sweating in them with no issues so far. They hold a good charge and haven't fallen out of my ears yet.<br />The downside is the sound quality. If you are looking for audiophile quality then these aren't going to satisfy you. They sound a bit flat without much body.<br />But these are great if you want some reliable Bluetooth earbuds to work out with.  They were cheap enough that I won't mind if they are stolen or if I break them.<br />4 stars because I knew I wouldn't get a high quality sound out of them when I purchased them.
1,"The best stereo bluetooth headsets I have used so far.<br />Pros:<br />- High quality sound - suitable to listen to music (as opposed to phone calls)<br />- Light and comfortable<br />- Noise isolation is good<br />- With the memory foam ear pads, the bass response is excellent.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- In my experience, without the memory ear pads, the bass is SLIGHTLY subdued"
1,"Just bought them, getting a second pair, do I need to tell you more?<br />Increased the volume 20% from Samsung 's buds.<br />less than 1 hour charge, and will try the charge time tomorrow, but again I bought wireless before, they are at the city dump.<br />Did I mention I will buy a second pair?"
1,"So I had a pair of a previous model that lasted two years and I loved them. When they finally broke after one too many falls I bought a new pair.  They are still great but I am not fond of the adjustable earhooks. I can never seem to get them just right and they are always messed up after storage which makes me worry they will break from all the movement. I store them in the carrying case but it doesn't take much for them to snag on any little thing and pull them out of alignment.  But aside from that design issue, I love the way they fit in my ear. The sound quality is great for listening to podcasts and the battery lasts a long time."
1,"I really like these!  I'm not used to this kind of earphone, but it's comfortable and the blue tooth works great with my iPhone.  I like the way I can control the volume from the earphones as well as my phone.  Also, when you turn it on or off, a little voice comes out of the earphone that tells you it's on or off.  Nice feature!"
1,I enjoy using them during my workouts.  Great not being tethered to my phone.
1,Excellent wireless headphones. Great sound and comfort using them.
1,"Bought for my husband, he says has great quality sound. Did not have any opportunity to test for waterproofness."
1,"Way awesome.  Plenty of power.  Love the case and other cool stuff they give you with these awesome headphones.  Very easy to hook up and start rocking.  If you want to shut out the rest of the world, these will do it."
1,Great sound and sit in the ear very well! I am very happy with my purchase!
1,Great headphones for a great price. I use them 4-5 times a week for the past several months without issue.
1,ok
1,Received my product. great headphone for a great price. it comes in a cool case along with car charger and extra ear buds and also with an extra iphone charger cable. how cool is that! Thank you SENSO! I will recommend this to everyone.
1,Certainly worth the money. They are comfortable while wearing glasses. I can make no noticable difference in sound quality with the more expensive ones.
1,"Very happy with them, have tested them under rain and under the shower (as bought them to work under range conditions) and so far so good.  Battery time is good.  Persons who i'm talking with usually complains about my sound quality (I can hear them perfectly) but with the cabin sound of my 89 Trooper and the mic position seems to be comprehensible."
1,Good product and service
1,"they don't fit that great, I still use them"
1,Everything about these headphones feels cheap. The clip to shorten the band barely works and falls off constantly. The hooks for over the ear may as well not exist as they don't seem to do anything. I put these things in my pocket once and they just came apart. Only giving stars for the price and the fact that the sound quality was actually decent until they fell apart on me.
1,Great sound.
1,"Not bad deal for price. But if you're a heavy bass fan, don't waste your time. Bass is flat and even muffs out."
1,These head phones are comfortable and have great sound. They stay in well and I have small ear openings. I can do everything but wear my glasses with them with a hat and headband. I would recommend these to others.
1,"This is my second pair. The first set finally stopped taking a charge after several years of daily use. My son also has a pair.  Very good, especially for the price."
1,"Great quality. Sound quality is great, noise-cancelling works fabulously. Output is fantastic, have not had connectivity issues whatsoever"
1,Very good sound; easy to use during exercise
1,Not very good to use if you are “active”... these are great for walking
1,Headphones are working out great.  I walk / run and they stay in place like you want.  I would definitely buy again.
1,"I have been wanting a pair of good ear buds, but never did I dream that I would find best pair I've ever had,  and wireless!  I could not be happier with my purchase,  and for such a reasonable price!  Sound quality is excellent,  battery life is excellent,  and they're so comfortable it's easy to forget they're there and just drift away into the music."
1,Love my headphones.  I have used them now for a couple months for running and when I travel.  I have really small ears and wasn’t sure if they would fit right or stay in.  Another pair I have they fall out.  So back to this pair I didn’t need to adjust the caps what is on works great.  They block surrounding noise so when I run outside I only put one in.  The sound is great.  I am glad I gave them a chance.  I would highly recommend.
1,owesome product with unbelievable cheap
1,I am not a sound snob.  I has a pretty decent sound quality.  Battery life is amazing.  You can hear from both ear buds while talking on the phone using these headphones.  The packaging is great and comes with extra accessories.  I bought another one for my wife and she is loving it as well.
0,"Up until now these headphones worked great. However, the charging piece just broke and I have had these not even a month. The small silver piece that plugs into the headphones became unattached and it is not fixable. I don't know if they sell chargers separately because it's just the charger that is broken, but it broke within a month of using these headphones."
1,I have had these ear buds almost two years and they still work great. I use them to both run and cycle with. I did get caught in a heavy rain once and had no issues. I used them on a road trip once and got 12 hours of listening on a single charge.  For the money they are a bargain.
1,I'm an rather heavy man and appreciate that the length of the connecting wire to go around my neck . Thank you for all the extra goodies too
1,"This is the second pair of wireless headphones I've owned, although the first from Senso. These are really good headphones. They have great sound, so no need to be blasting to drown out noise, and fit well. My only small complaint is that when I was hitting the heavy bag (boxing) they kept coming out. They're good for walking, lifting weights and running but I wouldn't recommend for boxing."
1,They are extremely comfortable & fit my ear good!! The case looks really nice! The low charge beep is very loud. (These were bought for our 15 yr old son. He takes them everywhere!)
1,"fit good, stay in place, great sound!"
1,"The product itself is excellent, however the battery life is so small that you will find yourself charging constantly. You might get a couple hours out of it if you're lucky, but keep in mind you're adding another device to your home that wants daily management."
1,Sound it's great and very easy set up.. I'm happy with it
1,Not as sturdy as I thought.  Nice item.  Well packaged.  Received in a decent amount of time.  Definitely like the headphones.  Nice.
1,These Bluetooth headphones are EASILY comparable to Powerbeats at a FRACTION of the cost. I love them!
0,"I purchased these headphones with the intention of using them while surfing. The description says they are IPX7 rated, but they stopped functioning after my first session on the water."
1,Hi there. Senso Bluetooth headset is awesome because of the excellent clarity and range. Touch control on active bud is surefire. Thanks... 😁👍
1,Nice buds that does everything it says it should do. I would only suggest to the designer to add a magnet to connect the ends when hung around the neck between uses so that one does not loose them.
1,"i bought these after trying and failing with every other pair of sporty bluetooth headphones. available here on Amazon.<br />at my wits end but wanting a cordless workout, i pulled the trigger on these puppies and I've never looked back<br />My deaf self really digs how loud these can get and they completely immerse you in sound drowning out any outside noise<br /><br />10/10 product, def belongs with the best seller tag"
1,Awesome looks and described perfectly the best bargain and buy on Amazon hands down. (Get it they are Bluetooth). Serious would order again for sure. I've been looking for a while. I Didn't want to overpay. Found these at a good price point. My co worker owns a pair and swear by them. I got them and love them
1,"I love these headphones,they great sound quality with plenty of base. Great for any type active lifestyle."
1,"I started listening at the gym 6:00 AM, work all day long (8~9 hours) and it is still playing when I get home. Good sound quality (HD sound), easy setup and well equipped with car charger, a pretty nice case, different sized earbuds, a dual lighting/micro USB cable, another (shorter) micro USB cable, a coupon and a one year warranty."
1,VERY HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT THANK YOU
1,Bought these headphones for working out. I do a lot of various activities and was tired of constantly holding my phone. I am able to leave my phone in my bag when I am at the gym and still be able to listen to my music without any issues.
1,"Overall good. Fits and holds well. The sound quality is not that great. Connects easily. Only main problem is I cannot use it when there’s a wind, when I’m running or biking outside because airflow makes a lot of noise. I’m not sure why, but it happens when it’s turned off as well."
1,"Bought two more, one for my husband and son."
1,"I'm very happy with these! The sound quality is great and in a really loud music playing gym, the noise canceling worked wonderfully. Plus they stayed in place and were comfortable."
1,"Works very well. Easy to pair. Long battery life. Comfortable. All in all, a great product."
1,"I have been using these for many weeks on a regular basis. They stay on, they are reasonably comfortable, the bass is a little weak, but improves if you shove them into the ear a bit farther. For the money, you can't go wrong. The battery doesn't last as long inbetween uses as I would like, but hey, plug them in more often! Great bang for the buck."
1,The esr buds stay in your ears as promised. Great sound.  The seller described and delivered their product as promised
1,Husbands anniversary present.  He says they are comfy and they sound great. Id buy them again
1,"Overall happy, you cant get any better for the money."
1,long battery life.
1,Love being able to skip tracks by long-pressing the volume buttons. Sound is decent given how inexpensive these are. Great for the gym where it's mostly to block out background noise and play music to help pass the time. Sweatproof thus far after using them almost every day for months. Works okay for online meetings and phone calls. Not ideal for true audiophile experiences.
0,Garbage. Had them for one month and they stopped working. Really disappointed.
1,"Everything is great, but they don't 100% fit right. Needed one size smaller than the smallest."
1,Exelentes
1,Love the product
1,Great except after a few days I lost them. :(
1,"These Bluetooth Headphones have strong value at the price point. Not on is the shipping packaging quality, the extras inside the box far exceed other products. The headphones are easy to use and the sound quality is better than I expected. The reviews I read were encouraging to me therefor I purchased another two sets (one for hubby), I will now order an additional set so that I always have a fully charged set ready to go; what can I say I'm a music junky! Definitely recommend this product."
0,Worked great for two months and then the right ear bud died. I was never rough on them. Disappointing.
1,"These were worth every penny, they are loud and have good battery life, I love working out with these and riding my bike.!!!!"
1,These headphones are really nice! Price is great especially because it literally comes with a car charger so you can charge your headphones. The quality is awesome. Definitely would recommend buying especially if you need good headphones for the gym. These are perfect!
1,"These are great for working at at the gym with running and lifting weights. I am a heavy sweater and these do just fine when covered in sweat. So far the battery last me a whole 2 weeks sometimes a little more. I just use them for the gym which is about 1 hour a day sometimes 2 hours. So it all depends on how often you use them. Sound quality is great I’ve used the beats before and there basically the same no crazy difference, only the price. These are great for price for sure."
1,"Ease of use and sound quality is good ,too."
1,Very lightweight but well made. Sound is pretty good and the set up was easy. My Bose wireless headphones have much better sound but cost 350. These are a great bargain.
1,"Excellent product.  Above average battery life.  Flexible ear wraparounds are soft, pliable and fit comfortably. Great sound. Easy booth connection and best of all sweat and water resistant.<br /> Just protect them in their case when not in use and you should get years of service life."
1,So far so good. Much better than the Beats at one fifth the cost. Good sound and holding up with long charge. Been using about 1 month...
0,Lasted about 6 uses then wouldnt take a charge at all using the included charger. They were good when they worked
1,"I used these ear buds daily for 20 months. Average use per day 1-2hrs. No issues. They stay in my ears well, except at a dead sprint where one may jiggle lose but rarely fall out. I will be buying another set and have already given one as a gift. They finally won't charge. This far exceeded my expectations!"
1,"This headphones sound awesome for the price, well constructed and good battery life. I paid $19.99 and it was a steal. I look 2 thing in Bluetooth headphones sound quality and battery life and this headphones have it all."
1,"So far so good. I have been on a few runs with these, and I am loving them. They are comfortable, they stay connected to my phone's Bluetooth with no issues, and I have not had any problems with battery life. The value for these is really good. They come with a nice case, USB cables for iPhone/Android, a car charger, and some ear bud replacements."
1,I tried them on my long run this past Saturday and they worked great !
1,Super easy to pair and sound is great. Wish the container to hold headphones was a little bigger to carry all the extras but o'well.
1,"Best bluetooth speakers that I have used.  Compact, good sound, and can use while running or at the gym"
1,"Really a sweet set , easy to use, love"
1,"Easily worth the money. Sound great, comfortable, connect fast, easy to use.  What else is there to say? I would definitely purchase again. Quality headset."
1,"Surprisingly better than some that claim to be superior than these so called brand name earbuds,  more insert sizes so they can stay in your ear."
1,"Great sound, and I like flexible and adjustable over the ear hooks!!! Some time it's very hard to find headset with comfortable ear hooks- but this one is the BEST!!! I can bent it over my ear and it will stay in the same shape."
1,"These are absolutely awesome!!  Loved mine so much, I ordered a pair for my husband.  He had a more expensive pair that he was very unhappy with, but he loves these as well!  Also, love the fact that we each got an email from the CEO of the company, thanking us for our purchase and saying if we had any issues at all that we should contact him directly, as they are a small company and realize that folks are looking for great service behind great products.  Highly recommend!!"
1,I jog with my headphones 2 miles a day five times a week. If they are not charged then the connection for Pandora is spotty. I have multiple ear piercings and the headphones are sometimes difficult to adjust to my ears. It takes a little bit of effort but just like everybody else says once you get it to the perfect spot the headphones don't fall out. I really appreciate the option to skip or repeat songs with the volume buttons and how easy it is to disconnect and reconnect WHILE jogging without having to stop and look at my phone.
1,"I was very skeptical about the quality of sound the Bluetooth earbuds would have. I was totally amazed how clean and clear the sound is. As a musician, I am very impressed of the sound.<br />Thank you"
1,"I use these every day at work, almost all day. I work as an RV detailer and I work outside in the heat. I sweat a lot, water is going everywhere and yet a month later they're still working like new! They charge back up really fast so they're always ready to go the next day and will last the full 8 hours. Only complaint is earwax will start to build up in the buds, but you can pop them off and use a tooth pick to clean them out. And if you wear glasses like me, the clips don't get in your way, you can just tuck them under the arms of your glasses and won't even notice them. Great purchase and well worth it!"
1,Excelente quality excede my expectations.
1,They are comfortable to wear. Have good sound quality and good battery life.
1,"I've had these for a month now and they are definitely worth the money.  Fit is good and the hooks keep them on my ears where other buds fall out.  The sound is very good, also.  I'd buy another set without a second thought"
0,"Battery life is nice, but just wish you could put your phone down and walk away more then 10 feet and it wasn't so bulky."
1,I love these. Best ear phones ever
1,Very good but not loud at all. Trying on different phones too
1,"They are very sturdy and stay in place, comfortable, connects with no issues."
1,Happy with the sound quality and everything except the cable attached is for iPhone. It should have asked for which option to order iPhone or Android. Then it will be a perfect 5 star.
1,"I've had multiple sets of cheaper wireless headphones, cause let's be honest, I don't wanna pay $200 for headphones. These are hands down the best headphones I have ever used. They were so easy to set up and the ear buds were so comfortable. I love the noise cancellation. I can still hear a liiiitttle bit when there's no music, but absolutely nothing else when there's music on. I didn't know how much I needed bass when I was listening with headphones. These are such an incredible investment I bought two just in case! :D"
0,Had them for a week and they where falling apart cheep
1,The only thing i find is they seem a bit bulky. it would be nice if they were a bit smaller in size.
1,"for the money, this headphone is one of the best out there. Sound isn't like my BOSE headsets but you're also paying lot more for bose. I use this when working out and it's perfect! Would recommend to others."
0,"The device itself is mostly okay. It has okay sound not any better not any worse than most others. However, I consistently cannot get the cover off the charging port. I almost always end up having to use a knife. Which means of course that eventually it will not be water resistant like I need it to be."
0,"Bought these in March 2018, it is now September 2018, five months and they wont charge. Tried different cables and different charging stations and no go. Apparently only one month return policy and missed that. Wouldnt buy theses or from this seller."
1,"I was pleasantly surprised by these units. Although the sound quality is not audiophile, the volume capability is substantial, and the Bluetooth connection is stronger than my $500 over-the-ear name brand units. I bought these specifically for use in the hot tub, and while I don't dunk my head, there is a lot of steam and splashing and after a few sessions over the last few weeks, the phones still work fantastically.  I wish there was a little better charging logic, as the user manual recommends to be unplugged after the charge indicator shuts off, and not left charging overnight.  I also have had a couple opportunities to chat on the phone with them in, and while I did have to speak up a bit, I was told my voice sounds crystal clear. Overall, quite a value."
0,"The bells and whistles on these headphones are nice. The feel is good, and it comes with an array of ear cushions for customization. However, the sound is terrible. Just terrible. Bass response is there, but the mids are muddy and the highs are non-existent. If you can't tell if one of your favorite songs sounds different when playing on a home stereo system vs through the speakers on your smart phone, then you probably won't notice the sound problem. For me, I was so distracted by how bad it sounded that I had to return them. Perhaps mine were faulty, but I didn't want to take another chance."
1,"Product has been owned 1 week, but, so far, has performed exceptionally well. Easy pairing, great sound quality, and the range has been pushed to to 20 feet or so, with no loss of volume or reception. Delivery was within 2 days as per Amazon Prime guarantee."
1,"Great sound, including rich, deep base.  Paired easily with phone.  Nice accessories (carry case, chargers, etc.).  I use this all the time biking and in the gym.  After ~7 months of use, the volume up/down button fell off the buds.  Invotek's customer service was great as these have a 1 year warranty.  New pair was sent out to me immediately.  I'd recommend this product, and the service provided by Invotek."
0,I bought this in the summer & gave it as a gif on Sunday.  It was broken and the child never got to use it.  Frustrated as<br />it is past the return date.
1,Great sound and great product. I am very happy with this purchase.
1,"My first set of bluetooth headphones. They feel great, connects fast, pretty loud and bassy, and hold a charge really well. Highly reccomend."
1,They're perfect for gyming and office.
1,"My first pair just broke after 18 months of daily use. I just received my second pair and the materials and quality are not as good as the earlier version. Rubber part around the ear was changed to a stiff hard plastic, colors on the casing look dull, and the sound quality is not as good. In the photos, the left single earbud is the older version, and right is the newer version."
1,"so far I love these headphones. Easy to pair, great sound. Would buy again."
1,They turn off by themselves when you forget to turn them off. Great feature! No problems with them falling out of my ear.
0,Went thru two pairs in 1 month and they both wont hold a charge anymore. Waste of money. Everything is good except battery and charging.
1,"Out of the box, these are better than my wife's Powerbeats 2 Wireless which were 3x more expensive when we purchased those.  Haven't tested the  8 hour battery life yet, but they have handled my 2 hour gym routine twice and a couple 20 min dog walks on a single charge thus far.  The sound quality isn't studio headphone quality, but I also stream music through Spotify, Amazon and Pandora so hard to say if it's the headphones fault.  And honestly, that isn't why you buy wireless headphones.  Bottom line, these come with different ear pieces for all size ears and they are great for the gym!  I will update this review if I come across any issues but thus far, I would buy these again!<br /><br />July 2019 - I did buy them again.  Lost mine at the gym.  These things are pretty much unbeatable for the price."
1,The price and quality of these headphones are great. Long battery life. Great sound. Easy to use
1,i really like these for exercise or just listening to music
1,I just received my SENSO headphones a few days ago and I LOVE them! The sound is fantastic and it'/ almost scary how I can't hear a single thing outside of the music. Fantastic fit to my ears and they never move an inch! Just what I was looking for my strenuous workouts and running. Highly recommend!
1,"I have had them for a week now and they are comfortable, work great, and sound good. They exceeded what I expected and I am glad I ordered them."
1,I have only used them once as I just received them a couple days ago.  I used them while walking /  running with my dog.  I like them.  I do get some wind noise but may need to play with the size of the buds.  I recommend!!
1,Very comfortable but has a tendency for cutting out when bounced around.  Not sure if it's the headphones or my phone though but fir the price I can't complain
0,The earbuds are not a tight fit like the way the picture shows. They keep falling out of my ears. I'm using the small plugs but the piece that wraps around my ears is too big. Therefore I have no secure fit. I love the car charger and the warranty. I'm going to have to order a different kind. I going to order a Jabra headset that one will fit my ears perfectly. What can you do to accommodate me. Is there a Jabra with a warranty. I saw one that I would love. Also the Senso earbud is suppose too be noise cancelling but it's not. People keep asking what's all the noise. I can be driving & the sound of the wind & every moment they hear.
1,It was a gift and I assume they were happy with it
0,Update: I bought the headphones in March and they just stopped recharging in September. That's 6 months of usage and now the headphones can't be charged!<br /><br />Great headphones had them for two days. They sound just like my bose qc but have a bit more bass and 10x cheaper. These are my new go to headphones
1,Great quality headphones at a great price.
1,"I left another review - but got an email from the company. First - shipping was outrageously fast!!!!! Love the product packaging. Next, I didn't realize how much was included - WOW - love the case for the earbuds and the supplied car charger and cords. Lastly, the earbuds. The instructions are earsy to follow. Having wireless earbuds already, I felt the setup was intuitive. They are comfortable and the sound is great. Will be cruising later this year and wanted another set of earbuds - so I'll always be ready - so to see these as being waterproof was a plus. So far, I'm very satisfied and would recommend them. If you are a person that is looking for BOSE quality however, these are not for you! For exercising and cruising - these serve my purpose."
1,"On the second pair, cause I stepped on the first and broke them. These are the best Bluetooth headsets I have owned and I have paid as much as $200 for headphones in the past. They are louder than the beats, fit better, and have more bass.  You can not go wrong at this price but you couldn't go wrong if they cost 3 times this price."
0,"I always had trouble connecting to my iPhone and now Google Pixel, but now it takes 4 resets (turning the headphones off and back on) to finally connect before being able to use for music listening. Additionally, the left headphone finally gave up and stopped working due to the wiring. I'd say these are ready to throw out. Total lifetime: 2 years, 3 months.<br /><br />Wouldn't buy brand again."
0,The Bluetooth cuts in and out if I have my phone in my pocket. Don't really understand how this product has such good reviews.
1,"honestly, I'm unsure if I will keep these.  They don't stay connected to the phone and often turn off in the middle of a call.  You can hear the voice saying disconnected, several times during the call.  This happens on a fully charged battery."
1,"Work nice, decent sound, don't count on the noise canceling."
1,Love the fact that they are connected and you wont lose them!<br /><br />includes a few spare ear-buds.. NICE!
1,Easy setup and streaming music sounds great however they're not to clear when fielding phone calls..
1,"Generally well pleased with these bluetooth headphones. The sound is awesome, the battery life is good but I was disappointed in the noise cancellation. Overall though they are good headphones."
1,These headphones were great for the price! The battery lasted much longer than I expected.
1,Great sound.  Extremely light
0,Battery pretty much died after 16 months. Can only last 30 seconds after fully charged.  How long is this supposed to last anyway?<br /><br />Somehow always get disconnected while going up or down stairs.<br />Okay sound quality.
1,I purchased these and enjoyed them very much as they have great sound. After about 10 months of working perfectly the sound died in the left earpiece and soon after in the right earpiece as well. I contacted customer support and they quickly sent a replacement. Overall a very good experience and worth the price.
1,"I like that it is complete - w extra sizes of the earbuds, chargers, and I especially love the case it comes with. Sound is great and it’s easy to sync to my phone’s bluetooth. There were times though that sound kept cutting in and out during my run which distracted me from my run. Otherwise, sound quality is great and works well even on phonecalls."
1,They seem to work fine
1,The headphones stopped working after only 6 months. However I loved the. Just wish they lasted longer. I need to update my review. I called the 24 hour customers service number that came with my headphones and I must say that I am very happy. They are going to replace my item. No hassle
1,Used for work excellent choice
1,"I have used them for a while now, they're still great. The battery lasts a few workouts, and the sound quality is great for the price."
1,Great headphones.  Very comfortable with awesome sound quality.
1,"Second pair of bluetooth headphones I tried at this pricepoint. By far the best. They stay in your ears while running, sound is great. Sometimes they're a little glitchy connecting to my phone but turning them off and on again always fixes it."
1,"Let me start off with, it is almost IMPOSSIBLE for me to find ear buds I like. I want noise canceling and waterproof for the pool, cheap and all the things! Plus it's hard for me to find any that deliver all the things AND are comfortable. I was skeptical when these arrived because the wings that go around the ears are bigger than I expected and the cord, kind of long. I have abnormally small ear canals so it is really hard for me to find earbuds that stay (thus purchasing earbuds with wings). I fought to get them set just right so that they weren't falling out of my ears. Eventually, I tried the foam pieces they included and that seemed to help make a better seal. The pieces aren't easy to change but once you get them, they stay secured. When I got them in, I could still hear just about everything around me but it was muffled. No noise canceling. With that said, the second I put music on, the sound was incredibly impressive and I could no longer hear the world around me. The connection to my phone was easy peasy. Hold button 6 seconds, turn on blue tooth and select your device. BAM! Done. Overall, I am happy with these. They were crazy cheap, they're ""wireless"" (I've been mowing with wired earbuds and that is a true struggle with all the trees), and with music I can't hear the commotion in my office so I'm good. I have not tested moisture or waterproofing yet. I will update this review once I do. Oh! I tied back the cord and it isn't so bad. Probably a little longer than they need to be but not crazy."
0,Battery drops from 70 to<br />30% very quick and turns off
1,Absolutely love these earbuds!  AMAZING sound quality.  Will order more for Christmas gifts!<br />Great service- Received package on time as promised.
0,I used it for two months now.  It was working well while it lasted but it just stopped charging.  I tried using different cables and chargers to get it start charging but it does not work.  The charger and cable charges my other unit fine except this Senso headset.  The red light which indicates that it is charging does not lit up when plugged in.  These popular brands in Amazon is a hit and miss I guess.  I can't return these now since it broke down after 3days.  I'll try another brand and hopefully it will last more than 2 months.
1,excellent sound and good quality for the price.
1,"I gave it some time. I REALLY wanted the Beats Powerbeats3 wireless headphones for their W1 chip which makes pairing look super easy.<br /><br />I primarily need wireless headphones for the gym. Too many times have my wired headphones been yanked out of my ears when they get caught rising from a bench or walking by some gym contraption. Plus it's a PITA doing certain exercises with my phone in my pocket.<br /><br />After a bit of research, I chose this style of headphones because I have large ears and earbuds won't stay put. This pair of wireless headphones has everything I need; Cheap, bluetooth, volume, pause/skip, at least 6 hours of battery, sweat proof. The powerbeats3 are $150 right now, but I went with these just to try them out, even though they're sans W1 chip.<br /><br />I paired it with my iPhone and iPad, and I noticed the first problem. When I walk out of range of my iPad, it pauses my music and gives me a beep, and does so repeatedly until I'm hopelessly out of range (going to my garage for example). This became very annoying, so I unpaired it from my iPad. I didn't really need it paired to it anyway. Since I only have my iPhone paired to it, the headphones pair immediately.<br /><br />When walking around the gym, I leave my iPhone by my towel and walk around (weight rack, bench, fountain, etc.) and it maintains a strong connection. I admit that it's because I always maintain clear line of sight (don't want some bro taking my phone). As long as I don't demand multiple bluetooth pairings and just use this for the gym, I'm good to go and it's well worth the cheap price. I can't really say I care to pay far more just for the added benefit of being able to quickly pair this to my iPad, so I'm keeping these.<br /><br />However, and this criticism is for the style in general regardless of manufacturer, these headphone cords kinda have friction when brushing against the back of my neck. I wish there was a way to keep them up and off because when I turn my head to glance somewhere or look around multiple times, the friction is just strong enough that it eventually tugs the headphones off my ear. The powerbeats3 would more than likely do the same thing since the cord would rest in the same spot. This kinda left me keeping my head straight like I had a neck brace on toward the end of my workouts. I'll have to figure something out in order to make this work.<br /><br />A note on sound quality. I can't get THX surround sound on tiny little buds, so I'm not going into these with sky high expectations. That said, these sound great and my songs don't sound noticeably muted or dull. The sound is similar an average car stereo. Sound range and bass are good. I expect the powerbeats3 would probably have some sick bass, but meh. I'm going to the gym, not a sound studio so whatever ambient noise there is would leak in and drown out subtleties anyway.<br /><br />Overall, 5 stars because the cost savings for my application make this pair more than adequate over the powerbeats3."
1,"The sound quality is good and controls are easy to use. Battery life is also good. This is my first pair of bluetooth headphones and they are bulkier than I would have liked. While they stay on my ear just fine, they aren't snug. I get a lot of wind noise when running outside with them, also wasn't expecting that. The case and cords that come with it are all great additions."
0,"They worked pretty well, but they had this terrible buzzing/squealing sound in the background constantly. I've noticed this problem with other Bluetooth headphones before, but these were the worst. I had to send them back, because you could hear the sound over quieter songs, and the sound would make my ears ring hours after wearing them."
1,Excellent!!
0,Update - I had this for about two months and the volume controls on the headset broke. Was super happy until the product was defective. I reached out to see if I could return or get a replacement for the item and have not heard back from customer service.
0,"Product came defective upon opening. Left earbud did not work. On that aspect, I wouldn't call this great quality."
1,Great price for a good quailty hands free headset.
1,"I loved these for a while, however with a full charge they shutdown after a few minutes.  Still shows full charge when I turn back on.  This would be 5 stars without this problem."
1,"These have good sound, good noise dampening and a good fit. The case is fairly durable and a good addition and so are they extra ear buds. Overall I liked these much more than other active bluetooth headsets like mpow. For the price range these are a solid buy."
1,"the hook is very flimsy and do not hold the headset in place for any activity.<br />This headset can be used for in place or gentle walking. Any quick movement the headset falls of from the ear.<br /><br />Other than that sound quality, ease of use was good.<br />I am returning because of the earhook"
1,"These are really good Bluetooth headphones.  High quality sound, loud, and sit well on your ear while running."
1,"This is a very nice little set of Bluetooth headphones and for the price, very hard to beat. Crisp clear sound and nice bass for the size. They are nice and comfortable. However, my left bud has a quiet but perceptible ringing to it which is acruelly rather loud when music isn't playing and you can hear it on softer tunes. Really a downer for a great product."
1,"I am very pleased with the quality of these speakers. These don't sound like low-end headphones at all when the price clearly states. They come with different sizes and style earplugs, my favorite was memory foam type. First time of my life I feel like headphones are holding gently to my ears and music quality does not change that much when I move around. I live quite active lifestyle and these are perfect for me. They wear them when I work, run... bike.. hike... they just good. If I have to name at least one downside then it would be battery. Everything else is pretty nifty!<br /><br />+ Pros:<br />* amazing audio (smooth bass and clear trebs, no crackling or screaming menus, same pleasing experience as my old 200$ ones!)<br />* reliable BT connection with iPhone (no hassle, fast one touch control, connects every time, no dropping)<br />* ergonomically pleasing<br />* great bang for the $$<br /><br />- Cons:<br />* battery time (not horrible but I'm considering getting another pair to always have one charged, they die faster than most of my BT headphones)"
1,"These are amazing! I purchased them because I had broken my last set of bluetooth headphones and needed another set for my races. The sound quality is great and the battery life is pretty decent as well. I highly recommend these, especially if you are a runner."
1,Super
1,For the price you you can’t go wrong
1,Excellent product and excellent service. Would absolutely recommend these to anyone.
1,Like them a lot.
1,Great headphones.  Sometimes struggles to link to android devices
1,Loving it for now...fits well for a small ears guy like myself.<br /><br />Will edit in the future...
1,Charged easily and quickly. Paired with my phone right away. Very happy with the earbuds.
0,I had these for a about a month before one of the earpieces snapped and is now floppy and unwearable. They are pretty clunky for in ear headphones. The sounds and electronics quality was good though.
1,Went through 3 different earbuds. When I work out these don't fall out. Sound is great. Distance is fine. Great price<br />4 jan..Ordered another for my father in law. One ear bud came broken. Sent it back for exchange. New ones came 2 days later. Well worth the money for theses ear buds.
1,"Absolutely the best earbuds you can buy, the accessories that come with it are phenomenal, two USB cords and one has a lightning adapter, a lighter charger, four sets of earbud cushions, two wire ties, a great carrying case, they are responsive, have great bass, completely noise cancelling absolutely amazing value."
1,Stopped charging after 3-4 months.  Constantly had connectivity issues which would stem up often after lots of sweating.<br /><br />I have updated this review from 1 star to 3 stars as their customer service was very quick to respond and resolve the issue.
0,"This was a good product till it stopped working after 3 months of not daily use. I wrote previously that it was good for noise cancelling, which it was. I am not a daily user of this product so when it broke down within 3 months...I am no longer a fan!"
1,Wow so thrilled to get these the sound is fabulous would recommend these.
1,"SENSO Bluetooth Headphones, BUT looks wireless head...C.Guzman"
0,It’s a Christmas gift.  Not Christmas yet.
1,"workin great, use them in noisy environments they help block the noise out while giving a great sound"
1,"They work perfectly, they have long battery life. Wireless really frees up my range of motion when working out."
1,The sound quality on these is amazing. I honestly did not expect them to be as awesome as they are. I got a set for myself and my wife for the gym and we love them.
1,"Awesome gift for my husband, son, and grandson! They loved it!!"
1,Very good.  Arrived quickly.  Sounds great
1,"Would give 5 stars if these were on sale for $25&#60;. Other than that these wireless headphones are good, considering its decent price, battery life, and build."
1,These head phones are sweet. I use then every day. Very comfortable and reliable
1,"&quot; I love my new ear buds. They were so easy to install and music sounds great. I use them with my iPad, and I like the fact that they are wireless. I highly recommend the SENSO AcivBuds &quot;"
1,"These headphones are awesome! They fit well, the sound is great and the price was right."
1,"Just recieved them a few days ago.Still working on learning all the buttons,etc.<br />They seem great,so far!Clear sound.<br />I hope these will allow me to listen to music,when I'm mowing the lawn this summer.<br />They also seem to stay on well,so far.<br />I also like the fact that the cord will keep them on me,even if I need to take them out of my ears."
0,"When using them for phone calls, I frequently get told that I'm too quiet."
1,"These are really great Bluetooth headphones. They sound good, the battery life is good enough that I can listen all morning and plug them in while I eat lunch and then they will go all day. Great great headphones for a really awesome price.<br /><br />I had them for about 8 months and the left ear unit started to go in an out depending on how I moved. I sent a message to the company, and received a message back within a few hours and after one quick shot at troubleshooting with a reset another set is on its way to my door from the warranty.<br /><br />I can’t recommend these enough. Really great product, with really great service."
1,"Surprisingly for the price, these are actually decent headphones. We purchased two sets when they were on sale. The headphone battery lasts a good amount of time without charging. Comes with a carport charger. The only issue I have it sometimes when linking the headphones to my iPhone I have to &#34;forget the device&#34; and redo the link for some reason. Not a huge issue but people have had issues with it not linking automatically but we figured out the way to fix it when it does that. Sound is pretty decent too"
0,"Bigly hard to keep these connected to Apple Watch while running. If there is meaningful motion of the watch - as, say, there would be if you wear your watch on your wrist - the audio connection drops in and out continuously. This might be something I would accept in other types of devices, but since these and many other similar headsets are marketed as exercise accessories, it's kind of not performing.<br /><br />Some reviewers suggest a factory reset, but so far this has not fixed the problem. I've had some luck recently by 1) keeping the headphones fully charged and 2) pairing the headphones only with the Watch, and never with the iPhone. That has dropped the frequency of the problem, but to my frustration, not entirely.<br /><br />These were pretty highly rated headphones, but something I'm starting to learn is that many high-end electronics mostly differ from cheap in that they are tested before they leave the factory - they're expensive because they throw away a good portion of the devices. It might be that many of these headphones are fine, but some aren't. If I cannot fix the problem, I may try to return them - they also generate a lot of wind noise, and the lowest volume setting is too loud. I just don't know if another brand would be any better; they all seem to be designed more or less the same.<br /><br />Other than that, the device seems well built and comes packaged with some useful accessories. I was fully willing to like these but they just aren't doing the job right now .."
1,"Love them, not a big fan of new technologies as they come out, but finally got the blue tooth.  Workouts are now a breeze without worrying about my phone falling or getting damaged.  Also found that I like it just doing chores around the house as I can keep the tunes going with laundry and the such while having 2 free hands.  These are comfortable and have yet to have them fall out of my ears, including interval exercises and running stairs."
1,"They fit great, have full/rich sound and hold a pretty long charge. The dual charger is great. If they run out of juice, I can get enough of a charge in 10 minutes to go for an hour run. I prefer the memory foam pads, but they come with both types so you’ll find your fit. I have bought these for family and friends as well."
1,"I am so happy with these!! I have a lot of ear piercings all throughout my ear and so I never know if ear phones will work with that. Especially since these have the clips I was unsure. It doesn’t irritate any of them, not even my daith or conch. If you’re pierced, these are awesome! Highly recommend."
1,"For the cost, these are a great pair of Bluetooth headphones.  I use them for exercising and general use and they work just fine.<br /><br />The box includes a USB charging cable, Car charger adapter, 2 wire ties, 1 pair of &#34;foam&#34; ear plugs, and various sizes of the rubber ear plugs.<br /><br />On first use, the bass seemed a little overpowering compared to the treble.  That's largely due to using the &#34;foam&#34; ear plugs that I was not used to.  However, I got used to them pretty quickly.  They work really well for cancelling out noise and letting you enjoy music.  I actually have to remove at least one of the earbuds so that I can hear people talking to me.  Note: I only used them for phone calls one time.  I had not re-calibrated them at that time so I cannot speak to their quality in that regard.  I am using them for exercise purposes.  However, I can say that the one phone call I took while wearing them worked pretty well but it was not a long conversation at all.  The function worked is as much as I can contribute.<br /><br />Also, the first couple of times I used them, the Bluetooth would not maintain a connection very well.  If I walked away any distance from my device, the sound would cut out and was real spotty.  However, I contacted their support and mentioned the connection issue.  They promptly replied (within an hour or so) and gave me instruction on how to perform a system reset/recalibration for the headphones.  After following the instructions, the connection issue disappeared.<br /><br />Overall, I would purchase these again.  The product is of good quality and Invotek provided an awesome support and customer service experience.  I will definitely purchase products from Invotek in the future."
1,I like
1,"I was very happy with these headphones. They are comfortable to wear and stay in place securely. The time between charges is very good and most importantly, the sound quality is excellent. I really like the carrying case and that it comes with a variety of charging connectors. Overall a very good value."
1,Great so far the only issue might be the bass seems a bit much.  I am still getting used to them so I might find that is good. I did accidentally call back the last number when trying to change tracks on a playlist. that is just user error.
1,"These are really good, the sound is very good quality for these kind of headphones and the battery last quite a bit really"
1,"Overall I found the Senso headphones to be a solid value. Sound quality is on par with the more expensive brands, battery life is good, and the microphone works well. Their warranty and customer support was top notch. My headphones died after 7 months and I contacted their support team, after some trouble shooting it was determined that they were no longer functional. A replacement pair arrived 3 days later. They backed their product 100%, and resolved the issue timely. Because of the support I received, I'd recommend Senso to anyone."
1,Good sound. Easy connection.
1,Great headphones! The design is great quality and it's very comfortable. I enjoy being able to workout and the earbuds not coming out of my ears.
0,"I bought these twice, the first time I thought they sounded comparable to beats, however unfortunately they broke down on me after a couple months. I figured I'd give them another shot because they are cheap, and  recently bought them and wanted to return them the day I received them. They have CHANGED, the sound quality is horrible now.<br />Wont buy again"
1,excellent reception good value
1,"I had been using Jarv wireless headphones for the past 2 years. When I upgraded my last purchase of Jarv, I kept having problems with the audio and ended up returning my last two purchased. I finally decided to switch brands and I chose the SENSO. I like the carrying case; it is sturdy and not too large. The controls on the earpiece are great. I haven't had them for very long, but I am pleased with the fit. I was a little leery when I saw the over the earpiece was not removable, but I don't feel them at all and they do not interfere with sunglasses. The sound is very good and noise canceling is very good, as well. So far so good!"
1,I like how well they fit. Good sound and easy to use.
1,Stays put and has long battery life.
1,"I will give a 3 1/2 start. It fits perfectly in the ear , easy to use . Sound quality is ok. No controls to skip songs ."
1,quick delivery.  package nicely.  nice option on sizes to interchange ear buds.  easy setup.  quality of sound very good.
1,Good value and sound... this version of  bluetooth allows use of sound options
1,very good
1,"I'm so satisfy with this product,the sound,wateeproof and the quatiy of it that I hve bought three of it. I told two of my friends about it and they have bought it ,too. It's a excellent product. You can go wrong with this Senso brand."
0,"Because of all of the positive reviews, I got these as a replacement for my Anker SoundBuds (https://smile.amazon.com/Anker-SoundBuds-Wireless-Headphones-Ear/dp/B016Y8XJCW) that broke when I mistook the power button for the charger-port cover and ripped them open.  I have to say that I *really* don't like the SENSO headset.  The electronics/sound quality all seem great, but it has 3 major issues for me on that related to its form factor and ergonomics:<br />1. The position of the power/play/pause button means every time I use it, I end up squashing the headphone into my ear, causing nasty crinkling noise and enough change in air pressure that it's uncomfortable.  The only other option is to grab it with more fingers (potentially bumping the volume buttons in the process) to hold it steady,<br />2. The over-ear loops just don't fit me -- I am not a particularly small person but they don't even touch my ear (maybe 1cm clearance between the loop and the parts of my ear I would expect it to rest on -- enough clearance that they can loop over my eyeglasses and still have room to spare).<br />3. They fall off with a slight shake of my head.  Despite the fact that the loops don't fit, the right one stays in reasonably well if I wedge it in (it's supported by the earbud, not the loop) but I can't even keep the left ear on when just walking around my house.<br />4. Wind isolation is poor.  I don't expect much, but these are pretty terrible with even a slight breeze.  I use the smallest silicone covers, not the foam one, but the wind echo sounds like it's the coming from inside the headset, not just some air moving around the part in my ear.<br /><br />So, back to Anker, along with a sharpie so I can make their charger port a bit more distinct from the power button."
1,The headphones are of high quality . Loving them.
1,"i didn't expect much from this headset, because it doesn't cost $200 and I haven't heard of this brand before. I relied on good reviews and decided to take my chance. I'm glad I did. First, the delivery was fast, it came sooner than it was promised. Second, it fits perfect in my ears. I've used it for the past week, every day. I run, do cardio, pull weights, jump. They don't fall. It comes with different earbud sizes, to fit bigger or smaller ears. Third, the audio quality is really good. Clear, no distortion. I never owned more expensive and famous brands, so I can't really compare it to anything else. But I'm happy with the sound. Can't say much about how long last the battery. I workout for two and a half hours, and listen to the music all this time nonstop. But when I get home I charge it so it won't stop on me on the next day. So I can't say how long would it last if I don't charge it right away. I talked on the phone using this set only once. I had no problem hearing the person. But the person that I was talking to couldn't hear me well, I had to increase the volume to the highest.<br />I'm very happy with my purchase. Would buy it again and would definitely recommend it."
1,"Comfortable, affordable  and easy to use."
1,"Great sound and fit comfortably, for the price you can't go wrong"
1,"Although the sound on this product is good, the ear buds don't fit well into your ears.  The ear piece that goes around your ear is flimsy and the product looks bulky.  Thus, giving you an awkward look and hard to jog with product.  I will look else where for ear phones."
1,"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of these headphones.  They have a long battery life, they are comfortable, and most importantly they have great sound.  They are a little bulkier than I thought they would be, but comfort wise the size doesn't cause any issues."
1,The ear hooks are of a flimsy material and don’t conform to the ears well. The ear plugs do not stay in ears tight enough to produce the good sound. These would be better with improvements to that. Overall good quality though. They have lasted 6 hours now without a charge. Not bad for $20. But not as good as my knock-off beats from Afghanistan.
0,"Headphones were faulty, the connection to my phone is very intermittent, not an issue with my phone as my phone works well with my Bluetooth speakers. The base also drops in and out. Very disappointed."
1,Nice headphones with a good sound. they are perfect for what they are designed for. Affordable headphones that can be used in a harsher environment like working out or just working. Perfect for the price. In addition the vendor was very attentive to the product and customer satisfaction.
1,Timely delivery and exceptional product. The sound has outstanding quality and is far superior to other headphones which are triple the cost. This vendor is highly recommended.
1,"I must say I was pleasantly surprised by the ease of use and quality of the sound. I have more expensive headphones that I no longer use. The only issue I have is not being able to use these with my motorcycle helmet. However, great in the gym, great on my bicycle and better than expected."
1,These thing are great very good clean crisp sound bass is off the charts
1,"Great headphones, good battery life."
0,"Audio quality is garbage(think the original Apple earbuds).<br />Comfort- also very poor. They are very bulky and have a large bulge just behind the tips, so even if you have large ear holes like me, they are not comfortable.<br />Cable is flat, but somehow tangles.<br />Wings are floppy and useless.<br /><br />Only buy if you are looking for bargain basement podcast headphones."
0,I like everything but the 2 days it worked. Speakers are crackling when the bass hits.<br />Replace please!!
1,"I needed to replace some BT earbuds after my dog chewed them and thought I'd try these.  Great value and they stay in my ear no matter how hard I exercise.  They don't get in the way and connect seamlessly to my iPhone.  Only have had them for two weeks now, but they seem to be holding up well.  Unless my previous earbuds, I haven't  gotten a battery low message yet and use them for 2 hours at a time almost every day.."
0,"I bought these batting gloves following the good reviews, big mistake, they broke on the first use, totally disappointed"
0,This only works for 2 month I bought November and it’s stopped January 😩😩
0,I was enjoying this for a week or two.  Now it will not charge.  All I get is enough juice to pair/activate and in a minute will say battery low/disconnected. Red light does not come on when i plug into charger.
1,Great value for the price just doesn't stay in ear when running. I had to buy headbands to wear over my ears so they stay in ear while running.
1,"""A quality product at a great price. I would buy again."""
0,"The first time I used these headphones the sound would cut in and out when paired with my iPod. I could sometimes turn the iPod and earphones off and on again a few times and usually I could get a fairly solid connection. After only a few days, however, the headphones stopped working entirely. They appear to be junk, or at least the set I received was."
1,Great for the price and very comfortable.  Sound quality is great.
0,"Hello. I ordered and received (INSERT BRAND NAME) Headphones. I ordered these headphones for my girlfriend to use during her runs and high-intensity workouts. She has been using them for about 3 weeks, when today the left ear is a lot more faint than the right ear to the point it almost sounds as if it is shorted out. The headphones sounded like this after a 4 hour charge.<br /> She really enjoys these headphones because they stay in her ear during her runs and during sweating. She also likes the quality of the sound, and how the quality maintains during her workout.<br /> Not to mention if your military deployed the warranty would not cover out of US. All in all disappointed."
0,"My unit came to me DOA (I assume).  I fully charged it until the light was blue but it will not turn on.  I researched other non-responsive units in the reviews and followed steps for a hard reset, but my unit will not even reset.<br /><br />I sent an email to the company this morning (about 8 hours ago) and haven't heard from them.  Hopefully, they will respond and fix the issue.  If they do, after getting a fix or a new pair, I will update this review.<br /><br />For the time being, this is a generous star, because it doesn't deserve a single start considering it doesn't turn on."
1,Work great!
1,"Just bought this, right earpiece works fine but left earpiece has a constant buzzing sound whenever its connected to any bluetooth device.<br />The sound is painful so may be a health hazard and I don't want to risk my hearing.<br /><br />Wanted to like this product but so far its a dud :(<br /><br />EDIT: Revised this upwards to a 4 from a 1 in November 2017, so Senso indeed did ship me a dud on the first one, but once I contacted customer service they were very prompt and I got another replacement within 1 week. I've been using the new one for 1 month and so far there is no left ear ringing issue. I still think the sound quality is only so-so and the fit isn't great compared to the Anker Soundsport I used before this, but for $30 its a decent bluetooth headphone I can't complain too much about."
1,Just as good as my husband beats.
1,"Great product!  Evident quality throughout. Directions are simple and legible. Connectivity is simple and fast. The audio is all I could ask for, as I mostly listen to podcast and Audible.Com books. However, I have tried the headphones with music and it was excellent! A fantastic alternative to the myriad  overly priced buds/headphones out there."
1,"Around 5 hours of continuous run time from full to completely discharged and then about 1 hour to recharge on, I would guess, a pretty standard USB outlet (I've only recharged them as of now with the in-seat USB port of a plane I was on, so I couldn't say how many mA). Didn't try to use them while recharging (took a nap), so couldn't say if they would work. Paired easily enough with anything I've tried thus far. Controls take a little getting used to, but that'll come with time. Audio quality is sufficient, but (as hinted to earlier) I'm primarily using these for listening to movies in a challenging environment (aircraft in flight) so they may well sound better in a more conducive location.<br /><br />Update: After only three recharges, the red charging indicator LED has failed. I don't think this is the end of the world, nor a reason to ask for a warranty fix or replacement, because (and I have yet to establish this with any certainty) I think the blue LED comes on when fully charged. Also, I've now established that you can't use them while they're recharging."
1,These are great for working out and running.  I even bought my wife a pair to use.  Her pair stopped charging after almost a year's worth of use but Senso sent a replacement pair at no cost.
1,"My husband is a mechanic, and uses these to listen to music while he works! Good quality, he's very happy with them."
1,Love the headphones!  Very easy to set up.  Sound is excellent!
0,"Mediocre sound, awful microphone for calls ... but cheap."
1,"Very comfortable, great sound, excellent customer service.  Great deal for those of us who don't want to spend $200 for earbuds to wear to the gym."
1,"i have a set of the Senso buds for about 3 months. worked wonderfully until i had an issue with the left ear peice going in and out of sound. contacted Senso and they got me a replacement within a few days! stoked on the customer service! backing this company 100% as far as quality, the earbuds sound great for the asking price and come with a lot of bonuses like a case, foam or plastics ear, iphone/android charging cable, etc. super happy customer! would def recommend if ur looking for affordable bluetooth buds 👍🏽"
1,Just as good as my powerbeats 2. Way more affordable. I'll buy another pair of these ever break.
1,"Very comfortable, range excellent and sound is crisp. Looking forward to seeing how the noise canceling works out on plane"
1,I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH THE HEADPHONES BLUETOOTH SENSO. I AM USING A LOT AT GYM. IT'S PERFECT. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED.
1,"Great headphones, great customer service if you need them replaced."
1,"I bought these to use for running, but they're basically useless for that since they won't stay in my ear. I tried the different sizes of silicone inserts, but they don't stay in well when you're moving and sweating. I've had cheap Panasonic and expensive Etymotic wired earbuds that stay in much better, so I know it's possible. However, they pair easily (with my Nexus 6) and have good sound quality and battery life, so I'm happy with them for indoor use."
1,I have only had these a week but seem to be working great.  They are just as advertised  I liked these so much I bought several more to give as Christmas presents.  .
1,Very impressed and thank you for making it affordable.
1,"Everything you want, and more. Seriously amazing quality! and got them in the mail very fast."
0,These stopped working & Amazon won't even allow exchange
0,"Was excited to get.  I got and worked okay, but when working out it falls out of my ears.  I could live with that, but then after about 3 months, would no longer turn on.  Battery light showed fully charged.  Said one year warranty, but when registered with manufacturer, no way to see how to return.  Emailed and got nothing back.  If one relies on head set, this is a big issue.  So still received nothing back from manufacturer.  I purchased the Soundbeat Q30.  Does not fall out my ears.  Spend long time on line looking for ways to turn on, but only found other people had similar problems.  Then saw small note on manual, that says don't charge overnight, can affect batter life.  Just not a good product and still have not heard back from them.  Would like a refund.  Not like it is a lot of money, but adds up.  I do not recommend this product.  Especially since customer service sucks."
1,"These earbuds have great quality sound. I am far lees distracted now that I don't have to constantly untangle cords or readjust an earbud. Sound quality is great, even towards the upper end of the volume. Also, these things can be LOUD for earbuds, I was surprised. Overall excellent quality for the money."
1,"Great product, great price."
1,"These headphones work pretty good although I have one issue. When I first turn them on and sync them with my Galaxy S6 the music cuts in and out almost as if there's a bad signal. It seems to work fine inside the house but once I go outside, it becomes really bad. I pretty much have to stop my run because the the songs start to skip non stop. Sometimes it take 10 minutes to clear up. It really becomes annoying."
1,Love them
1,Bought a set of these for my wife and she loves them!  After I tried them out I immediately bought a set for myself.  Very good quality.  10/10 would recommend
1,USB charging cable supplied did not fit the headphones. I had to use the thinner port Android phone USB charging cable.
1,"Like many, I have owned several varieties of wireless headphones including Bose. These are the best product for the money!"
1,"Works great!  Easy to use!  I had some difficulty getting good reception at about 15 feet and by 20 feet from the device it was almost a no-go.  But, so long as I was close to the device I had no problems and the sound quality was great!  Ear buds felt very comfortable and came with several options.  A fully charged battery lasted 4.5 days with moderate listening.  Very pleased!  Would recommend and would buy again!"
1,"I'm so surprised with this product. It came out with a lot of extra stuff inside the box, and the sound is great as well. Highly recommend it."
1,Great Sound!!! High quality product at affordable price.  I had technical issues (operator error perhaps) and the company promptly replaced the unit!  Would highly recommend for the sound and product support.  Thank you Senso!
1,"This is the 4th pair of blue tooth headphones I've bought through amazon and they are by far my favorite!! They turn on in the shortest amount of time, the buttons are nice quality and easy to use and find. The multi device blue tooth pairing works the best of any headphones I've bought to date - coming online and connecting immediately to my phone and my iPad Pro one after the other and accepting a sound stream from either device without issue or complaint.  It was a pleasant surprise getting a car charger and multi cable that works both with the headphones and my apple devices!"
0,"Minus one star because I received an open box version. Minus another star because the sound quality was a little weird. Treble was higher, bass was slightly muted, and midtones were also slightly muted. I'm not an audiophile in any way but I was listening to The Postal Service's The District Sleeps Alone Tonight and it just sounded weird. Try it and maybe you might understand what I mean. Then again it could be that I got messed up headphones. Overall, the packaging, instructions, and overall design of the headphones are great. Also I did find the ear hooks were a bit big for my ears. Wish they were adjustable somehow.<br /><br />Update: I've had these for a year now and they started to glitch when connected to Bluetooth and wifi is on."
1,"I want to give them 5 stars but since I have just had them for a day, I don't know their durability yet. They are comfortable, easy to use, the distance for Bluetooth signal is strong, and the sound quality is very good. So 4 stars was easy to give. I have already recommended them to friends."
1,"The sound was great and I love that they are water proof, but they did not fit my ears. I have pretty small ears apparently. Even the small size didn't fit. Had to return."
1,Easy to pair with iPhone. Good sound quality. They stay in place on long runs.
1,"My fave pair of headphones! Sound is wonderful and bass is exploding! They don't stay in my ears as well as they should for a ""sport"" pair. The range is fantastic. I can go into other rooms and even outside and leave my device in another room."
1,"Used them for the first time at the gym and was totally impressed. The ear buds are very comfortable and blocks outside noise, the sound is great, and the Bluetooth range is fantastic. Highly recommend it."
0,"It was working just fine, but for a very short time. I worked for only 4 months, then it stopped charging altogether. I am very disappointed. It started getting unconnected after 2 months, but i didn't care and thought it was normal. But, today i stopped working suddenly. So sad."
1,"Great product, Excellent sound, and They are comfortable."
1,I received my SENSO Bluetooth Headphones and they are great!  I run outside and use them daily.  The sound is outstanding and the fit is perfect!
1,They are much more comfortable to wear than the earbuds that come with my iPhone.
1,Bluetooth works great. I've always had problems utilizing the technology in the past. Sound is very good. Bass is not the greatest but that's typical with earbuds. Setup and pairing was quick and easy. Battery duration for me has been 8+ hours. One con is the cord provided for recharge is only a couple of inches long. You may want to purchase a longer one. Overall I'm very happy with it. I plan to purchase a second pair to leave at my place of employment.
1,Great product well worth the money
1,Great sound excellent for working out stays comfortably in ear and lightweight truly satisfied with this product
0,Meh
1,"Awesome sound, have put about 30 miles of running and hundreds of miles biking on these."
0,The left ear piece had a humming in it. The feel is cheap and flimsy. They offered to replace them but I'm returning them.
0,Wore these less than 20 times and they stopped charging. Was really hoping that the product would be higher quality than it is. Very disappointed in this purchase.
1,"I bought these for my Boyfriend who was severely needing a new pair, as he constantly uses his headphones while he's working throughout his long shifts, and he's gone through 3 during the last few months alone.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Almost impossible to kill after extended use, the product suggests 8hrs of constant use, but it seems to be more of 12hrs!<br />-Charges very fast, but that might be because these headphones are impossible to kill.<br />-Voice quality on mic is excellent when taking phone calls.<br />-Excellent sound quality<br />-Offers different sized ear buds, which is a plus!<br />-Carrying case is nice, and perfect for traveling<br />-Made of wonderful material, feels good to wear for hours on end<br />-Very reasonable price!<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The only con he's even spoken of is that the range of the bluetooth is less than his old ones, but the quality more than makes up for the smaller range!<br /><br />Thank you!<br />-Happy Customer!"
1,Good but hard to wear lol
1,For the price these are outstanding. They sound pretty darn good.  The only issue is fit. If you have smaller ears these take some fidgeting to get secured.
1,They look and work just as well as the $150 Powerbeats by Dre.  They stay in your ear when running and connect via bluetooth effortlessly.  Music plays very well and gets loud.  Definitely recommend these over a used pair of Powerbeats.
1,"I did have a problem with the headphones not turning on , and yes, I have done the factory reset numerous times. HOWEVER, the customer service I received was great. I have a new pair of head phones out the next day, and they honor their warranty. I understand sometimes that products have a natural defect and explains my five star rating."
1,"They functioned as earbuds, but just not quite what I was hoping for.  I am a runner and when using these on the run they create a lot of wind noise.  For me, the left earpiece did not fit well and caused pain.  I changed out the tips, and the foam helped a bit, but not enough to make them comfortable for extended periods of time.  I never found a reliable way to hang them around my neck and they have fallen several times.  Not a deal breaker, but this could be fixed with a magnet or clip.  The thing that bothered my OCD the most was the fact that the volume buttons are backward.  You would think that the forward button would be volume up and back would be volume down, but you'd be wrong.  Plugging in the charging cable is stiff and you end up mashing some of the buttons in the process.  Not a huge deal, but as an OCD person it was dissatisfying.  They stayed on my ears quite well, and I had no difficulty keeping them on during runs."
1,"Impressed with product quality and ease of use. I’m not a techie and found the directions e-z to follow. You need to be “extra gentle” when connecting the small plug into the earpieces’ small port for charging. I made sure the plugin didn’t go in at a slight angle, which is very e-z to do.<br />Overall, this is a good product, at a reasonable price. I’ll recommend it to my friends. Well done!"
1,"These headphones do not hold a charge if you don't use them right after charging. Also, they do not stay connected to my apple watch. I thought the problem might be with the watch, but they connect to my phone, and my watch connects fine to my JBL speaker, so it has to be the headphones. The only way I can use these is if I charge them immediately before use, and with my phone only. Sound quality is good for the price."
1,"Top quality, sound great! I would say with confidence they they sound as good as Beats."
1,Good sound for a great price.
1,"These things are awesome. Just make sure you tweak your equalizer to treble boost as it sounds muffled without it. Other than that,<br />- Bass is great<br />- Fit is amazing, doesn't fall out<br />- Battery life is great, lasts a couple days<br />- Comes with nice little gifts<br />Bought 2"
1,The earbud is very comfortable and sound great.
0,"Bought these about a month ago and already don't work, I use them for the gym and working out but they would lose connectivity and/or wouldn't pair up with my Samsung galaxy s7.<br />So disappointed to be in the middle of a work out and these stop working.<br />Wouldn't recommend these!"
1,These head phone sound as good as my beats for $300. Wow you did it I'm loving them
1,great product for the price
1,decent sound okay product
0,Battery drain after 60 minutes + disconnected every 5 second after drining battery
1,Just received so used only a few times. So far Iʻm happy with purchase. Comfortable and mic audio is clear.
0,Don’t buy these. I’ve tried them twice and have been greatly disappointed both times. They DO NOT KEEP A CONNECTION. This is incredibly frustrating when you are using them for exercise which is for what they advertise them to be used. Total crap.
1,Greater
1,Good sound long lasting battery
1,"This is my first pair of bluetooth headphones, They stay connected even though you're around 20ft away from the device. One of my best purchases this year."
1,"Worth every penny. First off I was won over by a review from Cubichi. She was very thorough with her review. I have wanted something to workout in the gym with. I wasn't gonna spend all that money for Beats etc. So after reading her review I decided to give them a try. With prime they were ordered on a Friday evening and delivered on a Sunday afternoon. To be honest I didn't explore all the extra ear buds I just wanted to see how they sounded. Let me say they feel secure when warn and stay in place. The sound is great too! Good amount of bass without drowning out the highs. All around great sound for price. They come with a car charger, extra earbuds, some micro USB cord and cool case. Which is great for throwing it my gym bad. I'm over all impressed with the quality for the price. Now it's only been about 5 days so it remains to be seen how well they hold up.<br />P.S. they were charged when they arrived and snyced to my Android phone in seconds. I only use them about and hour at a time and on day five was my first day charging them. They were still going strong but i just figured it was time to charge them."
1,This paired with my wife’s iPhone easily.  She even did it. Nice ear phones.  She really liked the fit.  It’s better than the $100 ones everywhere else.
1,"Once I FINALLY got the product to work, I was generally underwhelmed by the overall product - sound is OK but not great. The earbuds do not remain stable on your ears with any real movement - wire pulls them out of place, the location of the buttons is awkward and documentation is terrible!!!!<br /><br />Because they were under $35 I will keep them as a back-up but would not recommend them to anyone who plans to use them for exercise, even walking."
0,"Good product,  but it didn't last much."
1,"Could be OK for most people. For one with little hard of hearing, there isn't much bass or other loudness. Had to consider returning."
1,"They work great. The sound is good, and they don't slip out of my ears."
0,an audible hum accompanies these uncomfortable earbuds when they are on. avoid them.
1,Love these!<br />I like the fit and quality of sound.<br />I like them more than my Skull Candy hearing device.
1,"The best Bluetooth headphones I have bought. Battery life is great and lasts long. What is even better is that these headphones charge really fast.  The headphones are flexible, especially around the ear, which make the headphones feel comfortable. Lastly, the quality of the sound is good and works well in the gym."
1,"Update: 8/14/2018 . . . I've had these a year and a half and they are still pretty amazing. No issues and perfect for my workouts. I went ahead and ordered a second set in case they go out of production at some point.<br />________________________________<br />Great for what I wanted. Sweat resistant, wireless, easy bluetooth connection, and priced right. The sound was great for the price. My first use I accidentally forgot my phone in the gym. Didn't realize it until I was about to get in the car and lost connection on my headphones.  Great range!  So far I have been very satisfied.<br /><br />They are a little bigger than some more expensive models, but not so much it would be worth the $100 price difference."
1,"Bought these based on reviews and they are just OK. Not impressed after a week of use. Battery life is not great, there are difficulties pairing with iPhone 7, haven’t worked out how to pair with my Apple Watch yet. Audio is spotty/choppy when out on a run, works better when connected to WiFi. Lastly, they are huge! They do not fit well on my ears."
0,"If possible I can give 0 Star out of 5. This headphones was good for couple of months when I bought it first time then a notified them in listening time it was shutting off every 2-3 minutes then they replaced to me with new headphones. This new headphones did same things it was good for couple of months and from couple of days my headphone’s left side not working, and now my warranty also expired. That’s why I’m telling you guys don’t waste your money."
1,"amazing, love them they are the best"
1,"Great product, good sound quality. super easy to set up and connect to my iPhone. Would definitely buy again."
1,"They sound and work great!  I've worn them several times at the gym and, as long as the volume is turned up, I can't hear others or the standard gym music.  It's easy to adjust the volume on the headphones while wearing them, too.<br /><br />Update: 5/10/18<br />Purchased early May '17 and they're still going strong.  I've had no problems whatsoever.<br /><br />Update: 6/27/19<br />One of the best purchases made!  These still sound great!"
1,Good
0,The earphones barely lasted before they stopped taking a charge.
1,I'm finally able to get erections again....the sound changed my life. I don't know how I lived without these. Bitches
1,Excellent battery life. Great sound. I really enjoy not having to connect a wire to my phone. Had an issue after 4 months of use where the main power button somehow got stuck and wouldn't power on. Contacted the company. Within a few days they sent out a replacement set. You can't ask for better customer service than that! They have gained a loyal customer should I need any of their products in the future!
1,"Wow!  These headphones sound great!  Will test them out in the gym tonight.  ****Update, these bad boys are still  rocking.  If you can still purchase using the Facebook code, jump on it.  Well worth the money."
1,"Charged them once right when I got them, haven't had to charge them since."
1,Great sound
1,"Good product, but the charge is fairly short.  Not the headphone developers fault since this is due to size and battery life in general.  Great sound, easy to use and can't be the price!"
1,"I recently purchased a pair of SENSO Bluetooth Headphones for my mom, and I own a pair myself. I really like these headphones. The sound is great and the bass is deep when it should be. Phone calls are clear and crisp and there is no outside noise. They fit very well and are really comfortable. Plus I don't have to worry about messing them up when i'm working out as they are sweat-proof/waterproof. And to top it off, included with the headphones are two charging cables, a bunch of ear buds, and a car charger with two USB ports, which is so convenient to me!"
0,Uncomfortable. Too bulky. Don’t fit.
1,Very comfortable and great deal with the lighting IPhone charger + dual car charger port that comes with it
1,"After my LG headphone finally failed after five years I decided to give this set a try and I have been very pleased.  Quick delivery but more important great performance.  Excellent sound, long range, and easy controls.  Its been easy to pair with my iPhone 6 and quite a deal.  Good phones and good people to work with."
0,"Lasted about 4 months before the left earbud died. Every time I turn my head, the music cuts out. I sent an email to Invotek a week ago, and they haven't responded."
1,I originally got these for myself but my daughter decided she wanted them and she is happy with them
1,They are great! Two years later they still work fine!
1,"I haven't had a chance to use them too much, but so far they are great. I was a little worried about how they'd feel, but they are actually really comfortable. I even ran around a little and they didn't budge! Would definitely recommend and they even arrived several days earlier than expected."
1,Love these! Sound quality is good and I have not noticed a lot of noise interference. I would highly recommend especially at such a great price. Shipping was fast and seller was easy to work wth.
1,"Not being either at the cutting edge or bleeding edge of Tech, I don't go run out buying the latest & greatest just to keep up with the Jones'.<br /><br />Music is very therapeutic to me, so I purchased these for the HD sound quality primarily. The hands free call capability was secondary and more a 'perk'.<br /><br />Bottom line;<br />Sound quality is wonderful and I am very pleased.<br /><br />Bluetooth hands free is at the complete opposite end of spectrum. Absolutely no 'good way' to wear these to make BT calling functional. MIC is placed in the absolute  worst spot and nothing you can do to improve it. As a male, I have a deep voice that carries well and doesn't benefit me one bit in regards to the MIC placement for BT hands free calling.<br /><br />Buy these for the exceptional sounding  music.<br />Buy something else if BT hands free calling is also as important as the HD music quality."
1,I love the quality of these headphones
1,For just $20 you get 90% of what you would normally get from another brand that cost 5x to10× more.
0,"Bought a pair for my  niece in  Norway. The left side quit working and cannot send back, not guaranteed for even a year."
1,I just got these but they seem to work well. They are very comfortable & sync easily.
1,"I am in lobe with this item, i was not sure if was going to be worthy. But, honestly I am impressed. They are good looking and the sound is super loud and crispy, all the accessories are really nice."
0,Very poor product.  The reception is so weak even if your phone is in the pocket
1,Sound is OK but fit is not so good.  The &#34;over the ear&#34; piece is much to soft / malleable and doesn't stay on my ear.  I got these mainly for audible/eBooks on my Kindle and the sound is fine for that and I love the flexibility I have with them being wireless (not tethered to my Kindle and can walk around).
0,The headphones work great as far as receiving audio and fitting my ear. However the mic is horrible. I can never make a phone call using these because they caller can hardly hear me.
1,The sound quality is excellent. The mic is average.
0,They will detach when running.
1,Nice earbuds. Well made. I don't know what the other $165.00 is for to buy Beats.
1,Excellent wireless headphones. Great fit and sound. Easy to use controls
1,Great price point for this product.  The headphones work well with my iPhone and I appreciate the higher level of volume.
1,This pair of headphones worked great in my first run.  They did not come off my ear or have any trouble staying in place during my run.  The sound quality is good and had no trouble connecting the Bluetooth connection with my phone.  The shipping was fast and was delivered when expected.
1,Sound quality is amazing for the price and I love how you can adjust the part that holds it to your ear.  Perfect for running.
0,"I would have given them 5 starts if they would not have broken after a few months. They won't connect to my phone's blue tooth anymore!! And I know it's not my phone, because it connects to my car just fine. So mad, guess I'm  just going to spend a $100 on some quality headphones like bose or beats. But other than that these have great sound and fit."
1,"These are great in the gym.  No more dangling, tangling cords.  However any time I've attempted to wear them on outdoor runs, they have created so much wind noise I had to take them off.  So much of the earpiece sticks out from your ear that the wind just whistles around it.  No matter how perfectly the earpiece fits, you can't dampen the wind noise.  I have worn Westone UM-1s for years and they fit my ears perfectly.  The IEM with a &#34;foamy&#34; Comply eartip is the best combination.  it sits inside my ear, they isolate well, stay in place perfectly, and the braided cable dampens cable noise.  I will continue my search for a similar in-ear monitor with bluetooth."
1,"I am very much enjoying my new headphones.  Bought them for use at the gym and they work great.  The cord, I am still getting used to but the sound quality, ease of pairing and battery life are EXCELLENT. Very good value, especially for the price - and I did not want to pay upwards of $70 for headphones!  Glad I purchased these."
1,I bought these specifically to workout in and they have not disappointed. They stay in place even when doing Olympic lifts
1,It is a great product and works perfect with my phone and tablet!!! great gadget
1,"They worked well for the first few months that I've had them.... but recently they've begun to short out when I get to sweaty at the gym :(  They slip off somewhat easily because the hooks are a soft material but they generally worked great, especially for the price."
1,"The fact that these headphones are under $25 is ridiculous! The noise cancellation on these guys are insane. The sound quality is great. Although the sound quality could be a little better, for sub $25, the sound quality is an absolute steal. I have owned a pair of Beats Headphones in the past and these are honestly comparable in terms of noise cancellation, if not better, but the Senso headphones are a little inferior to Beats in terms of sound quality. Taking into consideration the price point and the quality of Senso headphones, I would buy these over any other headphones in a heart beat.<br />WARRANTY: The right earbud just recently stopped working after about 5 months, but the customer service team responded quickly and was able to offer me a replacement pair in about 20 minutes time after exchanging e-mails. Great service and a great product. Highly recommend."
0,"This is my second pair... First pair lasted for 2 years and final wore out from pretty much continuous use.  Unfortunately, in my new pair the charging port broke after minimal use.  Not sure if it was defective or not but now they can no longer be charged."
1,"Excellent service provided by Senso, very good product warranty and customer service."
1,"Despite an issue with the headset not charging or powering on, the customer service is great and honors their 1yr warranty. I understand these things happen, a great customer service team makes or breaks a reputation. Great job and thank you!"
0,"Sweat proof (though they get slippery after a couple hours)! Great battery life, and the only ones that have lasted this long!<br /><br />Edit. They are starting to short out at just under a year!!!!"
1,for the price these are the best earphones i have owned. fit well great sound.
1,"high quality..... friday i lost them but this morning i found it in the parking lot, out for a rainy weekend . They were litteraly swimming inthe water.<br />i took it from the ground and they still working even with light battery charge! amazing!"
1,These fit very comfortably in my opinion. They look &#34;bulky&#34; in the picture but their not. Honestly can't even tell your wearing them. Sound quality. . . A bit much for me with the bass but I'm 43 so that's probably why. I downloaded a eq (kinda inconvenient) but that fixed that.
1,Construction worker defenetly help's jeep unwanted noise out.
1,"I love these. I use them everyday, especially when I work out."
0,"These earphones lasted about three months.  Now they are just dead.  The battery won't recharge at all.  The sound quality was always pretty 'meh' from the beginning, but the most irritating thing about these earbuds was that they couldn't hold a connection with the sound source without cutting in and out CONSTANTLY.  That was a problem from the beginning, so while I love the convenience of bluetooth and hands free, the quality is not very good.  If these were $10 headset, I wouldn't even complain, but at almost $30, I expect a bit more."
0,Obviously bought these one year ago and was really excited about the price vs performance ratio.  Low price and for that low price really nice sound with good base.  The problem?  They completely stopped functioning four days after the warranty expired.  These guys have got built-in functional obsolescence down to a science.
1,These headphones are great! The sound quality is amazing and I like that they actually stay on your ears while running.
1,Me encanto!!!!
1,these head phones are the bomb fully sweat proof and good sound quality !
1,I've gone through several types of wireless headphones and so far these are the best. They don't fall out of your ear and the sound quality is excellent. The part that hooks on your ear is light and seems almost flimsy but it gives just enough support to secure the headphone to your ear. This has the added benefit of not digging into or hurting the part of your ear that the headphone hooks onto. Highly recommended .
1,need to add a small weight to the cord to keep it from snagging on my skin when I sweat. otherwise it is pretty good.<br /><br />like the controls very easy to use. would recommend for others.<br />the fact that these are waterproof is a bonus especially here in Louisiana.<br /><br />I bought them in August of last year Andy they will not hold a charge now. Contacting mfg to see if I can fix them.<br /><br />Would by again.
0,"Keeps loosing the connection, even when my phone is located on my body.<br />I'm returning the device."
1,"At first I liked it, but then after a few months of using it, the right speaker started to not work so well. Also, the &#34;dialing last number that you dialed&#34; feature when you're trying to turn it on or off can be a bit frustrating."
1,The product didn't fit over my ears so needed to return. It's too bad they aren't adjustable.
0,Product did not come with all promised accesories.
1,Hook for ear loop is made of rubber and flimsy. Good overall sound quality.
0,cannot recharge with the use of usb capable charging port that was provided.
1,Just received these headphones and my fourteen year old son is very happy!  He loves the way they fit and sound. So far we are very happy with this purchase.
1,"I bought these headphones almost two month's ago.  They're the first Bluetooth pair I have owned.  Pairing it to my IPOD was a breeze.  The sound is really impressive along with the battery life between re-charges.  I work out about  an hour and 15 minutes a day 5-6 days a week and charge them once a week and have never ran out of juice.  The distance they stay connected to my IPOD is pretty impressive too.  I'd say at least 30 feet or more.  But as good as the device is (or was) that's not the only reason for the 5 stars it's also because of the outstanding customer service. .  If I could give them a higher rating I would.  Last week they stopped working, I thought maybe they were dead because it was close to the end of the week and I had worked out a couple of days longer during the week. Came home hooked them up to charge and the indicator showed fully charge?  Soon as I disconnected the charge indicator went out and they would not power on.  Tried another cord and power source and no change.  I contacted INVOTEK to see what I next step was because of the year warranty.  Adam responded in less than 24 hours with instructions on how to reset the headphones to see if that would work.  I tried the procedures and they did not work then notified Adam.  Again in less than 24 hours Adam responded letting me know a new pair had been shipped.  Though the headphones stopped working I would still recommend them.  I really like the sound and the charge life.  But also because INVOTEK's customer service is unreal.  You just don't see that anymore."
1,"Work well, sounds good but a little clunkey to operate."
1,Works exactly as stated. Easy to pair and the sound is great. Had a small issue with charging and the customer support could not be better. So fat I have been using them for a couple of days and am very happy. We will see how they work after awhile. This is my 2nd pair and they work as great as my 1st pair.
1,Absolutely LOVE these headphones. As a runner these are by far the best that stay in your ears with excellent sound quality.
1,"Sound quality is decent, and for the price paid for them, you can't beat that. although, I could barely go 10 feet without it losing connection. Not the best when it comes to talking on the phone. overall, you get what you paid for."
1,"Had a bit of an issue at first, but the tech support was top notch! Got em working well now. Had them for a few months now and have been happy with them."
0,"Suddenly stopped working after one month - the day after the return window closed.  Won't charge, pair, or connect to my PC fro update."
0,The ear hooks are CHEAP - one stopped working and the bud won't stay in my ear when I move (the wire inside the hook broke).  The headphones are less than 2 months old and I used them very normally and carefully.  I called the company and sent in an email with photos (as instructed) and they told me I broke it so it was not covered by warranty.  Really????  I've own many other brands in the past many years - never had a problem (these were a gift for Christmas).  AWFUL customer service and AWFUL product.
1,"I bought last year, nice headphone, but before the first year it stopped working."
1,"Great product, well worth the price. Will buy it again"
0,"This product is defective right out of the box. I received my headphones today and I have tried everything I can to turn them on but they simply don't work. When I press and hold the multifunction button, nothing happens. I plugged them in thinking they needed to be charged out of the box but the solid blue light comes up indicating a full charge. Will be returning."
1,"Great sound, comfortable on the ears, and light weight make it great for sports."
1,"Purchased them for my Peloton Bike.  Easy to sync, great sound quality and the perfect price."
0,"The earpiece would not begin to hold them on your ear,  I made many attempts  it was useless,  I returned item.  I thought they sounded pretty good, but not something useable."
1,"I have only used the headphones once so far, but they worked wonderfully. The item arrived very quickly. The instructions were clear. The sound was clear and I thought they blocked outside noise very well."
0,Ear hooks are too large and flimsy. They hover above my ear and do not provide any kind of support.<br />Sound quality is fine.
1,they're very comfortable I don't use them much but it has been great so far
1,"Pairs well, long battery life, pretty long distance range (I can be halfway across the gym, and it will still be connected)."
1,work great.
1,"Great earbuds, they fit really well. In addition, the Mic works flawlessly."
0,"so far so good, sound quality good. connecting via bluetooth very fast. the range is great. i can go anywhere in my apartment.  i'm giving a 4 out 5 rating because not enough time has passed yet.  i am very pleased with the purchase but only time will tell if this is truly a good product. well after about a year of CAREFUL use, they keep connecting then disconnecting over and over and over.  I give this product a ""1"" because I took very good care of these headphones and now they are faulty to where I can no longer use them.  I'm glad I only paid $30.  That's all they're worth...."
1,Easy to use. Sound quality is decent for the price.
1,"Really amazing sound.  I bought another Bluetooth headset for much more money just before I got these. Dang! These are soooo much better. Nice balance and depth. Even the packaging is better, straight forward."
1,"For the cost, these are hard to beat! good sound, easy to charge and convent carrying case is provided."
1,Hello...this is the second set I got the first one I got for Christmas but I came out of my van at a gas station and t fell out and another car rolled over it destroying one of the earpieces...So after 3 replacements that totally did not work I decided  to get another one.  It holds charge really well for hours unlike the others and the clarity is amazing really great product for me because I work with my hands and I am in the road alot..wish the cord at back of head was a stiffer material though .... but I would totally recommend.....
0,Liked these while they worked but after 3 months of light use they stopped connecting to my phone.
1,Loved it.
1,I really enjoy this product. The headset malfunctioned and the support staff where quite courteous and helpful. My warranted headset was sent out immediately. Thank you!
1,"They have a great sound. I do have one major problem with the headphones. Because the piece around the ear is very flexible, I'm having a problem keeping them in my ears. I have tried all 4 ear tips in the package. What do you suggest I do? I do wear glasses, but even without my glasses I have an issue."
1,"I purchased headphones for my nephew. He loves them! The design is great and the sound he gets is perfect. I also had follow up letter with the seller to make sure we were happy with them, I found this very professional and helpful! Thank you"
1,What a great purchase! These sound great and are super light!! A great fit and stay put on my runs.
1,I wish the little voice would tell you how charged it is and the mic is meh. I sound far away on the other line. The headphones are really really good despite those 2 things. Wish it came with a wall adapter. Is has a charge cord but no wall plug.
1,Love it. The sound is very good in comparison to other bluetooth ones that I ordered and couldn't stand
1,Just put them on!  They speak for themselves!!  The sound was spot on. I felt like I was there. And the adjustable ear piece fits perfect.  Im very small and these didnt fall off!!.  They are my favorite and I would recommend them to anyone that likes to have their tunes when on the go!!!
1,Got these for my husband and he loves. A little bigger and bunker than expected but definitely no issue. Very loud and he loves how they go around your ear to stay on. He lifts heavy and does cardio and he approves
1,Nice unit
1,Love it. Excellent sound quality. Stays on ears great. Simple to use. High quality without paying too much. Worth it!
1,Great sound quality for the price
1,THESE ARE AWESOME FOR THE PRICE
0,Nope. Don’t don’t do it. Decently made but sounds like garbage. Buy the Anker brand.
1,"Very comfortable wearing . I had a concern about them fitting underneath my bike helmet but not a problem . Sound , to these old ears sounds great ."
1,Great for the price
1,Boyfriend loves these!!! The sound is amazing and so comfortable!!! These are so awesomesauce!!! Don't let the low price fool you. This is a great product!
0,Lose signal repeatedly with a distance of less than 3 feet from source to receiver. Battery life is poor too.<br />Avoid.
1,My husband loves them very happy
1,good earphone
1,"I am first time user of the Senso bluetooth product they are one of the best at market,  with in a month of my purchase the product was broker due to my negligence in keeping them at my bag.<br /><br />But when i spoke to Senso customer care they taken my concern as priority and sending the new bluetooth headphones back as replacement to me.<br /><br />The Support is A1 class by senso. I really appreciate your support senso."
0,"crappy, quit charging after a couple of months"
1,Llegaron en buen estado!
1,Everything came in perfect condition. I love this product.<br />The time it arrived was prompt and professional. Thank you! I will order a couple more.  😇👍🏼
1,Husband and son loves this
1,"There are many things to like about these bluetooth headset, starting with the price and the included accessories (even a phone car holder).  But in the end, I find it to be just &#34;okay&#34; because the mic sound isn't great and the wind blowing in the cables makes so much noise in my ears that I find it unusable for running."
1,"Does the job! Nothing crazy nice, but they do it. C'mon, it was $30 or so"
1,Excellent for the price i paid. I use for my bike ride (mountain bike).<br />Only rason i didn't give 5 stars its because the cord that connect the 2 ear pieces stick to my neck when sweaty.
0,"It stopped working after 5 times of use, like it burned"
1,"It performed great. The sound qualit for the price was good enough. Just after a year of using, left side went. The problem was the flat cable connecting to it is damaged somehow. I dont see any visible bends or damage."
1,Not a good purchase for an adult. Maybe for a child that doesn’t care for quality.
1,"The only slight issue I had with these headphones was initially the fit took some time to get used to. Other than that zero complaints, great value for money"
0,"Worked great for a month, then completely died. No warning. Just a dead set of ear buds.<br />Be sure to register these things...you will be sorry if you don't."
0,"Really enjoyed using these headphones while doing yard work but after a few months of use, the charging port would no longer accept the cable to charge.  I'm assuming something is bent inside but I can't see it.  I felt they were comfortable, held a good charge and the sound quality was acceptable for what I used them for.  However, due to the charging port issue, I would not purchase again."
1,"I love these! They are super comfortable, the audio is clear, and they don't block out all sound but the majority. I actually used them to play low music to block out the noise of my kids so that I could work on my school work. I could hear just enough to catch them arguing, but they blocked out all the other sounds so that I could focus."
1,"I just wanted a set of BT headphones for night time gaming and not waking the family. Mic and phone functionality was a plus as I can use them riding my bike to work.<br />I went with the &#34;#1 Top Seller!&#34; figuring a zillion Amazon buyers couldn't be wrong, right? Nope.<br /><br />These will be ok for some people - and in truth, they were ok for my original gaming objective. But their portability had me trying them out for general headphone use and that's where they fall flat on their face.<br />Some quick background before I continue: that job I ride my bike to?  I'm a professional television video editor by trade, and for better or worse, the last 15 years have left me with no tolerance for substandard audio quality.  I'm not an audiophile or sound snob. I just can't handle muddy sound. I tried to like these earbuds - I really did. Even considering the price, their boomy bass, yet midrange-heavy sound and lack of separation had me aching to get back to my wired Sonys. The Sensos went back to Amazon within a few days.<br />If you're just listing to dialogue or phone calls​, these might do the trick, but they fall well short when music comes into play."
1,"These are amazing earbuds in terms of sound, comfort, battery life, range and ease of use, and the customer support team at Senso could not be more responsive or helpful.  I am happy to recommend their product and service without reservation."
0,Used these for two months before they started dying at 30% and not holding a charge. 2.5 months now and they’re not working at all. Would have rather paid $100 and gotten the Beats.
1,"Have had for over a year now and have been excellent. Sound is great, for the price I paid feel like I got a steal of a deal!"
1,"So far they are awesome, I am very picky with headphones and need something that stays put. I run with them and sweat a lot and they are holding up great!"
0,What I dislike about this product is that the sound quality was bad. And the battery life is short.
1,"I love the quality of the earphones and the bunch of accessories in the box.<br /><br />The only problems is the rubber around the ear supports are too big for my ears and the earphones fall off every now and then. Also, I wanted a pair of earphones for quality music listening. For the price these are great, but I feel I would go for something higher in range and return this pair."
1,I really like and recommend these headphones
1,I bought these in 2017.<br />I used them in the gym all the time and im a gym rat. I go 5-6 days a week up to 2 hours at a time.<br />I can tell you right now these are better than your $200 fashion status Dre Beats or your Blows i mean Bose headphones.
1,fast shgipping works great last a long time sounds time
1,They were a birthday gift for my husband and he absolutely loves them
0,"This is my second pair of these earphones. They work fine until they don’t. The first pair starting shutting off after only an hour or so. I would charge them and again, after an hour they would shutdown. Since I didn’t know what was wrong if anything I continued this loop for a month or so. I call the company and was told that they were out of warranty by a couple of weeks.<br /><br />Since the phones worked well in the beginning and were rated so well, I thought they were lemons. So I bought another pair. Guess what, the same thing happened exactly again. This time I tried recharging for a week or so. When I decided thta the same thing was happening again I checked my Amazon purchase and found they were out of the year warranty by 2 days. Called the company and they refused to warranty.<br /><br />Batteries seem to be a problem with many, maybe all of these types of phones. I WII NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN."
1,Love it.  Very light and clear ..........
1,I have been looking for a good set of headphones that actually stay in while working out. I have tried different kinds but these by far are the best. I like the hook around the ear because they stay on my ear very well. I also love that they come with a car charger for iPhone and headphones so I can charge them at the same time on my way to gym. The battery life is great I have only charged them one time and while connected to Bluetooth the battery life shows up on my phone which I think is a great feature.  I highly recommend these!
1,"Love these headphones! Good bass, clarity and comfortable. Received them on time. Great service. Bought another pair I liked them so well"
1,I really like the quality of sound and the extensive battery life. I bought another pair as a gift
1,Good sound for price
0,"They worked well and I thought the battery life was great but I don't think the battery level alert works well on my pair. I checked them before a workout and it showed it was almost fully charged but then halfway through my workout, it said low battery and then died. That was a little annoying but I figured I could work around that and just charge it more often. Then yesterday, it just randomly would stop connecting. I would be in the middle of a song and it would disconnect and I had trouble reconnecting it. I tried turning them off and then back on but it took forever to even turn them off. I restarted my phone as well. It finally reconnected and lasted about 45 seconds before it disconnected again and I just couldn't be bothered to do the whole process again. I've had these a month and definitely do not recommend buying. Yes, they were a good price but they should last longer than 1 month."
1,I have used these almost daily for 3 months and they are great.  You can't go wrong for the price.  The sound quality is good.  They hold a charge great and they charge quick. They are comfortable in the ear and they stay put when running or working out. I have had zero issues with syncing them to my iPhone . I'm sure there are better sounding headphones out there but certainly not for this price!
1,"I use these when doing yardwork, the sound quality is fantastic for the price, I'd say these are easily worth 80+ for the quality and battery life. I have regularly gotten over 8 hours of battery on these (closer to 10) per charge. I can comfortably wear these for 5+ hours at a time and I don't like most earbuds."
1,These just arrived so I don't have long-term opinion on them yet. They are comfortable and sound good. The quality seems to be very good. One of the things I was drawn to was longer battery life because that was the one issue I've heard for the other products in this style. They are much less then some of the others yet quality is definitely not lacking. If anything i feel they are better then the leading brand that go for three times the price. I say get them at this price. I'll add if I find anything that changes my opinion. Great product and value. Thank you
1,"These headphones are amazing. They have a pretty long battery life and they're comfortable to wear. The cord is just long enough without being bothersome. They stand up to sweat and water pretty well. They basically plug your ear to help with noise-cancelling, which is a weird sensation that will probably bother some people."
1,"Product reviews are everything when considering a new product you are unfamiliar with it. I listen to a lot of music, but not enough that I justify buying a more &#34;name&#34; brand product. I saw that there were 11,000 review of this a it drew me instantly. I have had the headphones for a few days and have done a workout in them...I can say I wish I had got this sooner. I never realize how much that cord can be a nuance. This is the future..that is here now. Highly recommend."
1,The ear phones are really great  and the connectivity is  so smooth that it connects in just a click
1,I love them. Perfect for running. Very comfortable
1,Very good sound.  They stay in my ears even with exercise so a nice tight fit.I basically have to carry my phone with me for them to stay clear and connected. We have a metal drying clothes rack. if my tablet or phone are one the other side the connection is intermittent. If I go into another room it cuts off. I've had them for about a month. The charge lasts about 3 hours for me.
1,Love it ! block out noise the bass is awesome
1,This is a very nice pair of Bluetooth headphones. They pair with my iPhone 6S perfectly. Good battery life and easy controls make this the one to get.
1,"good headphones for its price, wish their was a way to determine how much it has charged"
0,Connectivity is spotty.  but for the price it tolerable
1,"Sound is great, and the headphones themselves are very comfortable.  However, mine broke after about a month of constant use - I was unable to charge them.  Emailed customer service, who responded quickly and professionally, and sent me a replacement, no hassle!  I would definitely purchase another one of their products!"
1,I find them bit bulky on ears. It does take sometime to adjust it to your ears.<br />I think I will return it and look for something less bulkier.
0,"I'm bit disappointed with the product. I use it for my office conference and hear disturbances.... like someone is hammering the wood in the background, and hissss noise. Also, compared to other wired earbuds (iphone/samsung), I've to raise the volume of this higher to hear voice properly."
1,The Bluetooth capabilities is limited I'm over 6ft and if I have my phone or ionic on my left side of my body it loses connection I have to keep it on the same side as the right headset that has the Bluetooth
1,"This Bluetooth headphone is great, came packaged nicely, came with an extra charger. The quality is awesome. Stays on and in the ear well. Comes with extra ear pieces."
1,Excellent value and works like a charm!
1,"I love these headphones...they're comfortable in my ear while lifting weights, doing cardio or simply walking. Controls are readily accessible and work with ease. Initially after I had a connectivity problem in a certain area around my home that I didn't have with another headset. A quick response from their support team solved that issue. I added the bass booster from my phone's equalizer and now the sound is just perfect. Definitely a great buy."
1,These headphones have been great! The sound quality is good and I haven't had them die during a run yet. They even worked perfectly after a trip to through the washer. I highly recommend them!
1,"So far, so good! I really need to test them out with a tub, but on my walks, they have worked perfectly. We're easy to pair and fit snugly in my ears."
1,I love my headset
1,Great product for the price
1,decent sound.  It's not Bose or Beats but for it's price you can't beat it.
0,Ok. So I'm noggin. Listening to my favs. All of a sudden MOTHER NATURE decides to have a downpour. They got wet and intermittently worked. Besides sound quality 10 being the best these are a 5.
1,"Good headphones. Wore on a 26 mile bike ride and they stayed in and my ears were not sore from them. I only wish the part that goes around the eat was adjustable as they didn't touch my small ears. Overall, very happy with my purchase!"
1,No problems and the sound quality and volume were fantastic for the cost
1,"First Bluetooth headphone I ever owned, they sound awesome fit perfectly and never fall out! Great price great product!"
1,"The sound quality is decent for the price. Actually, the quality is probably better than the pair of Beats my boyfriend owns. I'm most impressed by how long they last after a single charge. I use these for about an hour at a time a few times a week when I work out and they still last me without having to charge frequently. The design fits comfortably around my ears and is easy to use. Best pair of active headphones I've owned so far."
1,"Excellent sound.<br />A little clunky in the ears<br />Not as many features as I'd like to see.<br />For instance,  push button for voice activation.<br /> But again. Excellent  sound.<br />Great headphones for the price."
1,Audio is incredible. Sounds just as good as other wired headphones at much less cost. Fit seems to be pretty good too even on long sweaty runs.
0,"Buyer Beware. Product will no longer charge, didn't even last 6 months. Past the window for any exchange or refund. Not worth the money and now will just be added to a land fill."
1,I use it when walking for exercise and around the house.  works very well except occasionally when I am on a different floor of the house than the cell phone listening to pandora.
1,"Great product, no complaints.  Very pleased for the price!!!"
1,Great quality for the price!  Awesome sound quality and fit comfortably and snugly in the ears.  I've had them for a few weeks now and use them often.
0,"Disappointed, this seemed promising in durability but these broke after one month of use.<br /><br />I only used it for the gym, and i went twice a week for roughly 1-2 hours per session. Activities were running and lifting weights. Fit snug and stayed on, sound was fine, but unfortunately only have one side working after a month."
0,Turn on/off button stopped working less than 3 months after casual use.
1,nice product
1,Great headphones with great sound. I like that they came with a case and all of the cable and charging components that you could want including a car charger.
1,"I've used these at the gym and they stay on even with vigorous exercise. Easy on the ears, and the sound is fabulous! It come with extra ear inserts so you can size to your ears, very nice!"
0,Not for small ears.
1,Staticky
1,"Originally I had rated these headphones 2 out of 5 stars due to quality control issues, as I had purchased and returned two pairs, both with faulty ear buds (crackled when inward pressure is added placing on ears, or pressing buttons when on ears).  Invotek had reached out  soon after my review, and has shown to provide excellent customer service support for their product.  They really tried providing me a replacement pair without this defect, and several more pairs were sent back and forth.  Unfortunately, all pairs had varying degrees of that defect.  Perhaps they were all from the same defective batch?  Dunno.  I have been using the last pair on and off at the gym for two months now, and they do an OK job.  But often sound muddy, and both ear buds still crackle.  None the less I give them a 4/5 now for a decent product (3 stars) and 1 star for EXCELLENT support.  If Invotek reads up on this review and believes another replacement at this time might resolve these issues, please let me know."
1,"Great set, I use these to work out and they are perfect."
0,"pretty mediocre sound, and don't stay on my ears when working out"
1,Excellent customer service when I received a faulty pair of headphones!
1,Cant beat the sound and quality for the price..Will buy gain!
1,Great product and they sound better then beats and much cheaper.  I am very happy with them.  I would recommend these to a friend.
0,Just received these headphones....they work great except for the volume!  WAY TOO LOUD!  I don't have it higher than one bar and they are blasting in my ear.  2 bars would be too much.  No way to adjust the volume.  Otherwise fit and everything would be perfect.  Such a disappointment.
1,"Love these headphones so. Much I actually purchased 2. Use them for the gym and to watch TV while the wife and baby sleeps. The sound is as loud and as crisp $150 headphones. Also, the customer support is great contacted Invotek by E-mail and they responded literally in 30 minutes.  These are a must must buy."
1,"I am using the headphones to listen to podcasts in Spanish as part of my language learning experience. The headphones allow me to hear clearly, even over a lot of noise - such as when I am mowing the lawn."
1,"I didn’t know what to expect when ordering I was just looking for a cheap pair of head phones to sweat in at the gym, for 30 bucks you get just that and a little more the product seems pretty good quality the sound is better than expected not better than my beats wireless 3 but higher than average and on top you get a bunch of neat accessories will update review after I sweat in them good a couple times but as of now five stars"
1,quick linkup with blue tooth slammed in car door will order again i ue for work actually took back me beats earbuds paid $200 for glad i did ....
0,The quality is not well! I have used these several times! Now a side can't listen to nothing!
1,"Absolutely great. Comfortable and secure in my ears, came with lots of useful stuff like a really nice case, wonderful sound quality and noise canceling! Wonderful."
1,So far so good!
1,Light
1,Great for bike riding!
1,"These are amazing. The sound quality is great and they have lasted through my ridiculous abuse at the gym, hiking, throwing around, etc. I'll buy these again when they do give in!"
1,"I've had these for a couple months, and for the price I'd say they hold up great! Sound quality is as great as my beats by Dre, Apple headphones, and Samsung headphones. Noise cancellation is great, and most of all they stay put while I work out. These babies don't even budge through my sweaty 4 mile runs! It doesn't take long for a full charge, I use these every day and charge them once a week! Also I like that I can walk a reasonable distance away from my phone without the Bluetooth cutting out."
1,"This ear buds are awesome! Super long battery life, actually has very good outside noise cancellation and cannot be beaten for the price offered"
1,Have had these head phone for over two weeks now.  I have used them now every day from listening to podcast and talking on the phone.  They are crisp and clear to hear what is going on.  The ear piece fits nice and the over the ear rubber piece i really love. It does not rub or irritate the ear when wearing for an extended length of time.  The battery time also holds and does a quick recharge also.
1,"EDIT UPDATE: Nov 2018, still going strong. I work out 5-6 times a week.<br /><br />I've owned 3 different types of 'waterproof' bluetooth headphones. Skullcandy, JBL, and plantronics I think. All of them stopped working within 4 months. I wanted to give at least that time frame for these and they have been outstanding, and they are at least half the price of any of my previous purchases. Highly recommended. I sweat a lot!, No issues and I like the little extras that come with set. Very surprised but with all the others failing, I had nothing to lose."
1,Have these already for myself. Bought this time as a gift.  I love them.  Use them to watch shows on my iPad. Can move around without being attached!
1,I bought these for my son to use during his boxing class. He loves them! They came with some great accessories and an excellent dual charger.Would recommend them to anyone!
1,"I've never written a product review, but I love these headphones. I was looking for a cheap pair of bluetooth headphones to test out if I liked the bluetooth and these have worked perfectly. The battery lasts as advertised, after almost six months of use 5-6 times per week the battery life has not deteriorated. And I'm typically working out with them so they are not being treated nicely! Lots of sweat and the quality hasn't deteriorated at all. I thought I would have to replace after only a few months. The ear piece is a little bulky looking, but it doesn't bother me because the adjustable ear hook means they fit snugly and I've had no problems with them coming out during any type of exercise from running to HIIT to box jumps etc. I'll take the bulky ear piece over a box on the cord that would always be swinging around. I'm not really a sound expert so I can't really comment on that, but I've had no issues with sound quality. Great purchase!"
1,"Great product, arrived on time, so far so good no issues."
1,Excellent!
1,⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
1,"I'm usually a fan of headphones, but these earbuds work great. They're lightweight, loud, and hold a good charge. The sound quality is pretty good, but lacks the fullness you get from traditional headphones, but the just personal preference.<br /> The only issues I've encountered are that the rubber ear peice that hooks the ear isn't adjustable and just a little too big for my ears. Plus the rubber material it's made of, especially when you have only one ear peice in, get caught on the back of my neck and tugs at my ear whenever I turn my head. Small gripes that you don't think of at first but can take a while to adjust to."
1,"Battery life is good. Some trouble connecting to Bluetooth and staying connected. Good sound, bass is good."
1,"I love these headphones. Great sound, very comfortable, excellent price. Exceeded expectations."
0,Battery lasts about 3 hours at the most.
1,These are the best Bluetooth headphones that I've used yet. I drive truck and people on the other end can hear pretty clearly. The only thing I find is that if using just 1 ear piece the cord gets in the way. Also if it's really windy there is that annoying wind sound.
1,Great looking and comfortable. Easy to pair. Loved the sound quality.
0,"I would have given them a 5stars if I have come with the &quot;you get what you pay for&quot; mentality but there were other options I know would have failed less.<br />There are random times they can't play a song uninterrupted i still don't know why .<br />The sound :  it's like its muffled up , like if it was forcing the bass by ruining all the other frequencies .<br />Then charger cover was opened the first time so I could charge them and now it doesn't stay put , I can no longer close the port that was already badly sealed , so no waterproof there ."
1,Good product for the price. No noise cancellation at all.
1,"I fell in love with this device from the word go.<br /><br />They are extremely comfortable and produce good quality audio.<br /><br />The design is also pretty impressive, totally looking forward to taking them with to my 10K tomorrow."
1,Item came on time. product as expected.
1,Im a over the road trucker. I dont have the time to test products and return them because i travel all 48 states. These headphones worked great and was a great purchase.
1,"I was very surprised by the sound quality of these earbuds. They are easy to use, the connection to my iPhone 7s is good, and they are very comfortable. I use these all day during my work day and when I go workout. They stay in place during my cardio and they don't slip around.<br />Great Product!"
1,"Great product absolutely LOVE these headphones. Only issue i had is after 9months they stopped working but Tekatron, the company I ordered them from on Amazon had great customer service and warrantied them and sent me a brand new pair, couldnt be happier!!!"
1,Great product for the price I use them everyday the only thing that I don't like is the piece that goes around your ear is to soft other than that love them
0,Poor sound quality and poor connectivity.  I keep my iPhone in my pocket while doing yard work and it basically sounds like I'm listening to scratched CD.  The sound has so much bass that it's really hard to hear the rest of the music.
1,Love these. Easy to use. Quick charge.
1,"Headphones are great! The dual usb cat charger and micro usb/lightning charger is an awesome compliment to the actual headphones. Sound quality is great, nice deep base. Very comfortable when running, I do have to push them in occasionally, but I expect that with ear buds."
0,The ear piece is too large and hurts in your ears.  Feels very tight.  Sound quality is okay.  I will be returning.
1,"I’ve had these for a few weeks and I love them. I use them mostly at work and I have to charge them about once every 2 to 3 days.<br /><br />The only thing That made it so I couldn’t give it 5 stars is when my phone was in my pants pocket and using these the music would beak up, but if I had my phone strapped to my arm I had no problem. Wish I could give half star so I could give it 4.5/5."
1,Quality sound for the money - would be better if had a larger set of adaptors for them.
1,These headphones work great! Easy to connect to my phone and easy to operate. Very comfortable. Highly recommend.
1,"I bought these Bluetooth headphones 1.5 years ago. They did pretty well . But eventually the left headphone stopped working.<br />Pros:<br />- reasonable price.<br />- light weight<br />- holds the charge<br />- charge fast<br />- stays on during workout<br />- customer service were nice, cooperative and tried to help. but due to limitation in the warranty I did not get a replacement.<br /><br />cons:<br />- sometimes they don't connect to the phone right away.<br />- the left piece stopped working<br />- it was uncomfortable at the beginning (it takes time to get used to it)<br />- many other brand have the same features and slightly cheaper so nothing special about senso plus a longer warranty period."
0,"Pros: sturdy build, good fit, low price.<br /><br />Cons: sound quality is harsh and poor, signal constantly cuts out if you move at all which makes them nearly useless when running."
1,One feature I don't like is the piece that goes over the ear to hold buds in place is soft and too flexible - allows buds to come away from firm fit.<br />All other features are just fine.
0,Thought these were great but the last 2 pairs I have bought were either defective or this pair quit working a couple weeks ago. Reached out and never heard back...
1,"These are amazing for the price.  Good bass and sound.  I have bought 3 of these over the past few years.  Considering what I put them through, they are pretty durable.  I bought  $200 plus headphones that weren't this good."
1,"Love them but they only lasted 4 months and the power button broke. Had to throw them em, will buy again but with protection plan!"
0,Had to return them they keep disconnecting from my s7 phone. Also as I'm walking the sound gets jumbled if I keep my phone in my hand. I do not recommend. The sounds decent though.wheb they work
1,Super convenient while taking a good morning run ! They don’t fall out of your ears and the sound quality is dope best inexpensive earphones I’ve had so far!
1,These headphones far exceeded my expectations.  The sound quality is excellent and I liked all the included accessories.  This is one product that actually lived up to the reviews.
1,"I have only had the earphones for a few days, and already been contacted by the company with AMAZING customer service making sure I was satisfied with the earphones. Excited to use the headphones and know if there’s any issues they will be resolved right away."
0,"Ear buds don't fit properly, other than foam ones they supply, like you'd use on a gun range. All other buds supplied to big and don't fit properly even the smallest set."
1,Thank you so much for the same day free delivery! I could not ask for anything quicker.  I love these little things.  My biggest thing is that my ears a very small and when I do sweat my ear buds always pop out well not these.  Thanks guys keep doing  a great job providing consumers with great product.
1,"This is the best. Great sound, good battery, very confortable.I bought this pair of headphones and the Powerbeats 3. The beats are very expensive and uncomfortable. I will never buy the beats anymore."
0,"I bought these and they worked off my iphone bluetooth.  After about 4 months they stopped connecting altogether.  I have 3 other makes of blue tooth earphones and they all work great except for this one.  Yes, it is fully charged and turned on but will not connect.  I guess its too late to return it."
0,My headphones stopped working and I have contacted the company and given my info twice for a replacement. They never processed or contacted me back. They do not honor their warranty.
1,"These things are actually amazing for the price so far. These were listed as a &#34;Today's Deals&#34; the other day for $30, so I figured what the heck... these things have amazing reviews so where's the harm in giving them a shot. Got them today and they connected to my iPhone with ease, and sound just as good as my Sony XB70BT headphones I use at work daily. Very impressed so far. Really hope the quality of the build is just as good as the sound."
0,I need to contact seller about malfunction.
1,"My headphones arrived quickly. They were easy to set up. The sound is amazing through these earphones!!<br />On my job it can get very loud; however, the headphones DID cancel the background noise. I also brought my son a pair (20 yrs old) because I didn't want him to steal mine. He absolutely love them!! Did I say<br />AMAZING SOUND!! 😀😀😀😀<br />Oh these would make great Christmas gifts!!!!"
1,"Excellent experience, prompt delivery!"
1,"I was really surprised by the quality of the sound and battery life.<br />this thing has amazing sound, better than a lot of leading brand products, would definitely recommend to anyone, don't waste your money on more expensive, less value earphones."
0,They died after only two months of purchasing them. They no longer work.
1,My teen son is super picky..his regular headphones are Beats...he was blown away by the quality of these!! He wears and used them everyday!!
0,"After having these for a while I a bit disappointed.  If you are not using them for exercise, I think they are great. I was using them for running but they constantly fell out. The ear holder is so flimsy that it might as well not be on the device. The sound quality is good, the mic sounds very well on the phone but they are just not good for exercise.  I got a set of Beats and although they were more expensive they are much better."
1,"I love these headphones. Had them for over a year now. Battery life is great, hours and hours of sound between charges! Sound quality is great. Highly recommend."
0,So huge they wouldn’t fit a giant.
1,Affordable and great for audio books. Super comfortable due to memory foam like ear bud. Last a long time and work at a great range.
0,Was very sastisfied until last week when it stopped working.
1,They work great for me i had some jbl under armour ones and they fell out of my ears and were uncomfortable. I haven't had any problems at all with these
0,the wire tie was not included like it states.  It says you can connect to 2 bluetooth devices but have to turn bluetooth off on the device you're not using. Not convenient.  Sound quality (phone calls) isn't that great either. Not for me.
0,"Bought my first pair last year and I was impressed initially. The sound was great and the battery life was awesome. Then, after approximately two months, they just stopped working... wouldn't charge or turn on. Being that they were $23, I purchased another pair on July 17th. They lasted 6 weeks and did the exact same thing. These won't charge or turn on. I know the old saying, you get what you pay for, but this is ridiculous. Look for better deals and stay away from these."
1,"Hi rating bc sound is great except for certain songs with rich mid range sound that this set of headphones distorts. There are very little if any connection issues while running/ cycling, Microphone is spotty, really dependant on your surroundings. Deep base, great overall function, ear sizes and memory foam pad are everything you need and as for Beats, they look identical and I wouldn't spend the money on anything mid level, I would stick to these and go with Bose sound sports or ANY of the new tech they are just starting to really turn out with these wireless headset competitors."
1,Love the sound and fit of these headphones!
1,i am on the 2nd pair. Perfect in all
1,"+ Audio is very good quality for the cost of the headphones.  Bass is impressive, although a bit much at times.<br />+ CVC noise cancellation is effective.<br />- Slight discomfort inside the ears after 5-10 min."
0,"Garbage. Spotty connectivity (skipping, drop outs, unreliable connecting upon turning on). Almost to the point of being unusable. Positives are nice packing and additional included charger."
0,Great earphones until the adapter inside the earpiece would no longer accept a charge. Earphones only lasted 3 months
1,I just got these and  syncing them to my phone was simple and easy.  I went on my first run with them today and they were awesome!  Sound quality is good and buds are comfortable.  I have a horrible time keeping buds in my ears but the ear hooks worked like a dream.  I'm looking forward to future runs with these ear buds.
1,"Positives:<br />The sound is EXCELLENT, the BEST of the many different brands I've tried around this price point, including some costing much more. VERY good bass and clear treble; if you're an audiophile, as I am, you might find it's not quite as crisp in the mid-range, but you'd have to pay multiples of this price to do meaningfully better.<br />Note that they are not truly ""noise canceling"" but when the buds are snug in your ear they do a good job of keeping most of the ambient sound out (bonus: you're less likely to get run over if you're crossing the street!). I use these mostly for workouts and they more than meet my needs.<br /><br />Less great:  They don't  transmit my voice on calls as well as some others I've had, mostly when outdoors. I also prefer an in-ear anchor rather than  over-ear loops, but that said, they stay in my ears even during hard workouts. If I'm sweating I occasionally have to push them back in to get a snug fit. But not many others have in-ear anchors, and the ones I've tried have inferior sound to these.<br /><br />ADDENDA<br />03/03/21-The replacement also stopped charging after about 5 months, though it did not overheat this time. And once again they cheerfully replaced the earphones. They say they don't get many complaints of this kind, so I'm not sure it there's something strange about my charging cable. I'm going to switch and see. In any case, I stand by my review. At this price you could replace them twice a year, even if you had to pay for both, and still come out ahead!<br />5/4/20: after close to six months of great performance, the charging port overheated and melted while charging. I contacted the company and was completely delighted with their response-concern and an immediate offer to replace the earbuds, which they did. This company deserves your business and the product overall is terrific. I tried a few others in the interim and always come back to this side. Again, for the money, I cannot find anything else that comes close."
1,These headphones are great for working out in! Such a good fit and easy to use!
1,"Works great.........it stays in the ear pretty well, no option to &#34;tighten&#34; the over the ear holder ..........the wire adjusters could be better.<br />Definitely a good product."
0,"I'm not very satisfied with the sound quality while playing music. Sounds muffled. Also, while speaking on the phone with the headset there is A LOT of background noise that the person you are talking to hears so you can't even have a conversation."
1,Great product
1,Excellent performance
1,"One of the best Bluetooth Headphones I've ever bought, clear voice and stay long hours"
1,"These things rock! Comfy fit, crisp clear booming sound quality, easy to use. Very happy with my purchase. And with the added 3 year warranty it's easily the best $40 I've spent in a while. Worth every penny."
0,I'd give these 2.5/5. Sound quality is noticeably poor and not as good as my old taotronic Bluetooth headphones which were a similar price. These are much bulkier and controls are difficult to use. Also the taotronic had more button features (like next song by holding the button) which was more useful at the gym.
1,"I'm a little surprised that this product is currently the best selling Bluetooth earbud set on Amazon.  The price certainly isn't unreasonable, but it isn't the cheapest either, and the set has some very significant shortcomings.  The first thing you will notice is that they are very large for earbuds and protrude significantly from the ears.  Some may not have a problem with this, but I think they are an eyesore in use.  The foam tips fit nicely into my ear canal and they stay put nicely as well, but the over-the-ear anchor is made of relatively hard plastic and becomes uncomfortable quickly for me.  Wind noise is another odd and disappointing side effect of their size and shape.  Even walking with them on a windy day renders them almost useless, and forget about using them for active sports like bicycling.  Last but not least, they are the slowest to connect of any bluetooth buds I have ever used.  They take a full 20-30 seconds to get a stable connection to my modern Android phone and during that time the sound cuts in and out maddeningly.<br /><br />The large size is probably also responsible for the two most impressive selling points of this set:  sound quality and battery life.  I don't have extensive experience with a variety of Bluetooth buds at every price point, but these are the best sounding set I have used.  The sound rivals a decent set of wired earbuds, and this was very surprising to me.  Battery life is similarly impressive.  I get tired of listening to music or podcasts long before the battery runs out on this set, and I don't even need to charge them every day."
1,Samsung Note 8 has the earplug on the bottom of the phone. I never realized how annoying that would be. So I went wireless! These are the perfect solution. Easy to set up and operate. Love them. They sound great too!
0,"Just like most of you, I bought these headphones because of the reviews and star rating I saw here. I really thought that this was the one I'm looking for, and that it would last longer. I was already disappointed with the first one (TAOTRONICS) because it only lasted for 6 months. The first time I saw the headphones from its box, I was really amazed. Great packaging with extra accessories plus a manual. I bought it only last July 2017. If I had done this review last month, I would have given it a 5-star rating too! Then, two weeks ago I noticed that it started to get &#34;choppy&#34; every time I ran. I thought it's just a problem with my cell phone so I kept on restarting the bluetooth. And after a couple of runs, I came to the conclusion that my sweat actually affected the signal of the bluetooth, contrary to its claim that it's sweatproof. I have proven this because every time I wiped the right side of the headphones where the bluetooth is located, the connection went back to normal. And two days ago, during my 6-mile run, the right side didn't work anymore. I couldn't hear the music on its right side... until today. I'm really disappointed because I was looking forward to using it for a 10-mile run next week. I expected it to be suitable and long-lasting for new runners like me."
0,... until one of the buds just stopped working one year and three months after I purchased them. Like completely. Done. Which is too bad.  I really REALLY liked them.
1,I here wind noise
1,"Very clear sound, comfortable, long battery life and a great price.  what else could you ask for?"
0,"I purchased it one year before but I didn’t use it often. Anyway, I go to gym recently and started to use it to run with music. However, first day everything was ok and it worked well. But, some day later, when I tried to connect my phone with it, my phone showed”connection unsuccessfully” even though it was turned on and in the range of my phone(what’s worse, it was not discovered by my phone but I clicked it as a history record) . When I went back home and tried to connect it with my laptop, my laptop showed”pairing rejected”(it was discovered by my laptop this time). I was disappointed because of its quality. I even didn’t use it more than 20 times since I purchased it!"
1,Awesome sound. Great comfort. Affordable price. They also come with a one year warranty. I would definitely buy another pair if these break.
0,I received this product And it didn’t work!!!!!<br />I was recommended this product by my boyfriend that has used the same earbuds for over a year and I’m extremely disappointed. For the amount of money I spent this is serious no go!
1,"Couldn't be happier  with these headphones. The price is right, the sound quality is excellent, and I have not had a problem with them yet.<br /><br /> I sweat a lot when I run and the water has not bothered the function of these headphones one bit.  I'm so happy I found a great pair of wireless headphones!"
0,ONLY LASTED ME 6 MONTHS
1,"These headphones are amazing for the price. They are a little bit bassy and you lose a little bit of the high end, which is why I only put 4 stars. I use them for running and so that is fine by me. Everything else about these are amazing. They stay in place well and the controls right on the head phones are great so I don't have the fiddle with my phone while running."
0,I could not pair the headphones. Had to return the headphones..
1,Unbelievable quality especially for the money better by then spending $100 on namebrand ones
1,Just received these. On time and nicely packaged. I have only had the chance to try them once. I would give 5 stars if I had them a while so given I only used it once had to go with a four.
1,I use the while running and they work great!
1,I love my new bluetooth headphones. I use them while running.
1,"Easy to setup, work great. Would buy again."
1,"The sound is fine, the charging is fine. The only drawback I have seen is that the earpieces seem to fold over when it is in my pocket. I then have to straighten them out to use them. I like they are soft, but perhaps they are ""too soft"". This is my second pair of senson headphones so I do like them. The first set, also soft did not break but I needed a second pair so I could have them where I was working out and at home."
0,Bought these to use in the gym and immediately returned them. They are big and bulky and fall off the ears easily. The sound is not that great either. Battery life I never got the chance to judge. Save your money and get a better quality set of headphones.
1,"I hardly ever write reviews for products on here, but I hope this helps some people out.<br /><br />I bought these head phones because of the price and they had good reviews, but here are my comments after a few weeks of using them. My primary use of these is working out and have enjoyed them so far.<br /><br />First of all they look and feel pretty good. I have a rather small ear canal and always have problems with regular head phones that just sit in your ears falling out. These head phones stay on my ears well (they have came out of my ear a few times but never fallen off) and are extremely light! They are quite comfortable too. The rubber piece that goes around your ear is very flexible and soft not hard and rigid like some I've had before, but still sturdy enough to stay on your ear.<br /><br />They have really great sound quality. I'm no audiophile, and have never owned an expensive pair of headphones and to be honest probably couldn't tell much of a difference between a $200 pair or these. If your even looking at these I would assume your probably not an audio expert either. They do get quite loud also! I hardly ever turn my music up past half way and they are plenty loud enough to drown out the terrible music at the gym.<br /><br />All of the extras that come with them seem to be of good quality and durability. It's a nice added touch to come with a few charging cables and the carrying case.<br /><br />My only negative so far is the Bluetooth connection does seem to get fuzzy at times. I've read that it gets weaker when the charge is low, but have had them cut out a few times after a full charge with my phone in my pocket. I don't believe they were low on battery, but still had a disruption in connection. Due to this I have only given a 4 star review, but will make sure they are always fully charged before using.<br /><br />Overall I would definitely recommend this product. For the price I don't think they can be beat. They have impressed me so far and make my workouts much better since they're not falling out every few minutes!"
1,"Wow!! Very surprised at the BIG sound of these in expensive ear buds!!..Have owned the Ridiculously expensive Beats, and man are those over hyped and way overpriced..These have nice clear LOUD sound with just enough Bass..Very nice!! Get them now!!!!"
0,Not good for cycling. There is too much wind noise.
0,"I really wanted to like these headphones. I used them most of the day the day I received them, and sitting at my desk I was pretty happy. They sounded good (a little bass heavy, but not problematically so) and were comfortable, which already puts them ahead of a lot of bluetooth headphones.<br /><br />Once I left for my commute home however, I had far too many issues with the sound dropping out to consider these usable. Every few seconds the sound would cut out, making listening to anything next to impossible."
0,I would give these a 5 but they consistently have an issue connecting to my Apple Watch.  When they do connect to the watch the sound cuts out and is just not functional.  I bought these to use primarily with my watch when I run or workout so I have been very disappointed.
1,Just what I was looking for. Great sound. Would recommend.
1,"Bought these as a gift for my son. The sounds is crisp and clear, the cord is doable an flat so it resists tangles.  The packaging included a long charging cable that i was surprised to see that it works for both Apple and Google. It also included a short charging cable and a car charger.<br /><br />All in all, an EXCELLENT deal!  Highly recommend."
1,These are incredible! Just as good if not better than my beats or Bose.  These are incredible!
0,"Didnt work well for me.  Everytime I tried to sync it to my bluetooth, it would take about 30 minutes.  Def not worth it.  When it did work, it was a great  sound.  I found another for 10$ cheaper and it works everytime.  Not sure what the hoopla is on this...but it didnt work well for me."
1,Love these headphones!
0,I bought senso headphones in November 2017 for one of my daughters and it stop working. First you could hear from one side and not the other. Really disappointed.
1,"Love love love these. So much I immediately bought another pair as back ups. What a great price. I have small ear holes so I'm always struggling to find something that works for me. These are awesome. The sound is great, love the easy blue tooth connection and it comes with some pretty cool charging gadgets as well as various size of ear attachments."
1,These are not only a great value but when I had a small issue their customer service took care of it immediately.  Five stars all around.
1,"Comfortable, easy to use, long battery life.  What is not to love about this product?"
1,"Works perfectly, have no prolems with sound and really comfortable best headphones :)"
1,"Paired easily, voice quality more than decent, they fit well, and I do love all the extra accessories and case they came in!"
1,Good sound and easy to use. I really recommend these buds for the price and use.
1,My girlfriend loved these!
1,Sound weren’t as great as the previous reviews said. The sounds were all blurred together - not a clear sound stage.<br />Happy with everything else.
1,"arrived fast and work great, I use them to workout, lasts about 5 days, one hr a day on a charge. great product!"
1,"I used these headphones for working out at the gym. They worked great for a couple years and then suddently wouldn't stay charged anymore.  There were a few times when working out there seemed to be more static. Don't know if that was interference maybe with other bluetooth devices nearby. But overall for $30 they did the job and had decent sound quality. I'm hesistant about buying them again, given they only lasted for a couple years."
1,Best headphones I’ve ever owned!  Great product and service.
1,"After having a terrible experience with bluetooth headphones that didn't live up to the hype or even last me a full month before konking out.  These headphones are fantastic!<br /><br />-Awesome bass and overall sound quality.<br />-Music sounds loud even on the lowest volume level so you don't kill your ears.<br />-Charges quickly and the battery lasts long. With my first usage out of box before charge, it lasted me for about 2 hrs. Fully charged I get a solid 5+ hrs on it before I hear the battery low msg and that's because I use them for the better part of my day. (Calls, music, gym)<br />I charge the battery before bed just to get me ready for the next day, but you could definitely go 2 days before charging with moderate usage. I have.<br /><br />The only real difficulty I really had with these were the parts that stay over your ears. It would be great if that can be adjusted for small eared gals like myself. Overall the interchangeable buds make a difference and help with the staying in ear and the comfort of the headphones are great. I also appreciate that this has a one year warranty on them something brand #1 I used did not have.<br /><br />Keep up the good work Invotek."
1,Basss and treble sound great for a cheap pair of Bluetooth headphones. And the battery lasts me an entire 8hr work day. Couldn't be happier 😊
0,"I've only used them 5 times. They've been in case for 2 weeks, now no sound out of right ear."
0,"These things are awful for doing anything more than sitting at a desk listening to audio, and even at that they fail pretty miserably since they're so uncomfortable.  Save your $20.<br /><br />Pros: Bluetooth seems to work fine, but so have all devices I've used in the last 5+ years. Comes with a case to protect them (good, so I can protect the next pair I buy).<br /><br />Comes with a wallet holder for your phone (which is subsequently trash). Comes with a magnetic car mount for your phone (why do I need that with bluetooth headphones?)<br /><br />They are uncomfortable, ugly (stick out ~1"" from your ear...), the ear hook is made from foam that will be permanently disfigured after the first time it bends, but it doesn't actually do a good job of holding anything to your ear (and then go back that they stick out really far, the weight is all pulling out of your ear). They do a bad job at blocking out other noise, regardless of which size ear piece is being used.<br /><br />Forget trying to move with these things in, they'll fall out of your ears almost immediately.<br /><br />Not even worth returning this item."
1,"I love these headphones. I used to have a pair of the much more expensive brands. With the 1000s of positive reviews, I decided to try them. They sound as good as the others. I did have an issue with my headphone not recharging. I emailed Senso, got a response immediately and they worked with me to replace my defective unit. Outstanding service."
0,"Even with phone in close proximity, headphones do not keep a steady connection.  Very disappointing."
0,"First It didn't fit into my ears and the wire ear-hookers were soft which didn;t keep the ear buds on the position, I wrote to them about this problem, their rep told me to change the ear rubber pieces. I did it , but the hook wires were so soft. Every times I turned my head (I wore prescription glasses), it dropped off many times. I owned many brands, such as Tao, Phaiser, Cowin, ... This is the first product I didn't like it. I wonder the reviews for this product were real. It didn't work for me."
1,Nice sound
1,"I have needed these and just didn't realize it.  It is SO great to be connected to my music and not get tangled up in a cord.  Good, clear sound and easy to use."
1,"In the first place, I would to make clear that I have made a big research; in order to find the proper headphones for me. I reviewed many headphones, and I finally came to the conclusion that o would be getting this SENSO product. I read the reviews, specially the &#34;1 star review&#34;, since those are the persons who had certain degree of discomfort with their orders. Thus, I would get more information concerning any problem that the product might have.<br />After a thorough research, I decided to purchase this particular item, which I am quite delighted with. Hence, If you are looking for a good quality and affordable headphones, this is your item. Nevertheless, at the end of the day, you will decide which is going to be your preferred headphones.<br /><br />I hope that this is helpful."
1,"Just started using these--they were a Christmas present for my wife, and she loves them."
1,"Absolutely amazing for the price I paid.  I got great sound quality, amazing noise cancelation with the wide assortment of buds, and a super long battery life. Mine even came with extra goodies like a stick on credit card holder for a phone, a carrying case, and a magnetic mount for a phone and car. Overall an amazing product for a low price."
1,Very satisfied with this purchase.  Needed headphonse for a 1/2 marathon and these were perfect.
1,only wireless headphones that stay in my ear
1,"Pretty standard Bluetooth ear buds. The only remarkable feature is that the over the ear part is wire, so you can form it you your ear, unlike others where that part is a soft plastic."
1,Love these ear buds! Last all day at work. Stays in place and the different size ear pieces are made to fit me!
1,great product - lives up to the rating
1,"These earphones are great!  Easy to use, quality sound!  Great buy for the money!"
1,"Wasn't sure what to expect, but these headphones are awesome! Would definitely recommend. Much better than Beats!!"
1,"Not really a audiophile or anything like that... Just wanted some bluetooth headphone to workout with a the gym and this product got good reviews.. I purchased them and the sound was good... The around the ear part was not stable at all though and I was continually having to adjust them to stay around my ear. Returned the item because of that... It was very cumbersome... If it wasn't for that, I would have kept them"
0,It didn't work without any sign. I only use it for few months. Do not buy it.
0,Bluetooth doesn't work well. goes on and off
0,"This product has two issues.  If your ears are underwater, there is no sound.  In water as long as your ears are not submerged, you can get sound.  As you go in and out of the water while swimming, it breaks up the sound.  I was willing to live with this problem because the product was very inexpensive.  After wearing the headphone about 12 to 15 times, it stopped staying charged.  I could charge it and get the blue light but it would immediately lose the charge upon unplugging it.  Note to self: buy a better quality earbud."
1,"I loved these the first time I used them on the stationary bike.  The sound is great!  BUT, I soon found out they are difficult to connect outside or at the gym, or they lose their connection for no reason, like another review said.  I will probably keep them as a back up pair in case my Powerbeats fail, again.  For the price of Powerbeats they should be better quality.  For what I paid for these I'm not too disappointed."
0,"Literally broke after one day of use. Turning my head to the left side causes the sound to cut out completely. I thought it was a bluetooth connectivity issue at first, but it happened even if my phone was in my hand. Since I bought these for running outside, it is really irritating to be looking to cross the street and have everything cut out.<br /><br />That said, I probably got a lemon and will return for a new pair. The audio quality was good and the price is right."
1,"I hate in-ear phones...but these fit great.  Sound is surprisingly good, and bluetooth pairing took seconds.  All this at a great price."
0,"Great in theory, worked well for the first two weeks then the on button got stuck so now it's useless"
1,"I bought these for my teenaged son, and he loves them! He's had others, but he says these are the best he's had. He uses them while running cross-country, and also some the house or on vacations. He also commented how amazing the charging cord that was provided is. I'm now a cooler Mom."
1,My husband loves them. He said their extremely loud and stay in your ears.
0,"Only one ear piece works, and the cable has kept its wrapped up shape so firmly that the cable slants to the right 100%of the time and it Riggs on the left ear bud none stop its extremely useless to work out with this or even just sit and enjoy music from the constant tugging you have to do besides the only 1 earbud working and the other being silent. I don’t recommend this earbuds to anyone , just go spend a little more on other ones that will work.. horrible product and their not cheap."
1,"Great quality sound, and they link fast.  They are lightweight and I really don’t even notice I’m wearing them."
0,"The connection to my Nexus 5  keeps going crackling if I  turn my head to the left...it connects quickley and they are comfortable....not sure if this is a defective unit or this i the way they all are...I have a cheaper taotronics  set that works much better. and were cheaper...not satisified, would return but I waited too long..."
1,Excelente Producto!!!!!!!!
1,"These things have been A-OK, I'm surprised because of how inexpensive they were.  I only wear them to workout but (knock on wood) I haven't had any problems yet.  Every once in a while I have an issue connecting, but I think it only occurs when the battery needs a charge."
1,So far so good day 3 got to be over 8 hrs of use no low battery signal yet loved my old pair that these replaced great value
0,"I am three weeks outside the warranty period and these won’t turn on anymore.  They worked fine until they all of a sudden quit working.  At first, I thought the battery was dead, but they still don’t turn on with a full charge.  I won’t buy them again."
0,Far too bulky for me
1,"These wireless headphones are perfect!! I love them.  I'm so glad that I bought these, instead of  purchasing the beats for a second time.<br /> The sound is crystal clear the volume  goes quite high.  The battery life does last.  I don't think I've ever purchased the beats again ..."
1,Amazing product! Would buy again! Highly recommended!
1,Pleasantly surprised!  The audio quality was much better than I expected. Great quality both with music and calls. They are also so comfortable and light that I barely notice them. I will be being buying sets for the family. Highly recommend!
1,"Bought these headphones for my 16 year old son. He absolutely loves them and uses them every day.  After the warranty ran out, we had a problem with them and emailed the company.  Within three days we had a brand new pair!! Excellent product and superior customer service!"
1,"Just getting started with these and love them already. Listening to books, pods casts and movies."
1,Loved the extra accessories.  Nice carrying case.
1,"The guys in the shower at the rehab center couldn't believe I was washing my hair  and taking a shower wearing the headphones. They couldn't figure out where the music was coming from. However, I'm a little disappointed with the base, I like a lot of base. I found out that if I hold, push in on  them in a little while in the ear I can here more of the base and sound much better. So I'm not sure what I can do to get them to fit tighter in the ear. I might try and maybe smaller ear piece, but I want them snugger in my ear so I can get that base. How do I get the headphones tight in my ear? Overall very nice product, couldn't believe all the extras, cords, case, adapters etc. Keep up the good work. Thank you SENSO guys. Rodney"
0,"Bought on July 2017 and for a while now the left earbud doesn't work. I shouldn't have to buy a new set every year, I took good care of them."
1,Daughter loves them.
1,"They work as promised.  I really like the fact they are high quality, work great, and half the price of over-priced Beats!"
1,Great value for the price and have been compatible with everything I have that has Bluetooth.
1,"They work ok for $30.  You need to stay pretty close to your phone or you will lose the connection.  I can’t leave my phone in kitchen and walk to living room for example.  Also if you turn your head, the sound gets crackly.<br />As long as you don’t move very much, the sound is pretty good."
1,Love it
1,These are ok.  I bought them for my nephew the sound is not as good as the apple ear buds but the price is low enough to assume it wouldn't be.  The clips to hold them to your ear are not very supportive but that wasn't important to him so they should work fine.  Battery life is to be determined.  Great seller and shipping was excellent.
1,"My wife loves them, so I do as well."
1,Sound quality on these is good for my standards. I'm not an audiophile but I wanted a decent pair of bluetooth headphones for running and exercising and these work great for that. Only real complaint I have is that they seem very susceptible to wind noise.
0,I do not Recommend. Sound Quality is not good.<br />Returning.<br />Bass is ok.<br />but Treble sounds are worst. Until they fix it. I will leave my feed back as is.
1,"Sound is great; used during rainy run with no issues, they stay in place."
1,very clear sound and light. I don't even notice that I have it on. Lives up to its name.
0,Only had them for a month and it’s already having trouble with staying connected to my phone. Maybe I got a bad pair?
1,"The headphones worked really well for the price. They really stay in the ears and provide plenty of volume. Unfortunately I think I got a defective set because they shutoff once I get really sweating. I have a friend who bought about the same time,participates in the same activities and has had no trouble. I wrote to the Senso support team explaining the issues and after some ltesting decided that a replacement set was best. I am awaiting their arrival and will upgrade my rating if they work as advertised."
1,Awesome ear phone
1,The design is good. Sound quality is awesome.
0,"This product worked 5 times and then the on/off button was stuck and will not work.  Obviously, this happened when the product could not longer be returned.  I have a number of Bluetooth devices as I'm on the phone all day.  This is the worst...by far"
1,"I really like these headphones! The ""strap"" is light, the ear pieces are comfy, and the sound is quite good. They do cancel out most outside noise since I commute via public transportation, but you can still hear announcements. My only issue is they are big for my ears, but I have pretty small ears."
1,Great affordable product!
1,Great product! Highly recommended!
1,"I looked into buying a more expensive brand but chose these because of the reviews...I am not disappointed..I've worn them for a week they are comfortable and stay on well...only hiccup with them....I wish they had a longer battery life...they go the 8 hrs but just cuz I'm lazy I'd like 12 hrs...lol<br />,"
0,I wish I can give negative stars. His product sucks! It literally worked for a month then stopped working. Never will I ever purchase fake head phones to save money
1,"Senso S250 is the best Bluetooth headphone that I ever owned: (a) Great sound quality; (b) very comfortable to wear; (c) easy to pair - it has the voice prompt to indicate whether the power is turned on or off, the device is connected or disconnected; (d) a fancy carry case; (e) a thoughtful power cable which has a double connectors to iPhone and USB device; and (f) water-proof rating (I have not tried this feature; but I have already ruined two sets of Bluetooth headphones by clean them with too wet of clothing after running). While the power button is large and easily accessible, the volume/track control buttons may be too tiny for some people, which one seldom uses once the device is set up, so I don't care. In the last few years I have gone through at least five sets of Bluetooth headphones: they either stopped working or were not good/comfortable for running. Senso S250 is the first perfect pair I discovered. I loved it so much that I reordered three additional sets for each of my family member.<br /><br />Update: One of the four sets I brought stopped working in less than 6 weeks. I used it to run for about 1 hour a day 4x a week, indoor. One day it just would not turn on. Don't think I would give this product a high rating when it does not last for more than 6 weeks for normal use."
1,"For the price, You can't do any better. I wear them in the shower, the Gym and all day. the battery is great! BUY THEM... I assure you, you will not be disappointed."
1,My first pair stopped charging but they were very helpful and quick to respond to send out replacements. Thank you!
1,These headphones are well worth the money !!
1,Work great for price.
0,I used them for a good 1-2 months at the gym and now they won't turn on or change. Worked great for that period of time though.
1,"Although the sound quality and features were good, I experienced pain in my right ear while using it for more than 1 hour. I returned the product due to this reason"
1,Running my first 1/2 marathon and wanted some music to help pass the time.  My hubby had these so he recommended them.  You have  a 15 minute warning once it says “low battery”.
0,"Didn’t fit my head/ears and weren’t adjustable.  The person I passed them along to, loves them and her daughter ordered a pair."
1,they are grate
0,"The quality of the senso headphones has fallen sharply. This is the third and last time I buy their products.<br /><br /> I bought these on October 5th(writing as of October 29)  and have had nothing but issues with them. I believe senso switched to cheaper parts, leading to the problems.<br /><br />I have had issues with the headphones charging, and never charging fully since day one. They advertise 8 hours of audio, I'm lucky if I get one."
1,Love these. They are comfortable and setup was a breeze. I wanted to make sure I wrote my review after I used them. Sound quality is clear and noise cancellation works well depending on the song. Best of all I don’t have a bulking headset around my neck
1,"Sounds quality is very good (for the price), battery life is as advertised, and they seem well constructed. My only complaint is that the pieces that wrap around behind your ears are not as bendable/customizable as I would have liked. However, the fit is pretty secure anyways, so I'm still giving these five stars."
1,Great value....arrived on time and better than anticipated.
0,"the earphones sounded nice and worked well until this week, now the headsets turn themselves off randomly every couple of minutes. and this is after only 3 months of use! terrible.<br /><br />update of the review above.<br /><br />Senso customer support contacted me post the review and asked that I contact them and they will take care of everything immediately.<br /><br />will update my review if the issue is indeed taken care."
1,"Comfortable, paired easily with my phone, haven't been able to pair with my MacBook yet.  Controls are pretty straight forward. Holding the multifunction button for the required seconds results in a voice command.  I never heard the pairing command after 6 secondstudents.  For the sale price, I'd buy them again.<br />I've used them everyday at the gym since they came. Set up was a breeze. No complaints at all."
1,My first set of Bluetooth earbids...I love them! Thanks!!
1,For the price these were well worth it. Use for working from home and sound is not perfect but well worth the price.
1,"Better quality than I was expecting, but still noticeably cheap in some areas."
0,Had these for a few months and they NO LONGER connect to any Bluetooth device in my home. They also do not connect to any of my friends devices. Pretty good sound quality but now they DO NOT WORK AT ALL.
1,easy to operate. Like having different size earbuds. great for travel and workouts.
0,I’m a runner and I thought the over the ear hook would keep them in my ear. They constantly work their way out.
1,"2nd pair purchased The sound is great. Great price. Also, great customer service from SENSO."
1,Great price and awesome sound quality! I love these headphones for working out!
0,"Muffled sound quality. I didn't expect miracles, but I was hoping for sound clarity."
1,Great sound quality.
1,Pretty awesome for the price
1,"There are alot of reasons to like these, and several not to. They have surprising range, reaching several rooms over from my phone with no loss. Good battery life, about 8hrs of continuous use. I use the memory foam ear pieces, which mold to the inside of my ear and are fairly comfortable. While each side of these headphones is large, the wire between them is thin and doesn't get in the way. Good price too. However, sound quality is only okay, with poor bass response and lack of clear highs. The controls can be difficult to find and use without knocking the ear piece off your ear, and the over-ear clip is nonadjustable, and doesn't fit my ears very well. These are decent for cheap Bluetooth headphones, but you can get alot better by spending a bit more."
1,"I liked them so much, I let my husband try them.  As a result, he bought his own pair as well"
1,nice headphones fit perfect they don't fall out on my bike rides and use with my Fitbit
1,"This is a preliminary review of the product:  Overall, I am happy I purchased these as I like to run with my OEM Samsung earbuds but the snag and drop potential is always pretty high.  The functionality is good and the value is better.<br /><br />I don't like the size of each earpiece and the fact they are pretty boxy. If you are a fashionista then these will probably drive you nutty.  The other issue is a noticeable buzzing static noise in quiet parts of the music I listen to.  Not a big deal since I'm running and don't require perfection.<br /><br />I've only used these headphones through one battery cycle and can't comment on how long they will actually last but so far they will exceed my run times. (~90 minutes)"
1,"nice sound quality, easy to use while working out. The ear plugs could be a little more comfortable."
1,Value.  My wife loves her set and they help to prompt her to work out at the Y.  I bought a 3d pair for my daughter at her request.
0,Tried these to use for video meetings on a laptop.  I had continued issues with these with the mic dropping out and the audio quality was not good. I verified it wasn't the built in Bluetooth on the laptop. The battery life was about 7 hours with just having the earbuds on. I returned these as I was not happy with the quality.
1,"Delivered as advertised, thank you"
1,"Good packaging, easy to sink to device, sound is more than good for excising, functionality is good but when trying to re position the right side ear piece many times you end up pressing the button to put music on hold. The biggest problem is the soft ear hooks are too flexible and do not do a good job securing the ear piece to your head. The ear inserts by themselves do not hold device in my ear and the ear hooks do not secure well whereby with normal exercise in the gym the ear piece is constantly falling off my ear."
1,"These headphones are alright during weight training. The piece that goes over your ear is too flimsy so sometimes they'll fall off your ear. Also for some reason when I initially pair them, they make this skipping sound when I play the first song. It last for 5-10 seconds and then plays normally.<br /><br />The sound quality is good and the range is pretty far. The good thing about these headphones is that I can put my phone in my pocket and it won't skip.<br /><br />I took a star off because of the backing of the ear is too flimsy.<br /><br />If these headphones broke I wouldn't buy them again."
1,Only had these for a few days so far but they seem like the best set of low priced Bluetooth phones I've ever purchased. They are extremely comfortable and I can wear these and practice drums just fine. Sound quality is excellent. They also work pretty well for phone calls so far. I wish they would be connected to two devices at one time but I can handle that they cannot considering the price. Just the best value for the money I've found with excellent sound quality for music.  I'll let you know how they hold up for the long term.  For me: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
0,Already stopped working. But if a disappointment as only had for less than 2 months.
1,great buds great deal  they arrived on time and well packaged  . i run alot and they work well  for my needs they stay in place and have plenty of flexibility . They also throw in some extra odds  and ends like a charging cable a 12v adaptor extra buds etc which is nice also the buds are that soft compressive foam material like why ear plugs are made of  not the little plastic ones so added plus for me  ...
0,"Oh my, these sound terrible. I have them paired with my iPhone 6s and streaming Spotify premium. The sounds is extremely bass heavy causing the sound to be muddy and distorted. I had to turn the bass all the way down on the app equalizer. I won't be able to do that with all apps.<br /><br />I'm attaching an image of my Spotify EQ settings. Even at these settings the bass is very heavy. Once set, the sound is clear and acceptable but there is noticeable sounds quality loss most likely due to Bluetooth compression. It's like listening to an MP3 at 128k quality. Not quite to the sound quality of wired apple EarPods.<br /><br />I had my brother test these out just to make sure my hearing wasn't the issue. He agreed but then he also added the comment that he is not an &quot;audiophile&quot;. Neither am I but when the stock EarPods that come with the iPhone sounds way better than these then there is a problem. I expect my cans to sound decent without EQ tweaking.<br /><br />On the other hand, they are comfortable and block outside noise when fitted properly.<br /><br />I'll return them since the sound quality out if the box is unacceptable."
0,I recently had a set of bluetooth headphones very similar to these that worked great for a little over a year before the left ear stopped working.  To replace those I purchased these the other day and was extremely disappointed.<br /><br />1) Bluetooth connection was spotty.  I've had some trouble with the bluetooth signals in the past when in a gym with a lot of people that are using bluetooth devices or running on a jogging trail next to a busy street but the first time I used these headphones I was working in the yard with nobody else around and the bluetooth signal continued to drop in and out.<br /><br />2) Left ear would periodically lose sound.  After about 45 minutes of use I noticed that the sound in the left headphone would drop off and then return once I jiggled the wire slightly.  It did this 5 or 6 times over the span of 10-15 minutes before I finally gave up and shut the headphones off.<br /><br />Needless to say I was very disappointed.  I initially was pretty optimistic about these headphones because they seemed fairly rugged and came packaged nicely with a good set of accessories to go along with them but they did not function well when used.
1,"To be fair, they're my first set of bluetooth headphones so I may be in love with the idea of wireless headphones more than with this specific product, but I have no complaints about these. They fit well and are comfortable. The sound is fine. They work consistently. One time I had trouble getting them to connect after charging. I ended up having to tell my phone to &#34;forget&#34; them, and then re-connect them as though it were the first time. Worked like a charm. Most of the time they connect immediately with no issues.<br /><br />I love not being tied to my phone - I bought them for exercising but I find that they're really great for cleaning the house.  I don't have to find a way to keep my phone on my body, I can just leave it wherever and then go from room to room and even out to the garbage cans and still hear what I'm listening to. Even when vacuuming or doing other things that are noisy, which is not the case when trying to use speakers. And I love not having to untangle my headphones every time I want to use them. I really love these headphones."
1,Battery life is great with only 2 hr charging time. Phone call quality NOT high definition. Playing music sound is ok. Comfortable
0,Trash.  They would not stay connected to bluetooth for more than 10 seconds.  Returned item.
0,"Pro:  Connects without any issues and very nice range, way pass 12 feet.  I can walk around most good distance away from my phone before losing connection.  Nice case, good quality flat charging cable.<br /><br />Con:  Sound muffled.  Bass is decent but missing highs. I had to adjust the EQ to boost highs and then it's ok.  But when I go to car and connect to car bluetooth, I need to reset EQ to neutral which is hassle.  Also can't use it on phone call as no one can here you, really bad mic or maybe it don't have one cause other end say they can't hear me.  Lastly, defective car charger (see photo).<br /><br />I took this set to trip and did not take my normal car charger since this set had one but did not realize it was defective.  I had to buy locally for $15, un-necessary expense. Guess my bad for not checking it before taking on my trip."
1,"So far these headphones are amazing! Nothing was wrong with them they give you an iphone charger, and two android chargers, also a car charger piece! I got them because I go to highschool and these children are so loud on the bus and these headphones fixed my problems, the charge last! Sometimes, I don't charge it up all the way and it still lasts. Worth the money! Every penny. Highly recommend!"
1,"These headphones have some great sound and a long distance bluetooth connection.<br /><br />Two things that bother me:<br /><br />1. I have an iPhone 6s and a 6s plus. Sometimes I can change the volume with the controls on the headphones, but a lot of the time it doesn't work. Then I have to take out my phone to do it, which defeats the purpose of bluetooth. There are no sounds that indicates that the volume is going up, until you reach max volume and get the loudest, most annoying beep aimed directly into your ear canal.<br /><br />2. The earpieces aren't adjustable to my liking. You can bend the part that goes over your ear but that's about it. I was hoping for a retractable function for smaller ears. My ears are on the smaller side, and these headphones don't fit as snug as I would like to feel comfortable. Not snug enough to be running headphones."
1,The sound quality on these aren't the best. My cheap ear buds that came with my HTC m8 sound alot better then these. The sound to me is muffled and theres no bass to me. That's straight out of the box. So I'm going charge them and try again when charged to see if that helps any.
1,They arrived on time and in the perfect little case to bring around. They have a long lasting battery life and you can't beat the quality for the price. I use them for running and they stay in place and allow me to move freely. Great purchase!
1,"the only problem is that the charging cable which i assumed was for an I phone does not charge phone, although I phones can be fickle when not using apple products thats what i thought it was for"
1,"Awesome headphones when they work. But after less than 6 mos, the headphones no longer take a charge."
1,Fanatastic sound at a very good price.
1,Arrived before given date easy to set up and sound great
1,"I like these headphones, they work well and have good sound. But don't market yourself as a good pair of headphones for running if the slightest drop of sweat makes the sound stop working, and don't drop from them from a height of more than 6 inches if you want them to stay intact."
1,"Great price, great fit, great sound and easy to setup."
1,"Great quality, soft and comfortable, stays in without falling out. All around great product."
1,"I've had these for a few months now and they've worked good since I got them. The instructions were easy to follow and paring was too. I have paired it on my pc, smartphone, laptop and smart watch. They work great inside building but are hit or miss outside in clear areas. That's common with the other pairs of wireless headphones I've had. The wire between the headphones was too long for me but I might just have a small head."
1,"I like these for walking the dog.  It maintains a good connection and it is easy to adjust volume, etc.  They are comfortable.  I did not give them 5 stars because if there is any headwind, there is a lot of wind noise generated (not in the headset) but the wind going around the headset.  That is my 1 complaint.  They need to be more aerodynamic."
1,"So far so good!!! I've only had them for a few days but they have been worry free, hassle free, and easy to connect to Bluetooth.  The earpieces are comfortable and the sound quality is great. Totally happy with them!"
1,LIKE...
1,I absolutely love these headphones! They’re comfortable and fit well in your ears. I don’t know how I functioned without them before!!
1,"Headphones were great, but there was an issue with mine. I contacted customer supported and they quickly sent out a new pair."
1,Good sound quality
1,"Solid headphones for the price, good battery life, but they quit working after a year of daily use. Great for listening during workouts, chores, or at the office, but on planes or while running the lawnmower they just don't get loud enough to overcome the engine noise. I was satisfied with my purchase, but if you can afford to go up in price you'll probably find something that lasts longer. If you've only got $25 to spend, you'll be happy with these."
1,Cool
0,Hard to keep on ear. Hop day are much better. Senso can only connect to one device Hop Day can connect to two devices at the same time. Do you not sell Hop Day anymore
1,They sound great! The battery lasts for my 9 hours of work. I couldn't ask for more
1,No problem so far...very useful
1,"It's perfect for the price. Live in NYC, so in some spots the connection is interrupted. Other than that, the sound, bass and quality is great!"
1,"Easy to use, great audio quality, stays in place just fine, long battery life. Mine unfortunately stopped working all of a sudden after about 8 months, but customer service was great and very fast in replacing them since it was still under warranty. I can't speak to the headphone's longevity otherwise. But when they're working, they're a great product.<br /><br />UPDATE: It's been 7 months using the replacement and they now have the same exact issue. They worked fine this morning for my workout. I hooked them up to charge after and 20 minutes later the indicator light was off. I unhooked them and reseated the cable, no indicator light. I tried to turn them on. Nothing. They're dead. I will update again after I hear back from seller Tekatron."
1,Love them.  Clear tone.  Car charger and outlet charger both included.  Along with three replacement your beds.
1,Comfortable and great sound
1,"Tienen muy buen sonido, excelente calidad y tiempo se batería"
1,I did a lot of research for quality economical waterproof headphones to wear while I run and workout.  These headphones are definitely the best choice.  I have been extremely pleased with the comfort and sound quality.  I will definitely buy these again.
1,"I am very happy with my Senso headphones. The sound is satisfactory and they keep firmly on my ears in spite of my movements working out. They are very easy to use, its charge is pretty fast and it lasts six hours with great performance"
0,It’s ok
1,"it plays clearly, very clearly. and I love this wireless headset. it would be perfect if the minimum volume could be lower."
1,"Amazed at how good these work! And they come with a holder, car charger, cool dual android/iPhone charger. Very good product."
1,Good!
0,"I am returning. The hook thst goes around the ear is too big and too flimsy. If you have small ears, look elsewhere."
1,These have a long charged life and sound is great.
1,I bought these for $27 I believe and they are the best I ever had I had your phone they cost me $166 are the best
1,"Very, very pleased with the product.  Great sound and easy to use controls, even for a guy with big fat fingers.  Highly recommend these ear buds especially for those with some hearing loss or issues."
1,It doesn’t get any better than this for the money. Great sound for so cheap. I run with these 3 or 4 times a week. No complaints at all. If and when mine get worn out I will buy these again. Not super high quality but very very good for the money. You can spend 300 on earbuds.... if you’re an audiophile... the rest of us would be happy with these.
1,"This is a &#34;first day of use&#34; review.  The purchase transaction was simple and Senso communicated the order receipt, anticipated delivery date, and a &#34;welcome&#34; email that included several links and phone numbers in case any issues arose.  The package arrived on time, and in good condition.<br />Not one for reading directions, I removed the headphones and turned them on.  They paired with my iphone 7s in about 10 seconds.<br />I put them on and was pretty amazed.  The sound was full, rich, and clear.  The fit was snug and comfortable.<br />They come with 3 sets of buds for different fit requirements.  I haven't yet tried to see if one of them fits better, as I am totally satisfied right out of the box.<br />Seamless order entry process, delivered on time, ridiculously easy set-up, and wonderful fit and performance right out of the box.  What's not to like!!<br />I will update my review later to report on the product's dependability, but I was impressed that the Senso reviews had more 5 stars (and more importantly, less 1 stars) than headphones costing $200.  WHY PAY MORE?"
1,"Love my headphones, they work great. Easy to use , quick and very clear."
0,They kept shutting off the first time I used them. I made sure the battery was fully charged and they still wouldn’t work properly.
1,Absolutely amazing sound & quality!!!  So happy with my purchase.
1,"I decided to try and get into the world of wireless earbuds and these things are amazing!! Like having mini Beats headphones. I saw that Beats actually made a similar product to this and I've heard it sounds just as good as Beats, perhaps even better! I can't recommend this product enough! If you're looking for wireless earbuds whether you work out or not, you should definitely give these a shot! (If only they made a wired version for in-ear monitors...)"
1,Great sounding head phones.
1,"These fit well, and the sound quality is good. I use them for Netflix while on my bike trainer mostly, so indoors. They stay on firmly which was the main problem with my old earbuds."
1,I think senso earphone is with good quality for what you paying
1,good sound and easy to use
1,These headphones are awesome! The sound quality is excellent. You are giving Beats a run for their money
1,"Just received and charged, looking forward to using on a bike ride this weekend."
1,"Quite surprised by the quality of these head phones. Honestly i was expecting too much, but they have performed. I happened to use them while working out with my gf, who was using a certain beat by (insert rapper), and they had a better connection range. You also get a ton of accessories. All kind of plugs and chargers...pretty cool bonus"
1,"The pros are they sound good when they're connected. The cons are they lose bluetooth connectivity easily.  I bought them to use while I do work around the property.  Even with the phone in a shirt pocket why would have connection issues.  The main reason I didn't like them is that the cord which connects them, if placed behind my neck would stick to my skin and they'd pull out of my ears.  Cord in front of my neck and they would hang down when leaning over and again pull out.  I don't use them anymore."
1,"Great headphones at a great price.  Have had these for almost 2 months.  They meet all my expectations.  Sound is clear, ear buds are secure, no fear of losing them because of the behind the ear design.  Exactly what I wanted without the ridiculous price.  Great for my audio books and music as well as phone calls.  Highly recommend."
1,"Great product, comfortable and soo easy to use. Grat at following up with the customer after product is delivered. I would definitely recommend them to a friend"
1,The headphones are great for working out. Cords don't get in your way and even with my small ears they stay on nicely. They come with all the supplies you need! Can't figure out how to switch the charger cord but its multipurpose.
1,"They work pretty well.  Connects easily, stay in ear well, sound is good.  My only comment is that the ear hooks are floppy and probably unnecessary."
1,Super helpfully customer support and great quality for the price
1,Great product for the money!! Would have been much easier to use if the volume controls are moved from the ear to the wire.
1,&#34;This headphone set works very well!!&#34;
1,Excellent service and excellent product! Would definitely buy again
1,Awesome headphones!! Exactly what I needed.. Sound great.. Paired up easy.. If size isn’t a issue.. You will love these headphones.. Thanks Senso
1,"Worked great right out of the box, blue tooth hooked right up with my phone no problem.<br />The wire connecting the left and right is just thick enough that it doesn't move all over when working out.<br />Thanks!"
1,"I've had them a couple of weeks now and they are GREAT!  Battery lasts as advertised, I've used them at work all day listening to music on my phone and no battery problems.  The mic is clear when I'm talking to people, they can hear me and I can hear them.  It connects via bluetooth in a couple of seconds and tells you when it's connected and when it's disconnected.  They are very comfortable and no problem to use all day without any fatigue.  GREAT product, I just ordered a second pair for a friend of mine."
1,I really have enjoyed these headphones. It just seems that no matter what pair I purchase something goes wrong with them eventually. The sound is great. Lacks strong bass but the holds up against most competiton. I used my one yr warranty after a few months. Great customer service.<br />Left ear went out and had sync issues. Now the second pair is done. Just stopped working. Won't power on. I go to charge them and all I get is a blue light (that means full charge). If I attempt to reset I get 2 beeps about 2 seconds in to the 7 seconds needed to factory reset and that's it.<br />Off to try yet another soon to break pair of headphones.
1,Just got these and they feel and sound great
0,"This product is not as represented, and I ordered two pair , only because of the &#34;deep discount&#34;. The sound is mediocre and it is absolutely impossible to have a conversation on these. When talking it sounds like you and the person on the other end are in a tunnel. Every time someone called they complained that I sounded weird and asked that i call them back. The moment i shut off the earbuds the call was fine. To avoid the hassel of return willgive these to a homeless person or maybe one of my nieces for music... they are bulky and clunky and sound is only average. Not what you would expect from a $50 pair much less the $200+ they represent them to be."
1,Really good sound and really comfortable...customer service is tremendous! Very easy to pair and control...double thumbs up!!
1,Great sound and fit in my ears pretty good. The price ain't bad either.
1,"I owned a pair of wireless Power Beat 2 prior to trying out this pair. I have to stay I can't notice the difference between the two products, except for the major price difference. Highly recommended!"
1,"My original pair recently stopped connecting after 18 months but I do like the fit and sound, so I purchased new ones. Hopefully will get longer life from the new ones."
1,Great headphones so far
1,"This is my second pair, as the first ones broke.<br /><br />The headphones are pretty clear in sound and have a decent amount of base to them. They don't sound muffled. The battery life on them are not the greatest. I think they last about 8 hours or a little under that. I felt that, as I have them for over a week, the batter would die faster and faster as I used them. The other issue is they tend to not stay in my ears despite what type of buds I use. On the pros side, they connect to basically anything. Any device that uses Bluetooth will connect to these, and they connect faster than most devices I've used in a long time. I gave them a 4 out of 5 because the battery life and because of the ear bud issues. Also, when you're talking, if you are working out and trying to talk to someone at the same time, it may be hard for the other person to hear you. If you have a hoody on, the mic is blocked and people can't hear you during phone calls. Phone calls sound okay, but nothing to yell in excitement about. Overall, I brought these again because they were a good price and I liked them. Lastly, these have a pretty good amount of protection against water when sweating, which has always been my issue with headphones like apple or Sony. They never handled me sweating after a workout. These headphones work well and dry up pretty nice. No issues at all. I recommend getting them."
1,Nice sound
1,"These are great earphones and not because they are bluetooth, well at least in part.  They actually have great range and clarity due to upgraded tech. They are not noise isolating but they do stay in your ear/ear hole and sound good with my electronic (EDM) music when at work or the gym.  The added carry case, car charger (dual port), usb cord with a flip able, inter usable, lightning adapter/usb c(?) adapter + different size earpods is what I call more &#34;BANG!&#34; for my buck.  Fast shipping and I can definitely recommend the Seller Invotek.  Thanks!<br /><br />*** Update 7-4 ***<br />Sadly my earphones started not working on the left side. Can't be sure why since I use them in a light duty way. Invotek (seller) was very responsive to my email and ended up sending me a new pair rather quickly. Outstanding customer service! I do hope these last much longer. I also received foam tips in this package (upgrade?). Still pleased..."
1,"I love the sound of the headphones, but for some reason with my iPhone 6S Plus & iPad 9.7 Pro there appears to be static or connection problems when I'm talking on the phone or when listening to audio. There are multiple pauses or gaps in audio and I do not understand why. When the sound plays, I love the audio quality but the multiple gaps in audio ruin the audio experience. Is there anything I can do to fix the problem?<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />I love my SENSO Bluetooth Headphones. I posted earlier that the audio quality was fantastic but I experienced multiple gaps and static during playback. Well, I noticed that I experienced these gaps during audio playback each time the headphones were connected to two devices at the same time. When there is only one connection, the headphones play beautifully with no problems in connection at all. The headphones fit nicely and they have a gorgeous design. I love them, but I wish there was no static and connection problems when they are connected to multiple devices. If that's a feature of the headphones, then it should work."
1,"So far these seem very good. Surprisingly good quality, easy to use, and comfortable.<br />Only had them a week, though, will update if anything changes!"
1,"Easy to use and charge, very comfortable for sleeping in."
1,Easy to configure  - so far so good!<br />Most importantly received email from the vendor providing all the necessary support and contact information.  I like their proactiveness.
0,product is not waterproof.  As soon as it got wet it immediately stopped working.  Sad though the battery life was great.  If you don't plan on using this item around water then I would recommend it.
1,Bought these in 2017 and just needing to replace them now. Ear buds don’t stay in my ear so the wire and over the ear feature is a must for me. The wires are starting to fray where they connect to the buds but I often fall asleep with them on so that’s to be expected. Would get 5 stars but the mic kind of sucks for calls.
1,I purchase the earbud because my old one stop working but I'm very impressed with the quality and clarity of this Senco ear bud. I have already recommended these to a family member. I'm very please with my purchase.
1,They work just fine.<br />Battery time is relatively long for wireless headsets.<br />The sound quality is not good but it is relative to price.<br />The cable connecting the right ear and left is uncomfortable during training.<br /><br />***Good for entry level
1,They fit really well and sounds really good.
1,"Excelente service, excelent delivery and super excellent earphones. Good bass sound. Quick pair with the device."
1,"My husband has two of these that he has had for over a year.  He uses them in the jacquzzi and has had no issues with the moisture.  I tried using one during my daily walk to listen to podcasts.  It worked so well that I ordered my own that I could keep charged and paired with my phone.  The sound is clear. It has just enough noise cancellation that I'm not too distracted by outside noises, but not so much that I'm in danger of being hit by a car.  I think there is another model that is more noise-cancelling, but being as I want to be aware of my surroundings when I walk, this is perfect for me.  The ear loops can be bent to fit, and I have had minimal problems with the ear pieces falling out.  I never notice the connecting wire when I'm wearing it.  I charge them after my 90-minute walk, although they probably could keep working longer.  I would buy them again without hesitation."
1,Very good. I use it all the time playing squash at uni.
1,Very positive experience! If you don't loose them they will serve you perfectly for this price.
1,Works good sounds good.  Used rubber earpieces but wind gets around them while running.  Foam works best conforms to ear.
1,Works great with my new HTC VIVE system....no strings attached so to speak other than the unobtrusive neck cord.  Has a good lifetime as well on charge.
1,"Came quickly, good quality sound and volume, stays in me ears when I'm running."
0,"These earbuds work great! Until they don't.<br />Bought ActivBuds A-1 which worked until one ear suddenly stopped working about 3 months later. Then bought S250 which also worked great for ~6 months, and now just randomly turn off every few minutes (it's not a charging issue - earbuds show 70% charge and it also happens after 4 hours charging). I also didn't do anything with them except use for 1-2 hours a few times a week in a dry environment.<br />No help from customer support because it's right after warranty expired.<br /><br />May still be worth the price, but be aware that you are buying a product that will last only 3-6 months."
1,I love them. The sound is awesome. Greast bass. They fit and stay in the car great. I deffently would buy again and recommend to all my friends. Thank you for checking up on my purchase wounderfull customer service.
1,bought these for listening to music while jogging.  work well.  the foam keeps them securely positioned.
1,After owning the product for about three months it stopped working. While it was working it was a wonderful product.<br />Dealing with customer service was excellent. I received personal return emails almost before I hit send. They made some hardware suggestions that did not work. So they immediately sent me a new one with no request to return the original.<br /><br />Jury is still out on the longevity of the product but when it works it works well. And customer service was off the charts great.
1,I have bought my husband dozens of &#34;tech&#34; items.  This is the first one he has liked.  I'm going to order a pair for myself
1,Excellent ear buds for the price. The connect easily to blue tooth and came with multiple ear buds including memory foam ones that block sound and fit perfectly in my ear. The silicone ear hooks are super soft and comfortable as well. The bass is surprisingly deep!
1,"Love the headset, use it almost daily in the gymn. Unfortunately it developed a mechanical problem with the on off button. Customer support was excellent, very apologetic for any inconvenience it caused me and a new one is on the way."
0,"I got this pair of headphones on 02/19 of this year while training for a half marathon. This year I ran around 15 races, the last one on 10/05. I decided to use them again while running errands in early November & noticed they were totally dead. I didn’t think much of it since it had been about a month since last using them, so I plugged them in to charge. Within a few seconds of plugging them in, a lil red dot will light up, & once fully charged will change to blue. The red light never came on which I thought was odd so I waited for a few minutes but still nothing. I even changed up the outlets, allowing it to be there for at least 5 minutes at each one, but nothing. I found the 1-year warranty I purchased & reached out to company on their website on 11/05, explaining the issue & asking for a replacement but never heard back. I’m disappointed because I really enjoyed this pair of headphones; the sound was good & they fit very comfortably in/around my ears. Unfortunately I’m dissatisfied with customer service & with the battery quality as they only worked for 8ish months before dying."
0,"They are ok for phone calls.  The bass on the ones I received was very weak.  I can not listen to music because of the bass.  The sound is hd and clear, wish they had better bass."
1,"Good wireless headphones, but they did not last long. I purchased these headphones November 2018. They did not even lasted two years before the left-side went out."
1,"Works well. Sticks well on my ears even through active workout. And, You get the advertised hours per charge."
1,"UPDATE: I contacted Invotek customer service and they responded promptly with steps on how to reset the headphones to factory settings. Unfortunately the headphones aren't holding a charge and can't be turned on. Invotek sent me a new pair and honored their 1 year warranty. Very happy with their customer service and with the headphones overall. Thanks Invotek!<br /><br />UPDATE: after several months of great performance, the headphones no longer hold a charge. Led light doesn't light up when plugged in to recharge, so essentially garbage now. Was really happy with these, now not so much.<br /><br />Amazing bargain for Bluetooth Headphones. Package comes with plenty of additional accessories which is amazing for something thats only $35! I kind of expected them to be total crap, but they are far from it. Feel good in my ear holes, light weight with universal charging cables and even a car adapter.<br /><br />Only draw back is the audio is very bass-y and actually distorts quite a bit. Solved that with an EQ app for my Droid MOTO. I simply adjust and tweak the low freq and the audio sounds way better. Not sure whats out there for iPhones but trying to use these headphones for Amazon streaming on my iPad was fruitless. Most EQ apps for Apple only adjust songs downloaded on the phone, or through iTunes - not other streaming services like Pandora or Spotify. So keep that in mind."
1,"I purchased these headphones for my husband. He’s severely hearing impaired. He absooutely loves the price,sound, quality. Comes with a warranty, great carrying case, cable and extra buds. I’m so pleased with this purchase that I’ll be buying another set for myself soon. I highly recommended these to family and friends.<br />Thank you for selling such a wonderful product."
1,"I use these to listen to podcasts or books on tape, so I can't weigh in on sound quality.  What I can say is that these pair quickly every time, the battery life is pretty good vs others that I've tried, and the ear pieces really go into your ear canal - I'm not sure the over ear thingies are even necessary.  I've had no issues with the waterproofness, but have only worn them around the house and in the hot tub (not underwater or in a rainstorm).  Price was right and I have no complaints."
1,"Secure fit, good sound and battery life."
0,Headphones worked good for about 4 months. Life of the headphones is terrible.
1,"Good sound, fits well, very compact."
1,Great quality and fast shipping. I am very satisfied.
1,Amazing sound!!!Really great!
1,Very easy to pair with my device.  Love these headphones!
1,"I end up needing a new set of wireless headphones every 6-8 months (in most cases it's from heavy/rough use rather than the headphones itself) so I get try a lot of different brands.<br /><br />This pair works perfectly well as a cheap Bluetooth headset and I use it regularly around the house. The sound quality and battery life are both standard and I haven't noticed any actual defects in the manufacturing.<br /><br />There are two things I'll single them out for.<br />First, the ear hooks are extra long and flexible. This may be a plus for you, if you find that other hooks are too short. I don't have that issue, so this ends up actually being a little bit of an annoyance, because every once in a while they'll get stretched and then I have to reshape them around my ears.<br />The second thing- and this is pretty minor- is that unlike other brands the power jack's cover doesn't pivot: it's simply a flap that lifts up. This just means that it takes a little bit of extra effort to keep the flap out of the way when you're plugging it in. I haven't had an issue with the flap wearing out or falling out of the charger, which is good.<br /><br />Bottom line: these are very good headphones for $20 with no significant flaws."
1,Good sound.  I do not like the feel of the cord on my neck with running.  Probably my idiosyncracy rather than product problem but still ...
1,"Nice sound quality, could have better bass / lower frequency. Fit was good, definitely stays put while actively moving during workouts. I sweat heavily so sweat proof worked. If you noticed, I'm writing in past tense. Sound on left side is gone, internal wiring seems weak. I didn't do anything to fray it, I'm calling it wear and tear. Only lasted 8 months. Time for new pair but not this brand"
1,Great product :)
0,I really liked these until two weeks after use they stopped working.
0,The quality is cheap<br />They dont turn up good like the other brand i love and tgis was more expenses
0,"These are supposed to be waterproof, but intense sweating seems to short them out.  I run a lot and noticed after a really sweaty run the phones would start powering off automatically even with a decent charge.  My first pair stopped turning on after 5 months.  I'm on my second pair, and after 2 months the second pair is similarly kaput."
1,I recently purchased the Senso Bluetooth Headphones. They arrived as promised. I truly enjoy the amazing sound quality and the ease with which I was able to connect it to my phone. The company has been supportive in answering any questions I had.
1,Construction is very robust. The sound is great. Bluetooth &#34; pairs&#34; easily.  The price is unbelievable for what you get!
1,it has a really good quality and battery. The only con is that hurts my ear..not so comfortable
1,"Best wireless head phones I've bought in a while.  I use them for running, motorcycle, talking. Everything! They also have pretty darn good bass! Nice product guys. Would buy again. I've had them for about 6 months now and they haven't let me down yet. I took them in the shower to test the water on them and after a 30min shower they are still kicking."
0,Short life
1,"Fit well, stay on."
1,Sound and fit is great. Comes with a lot of accessories. Worth the money
1,I enjoy these earbud sports and have been using them for two years. Great battery and price but I have three issues with their performance.<br /><br />1. They seem to always turn on like they have a mind of their own. I turn them off and shortly after I will notice they are on and connected to my iPhone. Power them off and they power back on  connecting via Bluetooth immediately. This is annoying because they may be across the room or in a bag. How long it takes for them to turn on is variable.<br /><br />2. The lowest volume setting is almost to loud for indoors. I use them at work and I want to be able to turn them down one more notch but that shuts off volume<br /><br />3. Microphone volume is low when talking on phone. The sound on the other end is clear but low volume.<br /><br />Other than those gripes an overall good purchase
0,I am not confident the warranty dept will stand by their 1 yr warranty on these.  They are 2 months old and used 5 times.  Battery will not charge.  Connection issue or whatever but junk!  DO NOT BUY THIS BRAND!  I will update if they stand by their warranty they claim at 1 Year.
1,Best ear buds ever. Awesome sound. I have even been 15 ft. Away. From phone and sound clear.
1,Very easy to set up with my phone.
1,"lots of fun easy to where, light weight. They just hang around your neck when not in use. They also connect to my android quite easily and most importantly the sound quality is great."
0,The product worked well until I had to charge it. It would not take a charge and is useless now.
1,"So far I really like the headphones. They are very comfortable to wear. It would be great if they would trigger my iPhone camera the way my iPhone headphones do, but that is minor. I haven't been able to pair them with my Sony Bravia TV, but that may be the television. They pair easily with my computer and my phone."
1,Compact and great sound. Worth it!
1,"I like the product, listening to audio books"
1,"So far so good. Although these are not noise cancelling, they work great for me at home and when I go for a walk."
1,They have good bass and great sound clarity. I use it everyday as my workout headset and they stay in ears fit.
1,I have had these for months and I love them.  They are wonderful.  The sound is really good too.  They last and last.  What a buy.
1,"great quality of ear phones , simple to use and connect to blue tooth"
1,"I have only used these buds in combination with my IPhone 7 for a week.  Worn on my daily run and in the gym five days.  The sound is great, they are comfortable and K have not lost power for use of two hours at a time.  At this point seems like a good product for the price."
1,Great for the price. Always works well. Fit great.
1,music
1,"You won't regret getting these. I found them comfortable and secure. Sound quality is great. The accessory package is complete and even has a 6' USB to Apple connector as well as micro USB - useful little item for so many things. One small issue and the reason I did not give 5 stars - I cannot lower the volume sufficiently for just soft background music for meditation. The sound drops out, tried both phone and ear buds volume controls. I emailed the company after registering the product. Maybe they will have a solution. If not, then I can always use wired earbuds when meditating."
0,Take several trues to get connected. Will disconnected periodically while connected. Have had several instances of the volume being messed up too. Buy something else.
0,Did not serve my purpose for buying them. You are definitely getting what you pay for. Not great quality!
0,Wouldn’t hold a charge. Returned unit...
0,I tried all the ear pieces and it would not stay in my ear.Total waste of money
1,"Great product at a great price. Not difficult to pair or operate. Love the audio reminder when turning on and off, max volume,"
1,"Really liked first pair because they sound great and feel very comfortable, so I bought a second pair. First pair stopped working so I reached out to customer support. Their employees were extremely prompt and helpful in solving problem. Would buy from them again."
1,"These are steal for just over $30. After doing my review research via Amazon and YouTube I was convinced. I am very satisfied with the headphones now that I have them. I actually very impressed with the quality of the earphones themselves. The most important, the sound is great. I'm an audio tech for my church's AV team and these get my stamp of approval. They are very comfortable to wear. They hold very well in the ear. The noise cancellation works well too. Talked on the phone with my wife she said she could hear good and she sounded pretty clear too.  Amazon's shipping was super fast. I chose 2 day shipping and I got it the next day. Overall it truly is a 5 star product and a 5 star service form Amazon."
1,"Best value for the price you pay.<br />Great sound, and if you like me and love to hear veryyyy LOUD music then this is the one for you :-)"
1,Super nice. Get connection.
1,"Product arrived as expected  and properly packed with all components.  The product is easy to use, intuitive once you have the basics and sound is clear,  Ear buds comfortable and charge quickly.  I would say an good value.  Liked them enough to order another set after crushing my set with the trunk lid"
1,"So far so good, great sound but overall bass could be better."
0,These were great while they lasted but unfortunately just after 4 months the power button got stuck and there is no longer an option to return or contact seller.
1,"Exactly what you would expect from the posting.  What was nice was all of the extras that were included, a couple of charging cables, carrying case, more earbud sizes than you would ever need"
1,"it doesn't stay securely over your ear after the first month of using...it's a pain adjusting it every time...would not recommend for workout ...if you're not moving around then its fine, so for sitting in the car talking its good"
1,I bought these as a present for my boyfriend and he loves them!
1,"I am very happy with these ear buds, I've had several pair of blue tooth ear buds including 3 pair of beats which i can say are nothing to your product, I have'nt had any problem yet for the price of your product these are exceptionally good"
0,"I recently bought new Senso handsfree again. I used to have the same handsfree and it worked perfectly for more than 2 years.<br />I wanted to compare the new pair with old pair. Issue with new one is that the ear support is very poor it deforms very easily hence does not provide stability at all. While old pair was having firm ear support and it never bends. Please see the attached pics 1st pic is for new ones and later one is for old pair.<br />Since I use this in gym only so I need handsfree which does not fall off and provide stability while on treadmill.<br />Sound quality is good, battery life is also great no complaints in that area but it does not solve my purpose.<br />I am not sure why Senso has degrade the quality of ear support. Very disappointing."
1,This is a wonderful Bluetooth headphone I love it plus the charging is great 8 hours of battery life the sound is amazing. Good product it’s a must buy at a reasonable price I would give it 7 stars
0,"I went through 2 pairs of these headphones. Each pair would start to cut out when I rode my bike and turned my head. Initially they were fine, the 2nd pair fared a little better than the first pair. This was with 2 different iPhone's and a Samsung S9 as the audio source.<br /><br />Sitting at a desk they are fine, for an active person try something else."
1,I didn't get a chance to properly appreciate these earbuds until I had to use them in a noisy work environment. The amount of noise cancelation is incredible! And the battery life is always substantial. I can use for two workdays straight before having to recharge. Would definitely recommend.
1,"one of the best I've test , keep going guys"
0,"Got a second pair, and completely different. Sound horrible. I am so disappointed."
1,"These are a really great answer to the need for wireless headphones that are not too bulky and are good for working out. I love how you can conform them to fit around your ears, as no ear is shaped the same and it guarantees a good fit. The sound is good, the earbuds fit well in my ears, and they are light and I know will be great for working out in the summer."
1,"Excellent build quality for the price, extremely easy to use and has a strong bluetooth signal. The sound quality is perfect for podcasts but not ideal for music. A little too bassy and muffled. But excellent for spoken word stuff. The case is good too. Very good starter wireless headphones!"
0,New ear holders make devices unusable. Loved these for years. Maybe new holders are cheaper but they ruin the headphones. No longer stay one.
1,My wife usually has a hard time getting ear buds to stay on/in her ears. These however work just fine for her
1,perfect!!
1,So far I love the Senso Bluetooth Headphones. The sound quality is great. I made a great choice.
1,Comfortable; great quality and sound.
1,They are great in expensive headphones. I would buy them again the only issue is that they die when the battery runs out. There is no warning before hand. To get around this I keep them charged all the time.
1,"Ease of use, good sound quality. Inexpensive!"
1,Loudest earphones I have ever owned
1,"I have a pair that I love, great reception and they receive up to 40 plus feet away.  So I gave a pair to my wife who didn't want them because she doesn't use or want ear plugs of any kind...so my mistake.  However when I asked to return them it was going to cost me over $7.00 for shipping and restocking fee.  I just do not believe that is fair, the box was never opened.  However, I still say it is a great product...just disappointing customer service."
1,These headphones cannot handle any base.  Any hiphop song will be full of static.  I am not sure if the ones I received are defective or if this is how they are.  I am planning on returning them.<br /><br />Follow up:<br />After a factor reset the headphones are working fine.  I therefore change my rating from 2 stars to 5 stars.
1,I have used these a few times now and I am very pleased. I had almost given up on finding an affordable set of wireless headphones that didn't skip out every few seconds with activity.  These sound great and I have not had a single skip over several miles of use.  My only complaint is that the part that fits over your ear is a bit bulky but it's not a deal breaker. So far I am very pleased with my purchase!
1,"The headphones are decent, but they are bulky and the part that goes around your ear could use a thicker wire in it for some more ridgidity. The headphones weigh a decent enough amount that you need a more solid wire in there to form around your ear and hold them in place.<br /><br />Definitely can’t run with these in your ears, they’ll fall out."
1,"Very comfortable, sound seems somewhat muted, but that's compared to my bose soundsports so maybe that isn't fair.  Although the ear fins aren't very supported, it doesn't seem to make a difference in how secure they feel on your ear during workouts.  Bluetooth connection is solid but I have had a couple of issues when I am biking and my phone is in my pocket for some reason.  Overall these are good workout earbuds."
0,I bought these in March and got about 9 months out of them but then one of the sides stopped working randomly. They worked great up until then though.
1,I couldn't believe to sound when listening to Beethoven on youtube! Comfy and simple to manage. I couldn't be happier with an Amazon purchase.
1,Easy to use. Great sound quality. Wonderful Customer service. I needed them replaced for a faulty charge port and withing 5min of calling them they had a new pair ready to ship.
1,"Very good value for money,  and very good sound quality. Previously have used cheaper versions and they intemittently has issues pairing, and sound quality wasn't very good. These are very good, but I have only used 2 days, so reliability and durability will have to be proven."
1,"Great sound, connect easy, and are very comfortable."
1,Great value form the price.
0,"I purchased their headphones in October 2019, I contacted customer support as my headphones became defective in one ear and after following the directions support offered the product was still defective in one ear bud.  It was still under warranty and for the past month they have ignored multiple attempts to contact them about a replacement or workarounds to get the product working as the product has a one year warranty and still under warranty.  I bought a pair of headphones from them in 2016 and their support was much better than so I repurchased another pair in 2019 and was disappointed with the customer support provided.  I will not be purchasing another pair from them and advise anyone in the future to not expect a response about replacement headphones although they do advertise a one year warranty.  I have read other reviews with the same experience and will not be spending my money with this company again"
0,The piece that goes around your ear is to rubbery. They don't stay on your ear. The sound is good though.
1,"Above expectations. The music is clear and define. I love ove my new Senso Bluetooth headphones for running, they are very comfortable"
0,"Horrible! Sound quality is really terrible, couldn’t use it to answer calls (other person can never hear me) and battery died after 3 gym uses. I’m not even sure why this product got decent reviews ."
1,"Great functionality - bluetooth connection is solid; sound is excellent, earbuds stay in place, comfortable to wear, and seal extraneous sound.<br />Extras - nice protective case, two cord cinches, 3 extra pairs bud tips, two-usb outlet car charger, two charging cords (short and long)<br />Price - inexpensive for what your're getting"
1,"I really like the quality, and they included a Phone attachment for my car to attach the cell phone to my dash at no charge.  A nice extra surprise."
1,"I've purchased several of these in the past, because I have loved the product but somehow manage to break them (not the product's fault). But they seem to have changed the design on the latest model, which is larger and clunkier than its predecessors. It doesn't fit the ear as well and the over-ear hooks don't keep their shape from use to use."
1,These don’t fit well. They’re constantly falling out when I’m still or moving. They only last about 3 hours before dying. Decent sound system though
0,I have none paired connection what so ever; just the first time i had a connection. but after that i have three days trying to connect with my cellphone Iphone 6S through ActivBuds Even more; the Headphone are not able to get charge...
1,Sound is excellent. The fit is comfortable.
1,These headphones have been fantastic so far.  They are light and comfortable and stay in place while running.  They sound great and were priced right!
1,Good
1,Have had these for a few months now and can't be happier.  Works as both a headset for making phone calls and athletic headphones for running.  The sound quality is great.  Comes with sets of interchangeable foam and rubber pieces for ear comfort.
1,"Sound quality great, smaller than they appear on the order screen. I was specifically looking for over the ear type of headphones, and when these arrived the silicone frame for over the ear seemed too flimsy, but ended up being extremely comfortable and has so far held up running, and lifting upper and lower body without interfering with any moves. Very comfortable and even a steal at the price."
0,I the first time I used them they worked great. But now they won’t connect to my phones bluetooth.  I am very frustrated.  I did charge them and it turns on I think it’s got a blu and red alternating light when I click it on.  Money spent for nothing
1,"Sound is very good. They fit comfortably in my ear, the flexible arms hold them in place withput being uncomfortable, and they are not too heavy. I am very pleased.<br /><br />I haven't tried them for conference calls. I got them for recreation and long, pointless walks on a treadmill.<br /><br />I am very satisfied with this purchase."
1,Must buy!!
1,"I ordered this earbuds, I loved it very easy to connect to my iPhone 6 Plus. My co-workers also ordered after trying my earbuds but not the price I paid for.<br />I will purchase more for X Mas gifts when they go on<br />sell again. Very satisfied so give it 5 stars"
0,Very choppy. Skips every time I move. I had to switch them out with my old ones.
1,These are excellent earbuds and a fantastic price.  I appreciate the super quick delivery; these are excellent!
1,I pair w Samsung Galaxy S9+. I need to have it ~1 ft away to avoid constant cutting out. Very annoying but otherwise works well
0,"I have had so much trouble with these headphones. The problem is with the bluetooth connection. I've had these for 6 months, and since the beginning, getting a connection to my iPhone 6 has been problematic. If you turn on the power and hear in the headphones &#34;Connected&#34;, you're not. No app recognizes the headphones either. then you go into settings and disconnect, reconnect, disconnect, reconnect to get the actual connection. You have to do this every time. Once connected, no problems. But i've final bought a replacement headphone to use."
1,"These earbuds have been great.  Clear sound, easy to use.  The car charger and extra cable are a great add."
0,"I will be returning these unfortunately.<br />I read people's reviews on these headphones, warning that the quality isn't going to be high-grade, but that they get the job done. With that in mind, I wasn't expecting anything awe-inspiring but I was disheartened to find that any normal user would be able to recognize that the bass in these headphones is just too heavy. When listening to music, the bass overcomes any of the other sound and essentially muffles the song. The quality on these is worse than any basic $10-15 pair of earbuds you can get from Panasonic/Sony.<br /><br />The headphones themselves are fine. They fit well and come with a really nice package of accessories like charging cables, wire tie, carrying case, etc, but I'm not interested in spending money (albeit the best price around) for music I can't enjoy due to the muffled sound quality."
1,"Worked well for me for about 10-11 months.. Then the left ear-piece started to work intermittently, depending on how I was moving my head. I tried resetting the it, keeping the phone just in front of  me on the desk, few feet apart from the headphones... nothing worked, I guess I need to replace them..."
1,Sound quality is good and is better than expected for the price. No problem with staying in ears even after 5 miles of running. Worth for money
1,"These are great headphones. A little bass heavy for certain types of music, but thats an easy fix for most devices in the eq. Great value"
1,"Even before I got the headphones I received a personal note from one of the owners of the company ensuring that I knew I could reach out to them if I had any problems. The product arrived on time and my daughter absolutely adores them! They fit comfotrtably with great noise cancelling properties . They're everything you could ask for in great wireless headphones:comfort ,quality and an astounding price point. The personal service is exceptional and makes you feel like a valued customer . Highly recommend"
1,"Sound is great, told voice is clear. like em!"
1,"Stumbled upon this product in a Deals of the Day.<br />Could not resist the price.<br />I am hard of hearing and wear hearing aids.<br />I had given up on high fidelity listening.<br />NOW I HEAR IN HIGH FIDELITY<br />The pleasure of Music and Movies.<br />Happy, Happy, Happy, Happy"
1,Was a bit worried that these would be too bulky. But they work great in the gym on the elliptical or when doing situp's they stay in place. Really appreciate the cool charging cable that came with them. The cigarette lighter adapter however failed after two weeks.
1,"Battery life is awesome, and connectivity was easy"
1,Finally! These work with my IPhone X and are cheaper than most! Love them
0,"I am returning the SENSO ActivBuds Bluetooth Headphones I ordered from Amazon for the following reasons:<br /><br />1.  Earbuds do not stay in place with ANY sort of activity.  I am a female and the very flimsy rubber supports that hold buds in place are absolutely HUGE and in no way adjustable!  There is no way that these will fit snugly on a normal sized person, and the over ear supports are far too flimsy to stay in place during normal walking, let alone running!<br />2.  I’m not sure why the cable between the ear buds is so long.  Far too much cable to be comfortable running with unless you tie it up."
1,"As far as bluetooth headphones go, these are pretty decent. The best thing about them is how well they stay in your ears. You can do some pretty intense movement without them moving at all. Very comfortable to wear, and the battery life is more than decent.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is with the amount of bass these things put out. It tends to drown out the treble almost completely. Don't even think about watching movies on your phone with them, unless you like to listen to people talk under water. Maybe I am just used to my Skullcandy headphones... Even adjusting my equalizer on my Galaxy S7 doesn't do much to help with this issue.<br /><br />All in all, I am happy with the purchase for using when I run, bike, or workout."
1,Works great.  Makes going on a run so much easier. Love them
0,Pros:<br />1. Cheap<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. This thing falls off VERY easily. Useless for running.<br />2. The midtones are very high so I had to mess around with the equalizer on my phone to get a decent sound. The treble is still weak though.<br />3. The cable is too long. Gets caught on the shirt neck and comes off.<br /><br />I do not recommend.
1,"Cheap, do what they're supposed to, and still work 3 months later."
1,The earphones fit well and it was pair them with my ipod
1,"I bought the headphones for my husband who paddle boards. He loves them. He said that they are comfortable, very secure and the sound is extremely clear. Great purchase."
0,Not as good as reviews made it look. Skips and cuts out. Don't want to return and deal with the hassle but I woulnt order it again
1,This Bluetooth headset is an excellent value. Control functions from the headset works great and is convenient.
0,These are terrible. They don’t stay connected for more than a half hour at a time.
0,"The first one I received worked great for two weeks and then stopped working. It was replaced and the 2nd one would charge but wouldn't speak or pair with my device. A shame since when it worked, it was just what I wanted."
1,I could not be happier with the sound quality of  these headphones.<br />thank you.
1,I really find the max volume of an iPhone with wired earbuds to be much to quiet. The SENSO blue tooth earbuds are much louder and I can finally here callers. Quality wise the are fine. Mine died after a little less than a year. However they were good about getting me a replacement. In any case I find that all earbuds only last 6 months so the SENSO ones were about average. If you are a hard user of ear buds I strongly recommend getting the insurance. SENSO took care of my problem under warranty but I had about to days left when it died
1,"No bad quality. Most of the price must have to do with all the extras you get. Cigarette lighter dual outlet with next gen iPhone charger and Android adapter, a few sizes in buds, mini usb charge cord, and anti tangle contraption."
1,"I’m on my second pair because my dog chewed up my first and I could not live without these things!!! The noise cancellation is pretty good for the price, though it’s certainly not like those headphones that block out everything. But the sound quality is amazing, and it comes with multiple bud sizes to fit your ear! These things do not fall out during a nice hard workout or even during a nap.<br /><br />Cannot recommend them enough for the price!!!"
1,"Let me talk about my routine and then you are going to understand better.<br />I run everyday 6 miles which is around of 45 minutes more 30 minutes of workout. I was taking shower everyday with my phone. I just don't want to stop listening to the podcasts. I always charge once and run for two days. For some reason when I went for the second  day the phone was dead. If i put it to charge again it will work normally. For that reason I look for something new but I couldn't because the price and quality is really good at this phones. The other reviews from other phones are always about some problem. So yesterday I bought a new one and I noticed that the size decreased, the sound improved and it fits better (maybe because it is knew, i don't know). So if you don't want to get bothered with your headphones and you just want to complete your workout with quality, I think that's a good option. Sincerely...."
1,I love these headphones because they are water proof.  My last pair onlylasted a year and a half!
1,"Little sad that they keep disconnecting from blue tooth device, it’s also choppy with in and out sound 😞. Also you walk away from the source about 5 ft and it starts fading in and out. Wouldn’t buy again. But the price was right."
0,"Holy bass, if you like an extreme amount of bass you will love these. The bass is almost over wellming"
1,I loved this product and use it everyday for a run or hike; but it just died right around a year. The light is one and takes charge but wireless doesn't work.
1,I have trouble finding headphones to fit my rather petite ears. Not only do these fit but they have excellent battery life and reception. I also like that there's no volume control unit on the neck cable to weight you down.
1,Item as described with fast shipping. I am quite pleased with this unit and would recommend this product.
1,Better than beats or jay bird and cheap fits good don’t falling or move deep bass and quality in music
1,Very easy to setup and amazing sound quality. Great product and happy customer :)
1,Excellent item
0,My interest was strictly for phone calls. The voice quality was very muddy and not acceptable for my needs.
1,Great product! The noise canceling is awesome! Feels good and comes with different size ear pieces. 10/10
1,"Great earbuds, Fantastic customer Servicep"
1,"Update (May 2, 2017): After using it for multiple weeks now, I can only say I am a very satisfied customer of this excellent product (for the price). One of the best! Their customer service is outstanding - I had lost the wire tie, and they immediately emailed me to say that they have shipped a couple of them and promised to improve it!<br />++++++++++++++++++++++<br />Early product review/first looks: I received this from amazon well before the guaranteed delivery time (kudos to Amazon, as always!). Product packaging was perfect, and I was pleasantly surprised to see two charging wires (short & long), and the dual-port car charger, so got impressed right away... quality & build is excellent, and bluetooth pairing worked like a charm with my iPhone 7 within seconds! Now, to the best part of all, the sound quality and loudness (at 50% volume setting, sound is booming, as other reviewers have mentioned), for the price-point is outstanding!!! All in all, I am very satisfied and happy with this purchase, and reviews by others helped me make the right decision, so big thanks to them all! Highly recommended!!!"
1,"Wow, I’m actually impressed by the f/u email to check on customer satisfaction !!  I am very appreciative of that!!  I do not have any issues of concern, the sound is much better than I expected and am very happy with my purchase!!  Good job on a very good product that doesn’t cost a ridiculous price !!"
1,"The item was shipped fast which is typical of amazon. These headphones are well packaged and come with extras. I have not test the iPhone charging cable yet but don't expect having issue with it yet. At first I was a bit concerned that the extra soft ear piece that helps with keeping the headphones in place was not going to work. However it works, and like others stated if it was harder it may be uncomfortable. I only listened to these few times for quick workouts and that tells me the battery will last the advertised time. The quality is good, not great however for 30$ you can't expect miracles :) I'm very happy with these."
1,Works great!
1,I love these things ! . I bought them after my beats crapped out on me. I was worried bc they were so cheap but they sound great and customer service is top notch !  update: I just got my second pair in the mail . The first pair crapped out in three months .the warranty is top notch !  I wear these things everyday to the gym and they were quick to replace them . Seriously buy these things if you want awesome cheap gymphones
1,Amazing Headphones. The battery lasts so long. I have yet to have to charge them and I've used them for a couple of weeks. The sound quality is pretty good and they are very sweat proof. I love that it syncs with my iPhone so I can see the battery on my iPhone. Very easy to set up and use out of the box. Beats quality for a fraction of the price.
1,Very great product for the price. Sound was beyond expectations.
1,"Tried these over the weekend and they were great!  Good quality sound, fit really well, noise cancelling is really good - could not hear anyone around me.  I used them on a run and they did not slip out, worked really well even though they wore soaked when I was done.  Definitely recommend them!"
1,"I am an electronics technician, an audiophile, and a runner. These bluetooth earphones are perfect for me. They rest comfortably in my ears and are barely noticeable while excercising. The only change I would make is to assign the forward volume button as the + and the back for -. Good job Sensor and seller."
1,Works well. The chord gets caught on my collar when I’m wearing a shirt. Not much they can do about that.
1,"The  best  I  have  found  of this type  ,, Will buy again  as  gift ....DLK"
1,I love it . It for perfectly.
1,"I essentially have only one problem, paired this with my iPhone 6S as well as my iPad 3 and it’s been impossible to bring the volume down to an acceptable level to pleasantly listen to music. I’ve made every adjustment I can think to try, no luck!<br />I so wanted to love this, it looks great seems extremely durable!"
1,"I thought these would be &#34;ok&#34; but they're amazing! Now I know why they're rated so high. Took five seconds to pair with my iPhone, couldn't be easier! Money VERY well spent!"
1,Works great and is easy to use. Highly recommend this product.
1,Love them.  The sound is great.  Thank you for providing a great product at a price I could afford.
0,Garbage. Lasted one month.
1,They are great
1,"I have no complaints beside the fact that the earpiece has a box on it that took a little getting used to. It's not to annoying, I'm just being nit picky. The audio is very good.  Especially for the price. I have had no problems with the Bluetooth. The battery life seems to be as advertised. 5 plus hours per charge."
1,I love these headphones.
0,"Worked fine if I sat down and didn't move.  If I did anything other than that - like any type of physical activity - these would cut out constantly.  Super annoying - I mean unless you like your music starting and stopping every 10 seconds in a workout.  Maybe these will work for you if all you do is sit like some bro lifting weights and trying to hook up with fake blondes at the gym, but if you're actually doing any physical activity I'd suggest a better product."
1,These are my first bluetooth headphones. I'm glad I cut the cord.
1,They are amazing and love that it came with a case and a car phone holder :) Thank you!
0,I got this in November and it stopped working in April... Disappointed!
1,"I have had these headphones for nearly a year and they finally show some wear in the worst way.<br /><br />What I like:<br />Compact, comfortable, mostly good sound and pretty good mic especially for the price.<br />I primarily used these headphones during runs and gym activity.  They've been good with sweat and the only real issue I had were when the audio would get messed up when too close to metal walls.<br /><br />What I don't like<br />The chord that tethers the headset together.  if rubbed can but not always will disrupt the sound, this happened rarely when running with a hoody but thats negligible.<br /><br />I don't know how often this happens to other users but I've had these for almost a year and the chord that tethers the headset is failing.  it looks fine but my left earbud is failing.  I don't know where to find a warranty clause on Amazon for Senso but I know their website says it has a 1-year warranty on this product.  If I can get my headset repaired or replaced I will gladly change my review to 5 stars if not, well $34 for a wireless bluetooth headset that lasts a year wasn't too bad."
0,"Lasted less than 6 months and I can't return. Even when they did work, charge would not last, and would die quickly."
1,The first pair that came were defective however they sent me a new pair and I was definitely surprised in the sound quality
1,So far so good. Amazing product for the $.  Good sound (I'm not an audiophile).  Pairs very easily.  I've got tiny ears and switched out to the smallest ear buds which work well.
1,I haven't purchased these but all of these reviews seem fishy. 8 pages of reviews for today alone? The day is only half over. And then 8 pages of reviews EVERY day? How many people are buying these exactly?
1,"My wife loves your headsets. I wish they were adjustable, because she has a small earlobe, but great headsets regardless."
1,Easy to pair with my iPad. Stereo quality is superb. Curious how durable these will be over time. Very comfortable during exercise!
1,Awesome headphones!
1,"These headphones are great, but the customer service by Senso is better. My headphones broke after about three months (the button got jammed), but I contacted customer service and they quickly sent me a new pair. Very pleased with the service. The headphones also worked great and stayed in my ears even while sweating and running."
0,work very well. I wish they were smaller but reception and hooked up to blue tooth very easy I keep ordering these head phones because my last set just quit taking a charge after 6 months. I still have them if you want to see the problem
1,I love these head phone and they are very comfortable I will definitely recommend these to anyone. Just try and and you will see.
1,Great sound quality. Stays put during workout. Definitely reccomend
0,I really liked them for 3 months. Then they stopped holding a charge. Now they are worthless
1,"This wireless headset was easy to set up, link with my phone with no problems. The sound quality is equal to the 200.00 pair that I have been using at a fraction of the price. Not to mention also a lot louder, I only set them at about half on the volume. Wish I had tried these before spending a lot on the others. Well done senso!!!"
1,"I REALLY want to like this product more.  The sound is good, they fit well, hold a good charge, and connect easily.  But the one main problem I have is with the Bluetooth reception.  It works great as long as the right side headphone has an almost line-of-sight to your transmitter, which in my case is my iPod.  If I put the iPod in my pocket, or my body gets in the way, or I turn away from the iPod sitting out somewhere, there is a brief loss of signal.  It picks right back up once it regains signal and keeps playing, but the constant interruption is maddening.  I may try an arm band for my iPod to see if that helps.  If it were not for this issue, I would give these a 5 star for sure.."
1,"Sound quality is good, but the range sucks. Sometimes I'll have my phone in my pocket and the audio will be going in and out"
0,"These earbuds have no range, only work if your phone is in front pocket, connection is frequently interrupted, have underlying hum while connected, do not stay in ear during running workouts despite multiple sized inserts. In general they do not perform as advertised. Company did their best to resolve issues by replacing with a second pair, but both perform in the same manner."
1,These are great considering how inexpensive they are. My puppies just chewed up my headphones and I will buy these again.
1,This is the 4th pair of headphones I have bought.  I keep them everywhere!  I have bought and returned more expensive headphones but these headphones have  BY FAR the best sound and connectivity of all of them.  I have bought them as gifts and everyone loves them.
1,"UPDATE TO UPDATE:  The company has sent me a replacement set, and I am a satisfied customer.  They were really easy to work with in getting the below issue resolved<br /><br />UPDATE TO Below review: I have since been contacted by the factory, and they are working with me to resolve the issue.  I will update with the progress.  If they resolve the issue I will be moving stars up to 5, as for the price of these, they performed as expected - when they worked.<br /><br />Received this 4 months ago.  Great product presentation and accessories.  Paired easily with my Verizon kyocera smart phone.  Great sound quality for the price.  Earbud straps a little flimsy, but the buds generally remained in place during workouts and bike rides - fit better after changing out to the correct sized, included buds.  After sweating for awhile they did start falling out a bit more easily, but still not a major issue.  The range of these is short - within 3 feet of the phone works best.<br /><br />On June 5, the units stopped working.  They will not turn on at all.  The charging light comes on to show fully charged.  I have tried different chargers.  The units will not come on.  I have emailed the company and will update once I hear back regarding how or if they will handle my warranty.  Overall, I was pleased with these while they worked, but keep in mind, I am not a huge tech guy.  So, I am not very critical on electronic reviews."
1,"I am just obsessed with these headphones. I love the dofferent sized ear buds because i have weird ears and standard ones dont usually fit me so it was nice to have a smaller option. They sit very comfortavly around the ear also. Spund is great and i love that i can completely control it from the headphones themselves. Volume, pause, turn on/off, skip a song or go back. AND i can answer my phone when someones calling and use it to talk to them, and hang up. They are just perfect, everything i wanted. Highly Recommend!"
1,"Easy to use and figure out. Recently purchased the new Iphone8 and can’t stand the ear buds the phone came with because I feel they way I go about things I’d lose them. So looked for something else, these work great. Like how they are connected and can’t lose one ear bud. Sounds great and really can’t hear outside noise when I’m jamming to my music. Glad I stumbled upon these. Keep up the good work."
1,"Comfortable, sound is great, battery life is longer then I expected and price is perfect!"
1,best quality for the cost
1,"Sound is ok, lots of bass. Maybe my ears are too small but the fit is loose, constant re-adjusting, slips out of ear & hooks are virtually useless."
1,Excellent product. First rate customer service. Sound quality is great and these are very comfortable to wear. I use them mainly with my iPhone SE and they work and sound much better than the ear buds that came with the phone.
1,Sound aight
1,"Shipment was fast, Earbuds are easy to work with and sound Great!"
1,Wonderful- well worth the money! Work with an active lifestyle- such as running or jumping!
1,It’s a very good product for this price!
1,They work and have easy Bluetooth connection.
1,"These are the best headphones! They are well made, they sound great, and they fit the ear perfectly. This was surprising given the great price.<br />I highly recommend these headphones."
1,Work great would buy again fast shipping
1,I used the Senso Headphones mostly for the gym and I never had an issue until recently. Over the last few weeks it seems that the headphones are starting to deteriorate. They will randomly disconnect from my phone via Bluetooth and also shut off quite frequently even though they are fully charged. Physically they are in great shape. I think it did it's job but I would have obviously wanted them to last a little longer.
1,These are great headphones..<br />The sound is awesome. The distance is good.<br />Just what I expected. I would recommend these headphones.
1,Excelente
0,"At first I was fascinated with these little guys, they came with a carrying case and multiple eartips. But that's pretty much all the positive I can say.<br /><br />Sound quality: regular, I had issues with loosing audio and bluetooth connection issues with my phone which was literally next to the earphones.<br /><br />Battery life: is one of the biggest issues with these ones, just around 1-2 hrs of continuous play.<br /><br />And see for yourself: the cables are damaged with normal use, 3 years later. Pretty much rendering them useless, will now have to find a new psir of wireless earbuds."
1,"They fit a little snug,  but don't move. They don't cancel all outside noise, but they do well enough for the price. Decent product, better than the MPOW Wolverine earbuds I had previously purchased."
1,Super comfortable and great sound for the price
1,"I was really excited by the reviews and price discount, but that didn't last long.<br /><br />Positives:<br />The headphones fit snugly, cancel out a lot of noise, and have excellent bass.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />The sound quality is lower than expected. These headphones sound different than all of my other headphones, and not in a good way. The sound isn't very clear, almost muffled. I also have had constant connectivity issues when I connect to my iPhone. The headphones will emit a beeping noise every 30 seconds or so and cause my audio to pause. It's very strange because if I disconnect and &#34;forget&#34; the headphones from my phone and then reconnect, they work fine. However, this is very inconvenient to do every time I want to use them with my phone. I have also noticed the wind noise that other commenters have mentioned.<br /><br />I had high hopes for these, but I will probably return them soon."
1,They're lightweight and fit well. Sound is great - blocks out office noise. If I lose these I would buy again.
1,"I was unsure about purchasing the headphones and transitioning to the wireless life (in terms of listening to music) but these headphones were not only comfortable but effective. They connected with my iPhone 7 seamlessly. Additionally, when I had an issue with the product, I was greeted with a friendly, sincere, timely and courteous response that made me feel like a person and not just a number or a customer. I recommend this product not only because of the quality, but because of the people who represent this company."
1,"I was considering returning them because they aren't my style (I prefer in ear buds) but I haven't been able to find a pair that's better than these, so I decided to keep them. I really like that the controllers are on the buds, the battery life is great (I get about 7 hours) and they don't constantly update me on the battery status. I use them to workout and they're great, the cord is long enough to tie them into my pony tail."
0,"This headphones only work for 3 weeks and then they never turn on again, no recommended at all."
1,These headphones are great for the money.. I have had 3 sets only because I lost the others.. The sound quality is good.  Not complete noise cancelation but I don't really notice anything and I wear that 3 hours A-day at least through hardcore workouts or just the grocery store. Good buy!
0,"3 weeks in and this headset is working great. They sound good and have decent battery life, averaging about 6 hrs. Update: At week 4 the Senso headset is no longer charging. #sad"
1,"These headphones are FANTASTIC!  I have very small ear canals, so finding earphones that fit is really difficult. I bought an iPhone 8 and wanted to go wireless. The small ear buds work perfectly for me."
1,amazing sound i love listing to music but a lot of these headphons out there just dont cut it i was a little lenient on buying these but after using them just for less than an hour I must say they are an amazing pair of headphones would highly recommend you to anybody whether you're working out or working in the garage or doing anything they stay in your ears I don't fall out voice activated calling they are just an amazing pair of earphones
1,Sound so good people can't hear extra noise normally heard when using speaker or other types of headphones.
1,"So far very good, sound is clear and crisp, and no cords, enjoying"
1,This is the first wireless earphones that actually stay in my ears while I'm running on the treadmill.  I don't have to fidget with the earphones or stop and make adjustments while running for 30 minutes.  I can stay focused and listen to music or podcasts. The behind the ear piece is super flexible.  Totally happy.
1,The first day these headphones were awesome!  But then after that they keep cutting out for like the first 5 minutes of putting them on but then they are ok.  It is just a little annoying for the first 5 minutes.  Maybe I need to charge them fully every time before I use them.  I thought it was my apple watch that was the problem but I tried with the phone and still the same issue with the first 5 minutes.  But I still like them and they are comfortable.
1,"Bought these for my teenager who seems to have them surgically attached to his ears. Price seemed very reasonable given the advertised features.  When I had a chance to listen to them, I was very impressed and bought a second pair for myself. Thanks for a great product."
1,"So far so good, this device has help me with my workouts and it feels comfortable. I feel that the earbuds are pretty big for my ear. But other than that is great long lasting battery."
1,Fine for the price. Died after 6 months.
1,Great for the price I paid
1,"I was looking for a decent pair of wireless headphones at a good price.  When I received them, I was worried that they may be too bulky and not stay in my ear during my workouts.  This has not been the case.  The headphones fit very well; the flexibility of the ear piece allows for a tight fit and helps minimize movement.  The sound quality is more than adequate and I have not had any issues connecting via Bluetooth.  I'm very satisfied with this product."
1,"I live in Houston Texas where it is hot and humid during the summer months.  When I run 8-10 miles the headphones get soaked.  I've ruined many different headphones.  These are the first to survive the beating they take.  They fit well, are light, and great for long runs.  They are an awesome set of sweat-proof headphones for the price!"
0,"These worked well for 9 months, but suddenly I can't charge them anymore. Which means I can't use them. I can't recommend them for this reason."
1,Works like the high-end brands
1,Awesome wireless headphones for the price.They sound is amazing the qauilty on clear and hard bass. ALSO have nice extra features like the pause button in the number when it calls through your headphones they feel good on your head too don't even feel like they're on and very comfortable. The extra cord and car charger too is a nice touch
1,I have a hard time hearing out of one ear due to injury but these activbuds are great and comfortable.
0,"Paired fine with my iPhone 7, until few weeks ago. Now it does not pair and it is practically useless."
1,"These are terrific. Great sound & easy to pair to my 6+ IPhone. Carrying case is sharp, & dual chargers are a bonus."
1,"Constantly having problems, can turn on by itself, Noise cancellation rarely work on mine but battery last long!"
1,Perfect sound
1,"Great price for what you get! I love how these come with multiple size buds, a car charger, multiple charging cables and the headphones themselves are made very well.  They work great too! I have very sensitive ears and even wearing glasses hurt, so I was nervous how these would feel.  Because they are made of silicone, they don't hurt the top of my ear.  They hold in place very well and the sound is awesome.  I bought two of these for my husband and I."
1,Very good quality. Perfect for the gym
1,Overall I like the volume especially when you're on the road in your vehicle. Fantastic product for what they sell for!
1,""" These Bluetooth headsets arrived earlier than expected. I am super impressed with these, work great, when I have these on I don't hear the noise and yelling from my upstairs neighbors, I am super sensitive to noise so that alone has me very satisfied that I don't have to have the headset volume set high either. These are a must have."""
1,I'm happy with purchase
1,"When I received it, the seal of headphone package was broken. Amazon packing was good.<br />I bought this product for its great rating. But it is not that upto the mark. There are few issues:<br />1. The left ear piece sound fades away as soon as I push it inside the ear canal. Right earpiece is fine.<br /><br />2. The sound is more bassy. Controlling treble is not possible.<br /><br />Apart from that, the design is good, the buttons, functionality and connectivity is all good. I used it while work out and it did not fell apart.<br /><br />I just wish that the sound was more crispier and left earpiece would work correctly.<br /><br />Update~~~~~~<br />Tried the smallest silicone earpiece and now the left earpiece seems functional. Medium and large silicone earpieces don’t work. Bass still too high. No way to control the equalizer."
1,"Love these headphones. Was concerned about the sound quality but I think it’s perfect for the price and the purpose of working out. You can walk a ways away from your phone and they still work. Only thing I wish I could do is change the song from the headphones. Also, I love the different size ear buds included. Senso have thought it all through!"
1,"Great product. Great sound. Long battery. Fits well & wont fall out. Today I ran 1/2 marathon in the rain, this headset was perfect."
0,"Broke down after 2 months, awful quality. Don't buy"
1,"The product worked well at first right out of the box. Now after a few weeks of using it, there is barely any sound out of the right side. The left side still works fine. So now I have essentially a mono pair of headphones. Very disappointing as when they worked, they worked well. But need more than two weeks out of this product to make it worth getting."
1,Really good earbuds as good as beats
0,"Really dissapointed that these did not last that long. Really wanted to like them ,but now they are just completely dead and won't turn on. So conveniently out of the product support window too. What a shame. Spend your money on something that will actually last."
1,"These headphones rock. By far the best Bluetooth headphones I've ever used which is a lot. They stay in when I work out, the sound is nice, the battery is really good. Something I didn't realize before buying is that the over ear parts are flexible, so they can be constantly repositioned for comfort and fit. Would absolutely recommend. Actually bought a second pair for my wife."
1,"I used only once, but have good sound and is held in place at the time of exercise."
1,So far so good but I only had them for a week so I will be coming back in 3 months to give my real review
1,Great for the price
1,"I'm currently loving these. I bought these for work, because I need a pair of stealthy headphones to listen to music at work to kill my boredom and these are amazing compared to the last pair I bought, Mpow Cheetahs, strangely appropriately named because I felt well and cheated after buying them.<br /><br />I guess I have oddly shaped ears because ear buds in general just don't sit well in them and they either pop out or just don't fit well to begin with. Not these. These ear buds stay seated properly and are comfortable to wear for a workshift. They charge quickly and last a long time, usually having enough juice toast 8 hours. Sound quality is great, I frequently find myself riding the volume because they are so loud. I can barely hear the background noise around me when I've got them in. The device paired easily with my phone and it has good range, allowing me to leave my phone charged up and cover a fairly large area of movement without losing the signal much. The buds come with a carrying case, two usb cables, a short one and a longer one that has as adapter for iPhone jacks, and a plug for your car so you can charge on the go, as well as replacement pads for your ear buds if they get all nasty and waxy.<br /><br />These are well worth the money, trust me."
1,I bought these to surprise my husband since he was dropping hints about wanting a pair! He absolutely LOVES them! They have great fit and great sound! Even our college kid who doesn't think we can pick good tech stuff was impressed.
1,Delivery was very fast and the buds work very well. I'm very pleased with my purchase and would recommend them to everyone.
1,"Pro: good build quality, relatively comfortable to wear, good sound for the price, nice if somewhat bulky case.<br /><br />Cons: Since they are very sound isolating you can hear yourself breathe if music is at low volume and eat (don't try hard pretzels, LOL), when it's even a bit windy outside you get a lot of wind noise (imagine blowing into a microphone). Stronger wind will pretty much listening to music impossible. The cable connecting the two is coated with a sticky rubber, if you get even a bit sweaty on your neck it sticks and if you move your head one side will fall out of your ear. At lower volume you can also hear the cable rubbing against your clothing.<br /><br />All in all good quality for around the house, at work, etc, but definitely not for jogging/biking/hiking or watching TV and eating some crunchy snacks. All in all I would not buy them again. I'd give 2.5 stars if that were an option."
0,"Head phones were used about once or twice a week. Head phones broke (left ear piece). I took out ear piece, and it was in two pieces. Not satisfied. Disappointed."
1,"Very comfortable and have very good bass. I workout at a very packed gym, so the songs cut in and out sometimes. Otherwise I really like them, especially for the price!"
1,They are great
1,love these headphones -- comfortable -- the sound is great
0,"Most important thing headphones can do is fit my ears.  They do not at all, I can't get them in my ears with the ear tips on.  I'm not a fan of the sound quality of these headphones.  Really tinny.  I'm no audiophile either, I am quite content with the ear buds that come with an iPhone, but the pair ear buds I had started shorting out."
1,Love these.
0,Stopped connecting to my phone within 2 weeks of use. They didn't even sound great when they worked.
1,"These headphones are amazing! I love how the bass is not compromised and how portable they are. Most importantly, I'm happy that they stay in my ears for once."
1,"These earbuds have held up well during pretty intense workouts and have proven to be sweat resistant.  They fit well, don't fall out during a workout and have great audio quality.  In addition to the nice quality, I am giving this review 5 stars because of the great customer service this company has provided.  For some reason, my earbuds stopped working this week.  I emailed the seller explaining my problem, and they responded very quickly.  We tried to troubleshoot the issue with a couple of very easy steps.  When that did not work, they confirmed my replacement earbuds would be sent since it fell within the 1 year warranty.  I am very please with the product and the seller, and I will buy from them again."
1,"So far, they are great and seem to be the best blue tooth headset I have had"
0,Audio system is not good
1,"They worked pretty well for 7 months.  Stopped working today.  Called to get another pair since within one year of buying.  They are sending a replacement.  Sadly, the warranty on the new pair will only be until November of this year, one year from the original purchase.  Is that weird?"
1,"These were recommended to me by a close friend. She regularly used her set until they went through the wash.<br />I decided to give them a try.<br />I have an iPhone 7 and would connect these via bluetooth, but they would frequently cut in & out. It was hard to listen to anything using them because of that. I tried multiple locations, phone placement, wire placement, etc and I had the same issue.<br /><br />They are made with quality material, come with a really nice zipper travel case and extra ear bud pieces.<br />Battery didn’t last as long as I would’ve liked."
1,Great value for really good performance
1,sweet phones bought them so I could ware them in the shower didn't know if they would just die in the water or not description says there waterproof and they are!!
0,Cuts off music on and off like a hot knife through butter. Don't snug fit to the ear. Constantly have to adjust.
1,Would buy again.
1,Great value!
1,DOES NOT FALL OFF like The half dozen OTHER headphones I've owned!!!!
1,"Build quality, sound quality, volume, design, packaging, instructions all excellent.  Overall rating on a scale of 1 to 10 is 9.999. The rating would be a 10 except for you need to change the word (now) to (not) in the last question and answer in the troubleshooting section of the user guide. 😂"
0,I don't have much good to say about these.<br /><br />They are big and fall out while jogging.<br /><br />Also they are NOT waterproof and died after 2 months...
1,"After several headphones, these have been the best by far for running and general exercising activities. The headphones provide one of the best 'noise cancelling' features for headsets in it's price range! Now this is not a Bose noise cancelling quality, but for what you pay, it definitely very good. Connectivity to my iPhone 7+ and iPad pro was very smooth.<br /><br />The accessories you get with these headphones are unbelievable. Great case, and charging cables, extra buds make it very good value. The only negative I experienced occasionally, the Bluetooth signal gets interrupted at times. Only last evening I found the charger being plugged in caused interference. This interference has occurred occasionally but not often enough for me to remove more than one star.<br /><br />Overall great product, and great value!"
1,"The Senso ear buds are perfect!  They pair up immediately, have a great sound and great battery life.  Delivery was on-time."
1,Great product at a great price.
1,"The sound on these are great but they just do not fit.....no matter what I've tried.  The ear loops which I prefer to have while working out just are way too big....the loop doesn't even come close to touching my ear.  Thus said these fall out within seconds of putting them on, I can't imagine trying to workout with these in.  Guess I'll be on the hunt for a new pair that fit better....was such a bummer to be soooo excited to upgrade from my old wireless ones to these then to be disappointed."
1,Great head phones<br />Easy setup and part<br />Thank you
1,"Not bad. Really. Bought these for my wife, but might get an extra pair for myself. The sound is decent, and they stay in. So perfect for workouts. And they even have foam tips, which really block out ambient noise. Packed with the extras too."
1,I purchased these for my 17 year old son. He uses them when he is running. He is very happy with the sound quality.
1,"Good quality for the price!! Very much worth it!! Delivery was also VERY prompt, I was pleasantly surprised."
1,Product arrived a few days late but I really like them so far.
0,Pros:<br />* decent sound for the price<br />Cons:<br />* mic is too weak to use (consider as not working at all)<br />* falls from ears even after adjusting<br />* bulky
1,"Wow, great headphones! These are very comfortable to wear for long periods with no ear hot spots from the over ear support or the contact points anywhere else. Sound quality is very good for the price, well worth the bills. I haven't tested them for sweat durability yet, but summer is coming, and here in TX they will be tested.<br />We could go through the tech stuff but that is really only to impress friends and family you probably want to know the major points: how do they sound, how long does the battery last, how well do the functions work. I am pleased to report everything has performed as promised. You can spend a great deal of time researching for the best headphones, I had been looking for a while, it really came down to several factors for me, reviews and price. I am satisfied with my choice, I think you will be also, just move to the buy now button and just do it. Enjoy!"
1,These headphones are definitely worth the money. I'm promoting them to all of my friends.
1,Happy and satisfied with product. Can workout with no issues
1,"So far ear buds work well. Fairly comfortable for an hour or two. Fits in the ear well. Bass not boomy, which fits the way I like to hear music."
1,"I've only used them twice but I love them.  They are sturdy, sound is clear, with good bass.  Major upgrade from my previous headphones -- I fully intend to buy a second pair."
1,"Fast shipment, great product, husband sweats a LOT and he loves these headphones!  Sound is excellent, all for a great price!"
1,The best earbuds in general I've ever owned. Love them!
1,"What great headphones!  After trying many others, these have:  great sound quality; ease of use; excellent range; great fit; and all the right features.  The sound quality is roughly the same as the Apple Airbuds - but these don't fall out of your ears.  Far and away the best I've seen."
1,I liked that it would stay put in my ears. Very well designed product. Great sound.
1,"Surprisingly great little headphones!  The battery life is just okay, but the sound seems good to me and they are easy to set up and use.  I didn't want to spend a bunch of money on the more expensive brands, so I tried these, and I don't regret it.  They aren't great to use during a phone call though...I tried them a few times and was told I was very hard to hear.  But for listening to music at the gym and while I travel, these are all I need."
1,Very easy to use.  Excellent sound quality.
0,Couldn't make them pair. Customer service was no help.
1,"My friend recommended a much more expensive set of ear buds. I thought I'd give these a chance since there were so many great reviews.<br />Great Bluetooth earbuds! Sound is crisp, clear, just fantastic! Prompt service, easy instructions, nice carrying case. I'm extremely satisfied!"
1,I have used them a couple of time now and I love them. I am still curious to see how they handle water and sweat. They are great though.
1,Great sound and good value!
1,Awesome for the gym!
1,"This is a well packaged product, which is a marketing strategy most company do not apply to a product this inexpensive.<br /><br />My intial use would place the product and sound quality around the $80-$100 range.<br /><br />This is an extremely good headset for under $30."
1,Excellent. I used that for about 5 hours while I was working around they yard on Saturday. The were perfect!
1,It worked great for two months then the left side stopped working
1,"Awesome soundand quality, but they do not sit well over my glasses"
1,"Great product for a good price. The extras (earbuds, car charger, case) are nice!"
0,Headphones did not work due to a faulty multi-switch. I am returning them.
1,Only have had the product a short while but I'm very impressed.  Headphones are very comfortable and I like the flexible ear wrap (or whatever its called)  Should quality is excellent
1,these head phones are fantastic. They stay in at the gym no matter what you are doing and they sound great best gym head phones I have bought and I have bought many.
1,Works great for the price but I've gotten a few complaints of annoying background noises from callers.
1,Sound quality very good. Lots of options for comfortable fit. Lightweight.  Pairing was simple. Extra cords was a bonus equivalent to $5-$10.
1,"OK, bought them 3x.!!!<br />Excelent.!!!"
1,"I called support. They were prompt and efficient. I was impressed that I could even reach a live person for support for such a small item.<br /><br />I purchased these for my wife. She is delighted. She said she has never had ear buds as comfortable as these. Hardly realizes she has them on. Seems to be a great purchase.<br /><br />She's bragging on them so much, I may have to get a pair for myself!"
1,"Amazing noise cancelling effect, great sound quality as well. I only gave 4 stars though because the ear attachments that curve to your ear must be meant for really large ears. They really have no effect on helping the buds stay in place."
1,Im ok with them
1,"I have a hard time finding proper earbuds for long distance running that don’t slip once the sweat starts flowing. These stayed in place, I didn’t have to fuss with them, and the sound quality was nice.<br />This was a good purchase."
1,"Purchased for a friend, so far he's enjoying them and hasn't had any complaints about them. They look sturdy and have been functioning well according to him, so I'd say these are great."
1,I'm very happy with these headphones/ earbuds. I babe used them to work out and for travelling and talking on the phone.  Music sounds very good and they're very comfortable. The price was hard to pass up but quality essay sacrificed. Highly recommended
1,"Well engineered product.  Good sound fidelity, unlike other bluetooth headphones that I've tried.  The battery life is good too.  Fits well over the ear.  Has an easy to use interface.  Dependable so far."
1,Comfortable and sound great.My Dre beats hurt the top of my earlobe and won’t hold a charge anymore.
1,Great price for great workout headphones
1,"Very comfortable, decent sounds, well written instructions. Used them for several workouts at the gym. A+"
1,I use these headphones around the house and backyard while doing hobbies and activities. I also use these while at the gym.
1,"Amazing value!  I'd wanted to try wireless headphones, but most are quite expensive.  These are not, yet sound great and are sturdy and reasonably comfortable.  Granted, they're new, but with a one year warranty one can't go wrong."
1,"Love these! Sound great, and the fit is perfect!"
0,Unfortunately these headphones stopped working after 6 months. There was static building up between my iPhone and the headphones and now the headsphones cut off connection from my iPhone. The bass and sound are good but to stop working after 6 months is not very ideal.
1,"These went through a washer cycle with detergent, and a hot dryer cycle... and they still work.<br /><br />Enough said."
0,"These are quality ear buds .  The sound isis excellent and the fit is perfect with three sizes to choose from. They stay put no matter what you are doing, which is a huge improvement over my last experience. At the price, I didn't expect a lot, so I was thrilled to receive something of this caliber.<br /><br />Editing this review because the left earbud stopped working after 5 months. I use these only around the house for podcast listening or to hear instructional YouTube videos, so I have not put them much wear and tear. Disappointed."
1,I love these earphones so far..the audio is clear and the controls is very responsive.
1,Nothing
1,The sound is very good.  Range is good also.  Going to buy one for my wife to use also.
1,Love these headphones when working out. The sound is amazing. They keep a charge. And they stay put during a workout.
1,"Great sound. Excellent noise cancellation. Great packaging and the added cellphone car mount was icing on cake. Oh, the cost was well worth it."
1,I like this. The box and chargers were a nice. Nice product! I would have given 4 stars but for some reason they won't stay on my ear at home. So I know I can't job with them. Other than that I like them.
1,"Great product, thanks"
1,"Comfortable fit, Great Sound. Comparable to similar headphones that are a lot more expensive, these are perfect for what I need."
0,"Cheap.  Tried these for my outdoor runs.  The wind sound (even light breezes) was too much.  I tried all of the different ear pieces and none of them fixed the issue.  The sound also frequently cut out just by me turning my head to the right.  These may be ok if you're just sitting indoors, but for anyone using these while being active, don't waste your time/money."
1,"Battery lasts long enough for a whole work day at minimum, easy to pair, and easy to use buttons on earpiece."
1,Great headphones and the customer service is great!
1,"If you're expecting beats don't even consider these. You're getting what you pay for. They feel light and cheap, the ear buds are soft and flexible allowing them to slip off more consistently, and the sound quality sounds like an 8track compared to beats. Unsure how they'll handle several sweaty workouts. Range of Bluetooth is also less than my previous pair of beats wireless2."
1,"I have bought two sets of these earphones. One as a backup. The overall sound is good but, you must have a tight fit to get  decent sound quality. Especially for the bass. One good thing is that they include a set of foam tips to get a tight fit. I like the hooks which help to keep the earphones in place."
1,So far great headphones. I got them for running and training and the first run went great !
1,"I've been through several sweat proof wireless headphones and this is the first pair that has made it for any length of time. **I have now had them several months of frequent use.** I think in part it is because of the placement of the charging port, which is on the underside of the ear bud and mostly stays away from sweat and water.  Sounds pretty good and the controls are easy enough to use.  It holds a charge pretty well too."
1,I've ordered 4 other wireless ear buds on Amazon and these are by far the best. I listen to them for at least 8 hours a day without any issues.
1,"I love these headphones!  I had been running with headphones connected to my phone and was constantly pulling the wire up so it wouldn't put pressure on my ears...or having the wires flap in my face.  I love the freedom I have with these headphones.  They stay in my ears well, give me good sound quality and are comfortable.  I would recommend them and would buy them again.<br /><br />Update:  I liked mine so much that I bought a pair for my husband!"
1,"This is my second pair of SENSO Bluetooth headphones. I liked the first pair so much, I wanted another set as backup, and for my daughter to use when she visits, and doesn't have her own set. They are easy to use, easy to charge and reconnect to my phone, comfortable and great sound. I like that they audibly tell me when they are connected and disconnected.<br />I'm very pleased with my purchase, and would buy again. This company cares about their customer service and interaction."
1,"Love them! But I got an amazing deal, &#60; $10"
1,I love almost everything about these headphones. The only thing that isn’t working for me is the hooks that go over my ears. They do not stay on very well as they are too tall. Maybe this can be fixed? I’m not aware of what I can do to help that.
1,This is an amazing wireless headphones. Music plays perfectly and phone calls work incredibly well too. It's fantastic not having to hold onto my phone anymore. It's also really light weight and comfortable. It's really easy to use and the bluetooth connects immediately. Great purchase!
1,"Excellent customer service. My headphones broke after less than a year of use. SENSO provides a 1 year warranty, so I emailed SENSO customer service and they sent me a new pair of headphones for free. The whole process took just a few days. The headphones themselves are good, they sit really well and do not fell off during workout."
0,Purchased 3 pairs of these headphones. Used them a handful of times and no one pair will charge now. Waste of money.. Do not buy. I thought 1 may be bad but all 3?? So irritated.
1,Muy buenos
1,"Great sound, loudest headphones I've ever had and they sound great. Haven't used them at the gym yet but they feel good. Much less expensive than the Jabra's I currently have and the sound is just as good."
1,I use these headphones for my morning walks connected to my android phone.  The music sound is great for me.  It helps pass the time while walking.  I like how they fit on my ears.
1,I love them! The sound and quality is great for such an inexpensive pa it r of headphones! Thank you very much!
1,"These are great!  They are light weight, easy to pair, comfortable material, stay in my ears, and do not rub on my neck in an irritating way like the last pair I purchased(different company but also from Amazon). I love these."
1,THEY WORK GREAT.
1,I had one before and lost it. I ordered this one but it does not function like the other one. It's the same unit and the right ear bud has very low volume. It announces the number that's calling but at a very slow pace making me feel like the call would have stopped by the time I hear the number. My other unit was immediate. I don't know if this is a defect or not but I have had my other one to compare this one to. I would appreciate any feed back and solution to correct the issues that I have.
0,"Worked great for the first few months, then started getting audio skipping after that when paired with iPhone 6s. Sometimes turning on and off helps, but other times does not."
1,"Great sound, plus all the cables and the case. One of the best deals on Amazon. I am extremely pleased with this purchase I use in the gym every day and for my runs."
0,"Headphones will not synch with several different types of iPhones. Extremely frustrating as this was the main issue. After reviewing with customer support and going back to factory settings, they simply just wouldn’t synch. Phone(s) on my end we’re all up to date. Asked customer service for replacement pair, they refused. Don’t back their product up so I lost $20. Live and learn with cheap pair. Moving on to another company that supports their product."
1,"A helluva set of headphones!  Love them!  Sound was awesome, easy pairing, and gave me a ton of extra accessories.  The sounds quality is clear and the comfort level is awesome.  If Senso comes up with a pair of that you are able to take into a pool and functions with Bluetooth later I would pick em up too."
1,"For running, these are working great for me. They don't come loose, and sound clarity is more than enough for that context.<br /><br />The problem has to do with it's bluetooth capability. When I strap my phone to my left arm during a run (easy to do with my right hand, and it makes the arm band's key pocket easy to access), sound cuts in and out frequently during a run. The receiver is in the right ear bud, which means the signal might be struggling to pass through my head or something. I don't know. I'm not a physicist.<br /><br />What I do know is that moving my phone to my right arm, right below the receiving ear bud, solves the problem. Ear buds work just fine, then. The problem, then, becomes that feeling weird and accessing the key pocket (now on the back of my shoulder) becoming an awkward ordeal."
1,"I love these! They fit snugly in my ears without any pain, and don't fall out! The sound is great, and do an amazing job of canceling out a lot of noise. I totally recommend these!!"
1,"Great product for a very active person, which I am.  Whether it's communicating in a business call while on a 5-mile run or simply listening to tunes while in flight, I'd recommend this product, especially its affordability."
1,Very good sound
1,I love the sound of them .  The only thing that I found wrong with them is that I can not adjust the way they fit on my ear.
1,"Comfortable, and sound is great. The battery life doesn't last long. I have small ears andnthey do bother me after a while.."
1,"This is my third pair of these so I obviously like them.  The design has changed a little, and this pair seems to be a little too heavy on the bass.  I am critical of audio quality having spent thousands of dollars on my home audio speakers.  It seems to me this can be remedied by switching the foam earpiece around.  Other than that I've always liked these.  They get pretty loud, but not so loud they will damage your hearing (I hope).  I like how they fit, and I actually really like that it has a wire connecting the two headphones.  I don't like ""truly wireless"" headphones because I want to be able to hang them around my neck.  Sound quality is probably 3-4 which is important to me, but at this price, VERY easy set of volume and ""skip track"" controls, really good and simple connection to my Android phone, and great water resistance (I sweat like a pig at the gym and have ruined other pairs), these are a real value purchase."
1,"I bought it for my wife, she loves the bass and presence of the sound quality."
1,When I bought this senso Bluetooth after using couple of weeks i referred to 2 of my friends and i got 2 more for my friends.... Its Great
1,"Its really good. Used it on my morning runs, d only slight snag is getting it comfortably around ur ears but sound quality n blue tooth connection is on point. Comparing it to MPOW i wasted a whole $45 or so on, dis is good stuff"
1,"After letting this puppy, and my new sandisk, charge up I just read the instructions and synced it up.  Jamming to the AC/DC as I put this together.  No complaints.  Will have to take it on a hike to get a real feel for it.  The buttons almost seem to hiding, but they are right there in plain sight.  Just new and different than past corded headsets.  Enjoy."
1,Comfortable and great sound quality. Also stays in place while on treadmill
1,"Feb 11, 2018: I bought these in Jan 2017.  I just loved them as can be seen in my original review. I have to revise that though. They stopped working in October 2017 after less than 10 months. I am very disappointed.<br /><br />These headphones work perfectly. I absolutely love them. I use them on an ipod. They paired easily and always connect flawlessly.  They are very comfortable to wear and easy to use. The battery lasts all day. I am thrilled with them."
1,Very happy with the headphones. Easy to set up and easy to use. Good sound quality and exactly what I want when using the treadmill and weight machines!!
1,My son loves them. Using every day! Great value.
1,"I'm not a techie, but more a commuter who needed headphones on the train.  I didn't want to spend too much, but I didn't want to have super crap headphones.  I always had issues with bluetooth headphones and was one of those diehard fan of wired headphones because I hate when someone can't hear you on the phone, or the battery dies and you have nothing to listen to for the rest of your 1 hr train commute.  I love the case, and that they include a charging cord and all the sizes of earpieces so when your ear canal starts aching, you can switch it out to a smaller size, and its all right there in your case!  The battery life has been great so far - I commute up to 4 hrs a day roundtrip on the train.  The one thing is the phone call quality may not be optimal, but who really makes that many phone calls these days?  All in all, great for the price!"
1,Great product. Fit great and stay in place bike riding. Going to buy again for gym bag.
1,great sound easy set-up...these are very good bluetooth headphones for the price.
1,YOU CAN'T BEAT THE PRICE. GREAT SOUND! GREAT QUALITY!
1,"Bought these for work, as a construction worker. I’ve tried a few types so far, and these seem to work the best.  The battery only lasts about 7 hours though for continuous playing of music. I’ve had other pairs last an entire work day, but these are comfortable and have good sound. So I just turn them off at lunch to give me a little extra time."
1,"One of the best purchase I have made for headphones. Pros: lightweight, fits great, sounds great, with great price. Cons: I can't find any. Very Good product. Buy one today!"
1,Had problem with my first set not charging after owning them for about 7 months. Contacted customer support who had a new pair on the way the first day I spoke with them. Really like these headphones and the customer support is great!
1,I just got the headphones and they work really well. I am very satisfied with the sound quality.
0,"Terrible fit, annoyed the entire run until I decided to take off. Will not recommend..."
1,Great product. Bought 2 of them. Thanks
1,Headphones work great. I like the way they fit and the sound is perfect. Great option and quality for the price.
0,"Cheap, bulky, can't adjust to my ears, I thought it will be a great product viewing the rating..."
1,I love these headphones! I tried a few other brands that wouldn't stay in my ear but these don't budge. The sound quality is also a lot better in these then some other headphones that i tried. You won't be disappointed with them!!!!
1,i have another brand that are not as good..only last about 2hrs..these are much better last 8hrs and are louder and much better overall..my friend who has beats couldnt believe how good they were ..comparable to beats!
1,Dont have long range but good sound quality
1,"Purchased these for a friend as he recently lost (2) pairs of wireless headphones. Upon pairing them the first time he immediately told me, &#34;Wow! These are great!&#34; sighting the clarity and volume was much better as opposed to his previous pairs. I might just purchase a pair for myself!"
1,Great headphones
1,"The sound quality of the headphones is good (I'd say 4 stars) and I find them easy to use, but I have given the headphones a lower rating for the following reasons:<br />- The pieces that go over your ears are floppy and can't be adjusted to fit to your ears, and in my case, they sit above my ear so they don't provide any benefit.  In fact, they  bumped against my glasses and caused the headphones to come out of my ears. I ended up cutting off the over ear pieces.<br />- There is a warning that comes on when the headphones need to be charged.  That's a great idea, but it gives you very little warning (maybe 5 more minutes of use), which in my opinion makes the warning kind of useless. It would have been better if a warning was provided when there is at least 30 minutes to an hour more of use."
0,"Stopped working. Refused to replace as they were out of the 1 year warranty by a few days. They were nice when they worked, but should last more than 1 year. Only wore them M-F in office so I don’t think they’re very durable."
1,"Easy to use. Stay put during workouts, great at noise cancelling."
1,"You can't beat these headphones for the price! I bought them to use when working out, and needed something that would pair with my Google XL 2 (no headphone jack on the phone). These worked out of the box, with no troubles. They pair easily with the workout machines so I can watch Netflix on them, listen to music, etc.<br /><br />They're comfortable (and I don't really like the &#34;ear bud&#34; style of headphones), and are very light weight. The ear clips fit comfortably. Comes with a neat carrying case with enough storage for the charging cord and extra ear inserts.<br /><br />I'd definitely buy these again!"
0,Broke after a month. Uncomfortable.
1,"The fit is really good and pairing with a phone or tablet is very easy. The sound is decent enough, not to ""tinny"" nor to ""bassy"". Customer service is great, so if you have any questions or concerns just reach out to them, they are quick to respond! Not really noise canceling (at least not on the level of my other headphones!) but once you adjust the fit most ambient sounds are muffled. Again, for the cost, these are a decent set of headphones."
1,So good so far
0,These were great...until the suddenly stopped working midway through a workout and wouldn't turn back on an all. I even had this fully charged for a full day before this happened so I dont really plan on rebuying these
1,"They were easy to setup out of the box. They fit well, good quality audio. No problems with it."
0,"I decided on this score because I got the headphones and they didn't work but whoever I bought it from only gave me the option to return, all I wanted was a replacement."
1,I am pleased with this product. They are equivalent comparable to other brands for a fraction of the cost.
1,"Had them for a few months now. Sound is great for headphones at this price. I’m very OC about headphones and quality. For what you get these are a great choice without spending a lot. Recently found the volume down button isn’t working. Otherwise a good product.<br /><br />Update:  Was sent a replacement. They worked fine but both recently died. After just under two years. The faulty element in the design remains. The rubber port cover for charging doesn’t seal properly and isn’t durable.<br /><br />Considering they lasted this long, not bad for the price. The sound was always fantastic if you’re into bass during workouts."
1,They are working great! I bought a pair for my husband and daughter too.
1,I love my new ears buds.  To me the sound is fantastic and noise cancelation work.
1,"I did lots of comparisons before I purchased, I""m glad I did, excellent value !"
1,These headphones stay put in ears while running. I sweat a lot and they don't move or make additional noise.
1,"Perfect customer service, even got an email telling me how to work them and if I had questions. Loved the product as well... workouts just improved emencely."
0,Great headphones.<br /><br />UPDATE: After a couple months the left ear went out and I no longer get audio. This is after normal use.
1,Just received but they work great.  My first Bluetooth headphones.  Reasonable price assuming they last.
1,"Amazing headphones for an unbeatable price. My husband and I each own a pair. We have to charge them about once every two weeks and use them for about 2hours 5x a week, so the battery life is fantastic as well! Definitely recommend!"
1,"Father's Day Gift for my husband. He travels a lot and we have a two-year-old so he needs the &#34;noise-canceling&#34; headphones, but the traditional ones are so bulky, I think these will work better. He said the quality is great and all the accessories are a nice bonus. Thanks!"
1,Great performance - I purchased to primarily wear while on my treadmill. Watching tv and listening to music makes the time of the workout pass faster.
1,These aren't bad for the money... Great but
1,👏🏻
1,these headphones are great the battery life is good and the quality is great for the price. Had these for over 8 months and still hold strong
1,My grandson was thrilled with the headphones!<br />I appreciate the high quality product that you all provide<br />and I also appreciate the fact that you all care about<br />what your customers think!<br />We'll be back!<br />Much success with your company!
0,"These worked well the first time I used them. The second time, they would cut out every few seconds and I would lose the music entirely or hear static over it. I would remind you - you get what you pay for. I'm pretty surprised these have such good reviews. I wasted money for sure."
0,"Updated review: I purchased these to run outside freely and had been using them indoors and they were working great indoors. I finally had the opportunity to test them outside during a run, they were awful they kept cutting in and out and I couldn't listen to anything! The phone was on my arm in a sleeve right near the headphones so distance wasn't the issue. I was very frustrated by them I ran back and got my tangle me up headphones to finish my run! I'm very disappointed.<br /><br />Previous review: I purchased these to run and workout freely while listening to music. So far so good with the headphones. If anything changes I'll be sure to update my review. They fit my ears fine and stay in place with all the sweat and movement. And the sound quality is great, it masks most sounds well."
1,"Bought these for my wife, she loves them.  Good quality and sound."
0,"Work fine in the beginning but problem started right after couple of weeks using.<br />The left earbud started have connecting issue, now is almost completely dead.<br />Wiggling the wire some times will get it back but won't last.<br />Not recommended."
0,"Will periodically cut out, even when fully charged and close to phone. (Edit - this might actually be my phone's fault)<br />Button placement is not ideal. When I try to push the right earpiece back into my ear (when it starts slipping out), it's very difficult to not press the multifunction button. Also they are uncomfortable."
1,Product as described and they are excellent. I appreciate the follow-up from SENSO insuring my satisfaction. Thanks.
0,"Do I enjoy suddenly hearing a unrelated voice out of know where at full volume scaring the sh!t out of you?<br />No<br />Do I like picking up your headphones and finding I can't comfortable put them in my ears because for the millionth time the rubber part fell out?<br />No. (Although they do throw in extras, its still very annoying and the extras aren't always conveniently near by.)<br />Otherwise its a solid product.<br /> I hope have a firmware update to fix the jump scare robot voice to say ""battery low"" at the volume the user is currently using. If they did I would increase the rating."
1,"Good quality sound, comfortable fit that doesn't fall out of my ears, and great battery life. They're not gonna be as high a quality as Bose or whatever top-end over-the-ear headphones some people &#34;require&#34;, but for this price point, the quality is perfectly fine and a great value."
1,"Amazing bass! Love the battery life too, never had it run out and I only charge them after about 5 or 6 1 hour sessions."
1,Great
1,"These do work well, but they take longer to connect than the last ones I had. Although it says its connected, they still don't play the music. I have to turn them off and back on again and eventually I get them to connect. Once connected they seem to work well. Also, the power button is not in a great place. Anytime I try to push the headphones into my ear, I end up turning them off. Other than that they are good headphones."
1,good. Thanks.
1,"I got them today, enjoyed them for a few hours and then plugged in the USB into my Mac to charge the headphones. Next thing you know, Mac dies instantaneously and I can't turn it on at all.<br />Edit- based on seller's concern shown below, I have modified star rating to 2.<br /><br />Edit- seller has been very nice and is sending me a replacement and hence I am changing the review since the headphones have high sound quality but the usb was bad. I will update the review according to the replacement"
1,These things are great for the price! The customer service is amazing too! Very easy to deal with and overall a great product!
1,Most excellent
1,"I've had this headphone for a few weeks.  My previous two wireless headphones were either too bulky or broke way too easily.  This one seems designed for comfort, though it is an eye sore at first.  If you're looking for a cheap wireless headphone that is comfortable and easy to use, look no further!"
1,"Being someone who is physically active more often than not and who enjoys listening to music without having to use bulky headphones on a consistent bases, I've been in need of headphones that could withstand a bit of a beating, were easy to carry around, that I didn't require me to sell my left kidney and first born just to get them.<br /><br />Also, a pretty annoying fact about myself is that my ears are a bit different from each other and though they are perfectly usable and nice ears, the difference makes things extremely difficult for me. When I try to use standard earbud headphones, they don't STAY in my ear. When I move my head, they pop out. If I wear them for over 30 minutes, my ears hurt. If I use any with wires - AT ALL - they get tangled (not. fun.).<br /><br />All in all, I was in need of a pair of unicorn-rare headphones that were adjustable enough for my mutant ears that were easy to use & maintain, were pain-free, and that closely if not entirely met my demanding and high standards.<br /><br />In my humble opinion, these headphones are the best. THE best. I'm not saying that because I can. I'm being honest. I though 'for $30+ how good can they be? quality costs more. they must be pretty standard'. These headphones prove that sentiment wrong. Of the hundreds of headphones I've bought over the course of my entire 20+ years of existence... nothing has come close to the quality or the manageability of these things. PLUS, it comes with a bunch of useful accessories! Nothing you need to make them work or slightly better is sold separately!<br /><br />I highly HIGHLY recommend these brilliant headphones. They make me a happy camper and I'm sure they'll make you one too.<br /><br />I mean it. If you want GREAT active headphones that won't make you throw them across the room in aggrivation or a pair that you can customize to fit your mutant ears, maybe you want a pair that sound better than other cheap pairs; if you require headphones that won't break the bank and don't take long to charge. Well, THESE ARE THE HEADPHONES FOR YOU, MY FRIEND."
1,I use ActiveBuds every time I go for a walk. It fits my ear very well and it is very easy to control the buttons. Highly recommend this product!
1,"This is my second pair of these. Had to buy a new pair after misplacing my first set. The noise cancellation is better in this newer set than my last. Sounds and battery life are still great.<br /><br />I'm not a leave a review person normally unless there is an issue. However, if you want great wireless head set I'm extremely happy with these. So much so, I even shared the product on my social media post. You can't go wrong for the price. I have had other way more expensive pairs and these are hands down the best reliable bang for your buck."
1,"Great headphones,really met and exceed my expectations"
1,"they are really good for walking, running and working out.  i wanted them for on the motorcycle, and they are very noisy"
1,Really nice product and awesome customer service !
1,I love the light weight and the way they fit great product you can workout with no problem and they ddo not shock when wet
1,Lasts a while on a single charge and good for those who exercise often.
1,"Great headphones for gym. Comfortable, don't interfere w/eyeglass temples. Great sound, can't hear outside gym noise. Very happy w/these."
0,"Bought these hoping for the best but sure enough, not 2 months after I purchased these they died out of the blue. I actually gave them another shot and ordered another pair, guess what... dead again after 2 months... coincidence? Stay away from these!"
1,Great headphones for a great price. Highly recommended.
1,"Bought these for my grandson and they met with his approval, meaning another great SENSO product."
1,"Best wireless headphones. Works with Samsung phones, which is why I had to purchase these. Microphone is amazing... you can barely tell you are speaking from bluetooth. I wish the cord was slightly shorter because i do not like the wire management option, but that is a minor detail. Overall great quality for the price."
1,"Very easy to figure out and use the first time, very comfortable.  I have some issues with connection to listen to music (media), but I think it's more my phone than the headphones.  Good product, worth the price."
1,good product for the price
1,"I purchased the item on Aug 2017. I am not so frequent user so, was expecting it to be last longer. The power on/off button is not working. Basically, it is dead now."
1,Works great with my Iphone X in my home gym.
1,great product
1,"Quite frankly, these are the best earbuds I have purchased, even surpassing the $100+ earbuds from Jaybird, Monster, etc.  The Jaybirds / Monster buds didn't have the fit, nor the sound these do, and even though they were replaced under warranty, both of them malfunctioned prior to the warranty period.  The bass is excellent, fit is excellent, battery life is excellent, and it is a simple design.  The only thing lacking is maybe the highs could be a bit more crisp.  For $30, I am not complaining!"
0,"I bought these a couple months ago and have worn them at work a lot.  Here is what I have noticed:<br /><br />Pros:<br />Solid build quality, I guess.  It comes with a nice box and nice cord that I can use for other stuff.  The actual hardware is housed in the headphones themselves, so you don't need that weird neck thing that I see some people with all the time.  The button works.  The functionality and pairing is solid and instantaneous.<br /><br />And that's where the pros end for me, unfortunately.<br /><br />Cons:<br />They're uncomfortable.  Because I find in-ear earbuds uncomfortable inside my ear, I'll mention everything but that because it's just personal preference for me.  The plastic things that go around your ears are uncomfortable if the things are in your ears.  They honestly don't even need to be there because once it's in your ear, it's not gonna come out that easily.  They just serve to hit me in the cartilage and irritate the crap out of me.<br /><br />I have never used Bluetooth headphones before so this might be the way it is for all of them, but the connection can get spotty and drop sometimes.  I keep my phone in my pocket and it will stop and start music sometimes.  That could be a variety of problems, but since it has happened to me on a full battery, I'm inclined to believe it's a connection problem.<br /><br />The button.  Pressing a button into your ear is super uncomfortable.  That, plus volume controls, is all you get from these headphones in terms of playback controls.  You can't skip tracks by double-pressing.<br /><br />The volume controls work, yes, but their starting volume level is actually pretty high and it won't let you go any lower without muting.  This is poor engineering - obviously, whatever digital potentiometer in there that is supposed to be regulating volume levels started way too high and goes WAY too loud.  These headphones are either for people with hearing problems or people who want to have hearing problems by setting their volume too high.<br /><br />Now, something some of you might be shocked about: the audio quality.  For a $30 pair of headphones, the audio quality is... pretty bad.  What you're paying for (albeit a cheap amount of money) is the build quality.  For $30, you can get a solid, good-sounding pair of earbuds, in-ear or otherwise.  These are not one of those solid pairs.  The frequency response is terrible - everything has an excessive low/low-mid end with barely any definition in high end or mid-high frequencies.  It sounds muddy and bad, and I'm guessing it's just bad hardware.  Anyone praising the audio quality of these headphones is dead wrong; I listened to a broad range of music, including music I really like, and couldn't find anything that sounded good with these.<br /><br />Do your own research, don't let Amazon do it for you.  Get better earbuds than these.  And if they're not as cheap, either bite the bullet or reassess what you really want from wireless &quot;sports&quot; earbuds."
1,"Headphones are pretty good for the price. I had an issue so contacted the seller and they were prompt and gave good service. Very satisfied.<br /><br />The headphones needs a bit more tuning. The bass is a strong and the connection isn't always perfect. However, good sound for the price and I had no issues with it falling off during my runs."
1,"great headphones, they sound great and feel great. The battery life is fantastic and they're really simple and easy to use. My only issue is the wire connecting the two headphones is a little long so it bounces excessively when used for running, but regardless of that this product is amazing and I would recommend them to anyone"
1,Bass heavy and a little muddy but overall I think they are pretty good. I've showered With them and the microphone is clear for the other party
1,"Good sound quality but they don't fit well with glasses. Also, a dual USB car charger and 3ft cable were supposed to be included but were not."
1,Great headphones!
1,The sound quality is great. They are very comfortable. I am very pleased. I can also walk pretty far away from my phone and still get reception. Easy to use.
1,"If you want a descent sounding headset for working out or hanging out. Can't go wrong for the price. Audiophiles should not get this. There's better out there. But I owned a set of Dre,s wireless when they came out. Still have the wired ones. They don't compete but pretty dam close and 80 percent cheaper. Can't go wrong."
0,These are crap.  If I put my phone in my pocket they wont work.  Tried to talk to the seller and got no help.
1,Ok
1,"Sounds great, great fit!"
1,These lasted 7 months (a record for me for running buds) and when they pooped out the company mailed me a new set with minimal hassle
1,"I've had my senso earbuds for about a week now and I really like them.  They are very comfortable and don't make my ear sore when listening to music all day.  The sound is great, doesn't totally cut out background noise but I can still hear my music without turning up the volume.  Still deciding if I like the flexible ear piece that goes around your ear.  It's nice because you can adjust it to fit your ear but you always have to adjust it each time you put them on which can be annoying but the material is soft and comfortable.  The only con I can think of is it needs a clip because if you only wear one earbud while doing something the other earbud drags down the other side also the clip will secure it to your clothing when they are not in use and are just hanging around your neck but you can buy clips for extra.  I've gone through a lot of earbuds and overall I am very, very happy with these earbuds hopefully they are durable and will last a long time."
1,Love my new headphones.
1,"Since I've only use them twice I'm giving them only 4 stars. However,  I'm hoping they'll be a 5 star. Ok both hubby and I 've been using wired ear buds for awhile. What a pain and inferior sound quality to boot. We looked at all different makes and models in various price range. Why I chose SENSO was due to the reviews and Amazon incredible pricing. They're comfortable, easy and actually fit my tiny earphones. Ive not heard music so clearly before with other ear buds. So, inconclusion, very happy with purchase may order pair for hubby soon. Thank you."
0,"After several times of using this in the pool, briefly submerged , the volume controls stopped working then one side is louder than the other."
0,"They work well when they work. I've had mine for about 4 months and they already won't turn on. No water damage. I have plugged them into a charger, and the LED appears to work. When the LED indicates that the headphones are fully charged, I am unable to turn them on."
1,"For the price these are good head phones.  Easy to connect, stayed on the ears well and crisp sound. However, the bass is pretty non-existent. I am going to try a different brand as that is something I want."
0,Just a clarification. These ARE waterproof BUT THEY DO NOT PLAY UNDERWATER when using bluetooth. They will stop and then when you comeback to the top they will play again. Otherwise these are nice. Stay in your ears and have pretty good sound quality. But since I was getting them for swimming these are not what I wanted. Tried a bunch of different set ups and yes I am always within 5 feet of the iphone I am using with bluetooth. Have a tether pool and this doesn't have any sound when the just dip below the surface. Maybe bluetooth doesn't work that way I don't know but not what I wanted.
1,"Easy to pair, easy to use, especially it’s a good product for go to gym work out 💪 ."
1,"GREAT Wireless Earphones. Got them on Saturday, they synced to my iPhone within seconds, put on my Apple Watch listened to music while doing yard work. Good sound long lasting charge and a very good price. Love these earphones"
0,Were great while they worked.  Died after 2 months.  They don't seem to hold a charge any longer.  Don't recommend.
0,"These are my 4th of headphones in the past year and I can't say they are any better then the others. The range is terrible, my phone can be less then 5 feet away and the music starts to skip. They don't stay in my ears very well either. I've tried the various sizes they send u and I still have to keep pushing them in my ear every few minutes. The battery life is decent and the music quality that streams through is good."
1,"Amazing product. The ear hooks are like jello. They feel so comfortable, but don't do what I did. I  hung them in my car over the mirror in direct sun light on a hot summer day. What was jello hardens, still soft but not as soft. I bought me another pair and now I keep them in their neat container that they come in and put them in the glove box."
0,"dissaponted!<br />they stopped working after few weeks. not worth it:,😐"
0,"They dont fit around ears very well, and i consider mine to be average. And not very much treble. Sounds muffled"
1,Love these headphones.  Great for the gym or any sort of physical activity.  Can't beat the price.
1,"These guys know how to do customer service. Great product, great warranty, and they make you feel like you spent your money well and are supported if any problems arise."
1,great
1,"This is such a wonderful product. In every facet of performance it has been excellent. Customer Service people are top notch as well. Had some problems with the battery I believe. After 5 months of pretty constant use the battery Just gave up the ghost. Wrote a note to customer service and they got back with me promptly.... less than an hour! They were very helpful in giving me some instructions to troubleshoot the problem. When that didn't get the desired result, they notified me that they're sending me a new one...which is another thing to remember: this awesome item I believe has a 30 day no questions asked return policy and a ONE YEAR MANUFACTURERS WARRANTY!! I am a witness to this companies backing of its product! Their Customer Service were awesome and made it painless and pleasant! They've got me hooked. As long as they will make this product, I'll be buying it! Thank you Invotek! You're awesome!"
1,"So far, so good. Wear them at work and they last a full shift of nonstop podcast listening."
1,These work great. I run with them and take them into the steam room without any issues!
1,"And I didn't have to spend ""Beats"" money for it! Great sound quality, fantastic battery life, and these are the first headphones to manage to stay in my ears through an entire workout! very pleased with purchase. Would recommend."
1,"Not bad, but the active noise cancelling seems ineffectual.  Bear in mind that my previous noise-cancelling headphones were not buds but over-the-ear headphones and very comfortable."
0,The headphones would never enter pairing mode. Even tried resetting it....
1,They work great!!
1,Price is right with surprisingly great sound.  Planning to recommend to my friends.
1,"These are great and especially for the price. Can't beat it, so much better than my last pair. A must have for the gym!"
0,"It stopped working within three weeks. There was no exposure to water or anything else. I used them daily for this period of time, for one-hour stretches. I will never buy this product again. It's too late to return it."
0,"I've had these headphones for about a year and they worked great - paired with my phone without issues, stayed in during workouts, and had decent sound quality. They aren't necessarily sound proof, but they worked for working out.<br /><br />The reason I'm giving it one star is because I plugged these in after a workout, and woke up to the headphones melted onto the charger. The headphones (as you can see in the images) came apart at the site of the port. My outlet and charger itself are fine and luckily this didn't start a fire, but this is definitely a safety hazard.<br /><br />Overall, I was content with the product, but this is definitely concerning."
1,Tried 2 other leading brands and these has the best sound as well as the only ear buds that didn't fall out of my ear while working out
1,"I was skeptical because these are half the price of my last few sets of wired headphones.  Item arrived on time and was very easy to set up.  I was surprised, these sound incredibly good (Bluetooth or not).  Even the bass is strong and tight.  Easy to use, fit great and stay in place.  I should have made the switch to these a year ago.<br />Thanks for a great product at a fair price.<br /><br />Now I feel like a chump for spending all that money on &#34;high-end&#34; earbuds in the past."
1,"These are really good sounding headphones, and their customer service is top notch. Highly recommended!"
0,"Fits fine, but Bluetooth doesn't work properly."
1,"You can’t beat these headphones for the price. They sound great, are comfortable and very durable.  My first pair survived several years of working out 3-5 times a week, and sweating like crazy when I do. I bought a second pair because I like them so much."
1,Theses headphones were super easy to pair with my phone and the sound is great. Great value for the money!
1,"The headphones were very nice; however, I could not get them to sync with the Samsung Fit Gear 2.  I am not sure what the problem was but I sent them back for that reason."
1,"I HAD A PROBLEM UNDERSTANDING A COMPETITOR'S PRODUCT AND WAS NOT HAPPY WITH IT.  HOWEVER, WAS VERY HAPPILY SURPRISED WITH HOW EASY IT WAS TO USE AND UNDERSTAND YOUR INSTRUCTIONS.  PRODUCT WORKS GREAT."
1,"Used 2 times and so far its a great product.  Will update later, after more use"
1,"After reading many reviews from here, I was convinced and bought it. Quality of material is acceptable for the unit as well as it's accessories. The ear support is just ok as I was comparing it with my son's Beats. It holds pretty well as I tried to mimick jogging and while I did some chores around the house and garage while listening. It's also comfortable for my small ears. After 2+ songs, I experienced skipping with the bluetooth cutting in-and-out that felt like I was playing an old album with the needle jumping left and right. It got very annoying that I started packing it ready to ship it  back. Then, I read one of the reviews here with similar problems that SENSO TS responded to. The fix was to reset the unit by having the unit turned to Off and while plugged-in the charger holding the Red button for at least 7 seconds. After the reset, so far no more skipping. I played several songs from different genres to test sound quality. Again, not too bad compared to the Beats. Very comparable actually. So far, so good."
1,"My first impression when I heard music through the headphones was: Wow! These sound great! The sound is better than any headphone that I have ever used. (I have never used any really expensive headphones). They are also reasonably comfortable. I was also impressed by the range; they easily connect across the room (which is a mixed blessing, since they may connect to the wrong device). The battery life is also impressive. They work with my iPhone and my MacBook Pro (at the same time!), as well as my Android tablet. The negative: I don't notice any noise reduction, they barely fit in the provided container, there is sometimes a little buzzing when the volume is too high and I think they are ugly. For me, the positive greatly outweighs the negative. It feels great to be able to listen to music at my desk and not worry about the earphone pulling out of my ear when I lean away from my computer, and the great sound is a real bonus!"
1,"Very comfortable, easy to connect, And the price wasn't so bad either. Beats paying $129.99 for Beats that do the exact same thing. I would recommend.<br /><br />Update: they're still good but I just wished the battery would last a little longer. I would have to charge them every other day. I only use them for about 1.5 hours a day and probably have to charge them after 2-3 days."
1,"I've just used them a few times, but I really like them so far. I have odd sized ear canals and find fitting earbuds a challenge. These are adjustable and fit me very well."
1,Bought a pair for myself and one for my wife. Great for audio books and music alike. Highly recommended.
1,"I've tried several of these advertised headsets with Bluetooth. In th epast the devices worked well to begin with and then started falling apart. Not so with this manufactires headset. It works well and can be coupled with two different devices. I have mine linked to two different iPhones. You know, one for work and business and the other for personal use."
0,"I run with my phone in my shorts pocket, which is right at the small of my back/waist. Sometimes the connection is weakened and you get that bluetooth &quot;skip.&quot; Not sure if it's inherent to all bluetooth devices or not, but some of my other devices seem to do ok at that range. Maybe I'm just too metallic and interfere with the signal."
1,Pairing was seamless and the audio quality is amazing.
1,confortable and easy to install
1,"I use these on iphone, iPad, MacBook pro.  At first, I could not sync the Bluetooth to my iphone so I erased the device tried to sync again, it worked.  These headphones are comfortable for me to wear walking everywhere."
0,"So I got these things with the intention of replacing my old corded workout headphones because the cable got in the way for boxing and cruising around on my longboard. Right out of the box the presentation was amazing, they include a lot of little extras And that got me excited... Until I actually tried the things on. Now they're light, which is great for reducing fatigue, But the little ear hook things are so flimsy and limp they'd make an old man with ED look like hard steel. I tried them out with a few simple exercises but because they don't really grip your ear (nor do they adjust to it) they love to fall out and swing around. Which honestly is the most frustrating thing about them. I really don't understand what kind of exercise anyone can do with these where they will hang on at all... But they're the opposite of firm/gripping. I gotta hand it to them for making such an initial presentation for what little cost they came at, however that doesn't make up for their inability to adjust to a user's wear preference. If you decide to include a metal core in your ear hooks so that the user could mould them to their ear, they'd be the best damn cheap headphones on the market. Until then, you can take this thing back, and I'll keep searching for something better.<br /><br />However, if you're the type looking for a non workout (but looks like workout) headphones for on the cheap and you never turn your head quickly, then these might be great for you!"
1,"This is the 4th set of these headphones that I’ve bought, and until this one, I’ve been happy. This set has an on/off button that works only part time. Sometimes it turns on the first time, but sometimes it takes 10 or 15 tries, which is very annoying, and shouldn’t happen.  I’ve initiated a refund, and will order again to see if this is a one-time quality control issue, or if this is the case with all their headphones."
0,Horrible product. Had for 2 months and they quit working. Does not deserve 1 star.
1,I ordered these for my adult daughter.  She loves them for working out at the gym.
1,They are so awesome
1,Fast shipping. Great accessories.
1,"Pairing and controls are super easy and a breeze.  My only concern is that these earbuds have a MASSIVE bass bump to them.  If you’re a fan of bass these will work fine. But if you music has any bass guitar or heavy big kicks be warned since they will over exentuate the bass frequencies, almost to an inaudible state. If on iPhone simply put an EQ on your music “Treble Booster” to counter balance the overload of bass.  Other than that comfort is quite good and the case and accessories are a big plus.  Just don’t get these for their high quality clear sound, they’re good as a beater set of headphones."
1,comfortable in the ears and great sound quality.
1,These headphones sound great! I just received them so I can't speak to durability or how they perform during excercise which is primarily how I will use them. But the initial sound quality really surprised me. Well done Senso.
1,Great quality for the money.
1,"I received these headphones as a gift, my grandbaby bit one of the ear pieces and I brought another pair. You can not beat the price!"
1,"These are a little bulkier than I care for.  If you tire of having them in your ears, they will not stay on your neck, you need to have somewhere to put them.<br />Have had several complaints of people being able to hear themselves during a phone conversation.  To the point, I have to turn off the blue tooth function and use just the phone during phone conversations.  Inconvenient for both party's."
0,This is not acceptable!!! They died and I can’t get it to charge again. I’ve tried everything from using different USB ports to changin the wall I plugged it into. It won’t a charge at all. I want a refund because I know I did not spend this much money to use a pair of headphones once.
1,Works great..
1,"GREAT Headphones! Well worth the price!<br />Excellent sound quality for the money. If given a choice between Bose, Beats, or Senso..........Senso wins hands down!<br />I would buy these again in a heartbeat!"
1,These headphones are very comfortable. Have good sound and they are great for the gym and bicycling.
1,Overall I am glad with the purchase.  They seem a little big for my ears but get the job done.
1,"I love these earbuds. They quality is top notch, the sound is great! The price outstanding. They are extremely comfortable, they are the first earbuds I have ever thought comfortable."
0,stopped working after 2 months. used as directed and charged as directed. completely dead now. very disappointed as they were great when they worked
1,The problem with these is not that I can’t hear with them but those I’m talking to said it’s too much noise in the background
1,Comfortable and easy to use.  Did not last as long as I would like but I got spares.
0,"Was definitely worth paying a little more for these.  Smooth sound, and it rarely cuts out.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Crapped out.  Unreal.  Won't turn on, and yes they've been charged."
1,"I bought them for my boyfriend who uses his phone for everything and works from home.  He loves them!  We are already talking about a second pair for his back up when he travels for work, so he is never without it.  I wish I had tried these before purchasing the Samsung Icons earbuds.  $200 for 1.5 your use is not worth it.  When answering a call with the Senso earbuds, I felt like the person was right next to me, crystal clear reception. The control buttons click on the Senso which I like.  I'm constantly swiping on the Iconx because it's so sensitive.  My recommendation would be buy two pairs because you will love them that much!!!"
0,"Worked great until it broke after 2 months of usage, not worth the cheaper price."
1,easily compairs to the beats wireless headphones (if not better) but a fraction of the price. battery life is great as well!!
1,"I've been wanting some bluetooth earbuds for a while but I didn't want cheap ones that didn't work well but also didn't have money to pay for the expensive good ones. I saw these on here a couple days ago and thought I would give it a shot.<br /><br /> These earbuds are actually really good! They are noise cancelling which is nice.<br /><br />The packaging is really nice and it comes with a case, a card holder to stick to your phone, a car mount to stick in the vent, and more! They also come with these red foam ear pieces you attach to it and the sound quality gets even bettter!!! Very pleased with my purchase."
0,"Positives - packaging was first rate.  Build seems solid and sound is good.<br /><br />Negatives - I had contnuous Bluetooth connection isues.  I tried resetting tthe earbuds to factory settings.  Tried  multiple phones (Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X).  Re-Paired several times, but still got disconnections and dropouts with the phone in my shirt pocket or hand.  The Bluetooth connection was just very weak.  I have several other Bluetooth devices that connect fine to these same phones..  Maybe I just got a bad unit.  Disappointing."
1,"I use these earphones while I run each morning, and love them. They shape to my ears and have a range of ear pieces. They come with a hard case which I love for storing them. Definitely the best earphones I've ever worn."
1,Sound is excellent.
1,Easy to wear and easy to operate. Nice hard case and extra supplies come with it. Sound quality is good enough.  I bought two more for family members.
1,So far there are working well
1,"I’ve been using them for about a week, I like them very much, I was skeptical at first but there very light weight, and great to exercise with.  My wife was very envious of them she wanted a pair too.  She tried getting them on amazon with your codes you all were offering but no luck.  I asked her to text you guys for a good code but she hasn’t gone around nd in doing that.  If I do have any problems with them, I’ll let you all know, customer service is top notch, thank you."
1,"UPDATED REVIEW:<br />5-25-2017<br />So like I said these headphones are the best out there!!!<br />The Invotek sellers are super professional and they handled my issue with so much care.  I contacted them regarding the issue I had(read previous review)  and they immediately communicated back. They had kept communicating with me via email, walking me through a reset process of the headphones up until they sent me another pair.  I couldn't be any happier.  I honestly did not wana buy from another company because I have come to love these SENSO headphones that much!! I got my new replacement pair that they sent me and am listening to music right now as I write this review.  So if you are looking for Bluetooth headset, please stop looking and just go ahead and buy these ASAP!!!  You will that me later! 😊<br /><br />×*******************************************************************************************************************************●_●●_●●_●●_●●_●●_●●_●♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥<br /><br /> These headphones are awesome. They have amazing sound,  they stay put in your ears and you won't feel them. Super comfy. I have had them for since February 2017. The reason I have them a 3 star is because as of yesterday  May 1st they just stopped working. I didn't drop them in water, I took great care of them. Used them everyday because am a very active woman.  Am very disappointed that they only lasted 3 months!  So now looking for a replacement 🙁🙁"
1,Wireless and Bluetooth is making it a dream when I go running. however it has slipped off mid run but I may not have hooked it right.
1,"5 stars for the price/value ratio.<br />There may be better sounding buds with clearer microphones but this package at this price is unbeatable.<br />They fit, the case is nice and they work.<br />I got them for my Iphone since Apple is doing their best to make wired headsets obsolete.<br />These are a great option."
0,they have very little volume and when I use them to exercise they pop out of my ears. I think you can't ask for more for the price
0,"I really wanted to like these headphones.  I was impressed by the price point and the accessories that were included.  When they work the sound is good and the headset features are nice. That said, I constantly have connectivity issues and unless my phone is within a few feet and almost direct line of sight (literally having to keep my iPhone on the right side of my body) I have continual problems.  Even if I try to move my phone to an appropriate place I still have sound issues that equate to dissed jointed audio feed, making listening to music extremely frustrating.  I've tried to use these for running, walking, yardwork and/or riding my lawnmower. The problem persists in any arena of use and seems to be getting worse as time passes."
1,"Stopped working after a while, but I loved them when they did work."
1,Like that I am able to hear out of them and that they stay on my ears.
1,They work great! Just wish the cord length was not so long
1,"So far these headphones have been great.  They fit extremely well, simple to use and pair, and also have been holding a charge over multiple workouts."
1,"excellent product I use one my self and bought one for my son.  Good battery life, fits well, easy to use"
0,"Bought for husband for xmas, and it wasn't within a month. They sent a replacement which was nice, but that one broke after a few months. Not good durability."
1,"had them for a short while, someone stole them from me, not as good as the mpow that look just the same and i own now."
1,"These are nice, and the sound quality is good. I've worn these while do yard work and sweating up a storm. My only critique is that they don't fit as snugly around my ear as I was hoping. However, I'm just nitpicking."
1,I just want to buy this headset is very good!
1,The ear pieces don't stay in your ears very well
0,"The Bluetooth goes in and out when my phone is in my pants pocket. Only works well when i hold the phone up by my chest. Sure they're a good price, but the quality was very evident"
1,"Great bass, had them for working out for about a year now. Still work great. At most, if you don't charge it for a while, the time between when they give you the low battery warning and shut off is pretty short."
1,Noise cancelling is better than most cheapie gym ear buds.  comfortable and stay in while kickboxing.  The sound quality isn't so great though. get what you pay for.
1,Great product! Met my expectations as described in the Products description.
1,Most of the time when you make a purchase decision based off reading reviews you end up regretting that decision. Well this time around that wasn't the case. What an awesome quality product offered at an outstanding value. Nice job SENSO ! Keep up the work.
1,They are very soft on the ear but stay in well. Great if your activ
1,"super fast delivery, love these earbuds."
1,"For the price I paid, the sound is good, the connection was easy, and they stay in my ears when running. If you are looking for a budget pair of fitness headphones, these are great. I would buy them again."
1,"This headphones are without a doubt the best headphones I ever had, and I'm saying it as a marathon runner user!!"
0,"Have only used them a couple times, but have been pretty unimpressed. The Bluetooth connection seems very poor. When wearing them while walking, they frequently make &#34;skipping&#34; noises and the connection goes in and out. When they work, the sound quality is pretty good, but they're fairly unreliable which justifies the rating."
1,The Blue Tooth function failed on my AYL-AX8 ear buds (&#34;out of range&#34; warnings when iPhone is in my pocket) so took Amazon's recommendation and bought SENSO. Sound is amazing and Blue Tooth is working great so far. Will revisit review to update Blue Tooth function if necessary.
1,Love these as headphones as an earpiece people some say I sound far away and or they can hear ambient sounds.<br />5/30/18: Wanted to make an addition to my review.  I purchased my original set back on 6/4/17 loved then too the reason I recently rethought them was because they stopped taking a charge just one day they would hold a charge for any length of time then nada . I thought the sound quality and the price were more than very good so now have another set.  Of these two die I will note it.  I like them enough to have friends get them from Amazon
0,"Loved them for about a month until they, without incident, stopped charging.  Tried different outlets, cables, etc.  Not sure if product faulty or what.  Nonetheless, very disappointing."
1,These are great!!! Long battery life with a comfortable fit.
1,"ear buds that actually fit my tiny ears.  They are so comfortable, I forget I have them on.  My only concern is that I can't seem to put them on without hitting the setting buttons.  I probably just need practice :). Thanks for a great product and fast delivery."
1,love the sound but they never feel totally secure. They have not fallen out however during my workout
1,They work fine. I have not used them for any length of time yet.
1,Great product and price
1,Love them I purchase a second pair for my honey
0,"Stopped charging after 7 month,now I need contact seller for warranty."
1,Great product for a great price nice carrying case provided and once opened another nice surprise of a dual car charging port. Well done Senso.
0,Start button stuck on after only 5 wears.  Button was alway difficult but stuck on today and I can't turn off.  Had to turn off on Bluetooth<br />You get what you pay for.... buy something other than these
1,"Just got my headphones, they sound great, no problem finding the right fit with so many earpieces, hope they last. Update, had<br />a problem with volume control buttons, unit replaced no hassles. I would and have recommended these ear buds to friends and family. So satisfied I bought a second pair."
1,Hi I am very happy about your product thank you so much
1,Excellent bluetooth on a budget!!!
0,Sound quality and fit is mediocre
0,"I was really happy with these headphones and used them for about two months until they would no longer turn on or charge. I reached out to customer service who responded quickly and gave me a suggestion to reset, which didn't work. The customer service rep was terrific and sent it a new set. I received them this past week and the new set is terrible. They crackle and disconnect from blue tooth multiple times within an hour. I'm assuming they are refurbished.  I'm SO DISAPPOINTED"
1,"I was using these most of the day today (just got them last night) and never had an issue w/ them falling out or getting loose in my ears. For the price, you can't beat them. The only issue I had was that the charging cord (short micro USB) didn't work and they had a new one out to me within a few hours of my email to them. And that cord isn't even their equipment, so you have to compliment their customer service.<br /><br />I travel a lot and wanted something to take w/ me on the road to watch movies on my iPad while on the airplane and these fit the bill perfectly. Like I said, for the price, I would challenge anyone to find something better. I was tired of cords and these are great. They sit very comfortably in my ear and did not cause any discomfort like some ear buds do. I did not have any issues w/ them getting loose while walking around the office and I was pleasantly surprised by the range these had.<br /><br />The controls are very easy to use and pairing is a breeze as well. Had no issues pairing to both my old iPod and newer iPad.<br /><br />I'm very pleased and could not imagine getting better sound unless I paid over $100, which I just won't do. If you're on the fence, go ahead and you'll be happy you bought these."
1,Freaking awesome sound and easy to set up. Thanks!
1,Received yesterday and wore yesterday<br />One day out of the box... so far so good.<br />I’ll give a review in about a month
1,My earphones worked great for 8 months; the quality was good and they were easy to use. Also I loved that the original package included a phone charger as well as two headphone chargers. After 8 months they stopped charging so I emailed their customer service and immediately got a response of what to do to fix them. I followed their instructions to no avail so I emailed them back and they said they would send me new headphones as I was covered by a one-year warranty. It was so easy and they really helped me with my problem and cared that the headphones weren't working as they should be. Would definitely recommend!!
1,"I bought the Senso Bluetooth Headphones to pair with a MP3 player which I had purchased for my wife. According to my wife, the Senso headphones are perfect for her. Charged the headphone set, turned the power on, paired with the MP3 player by pressing the connect icon on the player, played away.<br />The sound quality is great, and the range in our house is about 25-30 feet from the player which I think is very good, as my wife is never more than a few feet when she is at work from her player.<br />Very happy with the Senso Bluetooth headphones and recommend if you are looking for a product with great sound to check these out."
0,The sound quality is fine for anything without any base. But even a slight bit causes it to cut in and out and distorts audio. Its fine for podcasts but not music.
1,works fine. The sound is not as dynamic as I had hoped.
1,Hooked to bluetooth easily and works very well.  Comfortable earbuds.
1,I recently purchased this headphones skeptical about the price glad I did . I have never heard headphone that sound so good as these for the price .. Recommended these to any body that looking for affordable good quality headphone and they 24/7 customer service is spot on !!!!
1,Best Value
1,"I use them to lift weights, they're great on the bench because they don't fall out. I also do running plyometric workouts and they stay in place. They're great!"
1,tHEY WORK GREAT ARE EASY TO PAIR AND HAVE VERY GOOD SOUND.  TGHE DIFFERENT SIZE EAR PIECES MAKE THEM FIT GREAT
1,"Im sick and tired of BS reviews that promote items to a level they dont meet - these headphones are as good a money as i have spent on ways to play music in the gym. I have trouble keeping them in my ear canal but that is my problem as I have had this with every headphone/earbud ive ever owned. perfect bluetooth connection each and every time, great battery life and better than average sound quality"
0,Didn’t last 6 months. Constantly loses connectivity with the paired device side by side. Do yourself a favor and just save the money for some beats
1,Best headphones ever!
1,"So far I love it , good job"
1,"Tried them on for the first time this morning , I have Wahoo Kickr home power trainer for my bike,  it gets loud but with these earbuds on,  I can barely here the noise generated from the bike.  So far so good,  fit is excellent as super flexible ear lob things help keep the ear buds securely on my ear."
0,Left earbud kept falling out while doing the simplest of things- like sitting at my desk or going for a walk. I even read through the entire info booklet and a tutorial online but it still would not stay. The right one stayed perfectly; if the whole headset fit like the right side then maybe I might have kept it!
1,I like the sound and they work well with my new iPod Nano.  I would like to change the ear bud pads/inserts/?/ but I cannot remove the original.  Afraid to use pliers.
1,Nice headphones but had to return because they would not stay in place even with very light exercise.
0,"The sound quality is terrible. When I make calls using this earphone people don't hear me so well on the other side. The complaint is that I sound distant. the only key functionality is to pause and play music, turn up the volume and redial the last number. You can't activate Google voice with this. They also sent me the WRONG charger for the headphones. I was sent an apple charger instead of the universal android charger. see photos. The only good thing about these earphones is that they can stay in your ear for low intensity workouts. They however fall out for HIIT workouts. The ear hook is also apparently made for dumbo. They were entirly too large and aren't malleable so you can't conform them to your ear. This wasn't worth the price. save your money and invest in good earphone."
1,"I normally try not to give reviews that are unfavorable, but I think it is best to help other people prevent wasting their money.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-price<br />-ease of connectivity<br />-good bass<br /><br />CONS:<br />-uncomfortable if worn for more than an hour<br />-earbuds don't create tight seal<br />-no high end (treble)<br />-ear hooks are no adjustable"
1,Good wireless headphones for the price.  Have had some minor issues with beeping while they are playing.
1,"These wireless earbuds are pretty good for the price. I got them for mowing and walking and they do a great job for those purposes. The noise cancellation isn't anything special, but it does cut down outside noise some so you hear the music better. I am an audiophile so these wouldn't be my go to set for serious listening, but they sound really good as a whole. Remember, you aren't paying a Bose price, so don't expect a Bose sound."
0,"Pretty poor fit - inflexible ear supports means you're constantly adjusting them when running or even walking.<br />Below average sound quality. Bass is turned up, clearly imbalanced, and distorts at low volumes.<br />Terrible call quality. Quiet, distorted, and fuzzy sound. People also had a hard time understanding me compared to other BT earbuds.<br />Battery life seems decent and roughly as advertised.<br /><br />One redeeming feature? Comes with these nice memory foam earbuds."
0,I used this maybe 10 times and suddenly the battery went from a good 45 mins to less than 5. Even charging overnight the battery started claiming low battery within minutes and died before I made it to the gym. Garbage.
1,"My earbuds arrived on the date due.  Included in the package were a car charger, two additional sets of earbuds(different sizes), a short USB charging cable, and (surprise) a usb cable that included a dual phone/tablet interface connection (lighting and micro usb).  I opened up the package and paired the buds to my computer.  They connected immediately upon selecting the earbuds.  Later, after disconnecting and shutting down my computer, they connected quickly and automatically when I restarted my computer.  My other earbuds didn't do that.  The earbuds on the headset were perfect for me.  The earbuds fit comfortably and I feel that the quality is there.  They are easy to turn on and off and also to adjust the volume up and down.  Now, what I really like - the sound.  I have purchased two other sets of earbuds from Amazon.  One set was reasonable priced and had good sound, but did not have the ear braces (I don't know what you call those things that go over the ear).  The other earbuds that do have the ear support had a tinny sound.  These SENSO Bluetooth headphones have a great sound!!  Volume is great as well.  They feel comfortable and sound as good as my more expensive over the ear headphones that I also use.  I didn't want to spend the money for JBL or Beats as I don't use the Bluetooth headphones that much, but I might use these more than I have been using headphones in the past.  You will not go wrong with these headphones/earbuds."
1,This product is pretty awesome. With everything it comes with its unbeatable for its price. Another great thing oh get with this product is the customer service. I have already had to represent ice reach out to me and make sure that the product was what I wanted and to see if there was anything else I would need. The pair is pretty easy. It sounds good and it's pretty stylish. I like how they fit into your ears for security and then on top of that they have another part to go over your ears. There is no volume box on the cord like many other which is awesome and less distracting.<br />The only cons I have is that the part that goes around your ear is a little flimsy for me and when I first tried tried them it seemed like one side was louder than the other but have used a few times now and they seem to be fine but if there is a consistent problem k know the Senso company will help me become a fully satisfied company. These are the best Bluetooth headphones you can get for the price that has everything. Definitely telling other about this product.
0,DO NOT BUY. The left earbud went out in less than 3 months.
1,It's  annoying how every product can run around claiming HD.  These are not HD headphones.<br /><br />A very flat sound. Not for you if you have a musical ear.<br />More of a low mid sound. No highs or sub.<br />If you listen to music with actual instruments and sound clairity matters then Pass on these.<br /><br />I made sure before I made this statement that I had in fact downloaded high definition audio.  Luckily Spotify has an equalizer.  It helped a little bit but still.  I don't feel it can be called HD.  But if you've lived life not knowing what true sound is you probably wouldn't notice.  As for me..  I've got better sound from a $10 pack of skull candy which to me are the best for the price.  Sure this is blue tooth. And you get what you pay for .  But don't run around claiming HD.  That's ridiculous.
0,Bought these end of April and they already won't hold a charge...
1,"First pair of BT headphones.  Totally love the wireless experience.  These are comfortable, sound fantastic, and love the controls.  Cannot beat the value."
1,"The headphones were great, but a short time after getting them, the headset would not hold a charge. I contacted Senco and the service they provided was excellent!!!!! We tried a fix and when it didn't work they set me a new headset within a few days. I hope the new set holds it's charge."
1,I love it. Great sound. Comfortable and lightweight. Great useful extras included. Easy to operate. Stylish. I've already contacted friends and relatives urging them to purchase some for themselves. I plan on buying some for gifts.
1,Amazing customer service. Great product!
1,"This is a good product.  It works well for the price.  I use it to workout and run with and it stays fairly well in place.  Every now and then you get a little &#34;windage&#34; during the runs, which can be fixed by pushing it back into your ear.  It has both the over the ear and a fitted ear piece to hold things in place which is helpful.  Volume of music and quality is decent."
1,Really enjoy them I have been asked several times if they where beats brand. Like them alot
1,I really like the sound on the headphones!  I ran into a friend who saw my headphones and he said that he had the same ones and really liked them.  The only thing that I need to train myself not to hit the ON/Off button when I am using them into my ears as I did on my old ones.
1,Ok sound .not bad for the money . Not very clear highs and a little bit muddy on the bass. I  like my terablads better but were more money . I use the senso for work and as back ups.not as comfortable as the terablads either
1,I gave it 4 stars because sometimes it takes a little more time to sync but overall they seem to work well. Usually earbuds do not stay in my ears but these stay put perfectly. It is a little scratchy at times but overall the quality seems good. Comes nicely packaged with all the add-ons and the company seems quick to respond.
1,These headphones are awesome. Work better than any other headphones I have owned. They have never fallen out while running/weight lifting. They connect and stay connected to bluetooth. They came with a dual car charger and charging cord. Great buy.
1,"I just bought my 2nd pair b/c my first pair continued to work well over a couple years despite a decent amount of abuse, until my dog got to them. I try to avoid using bluetooth when possible, but it's often the best option for workouts."
1,"I use these primarily for workouts.  They are comfortable, stay in place even when I am sprinting and the sound is much better than I expected.  I would give five stars, but when I use them on phone calls the other party has  a very hard time hearing me.  They come with extra ear buds, 2 port car charger, cable and carrying case.  I would recommend these for exercise and I'm very happy with the purchase."
1,"Great price, fit and sound quality."
1,Really good headset. Only downsize is that the Bluetooth connection is not too strong so you have to have your phone with you all the time otherwise they won't hear you.
0,"My initial impressions of these earbuds were good. The sound quality was OK for hitting the gym, they didn't get especially dirty, they were comfortable to wear, and had a good array of adjustments for a good fit.<br />I've used them maybe two to three times a week for an hour at a time, and they keep a charge for weeks at a time providing they're turned off when not in use.<br /><br />My problem, however, is that only a month after the return window expires the up-volume button has completely jammed. I can no longer turn my music up from the earbuds, it has to be done from my phone now.<br />Volume down works fine, but not up... Very disappointing in how little I used them before something so simple broke on them.<br />I'll be going with a more familiar brand next time around, and I won't be buying these again.<br /><br />In my defense, I am not hard on electronics. I've never broken anything since I was 16, the button breaking on this was a design flaw, not from any kind of abuse in daily use.<br /><br />Overall, good presentation, good aesthetic, ok sound quality, bad design quality. Won't buy again."
1,"These headphones are a great value. They come with a car charger with phone charger and headphone connections, a carry case, and another charging cord. They are easy to set up and comfortable. The sound is 8/10, but good for the gym or running. The part that goes around your ear is flexible. I would recommend these!"
1,"The only downside is the amount of wind noise you get while running outside. I bought these because I saw that in a review and most of my exercise is indoors, so not a problem. The behind-the-ear pieces are very flexible and easy to mold to the ear. Great quality for the price especially."
1,"The headphones are easy to operate, and do not have the cord in the way. It has a good 8+ hours of battery life which is great when I forget to plug it in."
1,For the price these are astounding. Needed a cheap quick replacement for my Beats. Sound quality just blew me away. Super comfortable fit. If anything they are more comfortable than my Beats. I wear them running.
0,"this product has to problems, the first it the fit, as it doesnt stay fixed in your ears when running, but the second is really huge, as the sound stays on and off when you run with your iphone or other devide (tried itouch also), this is something related to the bluetooth connection. Is ok when you are just walking, but really impossible to listen when running!<br />Hope to receive any feedback from the manufactor!"
1,Comfortable fit
1,awesome!
1,Sound is good. Connectivity is good. Fit is odd and ear flaps are super soft and don't help maintain stabilization.
1,This product does exactly what it promises to do. They connect easy and sound great.
1,Return Window closed June 21. The device stopped working. Company and customer service was great. Indicated that this was a rare occurrence and shipped out another set immediately.  No hassles.
1,Great so far. I am very happy with the bass and all the extra goodies that come with these earbuds.
1,"Right out of the box, I looked at them and thought &#34;here we go&#34;.<br /><br />Then I held them and thought the sound quality can't be as good as these things look and feel due to the light weight. I felt them and everything was rubberized which I loved.<br /><br />Then I prepared to pair them and I've never had an easier time pairing a Bluetooth device in my life! Why isn't everything this easy??<br /><br />Then I put them on. After a couple adjustments, they fit perfectly. The rubberized everything makes them extremely comfortable, and they move with me as I do my HIIT and crossfit workouts and jump around like a fool as I do.<br /><br />Then I began the music, expecting to be disappointed. Nope. Great sound quality. (And I'm a tough audience.)<br /><br />Also, look at everything these things come with!<br /><br />The gist: Amazing earphones, great price for the quality AND quantity you're getting. You will not be disappointed getting these. Highly recommended!<br /><br />(Note: I was in no way nudged to give this product a positive rating. I truly am a fan of these!)<br /><br />*Update 1/11* Dropped a star. These are still great sounding and fairly comfortable, but I do a lot of HIIT and burpee-type exercises, and so far, these are just failing to stay in my ear.<br /><br />I also dropped that star because looks aren't the first thing I think about, but it's fairly important. These stick out of your ears moreso than the photos suggest, making you look a little silly.<br /><br />So unfortunately although these are great for the price, I'm forced to return them and go with the Phaiser BHS-750s."
1,"I did not know what to expect from the design of these earbuds, but I am happy to say I am MORE THAN IMPRESSED! I do not notice that much bass power, but the sound quality is crystal-clear, the earbuds fit quite comfortably and if you need some quiet time, the noise cancellation is great for meditating or a stylish way of saying “I’m sorry, I cannot listen to you right now.”"
1,"Work well, easy to use, looking forward to years of enjoyment."
1,"These headphones make working out so much easier, and they were easy to pair with my Bluetooth. So far, so good."
1,Great product and package !
0,I really enjoyed these headphones but I've only had them for 5 months and they just stopped working.  Very disappointed :(
1,Best $23 I've spent in a long time!
0,"These Headphones are pretty meh. They do the job, and the sound is acceptable. My biggest problem with them is the range is a joke. They *barely* reach from my ear to my phone in my right pocket.<br /><br />Want to turn your head slightly? Cuts out.<br />Want to impede the line of sight with your arm? Cuts out.<br />Want to carry your phone in your left pocket? Don't even think about it."
1,"Stunning sound!!! I love this earbuds they came out with an upgraded model I noticed I will love to know what the difference between them, but this things are amazing highly recommended."
1,"at the same price point, you are better off getting another brand of headphones. these have WAY too much bass by default. I have to use the equalizer feature in Spotify to manually lower the bass and increase treble"
1,"After discovering that the headset jack on my iPhone 6+ no longer worked, I had two options. I could go through the joy of attempting to get Apple to do something about it, or I could pickup a pair of Bluetooth headphones. Initially, I purchased these with the intent of just using them to listen to calls while riding the train into work (love those early morning calls that just can't be rescheduled), not even realizing they had a built in microphone. Of course, for listening to a group of people speak, they were perfect. The sound quality was excellent and people could hear me just fine when I spoke as well. Never did I have a complaint of background noise or low volume etc. when I would speak.<br /><br />A few weeks ago I decided to start up my workout routine in the mornings. So as not to disturb my family by listening to my music via a speaker, I decided to give these a shot and let me just say... WOW! The sound quality for music is way better than I had ever expected. On songs with heavy bass these really do an incredible job.<br /><br />As for the earbuds themselves, they are extremely comfortable and have an incredible battery life. I have literally only charged them once since I purchased them (the day they arrived) and, after 3 or 4 hour long calls, and 8 days of 30-minute workouts listening to music at a pretty high volume, I still haven't run out of juice. That's frankly incredible!<br /><br />The pairing is simple and the controls on the right ear are the perfect size to where you don't find yourself accidentally pressing volume up when you mean to press down, etc.<br /><br />The fact that these headphones are IPX7 waterproof, and not just water resistant, is also incredible. If you have no idea what that means, in the simplest terms it means you could be wearing these while floating in your pool, fall off the float and go 3' under water, and they'd be absolutely fine. That realization, coupled with the sound quality, has made me decide that this summer, I will be using these as I float around instead of a speaker. My neighbors will undoubtedly be happier too.<br /><br />All in all I can't recommend these headphones enough. There just isn't a negative in my opinion. Between all the things I've mentioned here, and the fact that they are under $30 (say what?!)... I can't see a reason not to get them. Seriously. Stop reading reviews and click &quot;Add to Cart&quot; now."
0,"Worked fine for a couple of weeks and after a sweaty run the right earphone stopped working. I contacted support and they were very responsive. Quickly suggested a fix that didn't solve the problem and so immediately sent a new pair of headphones that work fine. However, now the new pair has the same problem. This is unbelievable, I do not recommend the product."
1,Very happy with these ear buds. I don’t like any ear buds that go in your ears but these go in just far enough and don’t irritate. They connect quickly and the audio is very good. Would recommend them to others with no reservations.
1,Try them you will like them.  Don’t waste the big bucks if your like me and loose them in your gym bag.
1,"I'm pleased with these headphone, especially for the price, just wish the battery lasted longer."
1,I jog a couple miles every day and being able to listen to music is very pleasant. These headphones stay in my ears and sound great. Pairs easily with my iPhone and are​ everything I hoped for.
1,Works great well worth the price.
1,"After trying a variety of headphones, these are the absolute best. The sound is crystal clear, it fits snug on my ear, and they are light in weight. I sweat a lot in the gym, but it stays on my ear. I wish I had found these way before now."
0,"came missing parts, returned"
1,Great headphones but could use some improvement on the left side.
1,The Senso Bluetooth headphones was a very smart choice for me. The price was low but the features were excellent - adjustable ear pieces with the loop to prevent falling off and a solid 8 hours of playtime. The buttons are easy to use and the Bluetooth setup was a breeze.
1,These were a hit for Christmas presents. Nice gift.
0,"Connectivity is horrible. Once you put your phone in a band or your pocket the Bluetooth goes in and out. If you hold your phone right up to them, it is OK. Spend the money and get name brand headphones..."
1,Very nice thank you
0,"Constantly losing signal,  reconnecting, range is deplorable,  5 feet?  may as well have a cord ridiculous.  Uncomfortable,  sound quality,  I've only tried audiobooks  so hard to say but I am not impressed.  Going to send them back"
1,"These Headphones are well worth the cost. They are easy to operate, fit well in the ear and the sound is excellent."
1,"This is my second purchase! I loved them so much, I bought them for my brother for his birthday! They’re great quality!"
1,best sounding!
0,"Not sure how and why some of the good reviews.<br />I took these out for a short run, about 30 minutes and have to say these are junk. After about 10minutes I was so tired of pushing these back in I just pulled them off and ran without the remaining time. As soon as u swear, these WILL NOT stay in. On top of that, I had to place my Sandisk clip on my shirt collar because they were constantly skipping and cutting in and out.<br />Not worth the trouble."
1,"They work pretty well and are simple to use, my only complaints are that if I don't put them on just right they fall off and they don't keep out any background noise but that's common with ear buds"
0,Pure garbage!!!!! Brought them for my son to use for a trip they worked 3 times and stoped working!!! Please do not bother with this product
1,These bluetooth earphones fit well and work great with my phone.
1,"Good music playback, loud, but poor for having a conversation."
1,So far so good. The quality is great! Loud don't need to use all the volume and bass is and tones are great. They are comfortable i wish i would of bought these sooner. It comes with a usb apple charger but i have an android. It has comes with the microusb charger also. Great value! Would order again amd recommend to friends and family.
1,"Been buying these since they first came out, I wear them to workout, to run (including running in the rain), and at work.  Sound quality is good enough, not great but I'm okay with it."
1,These headphones are fantastic!  Im a musician and am used to using very high end headphones for on stage performances and I would consider myself an audiophile so trust we when I say the Senso bluetooth headphones are amazing! Great clarity and bass. They are also very comfortable and easy to use. If your considering Beats or Bose just skip the hype and go with Senso. You won't be disappointed!
1,Great deal. They work great. A little confusing on the controls but that's my doing.
1,"Do yourself a favor and pick up a pair of these. They are a steal! Here is the good and the bad:<br /><br />Pros:<br />- quality of sound is crystal clear<br />- sweat proof<br />- light weight<br />- stable when running<br />- good mic for calls<br />- easy connectivity<br />- long battery life<br />- charges quickly<br />- intuitive controls<br />- comes with many ear tips, a carrying case, and much more<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- bad range<br />- terrible bass<br />- weird static noise when far from source or on call"
1,"With the new iPhone, you either go Bluetooth or use their flimsy dongle.  These fit well, good battery life, and good sound quality.  Highly recommend."
1,When trying to find wireless headphones I tried everything.  This were a HUGE surprise.  Louder than Bose at a fraction of the price and super comfortable.  Well worth the money
1,"I purchased these primarily to run on the treadmill and listen to concert videos on my iPad. These headphones are awesome. They paired easily, have tremendous range and aren't affected by the treadmill as some other bluetooth I've owned are. I haven't even mentioned how great they sound. These are stunningly good and I will be purchasing more for Christmas gifts this year."
1,"Great sound, great while running and working out.  Lightweight, easy to use while working out.  Have yet to try a call on it but overall great set of headphones for the price.  The extras were a huge plus as well.<br /><br />Personally, I hope in the future they stiffen up the around the ear part.  It feels like a wet noodle and I get it might be for being lightweight and flexibility but I just prefer a tad stiffer part going around my ear so they're aren't bouncing too much"
1,Love them! Very clear and stay in place!
1,Just got it...sounds great and easy to understand and use...the packaging was outstanding.
1,Fast shipping. I've been using them at work for my podcasts. I haven't had any problems with them at all. They're very easy to use too.
1,"They feel and work good, a little annoying to put on with thicker glasses, but stills fits and works well."
1,One of the best Bluetooth ever great stereo y great bass
0,They stopped working after 2 months. Terrible quality.
1,"Awesome fit, stellar sound quality, great feel, killer battery life, and outstanding company and customer service.  These guys stand by their product, as they should because its sweet.  I'm out of adjectives."
1,"These are AWESOME! It really helps tune out the screaming babies, the music from others cell phones who refuse to use a headset and the loud conversations of teens. I can ride public transportation in my own little world. Ahhhhh"
1,"Very nice for the money; good sound, great accessories.  Suggest staying within 20 feet of device. There are tons of options in wireless headsets, think I chose a good one for price and overall quality. One somewhat slight critique is that the ear wraps are a bit floppy making them hard to get on your ear with one hand. The softness is probably good for longer wear but as someone who takes them off after use it's a bit annoying in putting them back on. Perhaps a slightly more firm rubber would be better. Otherwise I like them."
1,"Much better than the wireless headphones at a similar cost at the discount.  However, not anywhere close to what the original cost states.  A lot more difficult to sync and the treble and bass quality is not anywhere near the originally stated cost without the discount.  I highly recommend not using such a high original cost."
1,I have a hard time keeping ear buds in my ears. These are comfortable and the sound is great! Thank you
1,"As advertised.  Pairing is easy once you figure it out.  Pretty comfortable for 30-somthin dollars.  They don't fall out.  The sound could use more highs.  Took about 10 days for delivery.  I've used them for about 5 hours now and so far they work great.  I would recommend them to a friend unless that friend was rich.  In that case, I would suggest a sound canceling BOSE headset.<br />Cheers"
1,"Honestly didn't expect much because of the price, but I was blown away at the sound quality and how well they fit.  Absolutely no issues with them trying to fall off.  Other than the music I can't even tell I'm wearing them."
1,"I am happy either with the purchase so far .<br />Plus good customer services, and easy to reach"
1,Love these headphones!
1,These stick out from your ears a bit so it's uncomfortable to lay down on your side with them but it is possible. I have only had one instance when they wouldn't pair with my phone. I had to remove them from my phone and sync them again. The loop over the ear helps to keep them in place while using them. Sometimes people have a hard time hearing me when I answer the phone with them but I don't talk a lot with them on. The battery life is really good. I only have to charge them once in a while.
1,"Only issue I have with the head phones is that the cord that wraps around the back of the head tends to get stuck in my hair, shirt or whatever.  Other than that it is great."
1,I like them
1,"The headphones worked fine for a while, however the skip track button no longer works, and I've been having some connectivity issues. I registered the product through the company's website, and I'm yet to receive a response on how to get them replaced. The actual product is pretty solid, however so far the customer service and ""one year warranty"" have not been."
1,"I use these while paddleboarding, swimming, and taking baths and showers.  They are fully waterproof and the battery lasts for several hours.  A good quality product."
1,They are great have had no problems with them. The case is great. The sound is very good. It was easy to pair them with my devices.
1,"Finally! A great pair of buds for running. Fit great, perfect sound. Impressive quality with all components. Even the packaging was impressice."
1,I have had the ear buds for over a week and have exercised while wearing the earbuds several times.  When I run they work ok except when my ears sweat then I have some issues with the earbuds staying in place. But this has only happen a couple times.  The sound is pretty good.  I have had connection issues.  For example today While wearing the earbuds at the gym it disconnected and reconnected to my phone several times. Not sure why being the photographer me was with in 2 feet of the earbuds.  A little annoying loosing what I'm listening to for a second but also the earbuds tell you when you disconnect and reconnect. Other than that decent product.
0,They worked fine until they didn’t. A few days ago they simply would not power on despite being charged. I have tried every sequence of button pushing and holding I’ve read to try and nothing. Way too much money to have them puke and die this soon.
1,Great sound.  Easy to use.  Seem durable during use in a difficult and highly active environment
1,"Pro:<br />Packaging was impressive and fair, as far as the extra materials given for the earphones and case to store the earphones.<br />length of wires were appropriate.  Easy to figure out how to turn it on and Bluetooth to a device.  I didn't read the manual and I was able to connect to my Bluetooth.  Once on, sound quality was fair to good for the everyday person.  I'm sure if your a pro, you can pick up the little differences when compared to others.  At this time, battery life appears to be very good and recharging with a speed charger is great.  The ear bud component that goes into the ear feels very comfortable, and it doesn't feel like its going to slip out when walking around or sitting.  Haven't tested in the gym or jogging.<br /><br />Con: charging cord is very short; loops that go over the ear is toooo big.  It was made for someone with big ears or at least made for men.  The loops can sort of bend back behind your ears but it could have been constructed a little smaller."
1,"So far so good. Haven't run with them yet, but gave them a little test to compare sound quality with that of my old pair of Bluetooth ear buds. This is far and away better."
1,great price and great quality (manufacturing and sound!)
1,"I've used these for over a year with no problems.  I paid so little for them I didn't expect much quality and, frankly, didn't wear them except to try them out to see if they worked.  I continued using my corded Bose earbuds without really giving these a chance.  I finally tired of the cord flopping around and used these - blown away.  I didn't know I could use them for phone calls and stumbled over that when I received one.  They work great and people on the phone don't seem to realize I'm on a headset.  I have a lot of items that use Bluetooth and my phone is normally connected to something - a car, a speaker, or a camera, etc., so I have to go through a connection process if I put them on in my house, but if I turn them on while on my driveway they automatically connect.  That  problem results from using a point-to-point technology with multiple items and isn't the earbuds' problem."
0,"These were working great...until the volume buttons on top stopped working. It's had them less than six months. Now I'm incapable of changing the volume and, since it's currently set low, they're essentially worthless. Definitely bummed since they've been working great up until this point."
0,"The first pair of Senso headphones I got were GREAT!  I used them almost every day at work to listen to books.  Unfortunately, I lost them.  So I got another pair exactly like them...so I thought.  It seems that they have changed the design of the ear hooks.  Now they are bendable and too flexible and won't stay on tight anymore.  The ear hooks are getting bent out of shape, and I absolutely hate them now.  I'm getting rid of them and trying something different.  Too bad someone decided to change them.  The product used to be great, now it's worthless."
1,I bought a pair of these headphones for running.  They work great.  Paired up quickly and stayed put in my ear while exercising. Perfect.
0,"I purchased these on July 5 and a month later, my brother gets in the car only to smell the nasty smell of electrical burning, looks over and there is smoke coming from these and then poof, they catch on fire.  I want my money back!!!"
1,Great value !! Sounds great and work as described . This is my second set in a year though... But I use them a lot. I work out 3 hours a day 5 to 6 days a week. I feel that they held up well with all of the sweating and abuse. For the price I am more than willing to replace them once a year if needed.
1,Great buy!
1,I love these headphones. They are just as good as Beats by Dre without the crazy high price!
1,"battery charges up in a very short time, easy to set up."
1,"These buds have been a great addition for my listening enjoyment. I am a music lover that thrives on good quality sound and functionality. I use these buds while running, mountain biking, and working out. They are comfortable, easy to use, and don't fall out of my ears. They are my first set of wireless buds, and I highly recommend them."
1,"Fantastic headphones. Sound good pairs quickly and very sturdy on the ear. Have not tried while working out and sweaty but I fell confident that they will.work great. Light weight and the sound and bass will amaze you for being so small. Overall, very happy"
1,It is great for all kinds of activities in the gym and at home.  I love them.
1,i like to listen to audio books  great for that  i fall asleep with them. I've used them in the tub.  best of all is they are adjustable  so they stay in my ears and last all day with one charge.  the price is great I.ll never spend all that money on beats again
1,Great product for the cost!
1,"Love my senso Bluetooth headsets! Sound quality is great. They are easy to use,  I have ordered this pair for a friend. He has now ordered 2more pairs one as a backup and one for a friend of his👍🏽😎At this point I need stock in the company this is my 4th pair.👍🏽👌🏽 Thank you Kenneth❤️"
1,"Work great, only issue is the hook portion that goes over the ear sits to high. Wish they where adjustable."
0,"I had these headphones for less than 2 months and the volume button broke (no way to turn the volume down).  Furthermore, they didn't automatically turn themselves off when not in use, so they were constantly out of battery charge.  I do not recommend!"
0,"I used to love these Bluetooth headphones. And then I decided to use the waterproof feature and go swimming for the first time today. The instant I got them wet they were dead even though everything is closed everything looked great and these are supposed to be waterproof. They have work great for all exercise up until the pool......... UPDATE TO REVIEW&#62; Customer service is great, I contacted them to discuss and they replaced my headphones, however they informed me that (As we informed you earlier, the Senso ActivBuds S-250 are IPX7 Waterproof rated and have been tested by submerging them fully into water for a short period of time.  Although, most IPX7 rated devices can be submerged under water for short period of time, it is still recommended not to do so.  That being said, the Senso ActivBuds will hold up very well against rain, heavy sweat, and all kinds of other activities which involve interaction with moisture.) When I looked up what IPX7 means, it states IPX7: Can be submerged up to 1 meter in water for 30 minutes. I killed 2 pairs of these by swimming less than 30 minutes, and I was for sure less than 1 meter down."
0,These headphones worked well for roughly a week.  Now they stay connected for around 15 minutes. Then they lose connection and sometimes won't even power on back on.  I would not recommend them.
1,The work great for running and walking. They stay in place very well and work great with my iPhone. They are the best running headphones I've found. I had a pair die on me though. The customer service is sending me a new pair. The customer service was very responsive.
1,"Pretty good headphones.  I wish the earpiece were a little firmer.  Does not grip ear securely--slips off occasionally. Very comfortable, though."
0,After 2 months of moderate use (2 hours twice weekly) they died. It doesn't power-on and the the charging LED indicator doesn't show when plugged in.
1,They are ok. Battery life is decent. They have ok sound. I've had plenty of wired headphones that coat $25 that sounded twice as good as these.
1,"This is a great product at a great price. Pairing is very easy and the sound quality is great. I have not yet used it outside on a windy day, but I have found that even the most expensive Bluetooth earphones don't work as well as advertised. For is great and there are a lot of things in the bag."
1,"Great bt headphones!! Still havent charged them since first use, i use them mostly for the gym (1:30 mostly) and i love them. Sound is great, noise cancelling is pretty good! Overall i recommend them!"
1,Great sound quality
0,Purchased two months ago. The sound is low quality and they have stopped working. They will connect for a short period then disconnect and won't reconnect for an hour or so.
1,Overall great headphones! Stay in my ears and get the job done. I was simply looking for headphones to use while I work out because I was tired of normal wired ones falling out. The only complaint I have (and comes from me being a musician/picky sound guy) is that they are very bassy. I had to mess with the eq in my Spotify app to get the highs more clear in the headphones. But that's me being picky! Overall great for the price.
1,"These are great. I had to switch out the ear piece for the smaller one, and now they are very comfortable.  You have to adjust them each time you put them on. The mic works really well for phone calls. The sound is nice and it is really great for running."
1,Love these.  They are so comfortable and sound awesome.
1,Good quality sound.
1,I like everything about them but had to get a second set as the original pair wouldn’t recharge.  Senso sent me a free pair.  They work great.
1,"Worked well for the price, that's no question. But only less than three months of ownership (with careful care around gym use) it will not turn on, charge, nothing. It worked perfectly fine on a run. I turned it off and came back to charge it an hour later and it was just dead. It will not charge or respond whatsoever. For the price and the performance while it worked, I may order another but I will first contact the seller and see if they can just replace it, being that I have had it less that 90 days."
1,"These accomplish their primary task (play music and stay in for long trail runs) beautifully.  I have paid $100+ for bluetooth headphones that keep falling out or that drop signal occasionally.  I think the over-the-ear hook is a superior design and these last for miles of heavy sweat and running.  I'll dock one star because they do not consistently keep a signal outdoors playing directly from an Apple Watch 1.  To be fair, I have found no bluetooth headphones that do so the issue may well be with the early Apple Watches.  Curiously, it works indoors with the watch consistently (perhaps because it can bounce signals off walls), but not out in the open.  I'd love to run with just my watch and wireless headphones, but today I still need to bring my iPhone.  With that said, I'm still very satisfied.  And crazy good price."
0,"Made very cheaply, broke after month of using."
0,"Initially I wanted to give his 5 stars. I purchased these for my husband who was very excited and pleased with the quality and sound. He's only used them for 1 week and it cuts on and off for 15 seconds at a time. This is what he says:<br /><br />Ok, went for a run back home and it did it. Went to the hotel gym this morning and it did it. On for 15 sec then off for about the same time, continually. 😡very frustrating.<br /> Also, it would go beep beep, then off. Then 15 seconds, beep beep and back on.<br /><br />Can someone tell me why this happens? If not then we plan on returning these."
1,"AMAZING 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽❤❤ last so long, don't fall off, and incredible sound quality!!"
1,like
0,"Excited when they arrived and the fit was good but..... The music was distorted at any level and they are not good outside when running or biking the wind noise was too much. What a shame, so I am returning them"
1,"wife likes sounds, could be louder though and does not give you amble notice of battery running low."
1,These headphones were easy to pair (and can be paired to two different devices-way cool!).  Very satisfied!
1,"Excellent packaging, great case, workmanship superior to items that are at a price point double in value.  Ease-of-use, functionality, sound quality exceptional. This product is on my gift list for my kids this year. Ray"
1,Definitely worth the money. I love these more than my BEATS I used to have.
1,For the $40 you spend you get what you pay for and a little more. Mine came with an iphone charger as well as a car charger so that was already $20 right there. the headphones are really great sound for the price. I got them same day for a total of $46... well worth it<br /><br />Might buy another pair as extra
0,"kept dying and having to return, a bunch of hassle for such mediocre headphones not worth the risk."
1,The last gen model of these worked great but the latest Gen has even better sound quality and the battery is lasting even longer. Highly recommend.
1,"Excellent sound quality, fast delivery very good headphones"
1,I am really pleased with these airbuds. They allow me to use my hands while driving and doing house chores. The only thing I had an issue with was they didn't come with the free car charger and the long charging  cord.
1,Get what you pay for and some. Great value purchase
1,These headphones are lightweight and stay in your ear very well. I use these heaphones mainly for working out in and never have any problems with them. I would definately recommend this product to others.
1,Great earbuds so far!
1,I have been through many ear buds that either fall out or sound terrible. This pair doesn't fall out and they sound great. Nice transaction. Thanks very much. 5 star business
0,Worked ok for about one month now they wont stay connected and constantly die mid run. Worst headphones I ever had.
0,"I've had these headphones for almost two years and they've finally died on me. For the first few months they were great, but gradually the bluetooth connection got weaker, battery life decreased where I had to charge it every day, and sound quality lagged. I held on trying to factory reset and save money for something better, but had to write this review because now it's completely not working."
1,This was my second set purchased for my wife I loved the first set and used it for exercising during the Christmas period. Very comfortable and great battery life. Very pleased with mine so I got a pair for my wife excellent set. The sound quality is great I think its better than my Bose wired noise cancelling set (in ear) and comparable to the Bose over ear set.
0,"Despite the low pirce, I don't think these are worth it for the following reasons<br />1) Super annoying, loud, and robotic 'battery low' warning which triggers at 30% battery and goes on until it dies which is about 1 hr.  There's no way to turn this off<br />2) Battery is weird.  Goes from 70% to 30% in an hour or less.<br />3) Poor batter life overall.  Definitely not 8 hours, especially if you don't count that annoying 'battery low' period.<br />4) Constantly hearing static<br /><br />Sound is good when it does work and fit is comfortable.  But what good is that if it only works for much less than the advertised time battery life.  Back to my search for the best bluetooth headphones.  Sigh..."
1,"Very confortable device, paired sucesfull with 2 devices at one, wihtout problem. Love it!"
1,"Great sound quality for the price. Perfect for working out, it doesn't fall off easily. I got three of these SENSO which I gave two of them as birthday gifts, and I can say all are happy! Most importantly , I had issue with the cable of one of the SENSO, and once I contacted the company, the resend me a new one, even it was after couple of months. I liked this service a lot to be honest!"
1,I had no difficulty in setting up the connection to my phone. The headphones are comfortable and the sound is great!
0,Garbage...I've had them for barely two months and they don't work
1,"Have worn 3 times and they perform very well.  Sound is good, especially at the price paid.  Need to adjust slightly every mile or so on run but that is less often than any other pair I have purchased."
1,Excellent customer service. After almost a year my left earpiece started getting static and going in and out and i contacted the company since they were still under warranty. They answered my email within a few hours and gave me some tips. when that didn't work they sent out a new pair that i got a few days later with no hassle! They sound great and are very comfortable.
1,"I have had 8 different sets of wireless headphones and, so far, these are the best - hands down. Not only are the headphones tiptop, but the accouterments that came with it were over the top. High quality charger cords and car charger, and even a great case. I did a lot of research and found that dollar-for-dollar these were the highest rated in several cost categories. I'm thinking of buying an extra pair."
1,"I have been in love with these things ever since I opened the box. They are so comfortable, it hardly feels like I'm wearing them at all. Listening to music and going about my day is so much easier now that I don't have to worry about cords getting my way. And not to mention, the sound quality is amazing. This is an amazing product and I highly recommend them."
1,"These are great for around the house or maybe walking around on a day where the air is still. The sound quality is good, people said they could hear me clearly when I tested them inside.<br />If you plan on running with these or the wind starts blowing while you are wearing these, you can forget about hearing anything. The wind noise is unbearable.<br /><br />If you just want something to use while doing housework, these are great. If you plan on using them for running, pass on these."
1,"I USED THEM FOR THE FIRST TIME YESTERDAY.THEY PERFORMED LIKE I EXPECTED.THEY HAD GREAT SOUND,AT AGREAT PRICE.MY LAST BUDS WERE GREAT FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS,BUT THEN STOPPED CHARGING.SO,SO FAR SO GOOD."
1,"Great sound, very comfortable.  The issue I've had with wired and wireless bheadphones over the years is how long they last.  I changed to wireless bluetooth last year.  I purchased yurbuds, they last approximately 11 months.  I only use them when working out in the gym.  Only time will tell how great this product is.<br /><br />Updated 5/31/2019., Ordered Feb 11th. 2017, left headphone speaker is going out."
0,"When I barely got them. I loved them. They were comfortable and the sound quality was amazing.<br /><br />However, couple weeks in and they start to fail on me. The music cuts off completely. It keeps saying connected every 20 seconds or so. Very frustrated as I just missed the return date two days ago. I don’t even use them to excercise, I just use them while I am making my way to class."
1,"I bought a pair for use at work, so I cannot comment on using them in an athletic sense. It is nice to leave my phone in my desk and not have to worry about catching the cord on anything. While in use I am generally no more than 20 feet from my desk and cut out from distance has yet to ever happen.<br /><br />I use them to listen to music, podcasts, and audio books, exclusively. I do not use them for phone calls so I have no input on that.<br /><br />The bass is surprisingly 'bassy' which is entirely welcome. The sound quality in general is every bit as good as a pair of wired headphone I paid twice the cost of these for.<br /><br />I get probably right around eight hours use out of them before needing to charge them.<br /><br />They connect via Bluetooth quickly and stay connect so no problems there.<br /><br />The button placement, and usage are fine as well.<br /><br />They are comfortable to wear, which is a big plus because I have kind of small ears, and its usually an issue with other headphones.<br /><br />All in all, these deserve five stars especially since they are on $30."
1,WHY is it so hard to plug the cord in to charge ?? LOL that's my only issue
0,"Used 3 times, in the middle of my 3rd run they suddenly disconnected/died and won't turn back on.  I thought maybe it was a fluke but it appears other people have had this problem too.  I sweat a lot so I'm wondering if they're not as waterproof/sweatproof as they indicate.  I will soon be working with customer service to replace.  I may update review after interacting with customer service and replacement if the experience and replacement pair merit it."
1,"Perfect, and exactly what I was looking for. Great battery life, easy setup, really good buy and product. Thank you Senso"
0,Poor sound and connectivity. Sound tears.
1,"I, just like thousands of you read the reviews and made your decision based on your reviews you had read. Well I'm really glad I bought these Headphones. They work great. The range is really awesome. I was outside and my phone was inside and I was about 35' away. Inside my home the range is even greater. I'm just going to sum it up like this... Great product, works and sounds great and it's over half the cost of  headphones that my wife bought. So it's win, win win for me.. Buy them and don't spend $200 on Beats."
1,"Great headset, bass is good for music, excellent sound for sports talk radio."
1,I love my senso headphones....they stay charged for a long time too!!  Thanks!  The well written description helped me make my decision as well.  It told all the information that I personally was interested in and convinced me to purchase Senso Headphones...love them!!
1,"Gift for my son-in-law.  He's really happy with them, so far!"
0,"What a complete waste of money. Wouldn’t recommend these headphones to anyone. I probably used them 10 times in total and they’re already broken. They were never able to hold a charge for more than an hour or so, and then the other day they just stopped working altogether. What a frustrating waste of money."
1,This is my first pair of wireless headphones and I didn't know what to expect.  These are awesome!  The music is clear and loud.  I could not be happier with these and they come with a nice case.
1,100% good
1,"I've wanted some wireless headphones for a while and had this item wish-listed so when this went on sale for half price I jumped on it.<br /><br />Some highlights that the manufacturer claims:<br />-Water Resistant (IPX-7)<br />-Approx 8 hour life<br />-Clear audio with deep bass.<br />-Noise suppression technology.<br /><br />My experience:<br />-Water resistance worked well, I used this only a few times in wet environments including on a jetski for 2 hours and got soaked.<br />-I've used this for about 5-6 hours and no issues, can't say how long it actually lasts - I try to keep it charged to avoid disappointment.<br /><br />-Audio Quality/Noise Suppression: I have mixed feelings on this, I found that the bass was not deep and that whenever the Bluetooth activated there was slight hissing in the background. I've only tried two different devices but it seemed to be consistent.<br /><br />Connection: I've had a few issues with the device cutting in and out despite being charged. Not enough to be unusable but does occur occasionally, moving the phone from my pocket to my hand improves this. Maybe this is due to the orientation of my phone to the headphones as I have a metal case but I don't have this issue with other Bluetooth devices that work much farther away and still transmit audio.<br /><br />Conclusion tl/dr: As I mentioned I bought this on a fire sale promotion and paid just under $15. For that price I would definitely buy this item again. This product works and isn't bad on the audio quality, but as you might expect it does not deliver studio quality sound. It does live up to it's waterproof claim as I've been completely soaked on a jet-ski for a couple hours straiht and this continued working without a hiccup."
1,I really like these. They stay in place no matter what task I'm doing.
1,We love these headphones!  My husband and I both bought a pair and enjoy the freedom that Bluetooth gives you! Love that the earbuds come with 3 different size ear pieces and 2 charging cords!  The longer cord fits both android and iphone. The little case fits the small charger and my earbuds and is small enough to fit in my purse. I have to say they don't take long to charge and seem to last forever.  Great product for the price!
0,"When first bought these headphones, I loved them (good sound, easy to use, decently long charge).  My first set last almost a year, which, for the price seemed reasonable. However, subsequent purchases have lasted less long (the next two lasted six months each, and my most recent set lasted only a couple of months). The problem is that the earphones stop working, and/or die early (despite being recently charged) and/or the functions (pause, skip track, turn on/off) stop working.  I'm sad, as I really liked these, but the short life is becoming frustrating and I will be buying another brand."
1,"Good value, good sound, comfortable in the ear, microphone is okay. Endurance is okay too.<br /><br />After almost a year of either being in my ears or floating in my front pocket the left bud bit the big one. I think the wire was pulled out of its terminal cause I can wiggle the wire and get music in a sweet spot. As for how? They often got snagged on my keys while pulling them out of the pocket. I was less than tender with them. So all things considered I'd say they're worth their cost."
1,great stuff. Stays in your ears when running.
1,Great quality product for a reasonable cost.  Highly recommended.
1,"Definitely worth the money. This is my second pair of Bluetooth headphones and these are way better! Half volume is plenty loud enough, they don't fall out of my ears when running, and they are super comfortable! Highly recommend!"
0,They are extremely uncomfortable
1,"Fits well. The sound is pretty good for the price point, the bass can be a little distorted depending on your device. For the price I would say they are definitely a good buy.<br /><br />Edit: I accidently ran over my first pair. I immediately reordered a new pair because I was so pleased with the first pair"
1,These are great!  I've been looking at some<br />For over a year for at work and at the gym (no cords hanging down!).  These are so comfortable that I find myself using them all day even at home while doing chores.  Battery life is surprisingly long too!  Good score
1,I'm very please with my order of senso it was a good buy.
1,"So far, my husband loves his new headphones.  All others he's tried hurt his ears by the end of the day (he has them in a lot, he's a contractor) and these do not hurt at all.  He can hear really well over outside noise, too.<br />A happy customer!<br />Keep up the good work!"
1,"I am writing this review a little later as I have owned the Senso wireless headphones for over a year and just recently purchased a pair of Beats Wireless Headphones.  At the price, you can not beat these Senso headphones.  In fact, there are only 3 noticeable areas where Beats are slightly better:<br />1. The quality of the plastic that fits around the ear.  Only wish, it was stronger on the Senso<br />2. The quality of the sound and volume. I found Beats, for all their hype, are only slightly better<br />3. The ability to skip to the next song without using my device. Senso doesn't have it, Beats does<br /><br />I bought my Beats for $99 on Black Friday deal which is a decent savings (normally $199). I will say that at $27 for the Senso vs. the normal price of $199 for Beats ... SENSO wins that price comparison hands down.<br /><br />If you want a pair of good under $30 wireless headphones.  Buy the SENSO!  100% recommend."
1,"Fantastic sound, very comfy ear buds, Iforget  they're even there, sale price amazing, and all it comes with is such a great deal! We even liked the neat drawer pull box it comes in. Handy little circular pocket case to carry items keeping everything together is padded/protected well. I totally recommend these to anyone looking for any ear buds. They also function well for phone calls."
1,Works great no issues!
1,"I am so happy with my wireless headphones! They arrived on time, easy instructions, and they work like a charm. So happy and highly recommend."
1,"After trying many head sets this one seems to do the trick, I'm very pleased with the senso Bluetooth head set."
1,They sound good
1,They worked great until I shut them in my car door. I ordered a new set
0,"First, the good stuff.  It has nice sound for the price.  Bass is good for what it is and has quick connectivity.  It comes with great packaging and varying earbud sizes.<br /><br />Now for the not so good stuff.  The fit is awful.  The earbuds do not stay secure no matter which size earbuds I used.  The ear hooks do NOTHING.  The ear hooks sit too high and cannot be adjusted.  They provide no extra security and are more of a nuisance and annoyance.  I could not exercise or run in these.  They just don't stay fit on my ears.<br /><br />I returned them and will get something that will have a more secure fit to my ear.  Disappointed."
1,"Love these headphones, and they arrived in time. Excellent buying experience, absolutely recommend."
1,Sounds great!!
1,Would want to buy this product over and over again
0,Bought these for work because the are water resistant. The earbuds are heavy and uncomfortable if you wear glasses like myself. When you turn your head the cords stick to your neck pulling them off. The cover for the charging port does not seal after two days of use and the battery life is not impressive.
1,I like these earbuds but when I check the battery life my phone tells me there is 70% left and then they die shortly after so I have to make sure I recharge them at about 80%.  I probably get 3-4 hours to a charge.
0,"These seemed to be working fine. 2 months of owning them, maybe used them 20 times, and they don’t pair with anything anymore. Complete bummer and waste."
1,I really like Senso earphones. They were very easy to connect and I like the tact they came with a car charger. The charge last longer then a day which is really good. Great product.
1,Great product!! 1 charge lasts about 8-10 days using it about an hour a day. The sound is as good as the Bose and Beats I had previously. I highly recommend!!!
1,These sound amazing and hold the charge for a while!!! Easy to connect.
1,exactly as advertised...they are perfect
1,"I REALLY like these.  I am starting to run and need earbuds to stay in place for 45 minutes or so.  I've tried the iPhone earbuds and SkullCandy wireless earbuds.  They both get loose and I'm constantly having to readjust.  But not these.  The earpiece holds them steady and gives them plenty of support to stay in place.  It came with a cute little kit and 3 size options (S, M, L) to custom fit your ear.  And the wire band is very light and doesn't swing around like the SkullCandy ones do.  Recommend."
0,"I used these twice a week on my treadmill.  They worked great for 1-year, but have now stopped working."
0,Sounds ok. Fit is not great. I regret the purchase
1,So comfortable and easy to use. Perfect for running. They stayed in place during running and sounded great. Love them!!
1,"I've bough it for my daughter. Here is her feed back.<br />The overall quality of headphones was great until it was not. Literally, the sound quality, the price, battery life, and all the other factors making up the bluetooth headphones met all of my expectations. Unfortunately, the period of their functionality was not extended, only 6-8 months. The sound quality of the headphones was impressive, especially for their price range. They did pair well with my smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S7) with almost no troubles afterwards. The battery would last for about 3 days, approximately 6 hours of playing. The battery took about 1 hour or less to fully charge with no need for everyday charging (unless the headphones are used for more than 6 hours a day). The only concern is that at some point the left earphone turned off. This was one of those annoying cases where one of your headphones stops working until you put the cord in the right position. It would only work is the cord was at a certain position but then (about a week later) it stopped working all together. Shortly after, the right headphone turned off. (Note: the headphones were charged, recharged and left charging overnight). I would not recommend buying this product unless you want it to last for less than a year.<br />Update: replaced by seller since warranty is 1 year"
1,Really cheap and durable. The battery life is no joke and the sounds is good.
1,Very good.
1,The sound is good but I use mine too many hours a day and the battery dies too quickly
1,"One word: Amazing!  The sound, support and quick response. The quality of music coming out of the ear buds is incredible. Easy to put on and out you go!"
1,"I have small ear, but tried this one to use during workouts. Even using the small bud, I had to keep adjusting it every 3-5 minutes, as if it gets loose the sound get too low (on top of the outside noise). I'll return to the over the ear headphone, I preffer to sweat on the pad to have to ajust this thing that often."
1,"I really like these ear buds.  Nice fit. Pairs easily.  Comfortable to wear. The seller is great to work with as well. I've bought other things with them.  Never an issue on incorrect items ordered.  Items show on time, as advertised."
1,"I'm impressed with the headphones.  Apple's earbuds never stay in my ears and other in-ear Bluetooth headphones are hit and miss.  I have one ear most fit great.  The other ear must be a little different shape—it never matters what adapter tip I use, I have trouble with in-ear headphones.  These have the over-the-ear loop.  The loops are comfortable because they're flexible, but they keep the headphones right where they belong.  A perfect win for me.  I have about 6 hours logged on the headphones so far, and they remain paired consistently without issue (better than others I've used in the past).<br /><br />I haven't used them to make a call yet, but they are excellent for music and audiobooks."
1,No stupid long cable hanging in the way. Great sound cancelling. I can't hear anything but my tunes!!!
1,"Good quality, comfortable and decent price."
0,"I have small ear canals, so it's tough finding ear buds to fit. Even with the smallest tip, these still did not fit comfortably.  During the colder months I run with a hat or warm headband, but that is a problem because the hat/headband would push on the headphone itself and keep pausing and starting. Then without a headband/hat, every time I turned my head, the signal would cut in and out; I had to keep my head perfectly still in order for it to not do that. The final complaint is that I would always get wind/air noise when running--so bad that it was super distracting and overpowered the music. I received these as a gift so I tried to like these, but after a month of very frustrating runs, they will go in the trash."
1,"I have only had them for a week, but so far so good.  Not sure why is see so many bluetooth headsets on amazon that look exactly the same with different names, seems a little sketchy."
1,"I like it. It lasts much longer than my other, more expensive bluetooth headphones and has better base."
1,"I never do product reviews but felt i needed to with this, the headset worked great for about a month or two but i noticed the red charge light staying on after i disconnect from the charger and the headset is off.  I called customer support and the answered straight away, no hold time.  They had me reset them with no success.  I gave them the order number and they shipped a new pair immediately.  A++++++ for customer support at this company."
1,I've had these headphones for literally 5 years and they are STILL my go to pair! They have never broken and still look and work great.  At such a low price I just bought another one to have as a travel pair! Love them.
1,"Loving the product, this has more bass than my much larger Sony headsets! Crazy!"
1,"I hardly ever leave reviews but these headphones are awesome. They're reasonably priced and I'm very impressed by the quality. Plus it comes with a case which is convenient. Haven't been able to test the battery life, but as far as sound goes, they sound great. Great value and I'd definitely recommend to friends."
1,"Quality sound, great price, user friendly."
1,"Low battery life, and for myself the ear hooks don't hold that great, but they sound good"
1,"Like them, but they're not the best for talking on the phone. Sometimes fuzzy and the other person can't hear you."
1,"5 stars means perfection - a cut above the rest . My only issue was that my phone's bluetooth connection flaked out (my fault) and the headset would no longer connect  to the phone.  After a few minutes of self-discovery that I didn't know what I was doing, I went to the owners manual but the print is pretty small and I could not read it.  However, Senso has a free manual on the internet and within minutes the problem was fixed.  The packaging  included 3 additional sets of rubber nubs to ensure a secure fit with some  noise reducing capabilities.  The fit is perfect. I am a long distance runner and have not experienced and discomfort from having them on for hours at a time. Hope this helps"
1,I tried all 4 pairs of plugs and all were uncomfortable.
1,"Set your expectations this is a very good product, but not great. Good quality sound but not great. Very easy to connect via bluetooth. Wonderful fit for activity. Nice lightweight, easy to charge. High quality cables, chargers case and components. Hopefully they will last but on first blush I am very happy with these very comfortable wireless headphones."
1,Very nice design. They are comfortable to wear and sound great
0,Everything was fine until they stopped working after 3 months of normal use. Very disappointing.
1,This is my second set of these headphones. The first pair last for several years. Good purchase.
1,I really like the earbuds from SENSO. Easy to set up Bluetooth and work great streaming. Recommend to anyone.
1,"These were a gift, so I can’t review the headphones, but I can say the company goes above & beyond  expectations. Their desire to help is very refreshing!"
1,"Noise cancelling, great bass, and easy to set up and use, is there anything else required for Bluetooth headphone? A resounding NO!!! Awesome sound, comfortable to wear the whole day, and I can shut the world out if I want so I can focus on my work. I love SENSO's Bluetooth headphones. I will be getting an additional pair to leave at work while I groove on the original pair at home. LOVE 'EM!!!"
1,"I do have to say, Senso has great customer service.  They were quick to reach out to ask about any concerns.  The headphones have great sound to them if used while in normal activity.  However, my biggest complaint comes when running.  While running the headphones seem to pull in wind noise more than any headphone I've used in the past.  I tried multiple ear pieces and made sure that the earpiece was snug in my ear, but it was still an issue.  However, the sound is top notch otherwise and the headphones stay in my ear better than ones tried in the past."
1,For the price this headphones are awesome; the quality of the sound is very good; not Bose sound but excellent for the price. Highly recommended!!
1,"Although I don't particularly like the bulky side pieces on the headphones, they are comfortable, fit my ears comfortably, and have incredible sound. I also like that the voice sounds like a grumpy old lady. Can't wait to put these to the test in the gym."
1,"Great clarity, easy to use, and comfortable.  Comes with a whole host of different ear bud covers.  I see no reason why people would pay more than 3 times as much for the apple head phones."
1,Adequate for audio books and use with your cell phone.  Easy to pair and simple to use.
1,My daughter is happy with them
1,These are so light weight and the sound is awesome!
0,"Connection is good if the battery is 100% And your phone isn't in the other side of the bench. The other the ear piece is floppy and flilexible and does not help keep the ear piece on. Sound quality is pretty good though.  I haven't tossed them out, but I am in the market to replace them after 2 weeks. Decent for the price, but would not buy again."
0,"I used this product for about 2 months before they stopped powering on. I contacted customer service to report the malfunction, and received a prompt reply from a rep named Amelia. That is the last time I heard from her (or anyone else). I emailed Amelia telling her the troubleshooting steps she sent me did not solve the issue (performing a factory reset), and haven't heard back since. I've tried to contact her 3 times since then.<br /><br />Also, when I was performing said troubleshooting steps, the wire connecting the two earbuds snapped in half. With the plethora of options out there today for budget bluetooth headphones, stay away from Senso. In my experience, they're the worst quality of the half-dozen or so pairs that I've owned over the years. I'd expect to be ghosted while using a dating app, but definitely not while trying to resolve a customer service inquiry."
0,"I run 3-4 times per week and these headphones worked great but, unfortunately, after just 15 months (I purchased them in May 2017) they no longer work.  That's unacceptable after paying almost $40."
1,"I like, but anatomically didn't get my expectation."
1,LOVE THEM and the sound is amazing
1,They work great only downside I see is they recommend that they should not be left charging all the time when not in use.
1,Ok
1,The product works good and I love it!
0,Music sounds really good with this. But I doubt it's sweat-proof. Used this 3x/week for running on the treadmill. Died and was unrevivable after 3 months.
0,Since i bought these i have only used them maybe.. three times. Last week i did a full charge and the next morning i could not turn them on. All i kept getting is a red/blue flashing light.<br />LOVE the sound quality!! I prefer these over my Bose for more definition.<br />Not sure what to do with them...?
1,The hoops for over the ear are HUGE and kind of awkward to wear but they’re great headphones. They have great sounds and the battery life lasts a while. All the accessories that come with it is also a great deal and makes it worth the money. Overall a very good purchase.
1,"Use them for working out and phone conversations. They have disconnected a couple of times, but then reconnected. Also a couple of times connection was poor and breaking up."
1,It's only been a week. But so far they are awesome.
1,Ok
0,"Only good for gym workouts. If you are using them for anything else that might have any type of wind resistance such as biking, running, etc. they actually amplify the sound of the wind (probably due to their shape). You actually hear more noise from the wind than from the headphones. I bought them to use when I go biking and the gym but unfortunately I will only be using the at the gym."
0,Sounds quality is poor
1,These are great! Good sound easy to use!
1,Great
1,"Works well, just wish there was a pause button."
1,Needed to upgrade my workout headphones and read the reviews for this pair and can attest they live up to the hype. Definitely a great value for the price.
1,Unbelievable sound quality.
1,"&#34;The shipper was great and accurate. It connects very fast to iphone and ipad. Sounds great with strong bass with the proper size buds. The battery lasts most of the day at least 6 hours, I recommend this item and 5 stars! Very fast shipping as well.&#34;"
1,"Easy to set up, easy to use.  Adjustable hooks keep. buds comfortably in ears.  Handy tough carrying case."
1,It has been working well thus far. I really liked the additional things it came with like the clip and the phone magnet. The sound quality is decent and when I'm in the gym it's fine.
0,"Save your money, bought it 4 months ago and it doesn't work!"
1,"Big fan of the headphones for the price. I actually loved them soo much i got a second pair. I use one in the office when i want to zone people out. I have a home pair that I use on runs, working out, jumping rope. They are fantastic. Pros: Battery life is about 8hrs, $17!, easy to connect, show battery on my phone. Con/Neutral: The band that goes around your ear is a bit too bendy. This is not necessarily a bad thing,  but i wish it was a little stiffer. I would definitely recommend these."
1,"Amazing sound!!! Super sturdy. Way better than my Beats. Comes with a little carrying case, vent mount, as well as your typical accessories (charging cable, different sized ear thingies.<br /><br />Only CON: these have a strong smell. It smells like hot melted rubber...or tar....either way it’s not pleasant. It’s not strong enough to prevent you from using them, but it’s definitely noticeable."
1,These are great! I bought a pair to use at the gym. Sometimes I'm lazy and I want to do cardio on the treadmill for an hour. Other times I like to get into beast mode and lift weights. These are quite liberating regardless of exercise I'm doing. I just set my phone down next to my water bottle and focus on my workout. The only down side is the red one is about $10 cheaper than the black or grey ones. I HATE red. I just wish I wasn't cheap. Maybe when these die I'll invest the extra $10 bucks for a better color. Definetly great quality sound.
0,They hurt my ears.<br />Also the cable in the back irritates my neck.
1,I am so pleased with the Senso headphones. The sound quality is excellent!
1,Excellent headphones. They work perfectly with my iPad
1,"My primary use for these headphones is for meetings using Skype for Business. I've had these headphones for a week now and have used them for over 15 hours of meetings in that time, paired with my laptop. The most important thing for me was whether my audio was good enough according to the other persons on our group calls, and they agreed that the sound coming through was very clear. I also could hear very well, so I am pleased with the end result and the quality overall.<br /><br />Pairing with the iPhone was a snap; the Kindle Fire HDX was not as cooperative, but eventually it paired well and the sound is very good. My Windows 10 laptop is a bit more challenging to pair and manage, BUT that's not the fault of the headphones, it's just a bit tricky to figure out which setting controls the levels for my audio. Once I found that among the Windows settings, it was fine. As soon as I turn on the headphones, The ActiveBuds connect promptly to the laptop.<br /><br />As noted by another reviewer, the placement of the On/Off button is a little awkward; you do feel like you're pushing the right earbud further into your ear canal. But with a lighter touch and a slightly different angle, you can power on and off without difficulty. I found the volume up/down tricky because you press the front of the toggle switch to turn it down rather than the back end. But both of these are minor, and once you get the hang of it, they're not an issue.<br /><br />I have watched and listened to TV and movies on my Kindle and my iPhone, and the overall sound quality is quite good. I'm not listening to music with a great bass beat, so I can't comment on that, but I am an audiophile. For the price and ease of use, these headphones are everything I need. When I want to listen to classical music, I put on my big headphones anyway. These SENSO headphones fit neatly in my purse, and I'm very pleased with them."
1,"Great headphones. I've worn them to the gym three times now and they seem very durable. Audio quality is good too so that's a plus. Will update as time goes on, but for now these headphones are great!"
1,"Love that they have the 8 hour battery life. I bought these for my boyfriend for Christmas who is constantly listening to podcasts while at work, and thought he'd like the wireless aspect. I ended up needing a white elephant gift for my office party so I wrapped them up for that instead and they turned out to be the most desired gift! So, I bought another pair for my boyfriend and also a pair for my friend's boyfriend. Hopefully they hold up but for the price, you can't beat them."
1,A good deal. The product is wonderful.
1,Very light.  I got these for running and they are perfect!
1,"I really like these headphone. They are easy to use. As I recall, they had over 40k reviews. That makes me think they have been around awhile. I am going to keep my eye on this manufacturer to see if they have a newer version that is lighter and has a more flexible cord."
1,"It worked fine for a while until it stopped charging and when I tried to put the charger in one time, it broke in half, but I was able to put it back together. Still no luck charging though. Could be a problem with my unit only."
1,"I got the equivalent Senso earbuds about a year ago and liked those. Since the battery life was getting shorter, I recently bought a competing product at Best Buy. The fit was poor, the controls were clumsy and operation unreliable. I kicked myself and again bought new Senso earbuds, this time with Bluetooth 5.0. They work fine, just like the first pair. Let's see if the battery life is better this time."
1,Great Sound !!
1,"I really loved these headphones, but they have stopped working. They only worked for about 8 months before they gave out. For some reason they won't turn on..."
1,I love them! The sound is fantastic and they stay on. I do interval training so I move a lot and I was always adjusting my head phones. Also the controls are so easy. My last pair was jaybird which is twice the price and these are so much better! I also go my friend to by a pair he has jaybirds and likes these better. :)
1,I enjoy them so far. Good customer service and warranty.
1,"These ear buds have lasted the longest of ant I've had thus far with great battery life and the sound is great. The only thing I would ask for is, memory wireless."
1,"Meh...They don't properly fit on my ears, there's a gap at the top of my ears.<br /><br />And for the music quality... it feels like the sound is coming from the back of my head. I don't know how to explain it, but you know the &#34;like you're at the concert&#34;, rich sound feeling you get with good headphones? Yeah that's missing.. The sound depth is missing. Feels like it's coming from a distance.<br /><br />Also the bass is soooo freaking loud, and I'm someone who usually turns up the bass few bars when I listen to music, that I turn it allll the wayy downn!! It's insanely high for me!<br /><br />I should've returned them when I got them and buy a different brand. I thought it's just me, but should've followed my intuition because I've been feeling this way since I first tried them on. I'm sensitive about good quality music but didn't wanna spend a lot of money.<br /><br />But other than my above problems, it has been working fine. Oh also, no sound blocking if that's what you're looking for."
0,"They are not worth it even t the lower price. Many issues, but mostly bad Bluetooth and after only 6 month the will NOT turn or charge. Cheep JUNK !!!"
1,I've been looking for the perfect headphone earbuds with hooks on them....for skateboarding and working out at the gym. These are perfect. Excellent volume and clarity....strong durability!
1,Great sound and ease of use
1,"You get what you pay for. Not perfect.  Sound is excellent, as well as range. Will go out if I get ~25ft away from device. I'm in Oklahoma right now. As far as wind goes, if it's just more than breezy and you're head-first into the wind, it's so loud that it will drown out the music. If you're in a phone call, same issue, and the other person can hear it. Wind hitting the side of your face is much less disruptive. They're a little large, so they barely hold onto my ears and can rotate a little. You can't let the buds suction into your ear or you will hear every foot step. So sometimes I find I have to tug the cord a little when my sweat makes it slide in. I like that there's extra buds and a charge cord. I have long, heavy hair so my pony tail will tug at the cord behind my neck and can pull on the buds."
1,"Excellent...using primarily when walking...sound is great,,.my best pair yet!"
1,Great sound and so light.  LOVE these!
1,"Great sound quality, long lasting battery, awesome product, will definitely recommend anyone who wants to purchase a pair, go for it,  you won't regret it."
0,"These headphones worked pretty well, but within a couple weeks of use, I was getting ringing in my ears (tinnitus). My friend is an Ear Nose Throat doctor — apparently this comes from damage due to cheap noise cancellation. I stopped using them and the ringing went away, tried them again and it returned. I do not listen to loud audio. I believe this was from the noise cancellation which can do serious damage without sounding loud at all. I strongly recommend avoiding this product!"
0,"I had an older pair of these that lasted more than. A year. The wire started fraying by the ear piece, so I ordered a new pair. They worked fine until they died shortly after the return window expired. They are cheap so I ordered a new pair. The “your headphones are on” would blow you away with the volume, but despite turning them all the way up with my phone volume maxed out, they were not loud enough. With a fan on in my garage, I could not hear my audio book while rowing. These are being returned. I learned my lesson and have purchased some Jabras on Prime Day."
1,"Lightweight, easy and quick to connect, comfortable in the ear. It even allows for changing the track by long-pressing the volume buttons. Just what I needed."
1,"After having a pair of Powerbeats2 for under a year and watching them slowly fall apart, I told myself I would NEVER spend that much money for headphones again. I just opened the box and paired it for the first time. I don't know what the complaints on sound are because they are loud. They fit well in the ear and come with a traveling case. I would reccomened these headphones to anyone. You can buy 4 pairs and still have $20 left vs buying Powerbeats."
1,"For around $20 the sound quality and noise cancellation is pretty good and as long as you don’t overcharge the headphones, they’ll last a good while, but don’t expect it to work the day after if you used it all day. Here are the problems:<br /><br />1. Has an annoying volume level glitch where it doesn’t line up with whatever the volume says it’s at.<br />2. Makes an annoying ass “beep” when the volume is brought to 0% or when you use Siri.<br />3. Has a super high volume sensitivity, unnecessarily loud at lower volume levels.<br /><br />Other than these major problems, some minor ones can be:<br /><br />1. Inside of the ear can hurt after wearing it for awhile.<br />2. Can have trouble with sizing with ear cups.<br />3. Wire tie included easily comes off."
0,Big and bulky. Look ridiculous. No noise cancellation. No volume controls. The Anker Sound Buds Slim are a whole lot better.
1,"Good headphones at a good price. They are comfortable, have good sound and have been holding up well so far."
1,"These are by far the best Bluetooth headphones that I've experienced!<br />Others have had problems connecting and I would have to unpair and then pair again. No problems with these.<br />I watch Netflix while on the treadmill-the sound is quality and the volume has had to be lowered on occasion.<br />They take, maybe 20 minutes to recharge whereas others would take 3x the time.<br />VERY PLEASED AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"
1,"These headphones have great sound.  I was very impressed for the amount spent.  I did run into some problems when the left earpiece stopped working.  However, as these were under warranty, I contacted the company and I had a brand new pair in 3 days.  Couldn't be more impressed with the customer service."
1,I love these headphones. I have small ears and these fit just fine with great sound.
1,"These wireless headphones are exactly what I was looking for! They were really easy to connect via bluetooth to my phone and the sound quality is amazing... as in you actually feel the bass. Best value ever, so happy I bought this, would definitely recommend you purchase this if you're in the market for a great quality wireless headphones set for the gym or wherever."
1,I bought these a little over two years ago and I love them. I use them at the gym every day and the sound quality is great. They’re comfortable and cancel out the noise around me.
1,"Great sound, easy connect-ability, good range, great value for your money, comfortable - however, it says 8 hours battery life...I don't think that's true. I don't use it for that long for the battery is drained and it powers off. Anyway, overall I am happy with the quality for the price! Oh and all those other accessories are nice but kind of useless - the iphone charger (?) isn't compatible with my phone (iphone 6s)"
1,Love these. The only thing I don't like is that you can't change the song from the headphones.
1,I saw the reviews on this headphones and I just had to try them. For the price I couldn't go wrong. I was so happy with the packaging and the little container it came with. The sound quality is really good. I forget to charge them and they last pretty much the whole day while I am at work. A great feature is that I can connect both my phone and computer at the same time. Also when you take a phone call you can hear on both ears. I would definitely purchase these again.
1,Bought this for my dad and he loved it. Thank you!!
1,Works as expected with very good sound quality.
1,S-255s used to have a wire inside the silicone piece that fits around the ear so it was truly adjustable - but the 2 pairs I have ordered no longer have this feature - shame because it was very helpful
1,Went through 3 different earbuds. When I work out these don't fall out. Sound is great. Distance is fine. Great price<br />4 jan..Ordered another for my father in law. One ear bud came broken. Sent it back for exchange. New ones came 2 days later. Well worth the money for theses ear buds.
0,"I liked the feel and the sound of these headphones. Unfortunately the quality is lacking- left earbud connection began to cut out and eventually totally quit on me within the warranty period. I reached out to the mfg to get a replace/repair, got a generic troubleshooting email, didn’t work, and never heard back on my follow up. Will not be buying Senso again."
1,After getting the first charge works great and last like the stated good sounds even in loud environments and I use at work constantly.
1,great headphones
1,THE ONLY COMPLAINT IS THAT IT WAKES MY WIFE UP IN AFTER SIX HOURS BY ANNOUNCING THAT IT IS POWERING OFF.  I WISH IT WOULD LAST UP TO 8 HOURS.  IT LINKS WELL WITH THE TRANSMITTER AND SOUNDS GREAT.  SHE SAYS THAT SHE CAN STILL HEAR ME SNORING.  IF YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS LET ME KNOW.  THANKS.
1,Love them
1,Bought these for my daughter. She loves them.
1,Wish the sound was louder and had more base.
1,Arrived in nice box with a case to store them in. Set it up last night and all good. I listened to some music and the paired it to my Amazon tablet to watch some video ad it worked great. What else can you ask for?
1,"Rated a 4 high because of value being high. Better sound quality would make it a 5 at this price level. I’ve owned 3 pairs of beats. 2/3 broke. Both sound adjustable piece broke on beats and one completely stopped working. And the last one barely holds a charge. At the price of the senso it’s no big deal to buy a couple pairs a year, but hope I don’t have to"
0,"I just got my earphones today (free one day delivery) and I have to say that I'm loving it at the moment. I'm not really the type who gets annoyed when the bass doesn't sound perfect so I can't really tell if it's good in that aspect. Although I can say that these ,by far, are the best earphones that I've bought since idk, birth maybe. Works great with music, except when you're in call.<br /><br />UPDATE!!!!<br />Got this product yesterday. The right earpiece (one with controls) already started heating up and giving feedbacks and I haven't even used this product for more than 5 hrs yet."
0,"It is perfect for biking. I've connected it to all my bluetooth devices, no sweat. Love the design! It looks really good in reality so no surprise cheap version when you get it.<br /><br />Update 2017-01-06: I've had it for 4 months and the battery is no longer recharging."
1,High quality for the price awesome headphones
1,Works well. Battery life is good. Sound quality surprisingly good with rich bass.lowest volume level is quite loud indoors in quiet environment.
1,"Bought this pair of headphones to use while running.  First set came in an had some issues with calibration but customer service was excellent and they sent a replacement set within a week.  The replacement works great, stays connected and has great sound for my use.  I have used Sennheiser and Beats units and these are definitely comparable and a great value at the price point."
0,"After only two months of use, the piece that inserts into your ear pulled out leaving the wires exposed and the earpiece dangling.  Not able to use again, and not able to return.  They were comfortable to wear when they were in one piece."
0,Signal get's interrupted when I use it with Iphone inside my Flipbelt.
0,Loses connection with phone and also loses the sound in the speakers.
1,Husband loves it!
1,I bought this for my 16 year-old grandson. He's very pleased with it. His older brother listened to them and is probably going to order this for himself!
1,"for the price, i really like these.  I prefer boise, but not the price.  We received these in less than a week which was much appreciated."
1,Great product. Excellent service
1,"These are very comfortable, great sound quality, and easy to pair with my iPhone"
1,"The earphones work very well and the service was excellent. I could not locate the wire ties, emailed Sensi and they responded immediately. They instructed me what the ties  were for and where to locate them. I am very pleased with the company and earphones. I recommend buying them."
1,Sounds pretty good for the price!
0,"Works when it wants to. I have had these for a little over two months now and so far it's been okay. The first couple of weeks were great, no disconnectivity, clear sound, great battery, etc. all the positive stuff you read here. But after the break in period, man are they pretty annoying at times. They require a restart after turning them on, why? Well once they pair initially I know that if I start listening to music I will be stuck having it drop connection from my phone that is literally in my hand or sitting on my desk in front of me. Then it's nothing but &#34;connecting&#34; music &#34;connecting&#34; music &#34; connecting&#34;. I bought them to work out and don't want to use my higher quality headphones (Bowers & Wilkins and Seinnheisers) to go workout. Might just fork up more money just for better quality headphones.<br /><br />But they sound great when they do want to work! I'm just tired of it restarting."
1,Enjoy the sound quality and comfort of the ear buds..Will definitely recommend it to others. Nice for the price as well.
1,"Great music for the price. Absolutely love noise canceling as well. Only thing I wish I could change about this would be when it says &#34;battery low&#34;. I wish it would tell me &#34;battery low&#34; around 30-40 mins instead of 10 mins or less before the battery dies. Overall, great product. I usually charge my headphones when it reaches half battery life."
1,"I’ve only had them for a week, but I love the sound they produce. I had another pair, but they would cut out if they were more than 2 feet from my phone. With these I walked all around my house and it never stopped playing. Very good distance."
1,These work well with The MIRROR workout system.  Easy pairing through MIRROR App and comfortable if looking for a quiet workout solution!
1,"These headphones are very lightweight, and because they are wireless, I no longer have to worry about getting too far away from my phone or Kindle Fire. Pairing with them was super easy. Now I look forward to using my treadmill and free weights! The sound quality is amazing, and they fit closely enough to mute other sounds. The headphones also include other ear buds for a perfect fit, and a nice carrying case for everything, including charging cords. Great product!"
0,Battery life is shorter than advertised. The headset is not loud enough. Microphone is bad. You almost have t yell to be heard.
1,The headphones have good tone an fit ok.  I usually have a problem with earbuds fitting my ears properly but these seem to fit ok.  It seems to be good quality for a reasonable price.  I would recommend these headphones to others.
1,Awesome volume!  Beats my old s10hd by a mile.  For a guy that hates ear buds (they fall out and I have odd shaped canal in one ear from operations) these are best I've found for the money and they stay in my ears.  Let's see how they put up with workouts but have ipx7 rated whatever that means.  The extra lightning/micro USB (in addition to standard micro USB cable) and car charger is a nice extra. Also comes with a nice little case and extra ear plugs of different sizes.
1,"These headphones fit well even during workouts and the sound quality is excellent. They have outperformed the Beats they replaced.<br /><br />When I did experience a problem with them not powering up, their 24/7 customer service rectified the problem by sending me a replacement within 2 days. This was after calling on a Sunday."
1,I have bought these for 3 different people now and they all love them!
1,These are are great for the gym ! Stay in & great noise cancellation .
1,"Bought these the other day and I really like them. They are easy to set up, have a decent sound and come in a great case with a great lightning cord (which I consider to be an extra). The only small complaint t I have is that while outside there does appear to be some extra wind noise but with the volume up you don't notice to much. I have not had them long enough to comment on battery life but they came full charged and ready to go out of the box which was nice. The cord management system is a nice extra but the cord does seem to come lose easily so I am not sure how effective this will be. Assuming these last, I would definitely buy again."
1,I have had my senso headphones for at least a year now. They have great sound and stay in place even when I jump rope. They connect easily and the volume button is super easy access. Get these ones for sure! We have two pairs in our household.
1,Easy to use. Great sound!
1,The headphones were great. A lot better than the previous ones I bought which I returned. These were loud. All the buttons work with my pixel XL. The only problem is the music cuts out for a second when I put the phone in my pocket from holding them.
1,fast delivery and awesome product
0,"Definitely not the best headphones I have ordered on amazon, price was okay... I ordered because I needed headphones for my aunt as a Christmas present. She was not impressed. I regret not going with my usual brand. 2 stars because they are still functioning."
0,Stopped working a coupke days afo. Not mistreatred. Simply stopped working 5 mo ths later. Too manu similar complaints. Will not buy again. Don't trust them.
1,"I'm extremely particular about my music quality. I have several Bose systems (office, gym, buds) and a fairly complex DefTech system. To say that I'm surprised at the sound quality of these earbuds is a highly understated. Admittedly, I've only just paired them tonight, I will take them for a run tomorrow, which will be the true test. I've yet to find earbuds that stay put while running. I'll update after the run."
1,"These headphones are perfect for the gym and my daily life. They stay on perfectly during my workouts and I love that they are waterproof. Can't beat it for the price point either.<br /><br />I did have one issue with them, but their customer service was quick to make it right."
1,Works fine! Very easy to use.
1,I spent hundreds of dollars on Dr Dred earbuds and they can't compare to my new SENSO buds thank you for making a great product.
1,I've only had these headphones for a few weeks but I really like them so far. I haven't had any issues with usage or sound quality.
1,Love them.  Great value for the price. Love the silicone hooks that go over my ears. Accessories a plus.
0,Worked for about 2 months.
1,These work great.
0,"Welp.  Got these in July and now 5 months later, they won’t charge.  Got nothin’ for tomorrow morning’s run so that sucks.  Didn’t expect a Bose level quality but thus isn’t acceptable either."
0,"Below is my original review for a set I bought in April 2018.  The left bud started to get static after seven month, so I bought another pair in November 2018.  These are not the same!  The sound quality is the same.  However, the over the ear pieces are made of really flexible plastic.  So flexible that they constantly lose their shape and easily slide off my ears.  Also the door piece for charging is  made of some kind of really soft plastic so that it does not stay firmly shut.  I normally wear one ear piece in my right ear with wire going around the back of my neck because if I just hang this around my neck it will eventually slide off.  However, with the original pair, if there was any tugging against my clothing, the over the  earpiece was firm enough to stay around my ear.  With this ultra soft plastic, it loses it's shape and just slides off my ear, thereby in danger of falling off completely.  I'm constantly reshaping it to fit over my ears.  The original stable construction was not uncomfortable in any way and, like I said before, the over the ear pieces maintained their shape and kept the earpieces where they belong.  I don't like this new formulation and may have to reconsider another brand, when these wear out.  Maybe they changed the formula thinking that it would give people a more flexible option.  However, the originals were not uncomfortable, fit nicely over my ears and maintained their shape and these do not.  (See my pics).<br /><br />April 2018 Review:<br />I did not buy these for sports so I find them a little large looking and frankly ugly sticking out of my ears.  Yes, if I were running I would look quite fashionable and everyone would know that I was listening to music or some sort of exercise tapes.<br /><br />Anesthetics aside (they are not unobtrusive as noted), these have really good sound quality, even in noisy environments.  I bought these after buying a blue-tooth Nenrent single in-the-ear bud because I found the sound too low in background noise and I use my earphones to listen to language tapes and YouTube videos at any time, any place.  I don't use my phone for music.<br /><br />I did note, as another reviewer noted, that these capture wind noise, so users running or exercising outdoors may not like that issue.  This will not be a problem for me.  I have not yet tested distance with these.  My Nenrent, unlike some reviewers for that product have said, actually has a quite an impressive range.  I can wear that earbud at work without anyone noticing.  These are noticeable so so I don't keep them in at work, but I will test range at work and add to this review.<br /><br />These came boxed quite nicely with a carry-case.  The charger is different than others I've seen on YouTube for the same model and there was no phone charger with this  either as I've also noted in unboxing videos on YouTube.  However, this came with 3 different ear-molds, including  a sweat-proof pair, a device r to attach your phone to your car dash airvent, and a toggle to tighten the cord.  I thought the toggle was missing from my package.  Tried to call customer service, which line was busy the entire time.  So I emailed and got a response within 2 hours with an offer to ship any item missing but to double-check the contents.  I had thought they were earbuds, but they were there (2).  They also came with a stick-on cardholder.<br /><br />Now the test is to see how long they last.  Overall, I'm pleased with my purchase and would recommend them.  I think the controls are easy and the device material seems easy to clean.  The Bluetooth was a little touchy at first (but maybe it needed to complete its charge), but once paired, the earphones pair up immediately when you turn on the device.  The materials are soft and most people shouldn't have discomfort wearing them.  The device charged fully in about an hour on a computer.<br /><br />One star offfor the wind noise and inability to call customer service, but an A+ for customer service responding quickly to my email.  I do recommend this product.  Oh, and shipping was stellar.  They were shipped the same day as the order and were received the next day!"
1,"Pros - Easy to connect. Connection is great. I like the verbal confirmation given such as &#34;Powered on and connected&#34;. Nice carrying case.<br />Cons - When it runs out of battery you only have like 10 minutes left of charge. So you never know until the last second, so that is annoying."
1,I like these a lot my only concern is the part that goes around my ears are to big and it doesn't look like it can be adjusted. But other then that i really do like them as a whole
1,"Sound is great, but i still have the problem of hearing muffled noise every time the cord shuffles around"
1,I can walk around without hearing the cord. The sound is OK. I can talk to SIRI using voice commands. The ear buds work great for me. A nice inexpensive design that fits my needs perfectly.
0,"I had a pair of these that lasted 2 years, then they broke so I bought a pair of them again and I immediately noticed the quality went down and after one charge they wouldn't work at all."
1,Finally able to listen to music while I am commuting on public transportation.  Connection to my iPhone is consistent and of reasonable quality.  Good deal for &lt; $20.  Wish I could adjust the volume more finely.
1,I like these. They work great the only exception is walking on beach when its windy you can hear the wind when you turn your head.
1,Awesome headphones this is my 2nd pair i bought for my girlfriend i use them everyday to and from work and in the gym top quality sound love them thank you
1,Great headphones- at a good price. The only problem is that if I put them in my pocket they can turn on because the switch is on the side and works by pushing. That being said- I would buy them again. When compared to $250 headphones they win
1,I've had this pair since March 2018 and never a problem. I like the product and use it all the time. Just recently I had a problem with the headphones connecting to my phone. I noticed i was still under warranty and contacted costumer service via email. They replied right a way with instructions to trouble shoot. Unfortunately that did not do the trick and I let them know. They apologized and let me know that a new pair would be shipped right away since i was indeed under warranty.<br /><br />Great costumer service!
1,"I bought the JLab on a recommendation and was disappointed. Although they have perfect fit, the sound was less than desireable. I was made aware that these were over $100 off on Amazon. Based on the reviews, I bought them. They have amazing sound. They are so worth the $40."
1,Great product! Sound is clear whether it is a call or music!
0,Description says bluetooth connects up to 30 ft but the literature that comes with the headphones says bluetooth only connects to 3ft.
1,"Nice fitting, capable product for the money. Simple to use. The sounds quality is very &#34;bassy&#34; which limits the overall sound quality. So, ok, not the best sound."
1,Excellent product/
1,"Great price for Bluetooth headsets, but (as expected) when compared to my wired iPhone headphones the sound quality is significantly lacking. They serve their purpose for me as cheap gym headphones."
0,They work great but really hurt my ears! I've tried every set of tips that have came with them including the memory foam. None of them worked. For some reason the big black part past the rubber just digs into my ear so bad I can only wear comfortably for a half hour or so. Pretty disappointed
0,Phone has to less then 12&#34; from earpiece to pick up audio.  Instructions clearly states 10 meters is maximum length of reception.  Will return and never purchase audio equipment from Amazon.
1,Great product. So nice to get rid of the wires when jogging. They fit comfortably and very easy to pair with my smart phone.
1,"I just received these a day or two ago, so this may be premature....however I used them for the first time this evening when running, which is what I purchased them for. Can I say, they were magnificent? I know, I know they are just earbuds, but they are Bluetooth earbuds, AND they work! I was so very tired of running, and having to stop frequently to replace ear phones that dislodged every ten minutes or so. I tried multiple earbuds, and they always fell out. It was so frustrating. When I received an Iwatch as a gift, I had no choice, but to get the wireless buds and I could not be happier. It is too early to determine how long they will last, but right now...10 thumbs up! They come with a very cute little case, and are very easy to Bluetooth to my IPod, I watch and IPhone."
1,Great Sound !!
1,Very easy to use
1,"I'm glad to finally have wireless headphones so I can walk around talking on the phone without having to pick up my phone. However, you have to bring the phone into the same room with you or you will start to lose signal and get the weird alien voice the moment you step out. Also, the part that originally attached that goes into your ear is way too big and gave me sores on my ear before I switched to the smaller set.<br />Watch out and make sure to turn them off and bluetooth off when you're not using them because they have drained my phone battery till it dies if I forget."
1,sound great. A little bass heavy for me but sound great. Comes with all kinds of goodies. Would and will buy again.
1,"They arrived promptly. Have begun using them and they work great. Don't know how they compare to the expensive models, but I am very satisfied."
1,so far so good!
1,"It is really nice. I like to have an headphone for sport with light weight and secure on ear, and this one is exactly what I need. Thanks!"
1,I just got them about a week ago. So far so good!
0,Whenever I put my phone in my pocket it keeps cutting off and disconnecting its range is definitely not 50 feet
1,"Upon recieving my headphones, I unpacked them, and after a brief look at the instructions, was able to connect them to my iPhone without a problem.  They were charged and worked immediately with good quality sound.  I have used them several times now, enough to have charged them using the usb port on my laptop (which took less than an hour).  I have yet to use the car charger and cord, but expect it will work as well as the rest of the package.  So far I am very impressed with the quality of the product. It is obviously well designed and thoughtfully equipped with the accessories needed to make using the headphones an enjoyable experience.  They are definitely worth the money.  I would recommend Senso Bluetooth Headphones to a friend."
1,"These are awesome headphones.  Great sound and isolation.  The background noise disappears once audio begins playing through the headphones.  They are secure and comfortable.  The dual car charger that came with the package has only one minor drawback.  I cannot fit the phone charger connector through the opening for my otter box.  Replaced it with one from factory in the car, problem solved."
1,Works great!
1,"These headphones work perfectly, good sound for such a small device. Have just purchased a second set because I like them so much I wanted to have one for the gym and one at home."
1,No complaints so far 5 stars is result
1,Product is wonderful. It was a present for my husband and he was happier than ever. He tried them at the gym and the headphones worked perfectly. I might get one for myself too :-)
1,"just ran a training run of 11 miles with my new SENSO headphones . . . first time every running with music!<br />have to say, they were comfortable and really made a difference on my run . . . thank you, mike"
1,"Very good sound quality, but somewhat difficult to get into ears."
1,I use these for running and they function great and after selecting the right size ear piece they do not fall out during activities.
1,"Excellent buds. The regular size happened to fit me perfectly. I listen to a lot of music, especially classical, and this has the best acoustics I've heard yet in earbuds. Pairing easy and efficient, and I like the zippered round carrying case."
0,Not waterproof.  Limited range.
1,"Four stars for the product and five stars for the customer service. For some reason with normal wear and tear the headphone did not last longer than three months and quit working. Customer service was very responsive, really caring and refunded the money. I would highly recommend this seller because of the integrity they use in their business practice. The headphones was great when it was working. Was great to workout in the gym and for runs.  Sound quality was really good. I don’t know about the headphones but I would definitely do business with this seller because of the good customer service."
1,"I loved these! But, it has only been 10 months and they aren't working. The company was awesome in helping me troubleshoot and stand behind warranty."
0,They are already broken.... and they never stayed in my ear when I worked out or went jogging. I got these in March 2017... very disappointed!!!
1,"very comfortable, great sound. thx"
1,Great headphones. The warranty is great. My headphones encountered some issues and Senso sent me replacements! Overall would recommend. The only issue is that the ear loops dont fit my ears but thats not a huge con since ear looped headphones never fit my small ears
1,"Was not impressed with this product... Upon opening of box everything just felt really cheap, I know your thinking well look at the price What do you expect?<br /><br />But that being said I had a hard time maintaining a proper fit in my ear, which directly affects sound quality. Also the rubber piece that goes around your ear is basically worthless its not moldable is just kinda there. I guess it will hold them on your ear to keep them from falling but it will not assist with keeping them tight in your ear.<br /><br />Volume was no issue and when I got the fit just right, sound quality was ok but not great.<br /><br />Bottom line I would not recommend these... would not buy again...<br /><br />I ended up washing them and messing them up and could careless. Spent 15 more dollars then these and its a night and day difference. Hope this helps."
1,"Great battery life. I can easily use these for a full 8 hour work day and completely ignore my co-workers. Great for the gym too.  Bluetooth range is pretty good, like 30 ft."
1,Bought for daughter she is extremely happy with them
1,"I was going to buy a top brand headset until i saw the reviews for SENSO. I decided to take a chance.  At half the cost,  this headset is incredible!<br />Pros:<br />Great audio quality<br />Incredible bass (for ear buds)<br />Can be turned up very loud<br />Solid connectivity<br />Super simple to connect<br />Multiple ear bud sizes included.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The ear strap isn't perfectly comfortable on my ear.  (Not uncomfortable,  just not perfect)<br />The ear strap isn't adjustable or replaceable<br /><br />Overall,  I completely recommend these buds"
0,The charger doesn't work anymore and I've only had the product for a month.
1,Loved them but had to return because the right hook kept falling off
1,Great products!
1,"I love my new SENSO Headphones!!  I ordered another pair for my husband and friend.  The price is incredible too!!  Also, comes with a one-year warranty!!"
1,"I bought these for my fiance, and he loves them! We were both really impressed by the sound quality. They are working out really well so far, but I will update if he has any issues with them."
1,Pro: AMAZING for music!<br />Con: Not so great for talking.. WAY too much background noise. Definitely NOT noise canceling... more like noise engagement!
1,"I bought these headphones for working out and for training for a half marathon. The sound quality is great. I had been told that they are noise cancelling so to beware while running. I could still hear cars as they drove past, which was good. The only thing is that the ear piece sticks out so when I wore my headband for running in the cold, it pushed them further into my ear. Once I started running I didn't notice this. I am glad that the Bluetooth component and buttons are all on the earpiece though. I tried others that had it on the cord and this caused the earpiece to fall out. I also like that there's a voice that tells you when the device is on or connected, etc. These are great and I would definitely recommend!"
1,Amazing! The best wireless headphones I have bought yet.
1,Really great wirless headphones.  Comes with everything you need plus a a car charger for your phone.  Sound quality is better than expected and the strength of the connection is excellent.  Buy this one if you need wireless headphones to work out.
1,My son found these and he's very happy with them. For the money They can't be beat.
1,"Great sound quality, especially for the price! I was pleasantly surprised at the deep bass and clarity. These are also super comfortable. As someone with very small ear canals it's been a challenge finding earbuds that fit, are comfortable, and stay put during activity. I spent 30 minutes on an elliptical at the gym and my Sensos didn't shift and were so comfortable it was almost like not even wearing earbuds."
1,"can't say enough about these. Great bass and high strong sound. Great for working out. I bought a second pair. I've gone through many headphones, and these are the best I have had since. They are strongly built and comes with a little case so you can put them away and protect them. Comes with handy car charger. Can't ask for more for the price. I love music and im very picky about sound. These have the perfect sound for me."
1,incredible product!  highly recommended
0,I purchased these about a year ago.  They worked great.  Now they will not stay paired to my phone.  Very disappointing.
1,"Great Sound, No problems at all."
1,"These are great, and a great price!  So happy I tried out this brand (based on so many positive reviews).  Love that I can get on treadmill, listen to My Favorite Murder and not hang myself on ear bud wires!"
1,these are good. they fall outta my ears when jogging every now and then but that could just be my weird ears. good sound and handy button on the ear piece to answer calls or switch songs
1,So far Im really satisfied with the material and sound quality. Enjoying it every second.
1,Great headphones for the price I use them everyday in the gym
1,This was purchased as a gift the receiver says it works fine.  I would recommend someone trying it
0,"I have had these headphones for almost a month now so I feel like I wanted to give my review. I read the reviews on the headphones before I bought them, but the positive reviews out-weighed the negative so I gave them I try! They were absolutely fantastic for about a week, but then things started to breakdown. The first thing to go was the “skip song” control on the headphones. You are supposed to be able to hit the (+) volume button twice to skip to the next song and (-) volume to go back a song. This worked for the first week. After that week, the volume control still works, but the headphones wont skip songs anymore. The second thing to go was the headphone case. It’s a nice case, but the zipper broke about two weeks into owning the headphones. So now I partially zip the case to hold them in, but the zipper stills peals apart.<br /><br />The most frustrating thing is the Bluetooth. They initially connected fine and worked great, however, as the weeks progressed they had more and more trouble connecting. I started having to turn my Bluetooth off then back on, or disconnect the headphones then reconnect them through the settings in my phone. The most frustrating day was today. I literally just finished a run and had terrible connectivity throughout. I tried turning the headphone on and off, tried reconnecting them in settings, tried turning my phone Bluetooth on and off, and even restarted my phone. But they still had trouble connecting. The music coming through them sounded like a skipping CD for the first half of my run. I got so annoyed that I turned them for the second half.<br /><br />When I finally save up for a new pair of Bluetooth headphones I will not be purchasing these again."
1,These are very comfortable and the sound is excellent! Battery life is great too!
0,"Well I really liked this headset, had great sound and long battery...until I started having connection issues and distorted sound quality. Now they won't even pair. My guess just a faulty product, maybe covered under some warranty"
1,"Sound Great, Feel Good"
1,"Too big than its shown. Uncomfortable at all. Wanted to send back but im too lazy for it, just keeping maybe will give someone in the future, dont use at all after a day trying to use and didnt enjoy it."
1,They are easy to connect and very good sound quality.
1,I bought the 1st pair as a gift for my husband he liked them so much and was constantly saying he liked them I decided to get myself some too. No complaints from me.
1,"For the price, I'm satisfied with how well the quality is. I don't use it as much anymore ; however I love how well this product performed when I was using it. I definitely recommend it. 👌"
1,"Awesome! Love the clarity, range, and quality of sound. Really allows me to focus at the office or the gym and does a great jobs of noise cancellation without deafening me. Only drawback? Range isn’t as extensive as thought. But for $30 headphones these are a winner."
1,I had AirPods which are good but expensive. How can you beat th 36 price for the senso. Comfortable and sound great
1,I LOVE them.
1,Amazing product!
0,Not for swimming. Not waterproof. Search &#34;swimming&#34; through the reviews and you'll see that this product is clearly misrepresented.
1,"I was looking for an earnest that has longer battery life than my existing earset.  I need to wear it sometimes for phone calls, sometimes for online internet news or videos, so this is a good one.  The sound is good and clear.  Bluetooth pairing is quick and easy. Earbuds are comfortable to my ears.  Price is much cheaper than Beats.  I haven't tried it during workout yet, but I don't think I will have any issues using it during workout.  All in all, I think this is a good deal.  I haven't seen any drawbacks so I give it 5 stars."
1,Good Sound - Fit Well
1,Very happy with purchase
1,"The sound is fantastic,  and they STAY IN PLACE!  I run,  I weight lift... Stayed put! Love them. My husband just ordered a pair as well."
1,"Loves these headphones.  The sound was great, they didn't fall out of my ears, and they were comfortable. Now after a month they won't charge.  Very disappointed 😔"
1,Had it for a couple months. They’re fragile and mine broke pretty easily.
1,The headphones work great but I'm not sure they are really waterproof. After a few days of wearing them in the shower the down volume stopped working. I can't imagine what caused it besides the water
0,"I bought this head phone in August and tried it a couple of times, it worked fine. I didn't use again for a while. This week, I recharged its battery and used it again but it wouldn't sync with my iPhone. I tried it a few times but it refused to work. Unfortunately the refund period has ended a week ago. I am not happy about it."
0,"I received these as a gift last year. The sound, when it works is darned good for an inexpensive product. However, I have continuous problems with them cutting in and out. Right now I'm sitting stationary at my iMac, and they are cutting in and out. I've used them on bike rides, pairing them with my iPhone, and have the same problems. It's a shame, as they are comfortable. I would not recommend this product."
1,"These are great for the price.... BUT they sometime go in and out, only for a fraction of a second or so, but it's a bit annoying. Also, if you are riding a bike or running on a windy day, the wind can be REALLY loud with these. For the price they are a great buy and have a terrific battery life."
1,I was hesitant to purchase due to the design.  Was pleased to find that the band that goes around the ear is adjustable.
1,These headphones was recommended by a coworker and I couldn’t have ordered better ones. The Bluetooth is so efficient that I was in a meeting about 150yards away from my cellular device in a separate room and was still able to answer my call.
1,Great sound and stay on your head.
0,"If you look closely at some of the other reviews you'll see a trend of people commenting about the poor sound quality of these headphones. I unfortunately didn't listen to them because there so many other reviews that praise everything about these headphones!<br /><br />Here's the simple truth: These headphones, though an amazing &#34;value&#34;, simply do not measure up in the sound quality department, which I kind of feel is the most important one. The bass is way too amped up and overpowering (not in a good way), the mids are muffled and the overall clarity of sound is pretty poor.<br /><br />I've had these headphones for about six months, but the poor sound quality was immediately apparent. Yes, you can adjust the sound with your phones EQ to reduce the bass and it will improve things somewhat, but they still won't sound that good. Plus, anytime you listen to your phone in your car or on any other device, the sound will be all out of whack unless you go back into settings and readjust everything.<br /><br />This is like buying a smartphone that has long list of impressive features, but can't actually make a phone call. Yes, it still has value because of the many other features it provides, but the most essential one you bought it for is terrible. If you think about it, it just doesn't make sense!<br /><br />The other glaring problem is the annoying amount of whistling and wind noise I hear while jogging, even at a very slow pace on completely still days. This is something I've never experience with any other set of earbuds I've run with. The shape of these Sensos is not very streamlined with the sides of the headphones sticking out a good bit from your ears. I have noticed if I turn my head to the side while running, the wind noise is reduced quite a bit. However, running with your head turned to the side is a not a solution.<br /><br />Besides these two problems, these are really a great set of headphones. Good build quality, battery life, and value for the money.<br /><br />However, if you care at all about the quality of your sound experience while working out, then I would look elsewhere."
1,Ordered as a gift and was exactly as expected
1,Love these earbuds
1,"Love them! Fit my ears perfectly, sound is great, charge fast. Thanks for the extras."
1,Great quality and sound.  Once you get the fit right they sound amazing.  You cannot beat this for the price.  I've gone through countless pairs of headphones and so far these have out performed them all.  I will keep you posted for longer use but if what I'm experiencing now is indication of what's yet to come I'm 100% sold!
1,"By the way this is the second time I bought this product, because is awesome in range and sound quality."
1,"These ear buds are big, heavy and not comfortable for me. They sound great and function very well."
1,"Received packaged with lots of extras that I wasn't expecting,  I use when working out"
1,"Great headphones. Really enjoy them - charge quickly, great sound and always connect quickly.  Did have an issue after getting them but customer service could not have been better. Within five minutes of contacting them, the issue was resolved. Excellent customer service."
1,"These head phones are awesome! Very comfortable, great sound, and connect well to my phone. Very pleased."
1,"The audio is great, especially for the price that you are paying. I had to return them as I do with most earbuds. They are too big for my ears. The rubber part that wraps around the ear is far too large for my ear, so they don't stay in when I am doing anything besides sitting, even with the smaller squishy ear inserts."
1,Headphones are great.  Sound great. Use them for jogging and are lightweight and sound is excellent.  Would recommend to anyone.<br /> Product is great and shipping was very fast. Ordered it Saturday night and received it Monday. &#34;
0,"Tinny sounding, earpiece too clunky and the hook around ear too big."
1,excellent
1,The headphones supplied me with great sound for my music. Unfortunately the microphone is not that great. But for the price it is well worth the buy.
0,"I purchased two and initially loved.  However, one stopped working completely after 6 weeks of intermittent use-  Just past the return/exchange date.  The 2nd unit is still working.  Be cautious in your purchase consideration of this product."
1,Wow!!!! Seriously better than I expected. They work great for workouts and battery lasts long.  I hope they last a long time because so far so good.
1,"Amazing, the bass in these headphones blows my mind."
1,"Easy to pair, crisp sound, very happy with my first pair of wireless activbuds.."
1,Good sound good microphone. Not noise canceling. That is why I gave them 4 stars. Other than that its a good buy
1,"Amazing sound!  I bought these earphones when my other Bluetooth headphones gave out.  I'm so glad they did now because I found the Senso brand.  They are very comfortable and easy to pair with your phone.  I'm very happy with my purchase and I highly recommend buying them from Tekatron, a small business who cares if you’re happy with your purchase."
1,"I am extremely happy and shocked with the  headphones.  I thought for such a low price there has to be a reason. They are unbelievable, sound quality is fantastic. It does take a little getting used to the controls but after that they are gold. I am thinking of buying a second set,for back up."
1,"Impressive value for the money. Excellent sound quality, and good battery life (so far!) I have been wearing Shure 215 wired earbuds for years, and while these aren't quite as good as them they are good enough that I'm not saying to myself, &#34;Gee, I wish I had my Shures instead of these.&#34; I am also a pretty avid runner, and an audiophile...so I want good quality earbuds to stay put while I'm in motion. And that's where this would be a 5 star review, if Senso did two teeny tiny things to improve the product: 1) perhaps make the earfins a little more wide, to stay put behind the ears better, 2) while 4 tips are included (3 silicone of various sizes and 1 larger memory foam), include at least one more memory foam tip. In order for me to make these fit as comfortably as possible and not slide out of my ears, I actually needed to snag a set of smaller memory foam tips than the ones included from a different headset -- and, voila, perfect. As with any in-ear monitor, fit is crucial to make sure you're getting the full range of sound -- if the tip isn't snug against your ear canal, you'll lose all kinds of bass, and drums will start to sound like rice krispies. So I'd say Senso should make the extra effort to give customers as many options as they can to get the perfect fit right out the box, and toss in a few more tips. If that increases the cost by a buck or two, it's still (IMO) a terrific deal."
1,"UPDATE:  Senso immediately replaced the headphones per their one year warranty policy!<br /><br />I absolutely loved these headphones up until the point they stopped working.  I purchased them in April and they began shorting out in September.  If there is a one-year warranty, I'd love to know about it..."
1,These are simply terrific on  every level. Great sound quality. Easy to use. Intuitive controls. Have been touting them to my friends since they arrived on Monday. Excellent value. Nice job SENSO !
1,"These wireless ear buds work great, they are very light and stay charged for a long time with reasonable sound quality"
1,"Iv'e bought three of these headphones over the past year.  Not because they have broken, but rather I keep one at the office and one in my gym bag and the other at home.  Music is a huge part of my life and these have held up with no issues even though I use daily.  I usually have these in my ears for multiple hours a day so they are very comfortable round your ears and stay in place.  At the gym no issues, they don't fall out.<br /><br />Sound quality is great, especially when comparing to your Beats or Bose wireless headphones that cost more than double.  The music sounds just as good in my opinion.  If your hesitant about buying these because of the price don't be."
0,"2 weeks after, it stopped working for no reason. Won’t connect with my phone again. Kept blinking red/blue even after charging several times. Waste of money."
1,"I have been using it for the last three months extensively and must admit that it has been a pleasant surprise.<br />Pros:<br />1. sound quality - that's the number one reason I would buy it. The bass is deep (although required a chance to achieve it, see below) the mids are nice, and the highs are clear.<br />2. Quick charging and decent playback time<br />3. Consistent connect and disconnect to multiple devices<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. initially I noticed that the bass was not punchy enough, unlike what I read in the review, and that sound was leaking. One I changed the tips (I had to buy Comply Foam tips separately) the sound was WAYYY better, the fit was good and no movement in and out.<br />2. Bluetooth connection - sometimes patchy, especially when placing the phone in the left back pocket. I do not have this issue with other similar types of earbuds (Bose and Beats)<br />3. Comfort - after a lengthy use (I fly long hauls, a lot) the arched part is a bit rough on the ears, I wish it were smoother and less rigid.<br /><br />I guess that unless the sound was surprisingly nice, not just for this price, I would have given it fewer stars."
1,"Thoroughly impressed with this. I don't usually write reviews, because I'm usually not that impressed or things just have an intended use and it's practical, but this has got to be one of the best products for the money. Definitely great."
1,"I love these headphones! The sound is great, I'm very happy with their battery life, and the control buttons all being on one ear piece is so much better than being on the cord. They're worth the money."
1,"Love these. Ordered four pairs now, one a replacement for a set my kid broke. Great sound, range, and battery life. Comes with everything you need."
1,I bought it for my son he loves it .
1,I bought these for work but they get too much interference from everyday activities. Even walking outside with my phone in my pocket makes them cut out.
1,I gave 4 stars because in the beginning the headphones had an echo on the other end but now the echo is gone and they work great.
1,Great sound and fit.  Long lasting battery.  I'm very pleased.<br />Oh and it came with a car charger and cable.  I was really surprised and happy about it.  Cool!
1,"Good quality, nicer fit."
0,I thought this product would be great because I like to use my Ipod and hate the wire as it gets in the way. I am very unhappy with this product because the claim is their is a 30 feet range but it's more like a 1 foot range (pocket to headphones distance). If I walk 2 feet away it starts to cut out and at the 3 foot mark it shuts off. So don't waste your money on these as they are complete garbage!!!!!
1,"These are incredible for that price, but unfortunately they only last a few months. I've bought 4 pairs so far and two already bro on its own. First pair, the sound doesn't work in the right side. The other pair that broke, the main button stopped working. If not for breaking I would give it 5 stars for that price. You definitely get what you pay for..."
0,Bought 2 pair and continually had issues with pairing and connectivity.  Poor phone sound quality.  I used these when biking and they would often disconnect from my phone calls.  They stopped pairing with my device within a year.  Reported the issue to customer service and they offered me a 5%discount on my next purchase.  That's a WHOLE DOLLAR OFF!  Big of them.  Don't waste your money.
0,"I PURCHASED MY FIRST SET OF SENSO HEADPHONES IN 2018 AND OMG I WAS IN LOVE!!! THESE ARE NOT THE SAME QUALITY!!! I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THEY'RE LOSING MONEY ON ALL THE RETURNS THEY'RE GETTING?? PROBABLY COULD HAVE JUST NOT SLACKED ON QUALITY AND HAD A LOT MORE HAPPY RETURN CUSTOMERS WHO DO NOT RETURN THEIR ""NEW AND IMPROVED HEADPHONES""<br /><br />*****TLDR: DO NOT BUY!!! ****<br /><br />THEY RECENTLY QUIT WORKING AND CUSTOMER SERVICE TOLD ME THEY WOULD BE FIXED IF I FACTORY RESET THEM...WELL...IT DIDN'T WORK.<br /><br />SO I REORDERED THE SAME HEADPHONES, OR SO I THOUGHT... THESE ARE NOT THE SAME, THEY'RE SO CHEAP, AND THE EARHOOKS ARE NO LONGER ADJUSTABLE - SENSO SAYS, ""THEY DON'T MAKE THE ADJUSTABLE EARHOOKS ANYMORE BECAUSE THEIR CUSTOMERS PREFER THEM FLEXIBLE SO NOW THEY'RE JUST FLEXIBLE"". I ASKED IF THEY HAVE ANY HEADPHONE WITH FLEXIBLE EARHOOKS, THEY SAID NO.<br /><br />SO ALL OF THIS TO SAY, THE EAR HOOKS DON'T EVEN HOOK MY EAR, THEY'RE TOO BIG AND DO NOT CONFORM TO THE EAR.<br /><br />IF YOU ONCE LOVED SENSO AND EXPECT THE SAME QUALITY....STEER CLEAR!! I'M NOW ON THE HUNT FOR A PAIR OF HEADPHONES THAT JUST DON'T EXIST ANYMORE :("
1,"Update: Dropping my review from five to four stars after, having only had these a few months and not using them heavily over the last month+, I go to use them today and they are cutting out frequently. Tried restarting them twice, and there's been little to no noticeable improvement. I'm hoping this is not something permanent, as I really do like these headphones overall. I can't stand it when audio cuts in and out, especially when I'm trying to concentrate.<br /><br />I've only had them a few days, but I'm loving these headphones so far.<br /><br />They stay on through a sweaty workout without having to constantly be adjusted - a problem I had with my original set without the over the ear piece and non-silicon earbuds. The sound quality and background noise blockage are fantastic without having to turn everything up too loud.<br /><br />The amount you get for the price is really unbeatable as well. I appreciate that they come with a somewhat hard carrying case that allows me to pack them in my purse without too much fear of them getting damaged or accidentally turned on - which is a very real possibility.<br /><br />At this point I would definitely recommend these earbuds, especially if your work outs are a bit harder. I'll edit later if that changes for any reason!"
1,Have had the headphones for just a couple of days. I really like them!! It was easy to charge and easy to pair bluetooth-wise with my iphone. Sound is pretty good.<br />No issues as of yet. At this point I would easily recommend buying these if you are looking for a good set of wireless sport headphones.
1,Works great at a good price
0,"This product is not at all as it was described. The headphones are extremely heavy and do not stay on even when stand, let alone when you try to move at all. It also comes with two power cords, one that fits the product another that is a completely different outlet. I have an armband for my ipod and in order for the blue tooth to read the head phones, I need to keep the ipod at my neck or nigh. This was absolutely not worth the money and I do not recommend that anyone purchase it. The $10 headphones are a much better investment."
1,Product is as described. Follow up by the vendor was good and the focus on making a great product and marketing it well comes across strongly.
0,The keep cutting out on my phone when in use.  I will be returning.  Loved the fit!  Just keeps cutting in and out.
1,So far so good.  only had them a couple of days.  The battery life seems to be good.  The only thing that is slightly tough is the cord between the headphones is too lightweight and it doesn't lay down on my neck.
1,Good quality head phones. The only drawback is while riding a bike their is wind noise that sometimes interferes with the sound
1,I am still trying these out and so far I am confused. Confused as to why pay $80+ For other Bluetooth headphones. I have a another expensive pair and from a sound quality and fit perspective these are just as good but are so much cheaper. I go running with these and they do reduce outside noise so you have to take note of that. Otherwise I really like these. They are light and I barely notice they are there. Easy to sync and they have the same functionality as my plantronics but are actually more immersive and have a deeper base which may be a good or bad thing depending on what you use them for. Build quality is great. I will check back in another month or so.
0,"Sleek design but this product needs some work. I bought these for an upcoming 1/2 marathon and I was disappointed.<br />I ran with phone in my armband and connection was lousy. I spent the entire race trying to improve sound quality as it appeared shaky at best. For the comfortable design, it allows a lot of background noise in. I could constantly hear the wind blowing in ear piece. I ended up holing my phone in my hand the remainder of the race as this seemed to help audio quality. My co-worker has same pair and complains about same issues. I will not recommend or buy again. Wishing for a refund..."
1,"Awesome Headphones, sound quality is fantastic.  These are awesome for walking and running and being able to have a telephone conversation on the fly.  I would recommend these to anyone and everyone.  Thank you SENSO for such a great product at a great price."
1,Excellent.
1,"The look and sound quality of these headphones are quite nice. I was surprised with how loud and clear they were. Out of the box they are a little heavy on the lower frequencies which cause some distortion on the higher frequencies, but with some messing around with my phone's EQ I was able to get them to sound pretty solid. I used them to practice drumming and they canceled enough sound to where it was easy to hear the songs and hear the kit at the same time. Problem is though, after 2 charges the battery refuses to take another charge. I never let the battery die, and they are dead after owning them only a few days. The LED light stays on STEADY BLUE, showing the battery is fully charged but they will not turn on. This would be a 5 Star review if it wasn't for them breaking days after arrival.<br />EDIT: 8/24/<br />I spoke with customer service, the quick responses were a good relief. After some quick troubleshooting, the initial headphones still had some issues, that said they promptly are in the process of sending me a new pair. They were very understanding and they truly believe in their product, I hope what I got was just a fluke, personally I think so. Can't be perfect all the time, changing my review from 2 to 5 stars for customer service."
1,"Left my Beats wireless buds at the gym..wasn't expecting them to be turned in. Ran across these and deoided to give them a try. Hey for under $25 figure what do I have lose. Let's say I won't be ordering another set of Beats as they are not $150 better than these. I would say that the sound quality is about 80% of Beats, especially notice on vocals. But, good enough for my gym workout for sure. They also came with 3 extra tips and a cushiony water proof tip, 2 USB to charging cords and a 2 in lighter USB port. The excesories are worth what the headphones cost. So this is day one. I'll need to see how durable they are."
1,Good headphones except the power button is such that it turns on by itself when in the case
1,The best !! easy to pair !! and excellent sound !!!
1,My headset stopped working in one ear
1,"These thIngs are simply perfect.  Best sound quality I have ever experienced, and amazing battery life.  The accessories are generous!!  Will definitely stick with this brand going forward."
1,I've tried many many many different earbuds. I workout hard and sweat till I look like I litterly just got out of a shower and these earbuds don't move. Got 8.5 hours of continuous use before they died. Like any earbud they may take a few days to acclimate to your ears but I wore them driving my semi for 14 hours and only had to remove and rub my ears a few times. Just as good as the 200.00 Beats and volume is great.
1,"Good quality, bought them for my son who is very active and uses them quite a bit. Plus all the extra ear buds, cord and case, great buy! I also bought a pair for my wife too. Thinking of getting one for me as my last pair seems inferior to these."
1,Great packing and case...  Dropped bluetooth connection several times after the second use.  A bit clunky compared to other options... Good base but overall sound quality was mediocre...
1,"I was thinking about getting wireless headphones for a while since wired headphones are such a pain during workouts. However, the price of wireless was pretty steep. I randomly came across these on Amazon and decided to give them a try. What an excellent purchase. The value of these headphones, considering the price, is just unbearable. The sound quality is great and the build quality feels and looks good. They hold up well during workouts. Appreciate all the little extra things that they come with. Well done Senso."
1,"These earbuds sound great & pair with multiple devices. They also came with a nice case. Great value for the money. However, I do not like the buttons in the earpiece as it clicked too loud in my ear."
1,I use them at home a lot.  I also love using them while I play tennis. They stay in my ears the whole time.
1,"So far, so good.  Easy to use, work well, and are comfortable."
1,"I got these headphones about 4 months ago, they are still strong and amazing, they stay on even if I'm super sweaty.  At this point they are my backup headphones since I did purchase the new wireless beats and I don't think there's too much of a difference other than the sounds being a bit too high on these not too leveled but other than that fantastic!!"
0,"Just purchased, and now returning. I am constantly frustrated by the lack of affordable headphones for runners. For the last few years I've been using Plantronics Backbeat Fit - my last set finally died, so I decided to try a cheaper alternative. These flimsy things do not sit in the ear at all, despite coming with three size buds. The &#34;around the ear&#34; lugs are too flexible to offer any significant support. The chord needs to come out the back of the unit, not the bottom, otherwise the chord pulls on the ear piece. If you are not being active with these, they are probably fine, but they are not marketed as such, and thus a waste of money IMO."
1,"It does a good job, and a surprising amount of base.  I do get it cutting in and out from time to time, but other than that no issues."
0,"I'm giving them two stars because they did not fit me at all, although the sound quality was good. I am a female and thought I had pretty normal sized/even slightly large ears, but these do not stay on! The part that comes around the ear did nothing to hold it in place and comes up too high. If I wanted it to stay on, I had to use the smallest bud option and jam the earbud into my ear (and then the sound quality isn't good any more either and it's very uncomfortable). The part coming around your ear is more comfortable than other pairs I've tried, but that's probably because it barely touches my ear. I will be returning them."
1,Bought as a gift. The person really likes these for the gym or working out in the yard.
1,Work fine so far...<br />These have quit connecting to my iPhone. Only 4 months old
1,"The headphones have a great volume and the sounds with bass are heard perfectly. In addition, they have the possibility to change the music track with a single tap. They feel comfortable and light when using them. Also, it is only necessary to answer the incoming call from your cell phone to be able to speak for the headsets without having to do anything else. They are better than the Beats I had previously. I bought an extra pair for a gift and they loved it."
1,These Bluetooth headphones are just what I wanted. They have good sound and are very comfortable. The price is great. ONE TIP: I tried several times to pair the headphones to my LG smartphone. Per the instructions they were within three feet of each other. I then moved the items within one foot of each other and they paired on the first try.
1,Great product at a great price. I'm happy to have purchased them.
1,Really GREAT sound. Rich deep base and very comfortable to wear
0,Shortly after using these earbuds the right ear bud fell apart. I was able to put it back on and use them but after two months of this the right ear bud no longer transmits audio. Total Junk dont waste your time and money
1,Excellent quality fit and sound.  Buds stay in place.  Great battery life.  Disposable buds not tried.
1,I personally have 3. Two at work one at home. I'm a mechanic andi can use them all day no problem. They hold up and hold on to your head with the adjustable ear grips. I even bought a pair for a coworker. Love and highly recommend these!!!!
0,I have bought this product numerous times over the course of two years. The product usually lasted 6 months until it fell apart but I tolerated it because the sound was so good for the price. Unfortunately that is no longer true. The newer earbuds have no bass compared to the older ones. I still have an older one (slightly falling apart but still functioning) went ahead and bought a new pair. And immediately I could tell a big difference in sound quality. I thought it was a fluke and bought another one. Nope the bass just sucks now the music sounds hollow without it. Definitely returning and no longer repurchasing.
1,"I absolutely love these things! I use them primarily in the gym and after 5 months, they are still holding up very well. I sweat like a mad man when I workout, and these have handled it like a champ. Even a couple of trips into the sauna didn't have an adverse affect on them. I haven't tested the claim of being waterproof, but surviving my sweaty workouts is more than good enough for me. The ear hook could fit a little better, but that just may be due to the shape of my ears. For the money I spent verses the usage I have gotten, I am beyond pleased with this product."
1,They work great and are lasting over the 8 hrs stated in the description!
1,"These are my first wireless bluetooth headphones. I expected to give up some sound quality for the convenience of being wireless from my music source, but it is exactly the opposite. The sound quality of these are amazing and even better than my wired buds that cost twice as much. After having them for only one day, I bought another pair for a family member. Highly recommended!"
1,Headphones work great with much greater BT range than I was expecting.  They are also very comfortable.
1,"I own Jaybird Bluebuds X2, but wanted a pair of bluetooth headphones for running. This pair had an over the ear fit and it has been great for training runs. The Bluebuds would fall out occasionally if I adjusted volume or paused music, the Senso headphones stay on great. I am also impressed with the sound quality of these headphones. Great value for the price!"
1,"I just received my headphones yesterday. What came in the box was way more than I was expecting. Not only did it come with the headphones, extra buds, and charging cable, it came with a separate USB to USB micro/Lightning cable, a two port car charger, and a decent clamshell case to hold everything but the car charger.<br /><br />The included buds were adequate. There was a separate pair that were exceptional. They are made from ear plug material and really mold to my canals.<br /><br />Audio seem to be really good. Not excellent, but I haven't run a ton of music through them yet, so I'm undecided. Totally worth the money though.<br /><br />I wore them to the gym last night. It was great not to accidentally yank my phone off them machine with my old wired headphones.<br /><br /> I'll update my review in a few months with my long term opinion. 9/10 so far for accessories and value."
1,Really appreciated the extras that came with the headphones!
1,I love this product because it fits in my ear really well and doesnt fall out. I tell people about them all the time. It also holds a charge for a while.
1,Earbuds work good. If anything buy it for the fancy charging cable and car adapter.
1,"The sound is amazing! Well worth the price. If you are even thinking of buying these earbuds, just do it.<br /><br />Nice sturdy case to boot!!"
1,Purchased in July of 2017. Loved it. 6 months later it just stopped working. Wouldn't power on. Battery was charged and they were well cared for. None of these are made to last. I guess you have to consider it a bi-yearly purchase.
0,"Horrible....POS....I just want a good pair of wireless headphones for my morning job....these did not make one run. The bluetooth constantly cut out from my connection with my iphone that was on my hip.  Also, the UBS plug does not fit, so no way these will be able to prevent sweat from entering the housing..future point of failure.<br /><br />Sent back."
1,"Look, I just bought these a couple of days ago, and have used them twice while jogging, so I can't speak towards how durable they are, but I agree with most reviewers, that these are good headphones for the money.  The sound quality is good, and I had no problems inserting the ear hooks, and they were comfortable, and stayed firmly seated into my ears while running.  The directions on how to setup and use them are good, and the headphones are pretty quick to charge (like an hour). You can use any USB charger or your computer USB port to charge. The BT Bluetooth feature paired easily with my Nano IPOD, and the sound quality was excellent in my opinion. Very happy customer."
1,"Extremely comfortable, sound good and they stay in place when working out."
0,earbuds don't stay in well.
1,ordered them few days back got it in 2 days. working good till now. only cons i found is microphone being on ear it would be better if its on cable near mouth. That would provide better recording quality but its not bad  to use for talking on phone.
0,"I bought SENSO Bluetooth headphones in October. Since the beginning, I started to have a problem connecting with my iPhone. The Bluetooth connection dropped often and you have to switch off and on your phone to rejoin.<br />The worst part is it stops working now. It is said in the description that it is sweat resistant, however, it stops working from the day when I sweat a lot. I knew it was wet, but then it stopped working. I do Not recommend anyone to buy this."
0,What is the deal with electronics manufacturers and lights?  It is totally unacceptable that these have a flashing light while in use.  I will be returning them.  FAIL!
1,"battery life and fit are the hold ups for me on this, though the sound quality is very good."
1,"You can connect to two devices at once. However, they will be chipping in and out so it's best to connect to one at a time. I was trying to connect to my phone and my laptop at the same time incase I got a call I could just answer. I just use one at a time and even when I'm connected to the phone alone, the connection is poor. The person on the other line always says I'm chipping in and out so I've just stopped using it for anything but listening.<br /><br />I just don't have to really deal with it getting tangled which is the main reason I got these. Also, be able to just get up and walk around without worrying about forgetting I have headphones in and my phone falling.<br /><br />It stays connected within a certain range and reconnects if you happen to step out of that range then come back.<br /><br />Tells you when the battery is low.<br /><br />Comes with a cute little case that comes in very very handy.<br /><br />I would give it a B. Not A+ but it does the job minus using it to take calls."
1,"I recieved a Pixel XL phone for Christmas, and it's awkward to have a headphone jack on top of the phone, so I set out to find good Bluetooth Headphone. After a decent amount of research and reading customer reviews I decided to try these Senso Bluetooth Headphones.... The price and reviews drew me in, and honestly at the Amazon Price, I wasn't expecting much. Opening the box, I was blown away by the amount of goodies that came with the headphones.... Two separate charging cables, a car charger, a high quality carrying case, and of course the headphones themselves.<br />The headphones are fairly lightweight, fit gently around my ears and play music well. The battery life is impressive, and overall they're very simple to use. About a year ago I got a pair of Samsung Level U Bluetooth Headphones but they came with a collar attached.... The collar always felt heavy and awkward.... These Senso headphones are the exact opposite.... I find that I forget that they're still on. The sound quality is very good."
1,"For my first pair of bluetooth wireless headphones, I don't have any complaints. They stay connected as well as connect easily once your phone's bluetooth is on. The volume is nice and clear and they stay in your ear unless you are beyond sweaty which may be TMI but it happens when you work out.<br /><br />BTW they come with a charger that has a head for both apple and android & it both looks really cool and charges fast. Definitely worth the money.<br /><br />I will say that it has been an adjustment getting used to the buttons and over ear piece, I constantly find myself touching my ear to make sure the over ear piece is in place and i end up pausing my music. But that is my personal struggle, nothing against the headphones them self."
1,"I'm impressed with the ease of use that these Bluetooth headphones provide. They arrive with easy to follow set up information and alternate earbud cover sizes. They appear to work well with my Apple Watch to listen to music while running and it was nice to not have wires attached! The only down side is the noise of rushing wind that is amplified if running. When the wind was blowing at me, I couldn't hear music over it."
1,they work great!!!
1,Loved the whole experience of my order with Amazon and love these amazing headphones!!  Way to go SENSO!  The lamp is a gift so still waiting to see how it works. Thanks Amazon!
1,"Feels good and sounds good, very happy with my purchase.  Works fine with Windows 10.  not working good with Windows 7.  does anyone have any drivers for windows 7 or have a fix?"
1,They arrived as described & on time. They were a gift though so I personally don’t know how they worked but I’ve heard no complaints
0,"These are terrible headphones. The bass is outrageously overpowering. They had claimed on prime day to sell for over 100 dollars, however this was a classic case of trying to make the consumer think we were getting a great deal when really the ear buds cost 2 bucks to make. The ear clips do nothing, they float above your ear and have no structure in them to mold them around your ears. Listening to these bad boys pretty much kid like listening to your music underwater. If you value in any way shape or form what your music sounds like, AVOID AT ALL COSTS"
1,"Nice sound effects and worth for money . Recommending for samsung s7 ,s8 and s9 edge ."
1,"These put out good sound. But the minute there is any movement (i.e. walking in park with phone in pocket), the audio skips every couple minutes or so. Similar to what a CD player does.<br /><br />It seems to be a common issue with bluetooth earbuds I've tried."
0,Garbage. Had to throw them away after only 1 month because the charging chamber busted. You get what you pay for
1,No regrets!! Love them
1,"Great product, quality sound that blocks background noise at the gym.  Charges quickly with a long lasting charge. Different size ear tips for a good fit and very comfortable.  Would definitely recommend."
1,Great bass.  Very sturdy and comfortable. Ridiculous to spend big bucks on<br />Bose or Beats.  Buy these b4 buying big names.
1,Great storage case with ear bud replacements and charger cord all in one. Sound quality excellent and Bluetooth strength very strong.
1,"Excellent product! Excellent sound, very comfortable, comes with a nice looking hard case and charger and most of all, very cheap!!!"
1,"They are ok, but I don't think they are great. Maybe because my expectations were very high, maybe because bluetooth technology isn't yet so developed and I am comparing with cord headphones. The thing is I don't think the sound is so clear as it is in cheaper cord headphones. Anyway, interesting to have cordless headphones."
1,"The headphones are good overall! The sound quality is great, although at times there is a static sound."
1,This is a great bluetooth headphone for the money. Very nice quality and build. Packaging could not get any better. Both sound and battery lifer excellent.
0,Cheaply made headphones. Broke within a month.
1,Mic for phone calls isn't great. Lots of issues with background noise and the other person not being able to hear me.<br /><br />I've also had issues with the Bluetooth cutting out while listening to music when my phone is less than four feet away.
1,The headphones are great. Good sound. I would consider purchasing other headphones in the future.
0,Just crapped out during jog. 6.months and low use.
1,"These have been comfortable and sound decent. They're not particularly impressive when it comes to bass. And the bright blue LED might be annoying to some. I personally don't like that it blinks regularly, drawing attention."
1,"Just arrived, better quality then expected. Took about an hour to fully charge the headset battery, works very well so far."
0,Ear phonemes will not stay charged long enough to even attempt to connect to blue tooth device. Will not purchase again.
1,I would gets theses all over again .
0,these died within 3 months of light use for listening to audio books
1,"Very good quality for the money.  I purchased for my husband to use at the gym.  They are comfortable to wear, and he says that the sound is great.  He is very happy with these earphones."
1,Minimum volume is too loud for my ears.
1,Product was packaged well and came with many accessories.It was easy to pair.I will use this while riding my jetski. I wanted Bluetooth headphones that were at least water resistant and would stay on my head.Can't wait to try them out on the water! Could use a little more bass but they still sound good for the price point!
1,"This is my third set, I have had many ‘name’ brands, but the senso’s are amazing, and not just for the price, they keep their connection, sound great, fit well, and the battery lasts a long time.  I highly recommend these to anyone."
1,Work great!
0,There is a constant &#34;white noise&#34; that I can hear when I listen to anything.  It's pretty annoying.
1,Work well. Hurt ears after many hours of wearing.
1,Very comfortable. Sound is awesome. Mic works great.
0,"Seemed to work great... for a while.  I would have given them 5 stars, except that after about 4 months, the left ear piece just stopped working all together for no apparent reason.  Didn't get wet or anything.  So, not sure on the quality."
0,Broke within days. Returned.
1,Love them.
1,Once I figured out how to use these I love them!
1,"By far the best headphones I've ever had. The battery lasts all day the buds are confortable to wear and the fact that they come with the dual charging cord and a car charger speaks volumes of the level of care and consideration that the Senso company has for its customers. Not to mention the fact that they stand behind their product with a one year warranty. Out of the two I've purchased one started to give me trouble, and Senso waisted no time taking care of the issue. Never seen that in any other ear bud company."
1,Arrived on time! Bought for my husband. So far they are great! The sound is awesome.
0,"Sound quality is scratchy and not great. Thought these would be a cheap noise cancelling alternative to bose or song, but the sound quality is not even comparable. Would recommend if you just want eh sound and cheap wireless headphones, but not great for someone who wants bass, clear vocals, and true noise cancellation."
0,well liked
0,They lasted about three months.  Right side is barely audible.
0,I purchased a pair of these and they worked well for almost 2 yrs. Purchased another pair and they stopped working 3 days after the warranty expired. Company told me they could only give me a small discount to buy a new pair. I'll never purchase anything else from them!
1,After connecting I have to wait 30 seconds before audio doesn't cut in and out. Range is spotty and if phone is in my pocket and I bend over signal cuts out. Makes working in the yard annoying. For the cost it's not a bad deal.
1,I love them. It is so much nicer than actually the big Bose headsets and I love the freedom of movement. It is lighter too. My only gripe is I like to wear them to bed to listen to relaxation music and you can't lay in your side with them as they are too bulky on your ears.
1,Great sound.  Nice packaging.  Good customer support.
1,"Quality product, good design."
0,"I bought these as opposed to spending $200 on beats headphones. These are ok but not up to the hype on the reviews.<br />Cons:<br />1.)The ear piece does not retain its shape so it pretty much does nothing for keeping the headphones in place. In fact it was pretty hard to keep the headphones to stay on. I had tried out my friends beats which have a similar design and those stayed put during running, and crossfit type workouts so I assumed since these had a similar design they would too but they did not.<br />2.)NOT FOR RUNNING. The wind noise is horrible when running in these.<br />3.)Sound quality was ok at first but Ive barley used them over the last 3 months and the sound quality is horrible now. I sweat a lot when I work out so maybe it is because of that but Ive never had the sound quality decrease that much because of sweat in my previous headphones.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1.) The only pro I really have about this product is the battery life. It is advertised as holding a charge for 8 hours but Ive only had to charge these maybe 3 times since I got them and I will forget to turn them off a lot of times."
1,"Works great , nice battery life, sound quality not bad, cons- ear tip fell off after a year if you buy new ones it’s $20,"
1,Excellent all around. Fit very comfortably. Controls are easy to use. Love that I can walk all over the house without carrying my device with me.
1,"I had a problem with the headphones. I e-mailed SENSO, and they sent me another pair. I really think they are a good product."
1,"Great set of buds forb the price, beats 169.99 for air pods. Very happy with the purchase and no more near misses at the gym."
1,"I really like them, especially for the price. They're good for running, don't thump a lot when I step like other wireless earphones I tried.<br /><br />One star off because they do move a little bit, and while they don't fall out, I do find myself adjusting them frequently. I feel like it might just be me.<br /><br />Also, I'm very disappointed that there is no built-in functionality for Google Assistant or Siri. I'd really like to be able to double-tap the button and pull up Google Assistant instead of a redial feature."
1,"AAA+ I love this ear buds, excellent product."
1,"Once I figured out the multi function button was not part of the volume controls, it paired perfectly and works as expected.  That was very hard to determine from the instruction card enclosed in the box."
1,"This is my first set of wireless headphones and I love them.  The sound is great and the ear buds come in three sizes so the right fit is there for anyone.  I noticed during my last workout at my studio I didn't need the iPod strapped to my arm.  I was able to leave it at my table and move anywhere in the studio without it attached to me with no interruption or lost sound!  Last thing, SENSO has demonstrated superior customer service in their follow up and desire to make sure you're happy with the product.  So thumbs up on this buy folks!"
1,Great Product.  The sound is crisp and clean.  The receivers always can hear me.
1,"These are hands down the best headset / headphones I've ever owned! I will be a repeat customer and refer everyone to this product!  Easy to use, sound amazing, and are easy to control when doing other activities. On top of that, I don't have to deal with any cords getting tangled! Don't hesitate this are a steal at this price!"
1,Works great quality sound and comfortable. Nice packaging
1,First of all let me say I paid $200 for wireless Beats by Dre. I'm a 100 mile a month runner and felt the headphones would be worth the high price. Not at all.  They just kept dying. I sent them back 3 times before simply giving up.  I read the amazing reviews and decided to give Senso a try... Boy am I glad I did. I'm greatly impressed by the personal touch of customer service by the company. The headphones came quickly and I've been impressed every since. If you are looking for Bluetooth headphones you owe it to yourself to buy these headphones. Incredible value.
1,Really good
0,Audio quality is over compressed and muffled. Definitely not HD as the box says. The high frequency audio range on this product is terrible. If you like listening to heavy over baddy music through a blanket these headphones are exactly what you need to purchase. Also not compatible with PS4
1,Had a Powerbeats that failed on day 2-regular disconnected or powered off on its own. After reading reviews went with these and have been extremely pleased! Sound quality is great and have not had any problems with connection even when sweating heavily during a workout. Incredible value for the price!
0,"They were very uncomfortable to wear, and I wore them for about 10 minutes. Returning them."
1,Headphones are great quality.Amazing
1,Last battery life
1,me encantan tiene muy buen sonido
1,It has amazing sound quality. I still haven't looked into the noise canceling part FYI. I do think that the over ear part could be stronger but that's just my personal opinion.
1,"I bought these July 2017 because I needed a Bluetooth headphone I can use to talk on the phone.  These worked great at first.  They deliver nice sound and stay in my ears while running, but by January 2018 the microphone in the headphones no longer worked.  I could hear the caller on the other end, but they could not hear me.  You get what you pay for."
1,For the price you cannot do better.
0,These fit awful fall out used them 5 or 6 times now will not charge
0,"So I scored this product low because while the sound is amazing...it never fails after a year...one of the speakers go out. I have purchased these headphones three times (yes they are that good in terms of sound and noise cancellation) but once again, one side giving out. I purchased them mid January of 2019 so I guess it was time."
1,"love the fit and look! they fit great, stay in my ear, have great sound quality up and down the frequency range, and easily pair with my phone and my laptop. the battery life has been fantastic so far, my only issue is that they're soooooo loud. the first volume level is much louder than necessary for an empty house, and 4 levels up is far too loud. that's great for buses and subways and noisy environments, but for casual use, the lowest setting is closer to half-volume on regular headphones. despite that, i love them!"
1,"These headphones were everything I had hoped for and more! The price is unbeatable for a product of such high quality. I had previously read reviews that questioned these headphones' bass and I'm hear to shut down those critics. I workout to some rap music with some serious bass and these headphones keep up just fine. One of my friends grabbed them off my neck at the gym and before I could grab them back he put them on and his whole demeanor changed. He said, &#34;You paid less than $50 for these?&#34; He was dumbfounded and realized what an idiot he was. Unfortunately for him, he way overpaid for Beats by Dre. Overall, this product is awesome. I would recommend it to a friend and would definitely buy it again."
1,Still to soon to really rate them but so far their sound is excellent and the noise cancelling its not. I will continue to experiment with the eartips and see if that helps the noise cancelling.
1,"I ordered these earbuds to use in the gym. I don't run but walk in the treadmill, so I did not want a wire in the way. I took a chance on these because of the positive reviews and the price. Once I paired them with my iPod, I was pleasantly surprised at the comfort and sound quality. I have a pair of Bose (wired) earbuds, and they are great. But these are just as good in terms of sound quality and comfort. The bass is rich and I can hear all the instruments.  I have not taken them on a long flight, but I believe they will work just fine. I recommend this produce with confidence."
1,"I've been using these headphones 3-4 times a week in the gym and the sauna for almost two years with no real problems. Really surprised with these given their reasonable price. It can, sometimes, be a little hard to get them to stay in place in your ear once they get a little wet but the sound quality, battery life and overall lifespan of these little guys have been more than satisfactory for me and I'll definitely be purchasing them again."
1,"This earphones would have been awesome around $20, there’re profits and quality still to be made.  Manufactures can charge whatever people are willing to pay just to have that particular designs or brands/status.  Talking about “status” – there are people out and about, jamming with the Dr. that are still reside inside their parents basement lol.  Still on the first charge, hopefully it will hold up to its 8 hours charge promise.  In the future, having earphones implanted to the ear canals will be a thing and be much more natural with no more dangling or dealing with the fitting issue.  However, often the complaints would be the lack of bass, sorry to disappoint but you can’t cram those 15” subwoofers to these tiny earbuds.  Overall, I found these earbuds are visually pleasing and work well.  I would recommend this to anyone."
1,"I love these headphones, they pair easily and fit well."
1,Great earbuds for the price these have great bass sound.
1,"Sound is great. Delivered a day early, but after long use they are uncomfortable in the ear canal"
0,"well i had these for a few days and already only one ear bud works the left, the right i hear nothing"
1,I got them about a week now and went a about 4 runs of four miles and they work great. So far great product. Very easy to hookup to your phone. Holds charge very well. I'm happy with them.
1,I loved them I just lost them at work! 😢
1,For the price these are an excellent choice. Easy to pair with a good sound. Pairing holds across a good distance. I am well pleased.
1,"sound great, work great, fit great"
1,Great sound from these love all the accessories
1,"I've only had these about a week and I love them.  The sound is great and they are very easy to use. My biggest issue with wireless earbuds is short lifespan, so I will update this review in future.  But so far I am extremely happy with this product."
0,"This product worked fine the two months that it was functional. Then it just inexplicably broke, as other reviewers have noted below. I only used it when I went to the gym about three times a week and never mishandled it and just left it on my desk. It says it’s fully charged but won’t turn on. Absolutely horrible product. Beware and do not buy!"
0,Worked great at first in less than 6 months they will not stay on. So they are no use at this point
1,"These aren't the nicest, best quality headphones on the market. But for the price, they are great! Not only does it come with headphones, but there are a bunch of other accessories for your phone and extra ear pieces. I haven't had any issues with the ""static noise"" that people have noted in other reviews and the battery life is excellent. Overall, I would say this was a great purchase."
1,Great product for the Peice you’re paying. I used them for gym and they work wonderfully!
0,"Extremely uncomfortable. They look nice but they hurt my ears, I tried all the different tips and they didn’t make a difference. She. You bend it to fit over your ear it doesn’t hold that shape at all. The wire inside is super pliable and it wouldn’t stay on unless I crimped it as close to my ear as possible (which was uncomfortable). Not having a remote on the wire was a bit confusing and an adjustment. For calls I’ve been told that it’s difficult for the receiver to hear me when I am using these. The mic is within the bud. I accidentally called several people because a certain pattern of presses will redial the last number. Maybe I could’ve adjusted and looked past all this if the sound quality were at least good. Perhaps this pair has a defect, I don’t know, but there is a constant crackling in the background of all the audio. It’s quiet, like a crinkling, almost static noise. On the breaks between songs or calls/ when I pause a video to walk somewhere it’s there and it drives me nuts."
1,"The sound is great, I like the remote control buttons but I dislike the ear hooks they're too soft and weak. Any little hit they'll fall off. It also needs a better plug for the charger slot. But the customer service is excellent the earphones plug fell apart and they responded quickly to my email. My earphones was replaced with no hassle."
0,"First pair did not work properly and was sent a replacement pair.  They took well over a week to arrive.  I'm having the same problem with the replacement pair.  I used each about 10 times without any problem.  They connected quickly and didn't loose connection during exercise.  I was able to recharge them easily.  Then I had the following experience with each.  I plugged them in to charge after hearing the low battery message.  The blue light seemed to come on fairly quickly given my past experiences recharging.  Then when I unplug to use again, nothing.  no lights, no connection, just dead.  If you plug it back into the charger you see a steady blue light, but if you take it off nothing.<br /><br />These are not worth even the advertised discounted price.  Certainly were never worth the origianl price of almost $170.  If I had paid that much I'd be going crazy.  As it is, its a wasted $40.  I now have two pairs that are totally useless.  Very low quality product."
1,This headphone is just what I was looking for.
1,"Well, its been just under a year.  And while i did use these pretty often and regularly....the left ear no longer works.  When i move the cable a certain way it just cuts out.....i have to fiddle with it to get it to work.  Like regular headphones...if you use them often, be prepared to replace them yearly.  Will likely go with a cheaper alternative now."
1,"Great sound quality and responsiveness; connects quickly and lasts a long time. Only negative is the soft flexible ear wraps; just wish they were similar to the beats ear wraps, a little more firm, but still flexible."
1,Good sound and comfortable
0,"At first these were great...figured if they did not work out they were inexpensive...alas, too good to be true.  Broke in the first month I had them.  Disappointed, but my own fault for not paying more I suppose."
1,"They are easy to sync, so you can get to what you listen to fast. I have't taken them<br />hiking, but they're light and right and just what I need!"
1,"Sounds really good, nice and clear. pairing was easy."
1,"I've only used them once so far, but they stick in my ears really well and have good sound. I can tell that they'll serve me well at the gym and running. If something changes, I'll make sure to update.<br /><br />They look and feel nice, although I could do without the name written in bold white letters outside of my ears. Easily remedied with a Sharpie, though."
1,so far so good! These are nice wireless headphones. thanks for the fun surprise extras that were sent along with them too!
1,I love them. I was a bit hesitant after reading a review or two that mentioned they will come out while running. Mine have fit very well and I have had no issues while running. The mic works well when I have used them to talk on the phone also.
1,"Excellent customer service. Best headphones I've owned! Great quality sound,they stay in place and best of all they are reasonably priced!"
1,For twenty bucks  you can't go worng. I'd buy them again!  I've bought three sets o ear buds. Senso outdid all the rest in their price range!
0,these worked well for about 2 months but then suddenly lost all sound in the one ear. very disappointing because I had read a lot of good reviews and had loved them for the brief time they worked. very disappointed.
1,"The SENSO Bluetooth Headphones are wonderful and at a very good price. They are very comfortable, easy to put on and have a very nice sound.  I use mine around the house as my wife doesn't enjoy (euphemism) sports talk and I do. After using them to a point where the batteries are used up (I fall asleep to movie on my iPad), a complete charge only takes about one and a half hours. Very pleased with SENSO Bluetooth Headphones."
1,At the moment I really love these headsets. I've yet to check how long the battery last with continuous play.
0,They make a light clicking sound when I run and they don’t fit as snug around my ears as my last pair
1,"Overall it’s great. Only downsides two: The lowest volume can still be too loud for me; when the battery appears halfway on my phone, it’ll say battery low a few times before turning off. It lasts a good while for me but it can just get annoying at times."
1,"Fantastic sound, no problem pairing them and great price!"
1,"I have been using these earbuds for almost a year. I am generally happy with them and use them primarily for listening to audio-books during my commute on the bus. I do think they are a great value. A friend spent 5 times as much on a pair of Beats that look/perform/sound almost identical. Some pros and cons:<br /><br />PROs:<br />Very good sound, deep base<br />Easy to pair with my iPhone 7 Plus<br />Comfortable in the ear<br />Easily start and stop your audio with button on the right earpiece<br /><br />CONs:<br />Battery life is definitely shorter than advertised. I get about 4 to 4 1/2  hours.<br />I do get skipping audio at times. Not sure the cause - could just be a Bluetooth thing.<br />Not really a flaw - but I do wish there was a a way to plug them into the phone directly when the battery dies"
1,"After the first day, they are comfortable, sound good, and come with a useful set of accessories - even an unadvertised 4th choice in ear pieces which has additional noise-canceling properties."
1,Works great at first but only for 3 months then it goes junk
1,"Great price, good sound, great button convenience and layout.  Comfortable in the ear.  Pairs easily with phone."
1,"Good, hurts one ear after awhile, but they are great for the gym!"
1,"Comfortable headphones with great sound.  Although I wear hearing aids that are also Bluetooth equipped, these ear buds deliver a great sound."
1,"Headphones stopped connecting after a few months. After ~5 min on the phone with customer service, they were able to send a replacement."
1,"For the price, I can't really complain. However, the signal cuts out a lot and it sounds like I'm listening to a discman with a scratched  CD LOL."
1,They work great and don't fall out of my ears when running.
0,"I purchased these buds for use at work.  They fit great and are comfortable.  However, the lowest volume setting is too loud.  I don't like the range of volume.  They lowest volume setting is annoyingly loud and I cannot adjust lower.  Very frustrating.  If I cannot return them, I am going to try and pawn them off on my husband who is hard of hearing (from playing 70 style earphones too loud!).  If you are hard of hearing, these will be great. If you are hearing sensitive, then find another brand."
1,"I bought these as replacement to my beats after those got crushed under a teenager's feet. I wanted something less expensive and that's what I got. These were easy to use and I got them working pretty quickly, battery life is great. Headphones work fine for music listening. Comes with multiple sized ear buds so fit perfectly in my small ears. However, microphone does not work reliably at all. Most of the times, the other side is not able to hear the sound. However, once in a while it has worked with the same phone and same settings. So quite disappointed. If all you want to do is listen to music/videos these are great value for money."
1,"These headphones sound like full-sized headphones! Nobody could tell I was using a headset when talking on the phone. The controls are intuitive and easy to operate with just a touch on the right earpiece. It was a bit tricky finding the right fit for my ears, but after about two minutes of trying, I got them to fit snugly and comfortably. The battery life is outstanding. I listen all day at work and they make it every time!"
1,Headphones work well.  Small enough to store on the go enough battery life to last through my work day.
1,"Came to me fast, product works great!"
1,"These headphones paired easily with my new Fitbit Ionic. Sound quality is very good and quite comfortable as well. At this price point I can afford to have a few pair, since I'm prone to hiding things from myself."
1,"They sound great, and I can go anywhere in my house and the signal stays strong. These are perfect for exercise and housecleaning. They also don't fall out."
0,"Used them last night on my tablet and they started throwing sparks. I  disconnected and was unable to turn them off. However, I charged them and the light was Ted and blue then turned blue. Only used them for 2 hours."
0,"Like many low cost blue tooth ear buds, these did not last more than 2 months. I don't know if it was sweat getting inside them during workouts, manufacturing defects, or a bad battery, but after taking great care to charge them every six or so hours of use, they will no longer charge or power on. Your money will be better spent on a higher quality item."
1,"Ordered a pair of these last week.  Received them very quickly just a few days not counting the weekend.  Let's start by saying I'm not in anyway a headphone expert. However, I know I've used many different kinds that I don't like. This pair is different. When I put them in I noticed right away that they are comfortable. Turned them on and the sound quality is fantastic. Good &#34;bassy&#34; sound for workouts. I went for a couple mile run with them and they stayed in place the entire time and having no chord wonderful. Absolutely no complaints here."
1,"First impressions from using them, they feel good and are comfortable but dont get them expecting great sound, the sound really falls apart the moment anything with bass comes into play, they get loud but like i said anything with bass will distort them pretty bad"
1,So far I really like them. I will be able to give a better review after I have had them for a while. The main features that attracted them to me was their water resistance rating (I sweat a lot). So their longevity will be the biggest factor to me.<br />Thank you.
1,Great value. Comfortable and great sound quality
1,"Purchased for my son, he is at the gym everyday for a few hours a day. He loves the headphones.  Very comfortable and sound great. Also has a good battery,  or charge life. Definitely recommend"
0,"I bought this headset in April 2017.  They worked great for several months.  About a month ago, the left earphone started to have spotty sounds (I had intermittent sound in the left ear).  Now, they have stopped working altogether.  On October 30, I began having problems with bluetooth connectivity.  They would pair with my iphone 6s plus and then immediately drop the connection.  Now they won't turn on at all.  I have charged to full, but they will not turn on.  I need to find another headset that works immediately.  Any suggestions?"
1,"Excellent buy! You will not be disappointed. These are top quality, excellent sound and battery life. Can't beat it. No problems and so happy with my purchase!"
1,the price was right for these headphones.  I like the style and feel.  I have not used them enough to tell how long the battery lasts but it comes with the charger cable and adapters.
1,These work well and are priced right
1,The ear buds are great. I am still adjusting for the best fit. I also think I need to change the size of the buds to a smaller insert.
1,Love them
1,Have been using this for about three days.  So far so good.  I bought it to replace another brand that I had to return because it completely stopped working and wouldn't even charge or turn on after two days.  I did like the sound quality of the other brand better though.
1,"Not bad for the cheap price.  They do drop or lose signal and &#34;skip&#34; frequently when the phone is nearby so the 30 ft transmission is not as dependable as I would like it to be but considering these are significantly cheaper than the name brand ones, they do an okay job.  I have found that if you hold your phone near the BT antenna or if something gets in the way, it doesn't receive at all which is not necessarily the case for some better quality speakers that I have where I can hold the phone however I want as long as I am not close to the max distance."
1,great product and really awesome - responsive customer support!
1,"These wireless headphones perform very well. They are comfortable, easy to set up, and very light weight.  The volume control works very well and can be adjusted very loud so if you are in noisy places you should have no problem hearing. The only thing that did not make me give it 5 Stars was the range. The range is limited to about 30 feet but also if I had it in one of my pockets and my body was blocking the signal to the headphones, the audio would break up.  Other than that, being my first set of wireless headphones I am very pleased."
1,LOVE THESE HEADPHONES!! I am considering getting another pair since my husband keeps stealing them from me. Sound quality and noise cancellation is better than I expected at this price point. We've had them for a few months now and I still love them. Comfortable to wear and stay in place throughout my workouts and when I am cleaning up around the house.
1,"Great sound. Very loud. I listen to metal and rap. Very Good bass. Very good price. Great for running. I would give 5 stars... However, when bicycling, they create lots of loud wind noise over about 6 mph.  I have the jam on brand ear buds too . These Sensos last way longer and are way better. For 1/3 the price. Battery life on these is 7 hours on loud music."
1,Great set of headphones at a unbelievably inexpensive price.  Very flexible and fits in my ear easily.  All great follow up with Senso to see if I received my order and if they could assist further.
1,Best wireless headphones I have ever owned. You can't beat the value to price ratio. They are a well made and well designed product. They met Every expectation.
1,"A friend bought his pair, told me how much he liked them and the price, I bought mine and then another pair for my wife.<br /><br />Keep up the great work!"
0,Volume bottom fell off five minutes after taking out of box. So disappointed.  Packed it back up and returned same day as I received it.
1,"Though I have only used these headphones for a little while, I can already tell they are of great quality. The sound is very clear through these, also I like the audio system sync feature. This allows you to sync the phone volume with the headphones so anytime you turn down either one it controls the other as well. I have not tried to communicate with someone through the speaker, if I ever do use it I will update it here. They fit very comfortably in your ears and I feel this is because of the curved earpieces and the loop that allows it to stay snug for much longer. I have tried many different kinds and some others slide out but I never felt for one moment that these were going to slide out. I would recommend these to a friend or family member."
1,Son buenos....
1,"they work great, no complaints as of now. I actually have 3 pair for the family."
1,"Had these headphones for a week but they seem well built. The two charging cables, carrying case, and a two port car charger are nice additions to the headphones. I was not expecting the extras. I have yet to test the 8 hrs use but if it works these are definitely 5-star headphones"
1,"I got these for my son, and he really likes them. Thank you."
1,best blue tooth head phones for the money... will definitely recommenced them & will buy them again.
1,Amazing! Cannot beat the quality for the price. The charge held up for 4-5 workouts. The design also stays on and in your ears when doing intense cardio.
1,I like these a lot!  They are very durable and have a really good range.  They come with different ear inserts to fit just about any size.  They work well with my iphone and very well with my macbook air when I hdmi to my television.
1,Good sound ....the best number one ...everything is great
0,"Setup and connection are great, and they have a really good range to them. But the sound is washed out to a point where even EQ apps can't save it. The ear rests are pretty flimsy and the buds themselves are uncomfortable with any of the adjustable heads they come with.<br /><br />They're just not very good."
1,"I love them, thanks"
1,"I was skeptical initially since i habe never heard of brand called &#34;SENSO&#34;. But, this item had great reviews from other users. So, i decided to give a shot. It arrived next day and i used it to my workout...it was amazing. I mean i only used it one day and hope it will last. But, yeah it sounded amazing."
1,"I like them. Only complaint I have is the quality of the Bluetooth for phone calls. My husband complained the littlest of noises were extremely loud. However, I bought it to listen to music mostly for workouts, so the sound quality is nice for that"
0,I have had this set of earbuds for two months. It doesn't hold charge. At all. I just took it off the charger and it's already pestering me with the audible &#34;battery low&#34; warning.
1,These are my first Bluetooth ear buds. Great sound quality. No problems with them so far
1,"Great purchase. Stays put with workouts, running, cycling... For the price and quality, you can't beat it."
1,"Had a pair of these that lasted me 2 years! They are an awesome, very quality set of earbuds for $30. They are very straight forward and easy to use. I used mine almost everyday for the last 2 years for the gym, and had 2 different, poorly made brands of headphones that barely made it through 6 months of use for 1 1/2 prior to when i got my first pair of Senso’s. Mine only quit working when i packed them too tightly in some luggage and damaged the connecting wire so music only came in from the right earbud. I have no doubt they would have kept trucking along for another year or so if it wasn’t for user-error. Only complaint is the little rubber piece that holds the wires together comes off very easily and is quite hard to find after losing it. Already bought my second pair of Senso’s to replace my damaged ones, highly recommend these."
1,Awesome buds!! Good battery life and GREAT sound!!
0,I am skeptical of the good reviews they have with this product. This product is cheaply made!! The left bud of my ordered earpiece just died after months of using. So sad that I was so happy with it for few months because it really served its purpose. Unfortunately I was out of country when it happened and that I forgot to ask for its warranty. Now it is useless...Stay away!!!
1,"I liked them, they worked well, and they were priced right.<br /><br />Mine died after a year. I suspect it was from getting repeatedly snagged on items in my work bag.<br /><br />If you buy these, it comes with a case. Use the case, when not in use, and they will last way longer."
1,Excellent ear buds for the price! Great sound quality! Nice carrying case with belt clip! Sturdy! Looks good! Get one and enjoy!
1,"I mostly like this product for the warranty support by the company. I bought two pairs one as a gift, one pair is giving me some problems but after starting a warranty claim with the company I got a response back within only a few hours from them. They wanted me to try something to repair it, I attempted it a few times to see if It could be repaired that way when I informed them that it didn't, they processed a replacement immediately. I think that just shows how sure they are that the product is good is when they don't hesitate to replace it if it is damaged. If their product was a piece of junk they would fight tooth and nail not to replace it, but if they are willing to work immediately to get it replaced just shows their confidence in the product."
1,"I’ve had these for nearly 1 year now and they are still going strong. No issues. These headphones are fantastic. Like many, I was weary about the low price, figuring they can’t be too great for such a low price. But I was wrong. Great sound quality, easy connectivity, comfortable, and great battery life. I was going to buy another set this past prime day but saw that they have come out with a new model. I purchased the new model and will write a review for that one after I’ve given it some time to either impress or disappoint."
1,"I ended up not using these since they fall out of my ears easily. I've used other pairs of over-ear headphones, and the backs of these just don't hold them down like others I've used. I typically have trouble with in-ear headphones (except for Apple's earbuds, which work for me) While these do have an over-ear portion, they seem built to work primarily as in-ear headphones.<br /><br />I'm giving it three stars because although the headphones didn't work for my ears, the functionality of them worked great."
1,"Excellent earphones for the price and it came with a lot of extras like different sized earbuds, car charger, and extra charger. Definitely a must-buy."
1,"The best I've tried: 1. Way louder than necessary volume. 2. short recharge time. 3.quick pairing. 4. Very comfortable.The overear hooks really help. 5. Long playing. 6. No unnecessary weightier object on in-between wire whose swinging could cause earbud to dislodge from ear; they stay in place. 7. Very little build up of lag time between video and audio streaming.8. Awesome audio frequency response on high and low end. I can't find anything wrong with them, maybe wish volume could be muted more, the source can be muted also, anyway, and I like the extra power if necessary.9. Excellent go-the-extra-mile accessories, including a case which actually is small and protective. 10. Range from source is good or better than others. 11. And did I say they look cool?"
1,"Great sound, feels great and great price"
1,Exactly what I wanted and WaY better sound and comfort then my  Plantronics. Also was impressed with the customer service letter prompting me to write this review. Something I rarely do.  Tremendous value on amazon.  Probably buying a few more as holiday gifts.
0,The casing is breaking near the earbuds
1,"I love my new head phones they work great & there very comfortable to wear also fast charging i would recommend them to everyone family&,friends alike thank you."
1,Good bass could use a little more high. But very pleased with product.
0,"Only 18 mos, with semi monthly, light use and the socket for the charger has broken inward so the can't be charged... Useless to me now... so like 9-12 uses and they are toast...."
1,Great product
0,"Extremely disappointed with sound quality of these earphones.  The product looks good and has some nice features, but cannot overcome it's most serious flaw, which is the very poor sound quality.  Sounds are muffelled and it is incapable of reproducing sound accurately.  Total waste of money, so i now understand why they are heavily discounted."
0,"Fit isn't great, and sound is marginal. These are fine if you don't expect much as far as depth of sound but I was hoping for better."
0,It didn’t work after the 3rd time using it. Will never buy this ever again.
1,My wife and I use these earphones for exercising. They are great! They latch onto your ears so they stay in place while jogging and doing different kinds of workout.
0,"According to the IP standards of waterproof ratings, a rating of IPX7 means the device can be immersed in water of up to 1 meter (3 feet). This was not the case at all with these headphones. Do not buy if you are expecting them to be waterproof."
1,"Work as I hoped they would. I appreciate the different sized buds and found the range to be good, even walking around my home while my phone wasn't on me."
1,"I used these as an upgrade for wireless headphones as my old ones that were a different brand had been damaged and lost sound quality. These SENSO bluetooth headphones are definitely loud enough to disguise the grunting and weight slamming that is gym noise. My only issue is that the ear loops are a bit big and are permanently secured, so they look slightly funky looping over my ear. Other than that, they stay in place pretty well."
1,The sound on these are great however they don't fit in small ears very well. Good thing they came with smaller foam ear pieces.
1,Good Quality for price
1,same as beats but a quarter of the price
1,"I waited to use them to write a review, so that I could be accurate.  These headphones are great, especially for the price!  Easy to use, comfortable to wear, and full of functionality."
1,"The headphones are comfortable, easy to pair, and sound great, but I don't notice the noise canceling feature. I like that the on/off switch announces when it turns on or off. I mainly bought for active noise canceling, thus the rating."
0,"Terrible unit, I was trying to be a nice guy and afforded this company ever opportunity ti resolve this issue, but instead I got someone on the phone who was extremely impolite and didn't resolve a thing. My ear plugs do not work if you hold the base unit 1 foot away...after a foot then you will receive static and the everything will shut off. I don't want anything to do with this company again."
1,Really enjoy these headphones!! They fit perfectly in my ear and I avoid the annoying ear buds falling out of my ear due to sweat. Really would recommend these headphones!
1,&#34;Excellent headphones and for the price they are outstanding quality!&#34;
1,"What I liked most about the ear phones was how long I would be able to listen to books on my I-pod. My other ear phones only lasted about 2 hours. In summer I am mowing 6 hours a day,now I will be able to listen to my audible books the 6 hours of mowing. Also the distance they function from my I-pod is great because I have leave mower to move items out of the way. These fit the situation perfectly."
0,It stopped working after 8 weeks!
1,"So far so good, used thru the weekend and love them! Excellent sound quality, and build quality. Sync works great and range is awesome. You will not be disappointed with this product. About 8 hrs of use per charge, and very comfortable to wear. Love them."
0,Stopped holding a charge after a few uses
1,"These headphones are so cool, i like a the sound quality and the feel when using them.<br /><br />I just notice that it doesn't have a long reach."
1,"Great sound and functionality at a great price.  Could have used an extra set of lg. ear buds and the ear hooks? tend to loosen with motion. An adjustablet and more slender design would be awesome. Also, if you could lower the max.volume alert so it doesn't blow out my ear drum everytime I max out the volume.  I'd rather lose my hearing to loud music eventually as opposed to sooner as a result of that brain piercing tone.<br />  Thx again for the quality sound"
1,"Excellent headphones, I was expecting less, but I really crush on it. Excellent quality. Perfect fit over the ears, non slippery even when sweating."""
1,"Bought these for a friend after buying myself after and they're perfect! Very gooood quality, sounds like surround sound in your ears and really does block out any outside noise. Waterpoof works as I've worn them in rain and durable. I stamped on my friends and was able to put it right back together with no hassle. Works like new :)  BETTER THAN BEATS in my opinion, save some money and buy."
1,I am using these headphones in the gym for my treadmill workout listening to books.
1,So far so good! I've only had them for about a week but very happy with the purchase! Especially would rate them a 5 star for value!
1,Have great sound. Ear pieces not as stiff as I like but for the money Great purchase
1,They are great. I bought them for my husband's birthday. He loves them.
1,Great sounding headphones.  Pair easy and really fit ears securely.  Highly recommend these!
1,"Just got them. I read instruction books always.<br />CON:<br />It says not to over charge and not to leave it charging all night. I think sellers should put information like this in the description instead of finding out after the purchase.<br />PROS:<br />Fits really good<br />Pairs easily<br />Quality feel and look<br />Easy access to logical, universal controls<br />Nice extras (but would rather have a lower price)<br />Easy read instructions<br />And most importantly, sounds good<br /><br />I still would have wanted to know about the overcharging risk. One more thing to watch and remember. Anyone know of a simple 110 timer I can plug my USB charging unit into?<br /><br />Update, Before I had a chance to buy a timer, I got a rapid, complete and personal response from the company rep. The headphones have over charge protection and the warning is generic. I replace the fallen star."
0,Great sound but I actually purchased 2 and neither one lasted 2 months
1,"I bought the headphones for my husband.  He absolutely loves them! No wires to catch on anything and easy to wear. Great clarity on the music and best of all, I can't hear the music when I am watching TV and he is sitting next to me. I have told family & friends about the headphones already.  Great purchase & highly recommend to all. UPDATE: I just ordered another pair as now I want the headphones for me!"
1,I love these have bought several pair and seem to last longer than any I've bought before.
1,Compact and good quality. I have two
1,"Theses headphones are great! Solid sound and performance, and at their price point they are tough to beat.  The personal touch though by the company is striking, they genuinely care that you are satisfied with the product."
1,Exceeded expectations
1,So far it's working well. Seems good quality. No complaints.
1,Even . Though . They . Didn't . Send . Me . The . Accessories . This . Headset . Rocks
1,I bought these to wear at work since I can't wear my Bose headphones. Very base heavy and I feel like i'm in a tunnel - not a fan!
0,My customers say that the tonal quality is very poor and have me switch. I have an Apple 6
1,Great sound.  Good price.  Very easy to set up.  I would highly recommend!!
1,"It's not often a company comes along with a business plan that focuses completely on its customers, but this is exactly what the SENSO team has done and is committed to doing longterm! Not only have they produced an excellent set of wireless earbuds that are clear, have a wide range of tones and good bass, pair easily with any bluetooth phone or device, and work in excess of 30ft, they are offering their earbuds at an extremely fair introductory price (under $50), and supporting their customers with super excellent customer service...and a one year warranty!<br /><br />When I received my earbuds, the first thing I noticed was the quality packaging and support documentation...all clearly printed in color on quality coated stock to last for future reference. It reminded me of Apple's packaging...first class all the way! Seeing this, I quickly determined that SENSO was making a statement to the market... that they deliver quality products!<br /><br />And they didn't let me down. When I tried the earbuds on I immediately assumed they were designed by someone who uses earbuds often because they are not only the most comfortable I have ever used, but they deliver the most consistent, high quality sound of any earbuds I've tried. I couldn't be happier!<br /><br />Bottom line: You can't beat these earbuds. If you're in the market, BUY THEM! You won't be disappointed at all. They lack nothing!!!"
0,"I ordered a pair of these several months ago and enjoyed them while they I had them. I used them about an hour a day, 4-5 days a week at the gym. After about 3 months the right side stopped working entirely. I was bummed but figured I would just buy another set because they are so affordable. I got my new pair and used them about 6 or 7 times and the same exact thing happened. This time on the left side. Im guessing from sweat or something because I use the for exercise only but I took very good care of them. Needless to say , moving forward Im going to be buying something thats more durable."
1,"Crisp sound with decent bass. The fit takes a little getting used to, but it's nice to know my buds won't fall out of my ear so easily. I use these mostly at work, so I wear one ear at a time and drape the other over my shoulder, the bud is a little heavy so it tugs at the side that I'm actually using, but I can't take stars away from this product for that since I'm not using them exactly as intended. I love that these come with their own case that fits a bunch of accessories, but still fits nicely in my hand or purse. It also came with a really cool charger that has both the lightning end and the micro usb end, and that's apart from the actual charger for the headphones, not to mention an extra car charger! For the price, I'd recommend these to anyone. I hope really they last b/c I'm super happy with this purchase."
1,I've only had them for a week or so but I like them so far. The only thing that I don't like is not being able to control my music with them. (skip songs) Fit in my ears just fine and stay in place while running. Not bad so far.
1,"These are great, they fit extremely well and I tested them with multiple rounds of HIIT running sprints, burpees, and squat jumps, they didn't budge. The volume is great and they are comfortable, all the extra accessories are a nice touch. My only complaint is that it comes with a car charger base but no wall charger base. Overall can't beat these for the price!"
1,"Some of the best headphones out here, sure it looks like beats knock offs, but they really are not. They have amazing sound and a amazing life quality. The service the people at senso give you when you have questions or want to replace a product is also amazing"
0,The ear buds have stop working already.  I thought the sound was great but now I have to order another pair and it hasn't been a year
1,For the price the sound quality is outstanding. They don't really have too much is at all noise cancellation themselves. If you use the ear plug inserts for the ears then you can get some noise cancellation.
1,"I'm happy with them,the best i ever had everything is easy to get to I'll tell everyone to get a pair like these I'll rate them a 10+ ijs u wanna the truth"
1,This was a good buy for wireless headphones.  The sound is good and the comfort level is nice.
1,"I have only had my headphones for about 2 weeks but I absolutely love them!<br />The sound is great! I love the bass!<br />The medium buds a bit too big and the small buds are a bit too small but I'm a small person and have a hard time getting a good fit with any headphones. BUT the over the ear design works great! Even though the buds aren't as snug as I'd like it still blocks out the noise because of the design.<br />They come with a hard case to hold the charger, extra buds, and earbuds themselves.<br />It even comes with two slides to hold the cords together to wear them around your neck.<br />I bought these based on the reviews. I'm no audio expert but I'd say being a normal person these are much BETTER than the name brands you will pay WAY more money for.<br />It also comes with a one year guanantee!"
1,"Good product.  I've tried multiple types of bluetooth headphones.  These are consistently reliable.  I use at work, and gym.  Sometimes readjustment required, but tolerable."
1,Work as intended and haven't had any issues with this product!  They are slightly bulkier than I expected which might bother some people but the wrap around soft plastic hooks keep them supported in my ears just fine while working out.
1,"These headphones are great. I bought them after being frustrated with a different pair i bought on Groupon that were horrible. These keep a charge for a long time, I workout everyday for an hour and they last two weeks. I do turn them off after each workout . If I don't use them everyday they last about 4 weeks on one charge. The range is great too I can walk pretty far away from my phone and still have connection that is clear. Would recommend these to anyone. Good value for product and price."
0,I bought these as a result of many good reviews along with a good price. When I brought them home they connected immediately to my phone. But the part that goes over the ear is so flimsy that they don't stay on my ears and eventually fall off. I'm disappointed that they aren't more rigid for a sport earphone.
1,I've been using these for about 3 months now and they are phenomenal for the price. I've been caught in the rain while running. I sweat in them at the gym. I've had my kiddos pull them out of my ears. ... And after all of that abuse they work as advertised. A great value.
1,The headphones are good. The bluetooth connection isn't great and they will sometimes cut out if my phone is in my left pocket (The receiver is in the right earbud). But they work great at the gym.
1,These are great. Just what I was looking for. Light and comfortable with great sound. What a pleasure to be wireless!  And they don't fall out because of the over the ear part. Arrived quickly too.
1,"I was able to use these headphones while at the gym yesterday, and they were the best I’ve tried so far. I’ve previously tried Neo JDX, Avantree Jogger Pro Sweat, and a few others that I don't recall the brands. The ActivBuds were super easy to charge, pair, and wear. I have small ears, but was able to use the buds that were on the headphones, and did not need to use any of the alternative size gel-ear pods.<br />My first impression – I used them while on the treadmill doing a 3-mile run at about a pace of 6, and they felt comfortable and did not fall out of my ear at any point. As I moved to the weight area, I found myself wanting to skip songs, and change the volume, and was able to do both with no problem. My favorite feature is that I was able to skip songs forward and backward. The best feature is the ability to pause the song when I needed to talk to my workout partner, and I was able to do that a simple click of the button. All of these features are available on the right ear piece.<br />One other cool feature that I found most helpful for my small ears, is that the ear loop is made of a something that feels very malleable, and I was able to easily wrap around my ear, which is how I think they stayed in place while I was running.<br />Overall, I’m very pleased with these, and especially for the price and have actually ordered another pair to gift to my boyfriend. He currently has the wireless headphones Beats By Dre (which are nearly 3 or 4 times the cost of these), and he is not very pleased with them and was definitely envious of all of the neat features and sound quality that these offered."
1,Work great!!!
1,so far i have not had any complaints that the person on the other line can't hear me.  i like them
1,purchased as a gift for my daughter. I hope they work well for her! I guess only time will tell.
0,"The concept is great but if you have small ears, it simply doesn't work. The rubber loops that go over your ears are so large the flop around. Wish I would have stuck with my SkullCandy earbuds. I have never had an issue with them."
1,really enjoying the product-- amazing sound quality.
0,"The product  died after having had it for only two or three months. And during that time, I had only use the headphones one time. Obviously not a good reliable set of headphones or else perhaps if you purchase these you run the risk  of getting one of their 'lemons'"
1,"The headphones are good. This is the first Bluetooth version that I have purchased, so I certainly appreciate the freedom that they provide. However, I don't appreciate the repetitive requests from the manufacturer asking for me to leave a review. The first one came a day after they were received! How could a person give an honest and thorough review with only a day's worth or use. Even today, I have only had them a little over a week, and I have had three requests to leave feedback. I don't like the fact that Amazon allows this type of contact through their system. I hope that they reign this in as I don't want to be contacted like this every time I purchase from Amazon.<br /><br />But I digress... Back to the headphones. I am leaving this review without the real opportunity to give these thorough testing. So far they are fine. Too bad the manufacturer didn't wait for me to give the review on my own. Perhaps it could have been much more substantive."
1,I ordered the same pair maybe 1 year ago and I am so thrilled to have seen the improvements. It came with three different chargers!!!  This was not included  initially. The reason  I had re-ordered  a pair was for  a single charger-- and was very happy with the new improvement.
1,"I hardly ever write reviews but these headphones are a phenomenal value.  The sound quality is adequate but I mean come on for what you pay for them you're getting your money's worth.  These things really shine in that they charge exceptionally fast.  The  battery life is phenomenal.  You can make and answer calls.  And, perhaps most importantly, they stay firmly in your ears even during the most strenuous exercise.  Save a ton of cash and buy these instead of $100+ in ear headphones.  Note: they do not look cool though so if that's a concern you're going to want to look elsewhere."
1,"As the title states, the price and quality are great! I bought these as I needed wireless headphones for working out and chores around the house. The sound quality is perfect! I found the foam ear pieces were more comfortable and made them a little bassier. Overall I'm glad I went with these instead of the higher end 100+ headphones."
1,Really good sound quality and lightweight!
1,I think they are great but they do not stay in my ear far enough.
0,"OK, so I've had these for quite some time, so I feel almost qualified to write a review on them. Below you'll find all the skinny on these cheap but potent beauts and hopefully it'll help you make a decision. I'm going to go down the list as it's shown on the product page so it'll be easy to follow.<br /><br />First things first, do these do what they say? Absolutely! They're BT headphones with a mic and multifunction button on the powered side and they all work great, well almost.<br /><br />True High Fidelity Sound? Well, that depends on what you're listening to. I've found the lows sound pretty good for this type of unit, but they're inherently limited just because of the size and type of speaker used. However, I'm very happy with the base these produce. The mids are also very good, all things considered. Some artists sound better than others, of course. But generally they're clear and concise. The highs, well that's another story. Again, depending on the music you're listening to and how you have them adjusted, they can sound tinny with some music. Mostly rock and pop. However I don't listen to most auto-tuned music of today's artists so I can't speak to that, but I do listen to a wide range of music and overall am pleased. Watching a movie with them is enjoyable because of the noise reduction tech they have. Outside noise has yet to be a problem while listening to anything.<br /><br />Are they comfortable and secure on a sweaty head? Yep. They're equipped with the hooks that really do grab and hold on to your ear. I've mowed, walked and even did home improvements while these were on my head and they never became a problem. Over time they may slip out of my ear canal a bit, allowing outside noise in, but a light press and they're back and sealed. Now, after watching a long movie my ears may become sensitive but that's after a couple hours. Plus, they come with a few sizes and types of ear plugs so you'll likely find a set that works for you.<br /><br />The battery life has been remarkable, thus far. I've let them sit for a few days, come back and they're working just fine. It doesn't hurt that they charge pretty quickly, too. So even if they're dead it'll be no time on the charger and you're back in business. So in that regard, they perform as expected if not a touch beyond.<br /><br />On to the BT technology. I have not researched the various level of tech BT has these days. I can only assume the larger the number, in this case BT v4.1 with 6.0 and all that jazz, means it's going to perform better. In this case, I think not. My only complaint thus far is the quality when outdoors or beyond one room in my house. When outdoors the phone must be within about 12-24&#34; of the BT headphones or it'll beep repeatedly, indicating<br />there's a weak connection. A weak or lost connection will cause the music to stutter, for lack of better words. It's not skipping, it's actually stuttering for a good 30 seconds before it makes a full reconnection. This is consistent no matter what I'm listening to. The strange part is that if it's windy it's worse. Go figure. I called support and they were very supportive. They directed me on how to reset the unit, which we did and then it returned to what it was doing but the call was over and I never called back. I just try to work with them because it's been too long to do a return.<br /><br />This leads me to warranty. I can't speak of it, although I don't doubt they'd support a claim with a smile. Who knows, maybe I'll file a claim, but I'm guessing I'll just get another unit with the same problems so in the end I'm not sure it'd be worth it.<br /><br />I have seen these under a different brand name and they were a little cheaper. It wasn't on this site and I'm not even sure where it was. A friend seen these and asked me if I bought them here and took me to the site where the others were. It's been too long to recall, but I'm happy with the price I paid and can still recommend them.<br /><br />So in the end, these are of higher quality than any other headphones of their type, especially for the money. They truly live up to the hype put out there by Senso and you can believe what people say in their reviews. I gave them 3 stars because the BT isn't up to my level of expectations. The connection problem is the same I've had with BT when they first arrived on the scene and I expected them to be solved, but aren't. I'm not crazy about BT headphones but these will make a skeptic think twice.<br /><br />UPDATE: August 22, 2017<br /><br />The day after I posted the review above, my volume button on these beauties broke by collapsing inside the unit. It was on the volume up button, but before I realized what happened I had pressed the volume down button until the unit went to mute so they were useless to me afterward. I made the dreaded claim I mentioned may happen, but things went a lot smoother than I thought.<br /><br />I wrote via Amazon here so the claim was far easier than ever imagined. I wrote what had happened and added that the connection gets lost when outdoors and I have to keep the phone too close to the unit to make them usable. Well, as they stated the new set did not have that problem.<br /><br />First, let me say I wrote on a Sunday since I had some extra time. Oddly enough they responded that same day and, with proof through photos of the damaged part and the new set was off and in my hands by Wednesday. That's 3 days! Impressive I must admit. Plus, other than providing a photo and confirming my shipping address, both very reasonable, there was nothing I had to personally come up with. No returning of the old unit and it's accessories either. To me that's fantastic and makes this purchase even more worth its asking price.<br /><br />One last thing I forgot earlier and that is how does the mic work. Well, I don't make a lot of calls and use these more for music and movies. However, I did use them on a couple of occasions and they seemed to work fine. The caller confirmed they sounded great so that's what I'm going with. More later if, indeed, there's more later. :)<br /><br />UPDATE October 29, 2017<br /><br />I should say again that Senso was on the ball with my warranty claim and I can't complain one bit about them. They're willing to talk to you and more than willing to replace the unit if it appears to be shot, like mine were.<br /><br />When I first got them it seemed that the problems I reported earlier were no longer an issue and could have been an anomaly. Unfortunately, after a while they returned to the same old problems the first unit had. In their defense, I've never had a BT headset that worked so why should this one?<br /><br />To recap the problems, they lose connection when outside, regardless of where your phone is in relation to the headset. I literally was squatted on the ground with the headset about 15 inches from the phone trying to enjoy music and every time I turned my head it'd start to lose connection. It wasn't terribly windy so I don't know. When you have lost connection, for whatever reason, and reconnect the music doesn't play smoothly. It skips like I said before. I have to pause it and wait a minute for it to catch up and then restart the music. This is annoying as hell when your hands are dirty from working.<br /><br />They still sound very good for what they are and the battery lasts for several hours. However with all the other problems they have I can't give more than 2 stars because if you're outside all day like I am, these units will keep you frustrated and you won't enjoy your music."
1,"Can't beat it for the money.  Bought a second pair for my wife, she loves them.  Use at work for cell phone, computer (confrence calls), and music on fitbit.  Some of these manufactures want $100 +.  I shought the sound quality as excellent.  Some connectivity issues with fitbit when battery gets low."
1,Good headphones for the money
1,"If you are looking for Great Value over The Hype of other brands you need a pair of these bad boys... Great sound,  Great head feel and comfort, and when I use them for incoming calls the sound is Great and wind noise is not an issue...<br /><br />Big Clear Sound all around..."
0,"Broken out of the box, only one side worked"
1,"They sound great, fit perfectly.  Very impress"
1,Did not open or make use of product and would really appreciate returning for refund or credit<br />Thank you<br />James Henry
1,Sound great and stays on my ears
1,Awesome sound. Comfortable. Easy navigation. A great value.
1,Bought 4 sets for my family. We all like them. They connected quickly with no issue. They sound good. Only issues I see is the fit for some. Wish the ear strap could be adjusted some. 9/10 overall.
1,"So far so good. The sound quality is awesome. My husband now wants to buy one also. It comes with a  dual car charger, extra ear buds and a cool carrying case - also a couple of USB chargers (one android for headphones and one for my iPhone)."
1,works great. the fit is great too
1,"So far much better than the slabs I tried first.  Much more comfortable, very good sound quality and they seem to stay put.  The over ear flap doesn't fit that snugly but the ear buds do. And you can use them for a phone call if one comes in while you are using them.  Like them a lot so far."
1,"I did not want noise cancelling so not a problem,  when outside if windy there is noise which makes it difficult to hear but I do like them overall"
1,"These were a great investment. They worked perfectly for my workouts for 2.5 years, and I sweat a lot. No issues there. After 2.5 years, they’d no longer charge adequately, so I’m upgrading to the newer model. I can’t complain for the low price compared to quality and length of life."
0,"These have functioned OK so far.  However, I'm not sure I would recommend them for several reasons.  They are heavy on the bass, but it's not a good sound.  It reminds me of the sound of the cheap car stereo I had in my first car, with cheap speakers.  I would lower the treble and crank the bass.  It was a bad, muffled bass-heavy sound.  So it's not good that these remind me of that.  Also, they are accidentally turned on far too easily.  I keep them in their original case in my book bag. They are off when I put them in the case, and later I often find that they are on and connected to a device.  And finally, they get tangled up with the seatbelt in my truck when I have them draped around my neck, but not in my ears. When I remove my seatbelt, the ear hook of the left earpiece gets caught on it.  On a frustrating day, that nearly led to a &#34;Snoopy lawnchair moment&#34;.  The cord keeper disappeared on the third day of use.  I never used it anyway, so I don't miss it.  A spare cord keeper is supplied with the earbuds, along with extra earpieces of varying sizes, a car charger, short and long USB to micro USB charging cables with a lightning connector adapter (the earbuds have a micro USB port)."
1,The Senso Bluetooth Headphones were received and are working great. I had no trouble connecting to my transmitter and the sound is wonderful.
0,"Product already stopped holding charge, attempted to try several other cords and outlets to make sure it wasn’t user error. Not pleased with quality at all."
1,I just keeply LOVE them. They are everything I was looking for in headphone plus more. The sound it's just great. There is so many GREAT things I could say about These Bluetooth headphones but the price and the Dual charger for the car was the finish touch for me !!! GET THEM
0,Kept cutting in and out. Never had a strong connection to my iPhone 6 or 7. Super disappointed. Returned them.
1,Very nice
1,The sound for the money you can't beat
1,"Great head set. Was worried when reviews commented in ear books.. I use them mostly for work which has me removing buds, and hanging from my ear.. works great so far..<br />Slight suggestion I would like to give is to be able to skip songs on headset, and piece for the cord that would help shorten it.. Small details but helpful..<br />I am very satisfied, probably best cordless headset I've used so far; which is 5 different types.<br />Congrats on a great, well made product. The warantee certainly makes it comfortable knowing you have quality product. Plus, can't beat the price for it<br />Thank you!"
1,Great headphones. I live in the gym and the battery life for these headphones are great. Good quality for a great price.
1,"I must say that I am impressed. I've tried over a 8 to 10 different Bluetooth units and so far these are the Leader of the Pack. Great Quality and surprising level of volume available. Lot of extras including in the box, very easy to pair, and nice fit - Plus the price was a Bonus!"
1,"The headphones work well, are easy to use, and sound great.  The company has excellent customer service."
1,Used them for a couple years for exercise. Good battery life and totally sweatproof.
1,Exelente Quality for the money. As far as 23 days in use everything good. Lest see how is in a later review.
0,"They started off great, sound quality is impressive for the price. However, they stopped charging after a few months of use. It's unfortunate that I haven't been able to get atleast a years worth of time out of them."
1,Replace a high priced set with the Sensos. I was totally surprised with the quality and sound. Better than the ones I paid twice as much for.
1,"Absolutely love Senso earbuds!  The sound is amazing!  They charge quickly & hold their charge at least 8 hrs straight. However, my earbuds, purchased Mar. 2018, suddenly died and will not charge!  I’m so lost without them...  How does the warranty work?"
1,Mono sound quality
1,"Have not opened this pair yet.  Bought them for my husband for his birthday. I’ve have mine for almost a year and have enjoyed them tremendously.  Easy to pair up, easy to use, great tone and charge lasts quite a long time.  Can’t wait to see how much he enjoys his!"
1,I bought these ear buds on Amazon prime day. I got a great deal and a great pair of wireless ear buds. Thanks
1,Nice
1,"Got a pair of these a few weeks ago and let me tell you I was shocked at the quality sound you get from these for the amount of money spent.  They paired right up to my iPhone 6 Plus in seconds and stay connected without fail.  You can tell that the manufacturer really put some thought into this product - the packaging was nice and the whole kit came with some very nice extras including an attractive storage case, car dual USB port charger, cable that doubles as both a micro USB/ lightning charge cable, and three sets of plugs that will fit most any ear.  I saw an ad today for a pair of Beats wireless earbuds of similar design for $199.  While I'm sure that they probably sound great I just can't see paying such an insane amount of money for something that probably isn't much better than what this product offers.  They're well made and very comfortable as the material used is very soft and flexible.  They stay in your ears well.  If you are budget minded and want a great set of earbuds you really can't go wrong with these!"
1,Best wireless headphonesbive purchased so far! Little bulky but better than expected!
1,"Excellent headphones, the only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because they sometimes seem to have a connection disturbance and I'll get spotty sound.  I'm still trying to pinpoint the exact issue, but I haven't been able to as of now.  I do a lot of trail running and love these so much that I bought a pair for my wife, and she loves them too."
1,This headphones surpassed my expectations given what I paid for them. They fit well in my ear: works better with the connecting cable placed in front and under the chin instead of the back of the neck).<br /><br />It does cancel noise completely so that is something to keep in mind when buying this product. Sound is not top notch but it is definitely not bad at all. I like the design and look of it.<br /><br />It is also very practical with up and down volume setters and a function to click on the right side piece once to pause sound.<br /><br />Overall exceptional product for the price!!!
1,"truthfully I found the bass too strong and there is no adjustment.  They also do not stay in the ear well, but neither do the Apple ear pods so maybe its me.  Having said that I used them for a year and just this week they stopped connecting to my Bluetooth.  Cant seem to get any help with this so I am tossing in the trash."
1,"So far, I am very happy with my sensor active buds.<br />I will recommend these to my friends. Thank you."
1,Work fine.  But sound is definitely muffled. Tried all different ear pieces.
1,"So far these work great. Sound is good, and comfort level is good as well. Only thing I can say that somewhat bothers me is (and this seems to be the case with most of these earbud products) the power/pause button is on the side. So when you put them on you inevitably push the button while trying to push them in your ear. Wish it was in a different spot. Otherwise these are pretty good."
1,Bought for someone else. He said the the sound is great and the fit is great also. He only gave 4 stars bc it’s still trying to get used to the button functions. I was extremely shocked at the packing presentation. I would give it 5 stars for that alone
1,"These headphones are the best ones I've found so far, the sound is awesome and they are comfortable to, great for running, I let my wife try them and she loves them, so it looks like I'll be buying a second pair for her"
1,"Amazing Sound with great bass. I have tried so many earphone at different price so after lot of research I got the right one with right price. At this price its really good product, comfortable and also comes with different size earbuds so not to worry about the proper set up in the ear, wire Tie to adjust the wire, silicon ear hook is very soft and fitted properly. Also like the headphone carry case its looking very nice."
0,the sound on these is all blown out bass
1,Great sound. Super fast shipping. Highly recommend!
1,Fit great sounds terrific
1,Seem to be great although only used them once. Sound quality is great and they are very comfortable.
0,"They sound really good but the quality control needs work. These came in with one side having all treble and the other all bass and broke completely within the first week, still needs some work."
1,Absolutely love these!  Quality of sound was above expectations and comfort level was better than my Bose noise canceling headphones. They stay put even when I'm doing plyometrics...  Very satisfied with this purchase!!!
1,"For the price these are great head phones, they sound great when i use the phone, they sound great when i listin to music and they sound great when i watch videos on youtube. Great deal"
1,"Pros:<br />- sound quality and volume is great<br />- the extras (i.e. carrying case) you get with them are above and beyond what you would get with similar products<br />- loved that they come with 3 different sized ear buds, especially because the default size is always too big for me<br />- quick delivery<br />- company followed up to ensure that I liked the product (even if it's a auto email, it's still a nice touch)<br />- long battery life<br /><br />Cons:<br />- the piece that goes over my ear doesn't fit as snugly as I would like, but I don't think that is the fault of the ear buds (I have weird shaped ears)<br /><br />I would have given them 5 stars since I really only had 1 con to report, but I save my 5 stars for items that fit me perfectly. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with this product and will definitely recommend it to others!"
1,"Took a couple of tries to get it to sync to my phone (Samsung S8+), but was not difficult to do. Sound is good and range is about 30 feet+/-. Does a  good job of killing outside noise, battery life has been good. Turning on and off can be a bit of a challenge sometimes, but i think that is just me.<br />The only issue I have is that the audio output keeps kicking off which requires me to pull up my bluetooth settings for the headphones and turn it on, not a big deal but none the less a pain."
1,"Sound is fantastic, pairing was super fast and simple!  Stoked!"
1,"When I first received the ActivBuds I had difficulty getting set up and connected.  I easily contacted the support techs and explained my problem.  The tech was very helpful, very patient, and got me going quickly.  It is much simpler to get connected than I made it.  Seems I try to create my own method without the instructions.<br /><br />The device itself fits well and stays in place.  Although my activities do not include much vigorous exercise it appears the ear loop will work well for those who do.<br /><br />Sound is good, they are comfortable and I appreciate the light weight.  I would buy them again."
1,These senso earbuds are fantastic! No problems connecting to my Android and the sound quality is Crystal clear.
1,These lasted just over a year before the left ear piece shorted out.
1,Not hanging on the ear. It comes out while running on the treadmill. :(
1,amazing quality for the price
0,"I've been using these for about 6 months now and they _had_ been absolutely wonderful (good audio balance, no rattling buttons while exercising, moisture-wicking, effective ear wraparound) until the battery suddenly died last week.<br /><br />It previously would hold charge for about two or three weeks of daily half-hour use. Out of nowhere, the battery dropped to only lasting a day, and drains to 0 in that short a time whether I use them or not."
1,Very happy with this purchase. My cord was getting in the way of my arm swinging while I was walking this makes it so much easier.
0,Illfitting earpiece.
1,"For the price, these are amazing. I can put them in and drown out conversations and other noise in the break room. I use them daily at work and even at home."
1,"I do like that these are wireless and still stay in place when i run. They last maybe 4 hours on a charge which is a trip and a half to the gym for me so i have to charge after every use. They are a little clunky on your ears but not uncomfortable.  The sound is weird. It seems to be louder and clearer from the left side than the right side. Its not a deal breaker, just unfortunate."
1,good for the price
0,Terrible - the audio crackles and cuts out every other second - even when my iPhone is only a foot away. This is the second pari that I've tried - so I have no idea why these are s popular on Amazon. Audio is just OK.
1,This was a gift for my grandson and he hasn't taken them off since they arrived.
1,"This is my third set.  They connect to Bluetooth easily, sound great & are not too expensive.  My only complaint with this set is that they’re not as comfortable as my other sets."
0,"1. After 20-30 minutes they become uncomfortable<br />2. The loop (behind the ear) that holds the earbuds is somewhat flimsy, when the back of the wire (even with the smart clip) gets stuck due to turning the head, the ear loop gets pulled off.<br />3. The sound quality is inferior.<br />4. The headphones arrived and same day an email from vendor asked for a 5 star feedback.<br />Would not recommend them."
1,"Love em! Sound great, seem to be very well made. Much better quality than what you but<br />I'm soon retail stores."
1,Great value for cheap price
1,Love!! Just received two days ago and I haven't taken them off. I lost a pair of beats and these replacements are as good and more comfortable! Thank you!!
1,"Comfortable and affordable. Only issue I have is when I am listening to something via my phone, and I receive a phone call, the program/song continues in the background when I take the call instead of pausing."
1,these are the bomb can charger my phone at the same time as Iam chargering the head set
1,"Have had these for a little over a week and am pleased with the purchase. Sound quality is great. Have been to the gym a couple times and on a couple runs and these headphones remain secure in my ears. Much better at noise-cancelling than the traditional iPhone earbuds I was using before; otherwise this is my first sport headphone so don't have much to compare it to. The over-ear hooks are extremely soft and limber which took me by surprise because I thought it would be more stiff. Works like a charm and is comfortable. Earbuds fit nicely and it comes with different sizes. Have yet to try my other options since the original size did the trick. Only criticism is I have had a couple instances of dicey playback, but that could be simply be my data connection and nothing to do with the headphones."
0,After 4 months they are dead
1,"great sound, easy set up."
1,"My best work out buddy now, great sound effect!"
1,"On time, good quality"
1,If you move around a lot in the gym these have a tendency to pull out of your ear when the strap is behind the neck. It's annoying.<br /><br />Now I just put the strap in front of my neck and they stay out.
0,"The headphones were great while they worked (which was less than 1 month after purchase). Easy to use and fit comfortably, but the right earpiece stopped working within a month of purchasing. Not worth buying considering how quickly they broke."
1,"The cable tends to pull and the earbuds don't always stay snug in your ears. As a result, I find that I was constantly adjusting and readjusting these headphones during my workout at the gym. Very annoying!"
1,"On week 3 and so far so very good.  Sound is good - for me comparable to Beats.  Holds a charge for about a week (which for me is 6-7 hrs).  Comfy. I actually like the soft silicone ear wraps.  They irritate less than the hard plastic of Beats. Pairing with my iPhone was trivially easy and smooth.  Has a 1 yr warranty, which alleviated my concern about trying such an inexpensive product.  If these keep on working over the course of several months, I will up this to 5 star review."
1,Comfortable.  Connect via Bluetooth without a problem.
1,"I have only had these ear buds for a few days, but WOW!!! So far I'm loving them, they were super easy to pair, the sound is fantastic and the noise cancellation is superb. My husband called while I was wearing them and even he was impressed with the sound during our phone conversation. It's not an easy feat to impress him either. And it's very easy to switch modes to take a call.<br />Also, I have recieved two emails since I've had them from the company making sure I am happy with my purchase and offering to make it right if I'm not. If these things keep working like they have I hope to never have to contact customer service, but it sure is nice to know that someone still cares about the customer and wants to make sure their happy!! Thank you for a great product at a great price!"
1,"Best purchase I have made to date. Batteries last a long time and the headphones don't fall out of my ears when I run. Range is also very good, I can easily leave my phone on one side of the gym while working out on the other side."
1,Bought it 3 weeks ago. Battery still works and I haven't charged it. Great quality. Loud.
1,Item arrived on time! Package was as seen on site. Item works perfectly! &#34;
1,"I have been looking for a set of Bluetooth Headphones but was hesitant due to sound quality. These have not disappointed, the sound is really good, loud and the bass is deep. They stay in your ears and are not heavy, I have forgotten I had them in a times. I have only had them for a few days now but I am really happy with them."
1,"Bought to replace a paid Dre Beats that went thru washing machine.<br />These Senso's fit better and sound better than the beats at a fraction cost.  I found the beats always falling off ear during workouts, these so far stay put much better"
1,"Awesome sound, price and support!!!!! I was a Beats guy all the way and I lost my set a few days ago and did not want to spend 200 bucks. I read the reviews on these and decided to try them. I am super pleased!! No more Beats for me !!!!"
1,Very good bloodroots headphones the price. They connect easily to my iPad Pro 11 and iPhone XR.
1,Worked awesome until my cat got a hold of them....don't leave these out.
0,They have great sound but the hooks that go around the ear have no Skelton or resistant in the rubber. They fall out of the ear very easily. Only reason for the star is cause of the sound.
1,"Excellent Sound Quality, buds can stay in my ears for quite some time before feeling uncomfortable. Left Earbud failed within just under one year. Called Senso Customer support for assistance, and they shipped me a brand new pair within 7 days because headphones are under a One Year Warranty. Very happy with the product and Customer Support"
0,Break very easy. Had multiple issues with these headphones. Best place for them is the trash.
1,"They are a xmas present, so have not been used yet"
0,Meh. Uncomfortable. Too much bass for earbuds. Too loud on lowest setting. Short battery life.
0,"Super excited to tries these out today when I got home today after reading the great reviews... only to hear humming in the left ear piece as a few people have recently mentioned. Maybe there is a bad batch out right now, I'm not sure. One thing I am sure of is that it's pretty annoying between songs or if I'm listening to speech. Not bad if you have a constant stream of music going though. They were comfy during my workout and they didn't budge while skipping rope which was nice. Would have rated higher without the annoying humming/buzz.<br /><br />(Edit) dropped to two stars for the highly annoying buzzing and no resolution with the confident solution provided in the comments."
0,These headphones were horrible. I bought them for working out and they keep cutting in and out worst headphones I ever owned. Can’t walk a block and they cut out then connect horrible product.
1,Good sound and voice capabilities. Keep a charge for a while. Not as sweat-proof as I would have liked.
0,Did not stay waterproof after the first use
1,"These earbuds are great.  I use them almost every day.  Sound is great.  They're comfortable and stay on my ears.  Getting the computer to recognize them can be a hassle but it's not the fault of the earbuds. Battery life is sometimes an issues, but only because I use them so much. Decent price, great product, definitely recommend.  I would post it if they weren't good."
1,Really easy to use and pair with phone. Excellent value for money
1,These work great! I use them often for studying as well as running.
1,"I've been a Bose user but must admit that these Senso earbuds top them. Better fit, cord doesn't move to one side of my shoulders and terrific sound. I noticed a bit of wind sound running downhill but that disappeared. At less than $40 it's a steal. I'm buying a couple more!"
1,I had a pair of these initially with the static ear pieces and bought a second pair for at work and home. The moldable ear pieces don't hold their shape and fall off my ears. Still haven't decided if I'm going to return them or not. Not super happy about ordering the same exact product 6-8 months later and getting completely different accessories and hardware. The headphones even sound different than my old ones.
0,"Sounds fine when listening to calls and music but the callers always have a difficult time hearing me as the microphone is too far from the mouth. When the phone is in my pocket and I bend over, I lose signal and they disconnect. Not great..."
1,"They paired easily with my phone over Bluetooth, no problems there. These are bass-heavy headphones, if you care about that, to balance the sound out I lowered the bass frequencies and increased midrange frequencies a bit on my phone's equalizer."
1,"For the price you get the headphones, a case and all the accessories you could possibly want. All that and the quality of the fit, the sound and the battery life our top notch. Give these a try!"
1,Just received them and only worn once.  They were easy to set up and very comfortable.  Sound was great.  I would definitely recommend them.  I have small ears and they worked very well.
1,The Senso wireless ear buds are the  best all around headphones ever owned. The  bass and sound quality is exceptional in a  earbud and they stay put while jogging. Mic is also superior compared to other solutions. Very happy with purchase. Highly recommended.
1,Comfortable and light and they deliver pretty decent sound quality. No complaints about them so far.
1,Love them
1,Just as stated!!!it works!!!
1,Very nice headset. Accessories a nice bonus
1,"I love these headphones design, fit, quality sound and price for quality (value). I have been so pleased I have given 2 sets to my daughters and have bought 3 sets for myself (for home, office and travel)."
1,Great sound quality for an amazing price!
1,"Great sound quality. Only complaint is that they're too loud... as in, the lowest volume level is too loud to use these at my desk. They're not noise canceling, but they definitely drown out a lot of background noise, so these are way too loud in a cubicle setting. Nevertheless, I bought them for working out so the volume is perfect for that and it's helpful that they're water resistant. Been using for about a month and no issues at all. Battery life is great. Have only needed to charge them twice, although they're only on for about an hour a day, 5x a week. I highly recommend. Fully charged and ready to use right out of the box."
1,Great Headphones
1,"Great headphones - professional packaging with laminated instructions, quality cord and a number of accessories for car/different earbuds.  They include a pair of earplug-like foam earbuds as well as the typical silicon cups.  I've bought two pairs of bluetooth headphones in the past which didn't sound good and didn't last long either, but the sound quality and materials seem much better on these.  As mentioned, the quality of the packaging is worth mentioning with laminated instructions, clamshell accessories case etc. . ."
1,Fantastic quality and sound. I highly recommend these!
1,I like that you can control volume from the headphones instead of using phone controls. Hooks up instantly using Bluetooth.
1,I've only used them a handful of times but they are working out great. Music is clear and the earbuds stay in during my runs.
1,"I love my headphone, I previously owned beats but they broke easily.  I have had these for months and they work amazing!  They fit well on my ear & don’t move when I do my weights & my cardio.  Also my headphones dropped & I had purchased the one year warranty & they got back to me within the hour & have shipped a new pair to me within days to replace my dropped headphones.  I am definitely sticking to these headphones."
1,"I just purchased these headphones. They sound great and seem to be a good fit. The question I cannot answer is whether they will last. As of now, I must give them 5 stars."
0,I was happy with the sound quality for the price...<br />But The on/off button broke in the first 2 months of moderate use.<br />Sad to see that planned rapid obsolescence is in effect everywhere these days.
1,My daughter is 13 and DRE ear buds is what she wanted.  I can't afford them and bought her this set.  She is already wearing them out.  She walks around life with these buds on her ear.....  YES I would say it was a success.<br />Thank you
1,"Received a few hours ago and was excited to give them a go. I bought these to keep in my car and use when I'm out and about and don't have my other headphones. I have a few higher end pairs that I use at the gym and around the house. The sound quality is not the same, but I didn't expect them to be. With that said though the sound quality isn't bad. For what I paid I got more than expected on my end though. They fit really well. Comes with different size earbuds, car charger (lightening and Micro USB adapter), USB charger for the earbuds and a case. Happy with the purchase. Feels like a steal at this price."
0,"Sorry I am returning this product. I can't keep them on my ears. They fall off. I haven't even got to connect to music , what's the use when I can't wear them."
0,"These were THE BEST HEADPHONES EVER... until one day they just died. Like, they just don't turn on anymore. When I plug them in, I see the blue light which means they are fully charged. When I disconnect it from the powercord, then they won't actually turn on. When I contacted Senso Support I received the following message:<br /><br />""Actually, due to the inherent nature of electronic products, sometimes there are instances when some products turn out defective after some use. Unfortunately, our warranty department tried to process a replacement for you but our system rejected it as the warranty of your headphones has been expired. The warranty started on the initial date of purchase and is no longer valid.""<br /><br />So if you do purchase them, my recommendation is to use the warranty before your 1 year runs out, just IN CASE they decide to die on you and then you are left with nothing."
1,"My Sons were very happy with this headset.  I plan to buy one for myself in the future should my current head set go bad.  They sound clear to both the listener and the speaker and the range is pretty good.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for set of Bluetooth headphones.  The included car charger and multifunctional charging cable is an added bonus.  Even the packaging was above par.  I would not hesitate to purchasing these in the future.  My Son comments is he loves them cause they do not fall of when jogging.  My other son wants to test them in the shower, I told him not to test fate, but its nice to know they can withstand water and sweat.  Great investment"
0,It looks great. Have had it for 2 months now and it has started to go bad. Lot of disturbance when listening and phone is in my pocket. Use it mainly for my workout and long walks... I wish I hadn't missed the return window on this item.
1,They work great. Very easy to use.  The sound excellent.<br />I am really happy I got them.<br />Sometime though they feel uncomfortable after wearing them longer.<br />All in all a great buy.<br />Just one thing: you have to increase volume from the phone first and then adjust it from the headphones.
1,Love these. I have small ears and I have a hard time finding ear buds that are comfortable. Great sound quality. Easy to use. Comfortable fit. I use these for every run and haven't had an issue as of now.
1,"Fantastic product with amazing customer service.  They pair easily with an iPhone 6s, they sound great with iTunes and when talking on the phone.  I wish they had a local mute button and two magnets to hold the buds together when not in use.  Minor issues in my opinion."
0,"These headphones are decently comfortable (could fit my ears better but are fine) and have decent sound especially for the price, but the bluetooth connection is highly annoying.<br /><br />For starters, I'm pairing these with an iPhone 6s running iOS version 12.1.2. Pairing these is relatively easy, which is a good thing. With bluetooth turned on for your phone or iPad, you turn the headphones on my pressing and holding the main button on the right ear bud. They announce ""power on"" through the speakers, then you'll see them as an available bluetooth device on your phone. Push connect and they start working. Battery life is decent (lasts several jogs or long walks before needing another charge) and the sound quality is decent except in windy conditions.<br /><br />So what's the downside, especially for $30? Well, that's the first time you connect and pair the headphones with your device. The second time, the headphones pair automatically with your phone as you power up. Unfortunately, on the second and subsequent pairings, the bluetooth connection drops about every 5 seconds. There will be a soft beep, then the headphones go silent for 2-3 seconds, then another beep and they re-connect and resume playing. That keeps happening over and over. I found that to avoid consistently dropped bluetooth connections I have to go into my phone, find these headphones from my list of bluetooth devices, have my phone ""forget this device"", then re-pair the phone and headphones as if it was a brand new set of headphones. If I delete and re-initialize the headphones before every time I use the headphones, they work great. If I just turn the headphones on and go, they really suck.<br /><br />So... Maybe they work better with Android devices or phones newer than an iPhone 6s, or maybe the next iteration of iOS will fix this bug. I'd likely have given these 4 stars if they didn't have to be re-initialized every time I used them, but I can only give them a single star so long as this defect continues. In the end they work well, especially for the price, but they are super annoying."
1,I bought these for my husband and he loves them. He says that they fit perfectly and block out all surrounding sounds.
1,Comfortable - great range and sound for $30 - can't go wrong.
1,"I have used multiple sets of headphones. I use them on a daily basis while at the gym. These are by far the most comfortable, best fitting, light weight wireless headphones with great sound."
0,Ehh not that great got them today didn't stay in ☹️
1,Very solid product so far. I got tired of purchasing 5 and below/ Marshalls electronics section wired headphones.... i.e. having to buy new ones multiple times a year because they get twisty or short out or simply tangled and stop working in one or both ears. So I figured I'd pony up a few more bucks and get something Bluetooth/ wireless. Well the packaging and use is very well done. Range from my phone is impressive. Noise cancellation is very good and the sound quality is recording studioesque! It was very easy to unbox and pair with my Apple iPhone 6S Plus. I was not certain about the rectangular modules that the buds are attached to for fear of looking like Lando Calrissian's assistant in the Empire Strikes Back!!! (Lol) .... no worries....they are minimal in size/ sturdy and comfortable. I am very pleased with my purchase and if these bad boys hold up over the long run I will be a loyal SENSO fan for life! I would highly recommend this product. My music PUMPS and I am free of the dangly wire!!!! Oh yeah!
1,"Just what I needed, set up was very easy"
1,I like the fact that they are wireless so when I do exercises they don't get in the way like regular head phones do.
0,Complete crap too hard to assemble and use
1,"Especially for the price, these is a great par of headphones.  Comfortable to wear and the sound is best in the highs and lows - midrange is so-so.  Unfortunately, I was hoping to use them under my full-face motorcycle helmet.  There is no way I can get the helmet on with these in my ears.  The quest for decent sound on 2 wheels continues."
1,"So far in the week I've had these ear buds, I've used them on a two hour walk on the beach and this morning on a 5K walk race. They have performed very well, are super comfortable and are a lot lighter than the on the neck Bluetooth headset I have been using on my walks.  I purchased these thinking that because they were inexpensive they probably would be ok, but not great.  I didn't want to invest in the expensive ones if it turned out I didn't like the style and figured I'd upgrade if the style worked for me.  No need to upgrade!!  These are great!"
1,"These headphones are the best. They offer good sound quality, can be loud, and fit comfortably, but most importantly they are durable and the company is very responsive and helpful all for 30$. This is my second pair because I love them so much, and the most recent ones I unfortunately lost. I use them daily for working out and walking to places (being on a college campus). When my first pair gave out after 8 months, the company sent me a replacement thanks to the warranty within 3 days of me emailing them. Overall, as long as this company continues to have excellent customer service I will buy these for life."
1,These work great but depending on the device you may experience jitter and connectivity issues.  The jitter usually happens when using it along with another app that uses wifi or gps like a run tracker.  Also the pairing can be iffy but nothing that isn't easily troubleshooted and fixed with a reset or power cycle.
1,"Only have used them once so far. But I really love them at this point. Very comfortable. Also, provide supplies necessary to keep you going (i.e. headphones, different size ear buds, charging cable for your headphones and phone(both iPhone and android), car charger, and case). Well done Senso!"
1,They work very well.<br />No complaints.
0,"These headphones pair fine with an iPhone, but they cut in and out constantly, which is especially frustrating when trying to work out. Do not purchase these headphones."
1,These work great and are a steal at the price.
1,"I think you'd be hard pressed to find better Bluetooth headphones for $30. Great battery life, sound quality and fit are good. I like to listen to my music loud when I'm at the gym and these work perfect turned up.<br /><br />03.13.18 -  left ear shorted out, which was probably my fault from being tugged on getting them in and out of my bag. I used these things everyday and I'm ordering another pair as soon as I complete this update."
1,It works. Looks nice.
0,"Headphones are comfortable, the mic to make calls is very good and they don't fall thanks to the rubbery half loop but connectivity has always been bad. I've had this for a while and I've been patient wondering if the poor connectivity was due to interference or where I was, but after trying them in every possible location w my iPhone 7 I concluded I will get rid of them. The headphones beep constantly as the Bluetooth connection is lost and regained. I use other devices connected to my phone via Bluetooth and never have a problem...so this set of headphones are going to the garbage."
1,"The sound quality is just all right. The microphone is pretty decent and clear though so that's a plus.<br />If you have cauliflower ear, they will not fit in your ear at all so stay away from these if you have cauliflower ear."
0,"Good audio, Broke because of sweat. Recommend to not workout with them on."
1,They are hard to hear out of when talking to people I just went back to my iPhone earphones
1,nice sound.
1,Good sound and fit for $30!
1,"The headphones are a good buy if they would have continued working. The sound is decent for the money, and they are comfortable. But after just 6 weeks of light use they no longer work.. I started having issues with the pairing being lost, and finally the Multi-function button lost its spring tension and will not turn on. I will try to contact the manufacturer for assistance and see how they handle defective products. I will write a follow up review after they have been given sufficient time to respond. As of now I can only give 3 stars, which is probably over rating it considering the limited use.<br /> The follow up:<br />The company responded quickly and offered a replacement without delay. The replacement is working fine, and I am using it at the gym and while running. As of now, I am very happy with the product and the seller. 5 stars for the value and service."
1,"Very easy to pair with your bluetooth device and start using. The sound quality is very good. Great accessory package included with concise, easy instructions. My only complaint is that the earbuds don't stay in my ears as well as I would like. I suspect, however, that will likely be corrected when I try some of the larger ear buds that are included. Very good product, excellent value. Perfect for working out without having to deal with all the wires."
1,"Amazing headphone, love them, sound great, battery life is pretty decent and the sound quality is great too, for the price is worth the buy, I wish it could wirelessly charge but that would definitely bump the price, love them.truly"
1,Good product so far.
1,"Great for the price,  fit well, connect smoothly"
1,Ummm great deal for the cash!!! If I had four ears I’d buy another set right now
0,The headphones worked for a little over 1 year and then the left headphone stopped producing sound. I called to see of they could be replaced but the warranty only lasts for a year and I was over by a few months therefore they would not replace them. I understand that the product I received may be defective but they should at least last longer than 1 year.
0,"Right out of the box it synced to my iPhone for music. Every day I worked out for 1hr +. Hooked it up, would charge easily, ready to go for the day  YEAH!!.....  After 3 days they no longer worked. .....Blue light indicated charged, but did not work<br /><br />What I did NOT like from the beginning were the biggest of the ear hooks. They are soft and malleable, but did not keep their shape,  having to constantly readjusting while wearing<br /><br />If you have a really large skull these would likely be great.<br />  Sound was fine.<br />Their going back"
1,"I'm too cheap to spend money on Bose or Beats headphones and I needed something wireless to use for running/going to the gym. These headphones are...confusing. The sound quality is very good when they actually work. Some days I use these and they work perfectly the entire time. Other days the connection is poor for some unknown reason or the sound will constantly cut in and out. For the price, they're worth a try compared to much more expensive brands. But they could definitely be better."
1,"Great quality at a great price.  Noise cancellation delivers, and the charging cable with lightning adapter is a really cool addition"
1,"This was a great acquisition. They work flawlessly, almost silencing my motorcycle while I cruise."
0,The button on mine just stopped working one day. I left a review before and i need them to get in touch with me so we can sort this out. These are a great pair of headphones and i like them a lot but i cant do anything with them because the button to turn it on or off is stuck in place.
1,The headphones were delivered on time and in perfect condition. Setting them up and getting them paired with my iPhone 7 was super easy and I'm really happy with the quality. Best way to start out the new year! Definitely recommended.
1,"They seem ok, however the overthe ear piece is really flimsy and I don't know if they will stay in my ears during running..."
0,"These are probably the most expensive Bluetooth headphones I've purchased and also the worst. The left ear bud does not stay in place, so when I'm running it constantly falls out of my ear. If the earpiece that goes around your ear were flexible and were able to be bent into a specific shape (i.e., the shape of my ear) these would be great. But unfortunately, they do not. I do not love these and I would highly recommend another bluetooth headphone product and/or brand."
0,They don’t always connect wirelessly
1,So far I'm really enjoying these. The fit is pretty comfortable and the sound is great.<br />I would definitely recommend.
1,"Sound great and are comfortable, really like them!"
1,"about 10.5 months into using and loving these headphones the left one stopped working.  customer service was prompt in replying to me with ideas of how to get it to work again. When these attempts failed, they shipped me a replacement pair of headphones at no cost right away. Grade A customer service. Will buy again."
1,Wanted to wait and see how they performed on the jobsite.  After a year of hard use I must says these are a GREAT value
0,"The build quality seems fine and they are definitely functional. I kind of think most of the add-ins like the car charger and case are kind of silly. I am returning these because they are obnoxiously bass-y. I like my bass for the genres of music that deserve bass, but I listen to a lot of jazz but mostly podcasts while I'm working and the amount of bass these put out is simply unacceptable in my opinion.<br /><br />If you like bass, go for these because they seem perfectly acceptable otherwise."
0,The glue are weak
1,"Great headphones with good quality of sounds, clear in classical music and nice bass in rock music. It won't goo wrong with what you added going to pay this awesome price. Like to mention the package and accessories are impressed as well."
1,"The price for these headphones is within a reasonable range for anyone wanting to try out Bluetooth headphones for the first time. These are my first and I was happy with the purchase after I tried them out for a week or two. They have great range, are very comfortable, and the audio is quite good. The battery life on these are as described and last a long time before needing to be charged. The only setback I've had with them is the fact they don't block out too much sound for me from my surroundings and they malfunctioned a little at the beginning for how far I could go from my phone. The distance disparity was gone after the third time I tried it out and have been quite happy with them since. Also a side note, the accessories that came with it are really fantastic."
1,Bought these for my son and he just loves them. We have go through several throughout the years but by far these are the best we have purchased! Would highly recommend.
1,"Very nice headphones, quick charging,  easy to understand, fast syc. Noise canceling is great."
0,"These broke within 2 weeks of purchasing.  I also had a lot of trouble with the bluetooth connection, it kept unpairing from my device.  Would not recommend buying"
1,I love the fact that it's wireless so you don't have wires hanging all around you.  It's lightweight and easy to put on your ears.  Great sound too.  I just bought a pair for my daughter-in-law as a birthday present.  Hopefully she will like them as much as I do.
1,"I've been an avid exerciser my whole life, both as a runner and a gym rat.  Nothing irks me more than having to stop and fiddle/fix my earbuds, much less have a pair that keep falling out.  The SENSO Bluetooth headphones not only sound great, but are comfortable and stay in place quite well.  They also have remote controls for power and sound control on the earpiece itself.  Syncing it with my phone was a snap and the charging port couldn't be more simple.  It comes with adapters to get the perfect fit inside your ear, but I didn't need them. Adjusting the outer hook was also easy. I also really appreciate the small case it comes with to protect my headphones in my gym bag when I'm not using them. You would think a product with  all these features would be so much more expensive, but for the quality at this price, there is no reason to spend more!"
1,"Update 10/18/2017:<br />Having used the earbuds for longer I've seen some strengths and weaknesses. The initial sound issue I had seemed to have gone away one day after turning them off and on again... now the sound quality is quite good (I'd say ~8.5/10, definitely good enough for the gym). However, I've noticed that I get a lot of distortion and interference when I'm at the gym around other people's Bluetooth headphones. Not sure if this is common with Bluetooth as these are my first Bluetooth headphones I've used at the gym. That being said, I still think these are great exercise headphones especially if you can get them for a good price.<br /><br />Old review below:<br />-------------------------------------------------------------<br />They fit good and stay in place nicely during exercises,  and they don't hurt my ears after a good amount of use like other ear buds do, however the sound quality is not superb like I had hoped for.<br /><br />Overall the sound is a little muffled and has limited range,  vocals are drowned out and the base starts to pop and crack on higher volumes. It becomes intolerable at higher volumes.<br /><br />Overall I'd say it's good enough as something to workout with, but I wouldn't consider these to be perfect all around headphones."
1,"Totally worth it. Who cares if a few people had a couple bad apples.  Having had the original power beats³ and stepping on them,  I wasn't about to unload more money.  Get these instead and buy the 4 year extended warranty for 8 bucks.  2 bucks a year would take care of any negative reviews posted for these.  Sound quality and battery life are great.  Highly recommend"
1,"I've only used them a few times but so far I love them! I have never been able to keep ear buds in my ears, had no problem with these. Sounds great."
1,"I have a 2 to 3 hour commute to and from work every day. I walk to a commuter train station, board a train to NYC, then take a subway. I listen to podcasts and music while trapped in these cans of people.  These headphones are amazing. I would routinely go through 3 to 4 wired headphones a year. The Achilles heel was always the wire failing. These have less wire to tangle and thus less opportunity to bend and break over time. I have had these for 3 months now without any problems. On my iPhone I can even see battery level, which is helpful. There's a learning curve though, you need to shut them off when not using. I do work out at the gym, hike and sweat like a pig anyway. Sweat and rain have had no major problems. Buy them, best money you will spend."
1,"Nice packaging, I liked that they came with a 2-in-one charging cord, an extra (shorter) charging cable, a car charger adapter, and several options of covers for the ear bud part. I have small ears and the smallest one fits perfectly. The downside of small ears is that the piece that fits over the top of my ears is a little too big, but this isn't really a problem. The sound is good, these are a good value for the price. I can't yet speak to how long they hold a charge because I haven't used them to that level yet. Will udpate if I experience anything notable."
1,"I really love the sound quality of these headphones. I am seeming to have trouble with my left earphone. It causes a sharp pain on my ear after about thirty minutes of use. I am trying all of the eartips, and the largest ear tip works, for now. I just hope my left ear stops hurting."
0,These broke within a month. Returned!
0,"They worked well for three months and I liked them during that time. However, they stopped working today and would no longer turn on. I played with them a bit, and tried a few different button combinations to see if that would work. Instead, the volume button popped off and I'm stuck with a flimsy paperweight."
1,"This is my second pair of these headphones because I love them!  I accidentally drove over my first pair after dropping them on the ground.  I bought a different brand to replace those originally, but they could not compare.  Had to go back to what worked so well before.  Glad I did!"
1,Easy setup power button broke eventually
1,Sound is very good...I've got no complaints.  Pleasantly surprised @ the quality for the price.
1,Bought a pair for hubby and son. Both are super hard to buy electronics for and they both love them! I listened to my son's and just ordered my own!<br />Update: We had an issue with one of our headphones. Customer service was awesome! Had a new set within a couple days!
1,"The headphones are good, I enjoy that they have the ear hooks. The headphones holds a decent charger and doesn't take to long to recharge. The only thing I don't like but is tolerable is the bass. Some songs have deep bass that distorts when playing. Other than that it is a good set of wireless headphones."
1,These ear buds fit comfortably and the sound quality is good. They paired and performed as advertised. The packaging was slick as well. I recommend these ear buds for working out or chillin on the beach.
0,"The sound quality is great, but not very &#34;bass-ey.&#34; Also, it only works if your phone is in your right pocket. I normally keep mine in my left pocket and as I walk, when the phone is at the furthest point across my body it cuts off on the headphones. I mostly notice this when i walk outdoors, it seems to be a non issue indoors. It proves to be an issue when I run. It should be noted that I'm only 6 ft tall. So if you are taller, it may be a greater issue for you."
1,"Definitely worth the money!! I’ve had em for a few months now and still work like new, they do have some bass to them but I like it so I don’t mind it. They seem to be at least sweat proof."
1,"Headphones are awesome. I love them. Battery is good and lasts a good while. They pair easily and I am impressed with how far I can get away from my phone, even through most walls. The sound is great too.<br />I have no experience with high end Bluetooth head phones, but these were everything I wanted and they sound better than I thought they would.<br />Only down side is they come a little loose running sometimes, but thet may be me not picking the right size rubber ear piece for it . They have never fallen off while running."
1,I love these headphones! I don't have a problem at the gym anymore which makes it much more enjoyable. Other headphones were falling out while trying to workout. They have every option you could want. I received them within 2 days! Great business!
1,"It's a great device, I love the little case that you sent with. Excelente option and not too expensive."
1,Great sound and most of all really comfortable. Item arrived a day earlier than expected . Thank you very much. &#34;
1,I've been using them since November 2018. I'm amazed that it has lasted so long. The battery life is still pretty good. The sound has a good bass.<br /><br />They are great for working out and since last year I've been using them daily;  because of COVID19 I have been using them always for phone calls because I work supporting health care workers and sometimes its safer to use a headphone for attending phone calls rather than using your cell phone directly.
1,"I really like  it  , it works really  good"
1,Inexpensive and works quite well.
1,"Great product, great customer service."
1,These work great
1,Great headphones.
1,"They're OK. Biggest issue for me is that bluetooth receiver is on right side of headphones, so does not connect well with my smartwatch worn on my left arm when running - sound constantly cuts in and out."
1,I bought these for my husband for Christmas and he loves them.  Easy to use.
1,"The Senso Buds have been GREAT! I have been and competitive/elite athlete since high school and music is always part of my ritual. Nice fit, great sound, and the accessory kit that you include is amazing added value. Company has reached out asking for feedback and seem to want to genuinely please their customers. I run, row, lift, jump rope and clean the house and have no problem with the buds slipping out. Thumbs up to the Senso Team"
1,"These headphones work great, and for the money, its hard to beat!"
1,These work very well and the volume goes higher then the normal phone Bluetooth headsets. I have used these on my ipad and android phone with no issues. Also comes with a nice case and charging cords.
1,Quite uncomfortable sound quality is good but hurts my ears and they look a bit bulky
1,Very pleased with these. Very comfortable and great range on Bluetooth.
1,So far so good!!  As good as the popular brand name!  Super Confortable and sound quality is great!!! I would say very similar but 80% lower price than a popular brand.
1,"Bought these as a gift for my sons.  They loved them.  My husband tried them and wanted a pair.  We even bought for the grandfathers.  Besides the noise cancelling, they are apparently very comfortable.  Bonus is the magnetic attachment for your car."
1,Work well
1,The Best bang for your buck . Everything you want in headphones.
0,I really wanted this to work. Unfortunately - it was DOA; so I have no idea how good or bad this headphone is.
1,"Initial quality is impressive. Feels like high quality materials. Sounds great! I had the beats earhook style earbuds before which were stolen and i bought these to replace those. Honestly these sounds as good, if not better than the beats i had. The bass is definitely better. The only con ive noticed is it sometimes takes a few extra seconds to secure a good quality connection, but that could also be an issue with my phone . Overall, best $30 ive spent."
1,"They are easy to use,soft small ear pieces cancel  out all outside noise.very good bass to treble reponse."
1,Amazing.. I Love it!
1,Hubby loves them!!!👌
0,The set died after six months of use. Died. Dead. Will not accept a charge. Additionally the unit is bulky and sticks out of ear very noticeably.  Also could not use to talk on phone while riding a bike. Any wind noise distorts the conversation and speaking is not possible. They were not expensive but will not repurchase.
1,Great headphones for a great price...one of the best Bluetooth/wireless headphones I have seen!!!
1,Good but I feel like the reviews are inflated a bit.<br /><br />Perfect for working out but wouldn't use them in everyday use.
1,Excellent quality for the price. Easy to set up and use.
1,I love the Bluetooth earbuds!  They were easy to pair with all of my Bluetooth devices!
1,Stay in my ears with movement and workout sweat! Exactly what I needed plus great sound : )
1,Connect easily.  Work well in sweat dripping conditions.
1,I love the headphones.
1,"Love the headphones.  Unfortunately, they stopped charging after 4 months. Customer service was great. Quick response and they're still covered under warranty so they've shipped out a new set.  Painless and quick."
1,"Great product, lots of extras. Well done."
0,"Save your money. Tried to make them work, kept losing the Bluetooth signal during my runs."
1,This item was great perfect just what I needed
1,Great for the price. Good battery life.
1,Excellent!
1,"I used these headphones for 3 years and bought them for tons of friends and family as a gift. Durability, sound quality, customer service, all first rate. Note that I used one set for three years.<br /><br />However, recently they made the ear hooks ""adjustable,"" meaning they changed them from a stiff, springy rubber to a flexible rubber. Since the new earhooks do not retain a shape, they are ineffective at holding them onto your ear during vigorous activity like punching a heavy bag or turning your head quickly while wearing a jacket. Senso, can you please correct this product deficiency? When you do, I will change my review back to the 5 stars you deserve."
1,"I've had them for over a month now, and used multiple times. I've ran with them in the cold, mist, and through a couple sprinklers, but not in the rain yet. So far they've been great! Sound quality is good. The package it comes with is great. I'd highly recommend it for $40."
1,"Not the most comfortable headphones, but they're pretty good for the price. The sound is great."
1,I love them!  Easy to use and great sound.
1,Great earbuds for the money .... a little stiff so they tend to lay more to one side or the other
1,I love not have a cord for my earbuds.  The sound is clear and the earbuds are comfortable.  The charger is easy to use and they have a good life when fully charged. I would recommend these for anyone tired of being hooked to your phone by a cord.
1,"Only had them a couple of days but work well, hopefully that continues!"
1,"Ive only had these a few days but they are wonderful. Easy to use, great sound!"
1,Great
1,Great sound and have stayed on thru every workout.
1,Great BT headphones
1,"I love these headphones! I wasn’t sure of the quality for the price but thought that I could give them a shot and I’m so glad I did! Great sound, easily synced to my Apple Watch for my workouts, lightweight, and the stay in place!"
1,This is my second order I really like these headphones they feel good in my ear. I don't like the fit on most headphones and the sound is great. My first pair failed a sound check with the bottom of  my boot. Oops.
1,Seem to be well made. Comfortable. Easy to connect. Great sound. Good quality cables and case. Really cool that it has the mirco usb and apple charging connector in the usb cable. Great product. Would definitely buy again.
1,Use these almost every day great for calls
1,I enjoy them!!! It was the best choice I made!!! I just purchased another pair my first ones  I had broken them......I loved them so much I bought another pair!!!!
1,Music earphones have proven to be great. I have used them at the gym and while in the steam room. I haven't ran into any issues as of yet it sucks that they want to review for their product within a week or less of purchase but like I said this product is great. By far better bang for your buck. Most people want to get those expensive 150 plus dollar earphones when you can just get these ones that are just as good at a fraction of the cost.
1,"These headphones are pretty great. They're super comfortable, they stay in place perfectly and I barely even notice they are there. Sound quality is fantastic, especially for the price. I use them primarily to work out and these are honestly the best pair of headphones, wired or wireless, for that purpose I've ever used."
1,"I was a little skeptical when I saw these.  How can they be all that good at that price?  I was impressed.  Great sound, great battery life, and very comfortable.  Nice job SENSO!"
0,"Stupid headphones barely connect to my phone, kill my battery and one side stopped working. Crap"
0,Didn't fit my ears very well.
1,"Love them! Great packaging, fancy charger. Instructions are easy to understand. Fit great, feel great, sounds great. Buy these!"
0,"They keep falling off my ears when doing the treadmill, and that's the only reason I got them for..."
0,"After a few months of use, the headphones would not connect to my phone."
1,"I needed to return one, the power switch button was stuck and the company sent me a brand new one (I returned the broken one) with fast shipping. Great customer service and a great sounding headphone. Don't waste your money on beats .......these headphones sound great and great for working out."
1,Awesome headphones! Great transaction!
0,Earphones arrived broken out of the package.
0,I had these for approximately three months and they worked fine. Today they stopped working.... Very disssapointing
0,"I have had the headphones for about 18 months. I was happy with them, until now. Recently, the headphones just began to shut off after a few minutes of use. I tried several resets, but the issue continues.<br />So, if you don't mind replacing headphones within a couple of years, these are for you. If you are looking for headphones that are not disposable, think twice about purchasing these."
1,Perfect for workouts. Comfortable and light weight. Amazing stereo sound quality. Better and cheaper than beats!
1,the best of the best . . .
1,Great earbuds great sound and louder than my LG tone<br />Packaging was very nice with charging cable and car adaptor and nice hard case with zipper
1,"I had an issue with the first pair I received, customer service was outstanding. I truly feel that they were tremendous in their communication and support. I am extremely satisfied and recommend Senso, Invotek, highly."
1,"Amazing! I bought some $129 Jayvbird blue tooth. 1) they didn't fit right 2) uncomfortable 3) sound was expected. These senso headphones blew it out the water and it came with additional useful accessories like a car port charger, iPhone 6 charger, micro USB/apple adapter. Sound quality is superb! Comfort<br />Level is great! Highly recommended. Returning my jay bird to Best Buy today! And buying these"
1,Great sound and customer service. I purchased these for running and love the over ear hooks. Impossible to dislodge these babies. Love them!
1,Work great. Love it.
0,"I wanted to like these for the price.  But wow, they quit working after 3 weeks.  For three weeks they worked fine, then the earbud on the right got staticky and the whole headset began cutting in and out.  I only used them to listen to music and take calls in my car while driving.  Shouldn't have issues at all, let alone after three weeks.<br /><br />Otherwise, sound was fine for the price, Bluetooth connectivity was decent and easy to set up.  I wish the quality had been better.  If you're one of the lucky ones who get a set that doesn't end up with issues more power to you, but these are going back.  Will order some other brand."
1,Starts to develop problems after a while.
1,"Overall pretty decent headphones.  I mainly use when I am out riding my mountain bike and these have been a blessing.  Great fit, great sound, easy pause/on-off/volume buttons and quick charging. Carrying case with extra ear bud, car charger, and multi phone charger as well. Only flaw I would say is that they sometimes cut out while I am riding, and my phone is on my hip about 3ft away from them.  When I am in the house, will easily go 15-25ft before cutting out."
1,Saw on Amazon and the product looked good and a great price. Would highly recommend them to anyone that wants to improve their sound.
1,Great for me while I'm working out! Excellent sound. The only earphones I Will ever use!
1,"i like it but idk when answering calls people seem to hear alot of background nice n stuff, perhaps ear buds just aren't the way to go for bluetooth calls?"
1,Really enjoy the quality of sound and ease of use. I would recommend these to anyone.
1,The product was delivered on time.  The product works as expected.
1,Really good sound for a great price.
1,"Works great. clear sound, thoughtful charger wire. It would be best if it had a lower volume sound set."
1,I am very happy with these headphones.  I have no issues with them and the price and delivery was great.
0,"The headphones work fine, The two stars are due to when running outside there is wind sound based on the amount of airflow across the headphones. Very distracting!"
0,"Bluetooth isnt very good even with my phone in my pocket, lots of signal interference. Company got back to me with instructions on resetting the Bluetooth, didn't fix the problem, was my first set of Bluetooth headphones, maybe they all sound like crap, who knows."
1,"They sound great, they fit really well, they don't bounce around when I'm working out, and they don't get tangled. They're exactly what I'm looking for."
1,excellent product! I recommend
1,"I absolutely love these, they will work all day on one charge. My only complaint is the sound quality while talking on the phone, people say I sound like I'm in a tunnel."
1,I use them for working out and they are great. I had a charging problem with them recently but the customer service was excellent. They answered all my questions pretty quickly and had my problem solved. One of the best customer service experience I have had. Highly recommend these headphones and brand.
0,"Do not buy if you run outdoors. Even a small amount of wind totally drowns out the volume. It sounds like you are in a windstorm, very disappointed. Good sound quality if uses indoors."
0,"After about a year and five months of occasional use, the microphone no longer works. All along I was tolerating the 3-4 hour battery life as well as the inability to consistently connect to my phone and tablet but now that the microphone stopped working, the headphones are of no use to me."
1,"Great quality; easy to use.  Have not used them in the gym yet, or I might have assigned 5 stars."
1,Excellent product
1,"The sound is great but they're too big/heavy in comparison to regular ear buds. The black loop that goes around your ear seems nice, except it's flimsy and doesn't really hold them in place since it's not adjustable. I returned mine - customer service was great."
1,Love them. I've had nothing but bad luck with my Beats Wireless headphones. Been back to the Apple Store which is an hour from my house several times for replacements. Last week I was tired of the inconvenience and decided to look on Amazon for headphones. Saw a great review on the Senso's and made the purchase. Used them for the first time on April 4 and I love them. They sound great!!!!!! Would highly recommend them.
1,These fit and stay on while working out something that is hard to find in an affordable pair of wireless head phones. Bonus they even sound great!
0,Did not work right at 30 days. I just want to send them back to amazon anyway.  So tired of buying cheap products and getting stuck with them. I guess I rented them for a dollar a day....
1,Hundred percent am satisfied with the quality.
1,Vi una reseña y la verdad está muy bien por el precio
1,They were a Christmas gift for my sis and I know she will love them! Thank you!
1,I love it ! Best bluetooth for the price.
1,Good sound
1,So far so good. Very easy to set up. Like the voice commands. Better than the Dr Dres. Largest ear buds give me the best sound. Can't beat the price
1,Very clear sound.<br />Fantastic set of headphones.<br />Love them. Perfect for my workout!!!
1,"Dang, these headphones are pretty decent!"
0,I have bought four of these headsets. They have all broken within three months of purchase. The latest one broke within a week. This is my last one. They sound good when I could use them. But terribly unreliable. Don’t buy!
1,"For the price, you can't beat these wireless headphones.  My boyfriend uses them.  He says the base is awesome and sound quality is good overall.  The only downside to these headphones is the way it sits in his ear.  He says they keep falling out.  I don't think it's the headphones, I think my boyfriend has weird ears because only certain type earpieces fit him. Overall, you can't go wrong buying them."
1,"i have had these about a week and so far great sound quality , very loud and comfortable"
1,Awesome set of Bluetooth headphones with great mic and headset as well as awesome intelligibility!
1,These are great headphones!  The sound is awesome.  I was very happy with my purchase!!
0,"Lasted 8 months then out of the blue, wont charge"
1,These are a major Win!
1,"I've had some other, more expensive Blue Tooth headphones that sounded worse, felt less comfortable and were more fragile.  These sound great and are very comfortable.  A great value at a very reasonable price.  I would highly recommend these headphones to anyone who wants music while they workout."
0,Don’t work well. Invest money elsewhere
1,I do enjoy this product. I purchased one for me and one for the wife.  I gave this product a try and the sound is perfect and awesome and a perfect match for my cell phone.  The issue that I do not like is when I try and do my Bench press workout it falls out of my ears and while I’m focus and enjoying my heavy lifting with some awesome sounds they just fall out and this is very distracting and do not like.  I’ve tried the other eartips and nothing seems to keep them from falling out with I lie down and do Bench press.  Help with this issue are suggestions would be needed.  Thanks.
0,"product did not work upon receiving, was refunded. Thank you"
1,Very happy about these so far. They are comfortable and stay in my ears when I'm running!! I got them to mainly because they say they are water and sweat proof only used them 4 times but are by far the best ones I've tried.
0,I just received these headphones. I charged them up for about 2 hrs and then connected it to my iPhone just to check if it works. The paring up part was really easy. So I turned them off and kept them in the box. Tried powering up the headset the next day. Nothing. The device is not charging and not even powering up. Really disappointed.
1,"So far, I love these headphones. Great sound and they actually stay in my ears. I have not yet used them while working out, but i have walked around work quite a bit with them and they stay in place."
1,Good sound quality for music but when on a call the person on the other end of the line can hear all the surrounding background noise ...
1,"Originally given 3 stars, see Edits below the original feedback<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />I really like it but 3 stars for 2 reasons:<br />1. The mic doesn't really work unless you shout on a call.<br />2. When you use it outside, you get too much wind noise even if it is not really windy - no clue why!!<br />For listening to songs, and such purposes, it is really good and very loud, you never need to go beyond half the volume as it is very very loud.<br /><br />EDIT 1: Despite I have not used them a lot (only 10-15 times at most since I purchased them), the bluetooth has some issue. They keep disconnecting & connecting back every few seconds, making the music awful to listen to. On the Senso official website, there was no phone number for customer care provided, so I have dropped a note via the &#34;Contact Us&#34; form. Will update once I hear back on how to get this issue corrected.<br /><br />EDIT 2: I got a response pretty fast, and within a few to & fro email to confirm minimal details, the company has shipped back a set of replacement headphones. As I didn't otherwise have any issues with the pair, for the fact of the quick & perfect customer care, I'm bumping up the rating to 5 stars."
1,"I loved the quality of sound and the fact that you did not have to have the sound turned up much to hear it and you still did not hear outside noise. Wonderful! The packaging 📦 was really well. A nice hard box that held the headphones 🎧, case, and the other goodies. Very nice! 👍"
1,"Very decent sound quality - in fact, I cannot tell the difference between the SENSO Bluetooth Headphones (ActivBuds S-250) and the Audio-technica CKR10. Very comfortable to wear. Many useful accessories. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Caution: the sound could be very loud using your usual settings."
1,work great!
1,Great product great fit fantastic sound
1,These are great!!!
0,"On the first use out of the box they were cutting out every 10-15 seconds while listening to music. This is reported by lots of people as an issue, and seems pretty hit and miss. I was unlucky. Return was a breeze, and I bought a different brand."
1,Sound is good but falls out randomly.
1,"Good sound quality.  Long battery life.  Fit comfortably, I prefer the hook over the ear, these fit and work excellent"
1,"Doesn't always handle loud bass well, but the high pitch can get really loud!  Very good for the cost."
1,"We liked it so much we bought a second pair. Great sound, easy to connect. Works great for walking or at the gym."
1,Cool headphones! I'm giving them a 3 rating because sometimes it was hard for people yup hear me and they died within 4 months.  I would only recommend these to workout.
0,High bass but low acoustic and instrument sound.
1,"Sound amazing, can't beat them for double the price. Very impressed"
1,I love my new headphones there a goods quality I highly recommend this product
1,"Very comfortable and fit very well in my ear... Hold well while running, fantastic for music... however, I get complaints while on the phone sometimes that the caller hears an echo. Not sure if it's the reception in my area or the Bluetooth quality. Not always."
1,Great performance.  Easy to use and store.  Love them.
1,"So far, I love my new headphones. Good quality headphones for a great price."
1,"Just got these, the sound is clear and I dare to say dynamic. Not great, but for the price, pretty frickin' good. Yes, some might consider these ""buds"" an eyesore, but again, a tiny price tag for a sound range, quality, and db that delivers."
1,"Love Them ! They seat exactly as I like, works well and sounds great !<br />They might miss the withing the high frequencies range ... but with some EQ setting  it's OK<br />This is just the beginning :) I'll see how long they will last ?<br />My previous high-end brand name wireless headphones that cost a lot ... &#34;died&#34; too quick<br />If these will last longer - it's a great value for the money wireless headphones"
0,The battery will fail- not worth buying.  Seller sends excuse but item will still fail.
0,I bought these for my husband to be able to talk on the phone while driving his semi. Sound quality while talking to him is horrible. Goes from good sound to muffled and back again. Couldn’t carry on a conversation at all.
1,Love these things.
1,Love the way they fit and mold to my ear. Great sounds while still letting me hear what's going on around me. Great for the gym!
1,Has a nice sound and does not short out due to my heavy sweating.
1,They sound great!
0,"I'm not so hot on these. The loops are too big for my ears so I can't get them to sit right. And I can't wear them anywhere that other Bluetooths are broadcasting because it tries to pick up everyone. Out in the middle of nowhere they work great, but at the gym or on campus it is like listening to a skipping record. I actually bought a different pair as soon as I saw a good deal."
1,Love them. My hearing is distracted by other random sounds. These help me here music much better.
1,Working great!
1,Really good value. Battery life and sound quality are impressive given the price
1,"I got these as a gift for my mother, she loves them. She's a big runner and needed a reliable product. Can't beat it for the price!"
1,"I bought a set of these 3 years ago and have loved them! They've managed to hold up great over that time even given my less than gentle nature and clumsiness. They've gone through the wash at least 4-5 times too lol. I came back looking to buy a fully wireless set of earphones as the battery life at all those washes and 3 years of daily use is down to a couple of hours. I tried the Pasonomi x9... What a dissappointment absolutely terrible sound tinny, no bass, none of the tips were comfortable or gave a good seal. I put the tips from these Senso's on and they were comfortable but still terrible sound and very noticeable lag, despite being bluetooth 5.0, while trying to watch video. So if they sound terrible then why listen to music, and if they lag you can't even use them for video. Which brings me back here to order another set of these for $30 less and with 3 year old tech that sound and work better! Anyone know if there's an updated version of these?"
0,Great sound.  Used it sparingly for six months and can no longer get sound.  Very Disappointed!!!
1,"They work great and very easy to pair to any device! They have a long battery life, and stay connected to my phone even while running"
1,Comfortable fit. Easy to connect and charge. Sound quality isnt great but its worth the payoff to not have wires hanging down when cutting grass or working out. Nice carrying case and the included car charger and cables are an awesome value.
1,WOW!!! SUPER IMPRESSIVE!  EXCELLENT RICH SOUND. (Its my favorite gym buddy now). Thanks AAA+
1,"Good sound, great customer service"
1,I enjoy the headphones they are so much better than the ones I had before
0,"I've had my headphones for about three weeks now. But when I talk to people. They say they can't hear me, and I pick up static from time to time."
1,"These headphones stay in place for weightlifting, have good to great sound, and all the included components are thoughtful and thoroughly useful."
1,Just as good as beats. I love these headphones. We just bought another pair for my father in law. I have had mine for a year with no problems. The sound quality easily compares to beats. Great purchase!
1,Love the fit!  Just got them and so far so good.  Good value for the money.
0,I bought these in November and they quit working in June.
1,""" They work great and the performance is a bit better than what I expected for the price. Very satisfied"""
1,These headphones were awesome up until today. Bought them in 2016 and about a year and a half later the connection to the left earbud stopped working.
1,Wonderful headphones. Great for running. They are comfortable and stayed in my ears no problem. I ran a couple 8k's with zero problems. I did however notice a slight problem when it's windy outside and running. The wind whips through the headphones and kind of interferes with the music. You can still hear your music but it doesn't block out the wind. All in all a great product for a good price.
1,love them
1,"Pretty good deal, value"
1,I bought them as a gift for my mother in law. She loves them and continues to use them. They are sweat proof and sound quality is good. Highly Compared my bose wireless earbuds. Will buy again
1,Nice
1,"If you're looking for military grade reliability and/or amazing sound quality this probably isn't the headphone for you.  Having said that these are the only headphones that I have used that have lasted through many a sweaty run....<br /><br />Some things to note:<br />- tl;dr Don't ever use a fast charger it'll basically brick your device.<br />- DO NOT~ Under Any circumstances charge it with a fast cahrger (like a samsung phone charger or anything with fast charge or quick charge or whatever branding they apply to higher amperage charging) It will make it freak the f out.  the headphones will charge but they will overcharge which you would not think is a thing but it is... so what happens is you charge them with a fast charger and you aren't able to turn them on for a little bit until the batteries fall to a certain level..... it will basically seems like they're dead.  The light will light up purple.  (don't panic.... if you're in this situation just wait like a day or so and they'll turn back on.)<br />- When it says low battery, you have about 10 minutes.  Probably less...... usually less.<br />- the cord between the headphones will flap around...  I do not know what it is made out of but it will stick to everything sweaty and yank the headohones out of your ear if it hits a spot on your head with the right amount of friction.<br /><br />Overall though I enjoy these headphones.  They are great."
1,Good for the prize.
1,"Wireless/Bluetooth connects very fast, charges w/ in reasonable time, &quot;full charge&quot; indicator, and playback of many hours. (low profile and professional look."
0,"The over ear design doesn't work for me, it feels terrible and it doesn't even stay on when I'm running."
1,Very reasonable price and works great once you figure them out. I had no issues with my phone coming unsynced when in another room even like some reviewers reported. Maybe this has more to do with your signal strength but not sure. I was able to put my phone down on the counter and move around rooms no problem. It only got weaker when I went outside. I love using them when working on projects so I don't get head phone cords wrapped around door handles or stuck in the dishwasher:)
1,"Bought them for my son's 13th birthday.  He loves them!  He particularly likes the noise canceling quality, as he can't hear a thing I say to him."
1,"Good and sturdy headphones that stay in your ear. I have had trouble with finding a good pair of wireless headphones that stay in my ears at the gym without dropping $150 on Beats. This does exactly what I need, the only thing I have to complain about is that the bass isn't great quality and if you listen too loudly then the sound will be distorted so i have had to turn down my bass for the music I listen to. Good purchase other than that."
0,Really nice audio battery life junk after about 2 weeks. From a full charge to empty an hour and 45 minutes
1,"Easy to use and the directions are helpful. Lots of accessories included. I would like if it had a wall charger instead of a car charger, but that's just a matter of preference."
1,I can no longer charge my headphones the port will you plug in to charge the headphones it slid back in the earpiece there now I can't I can't plug in the charger. They were great for two months but now I got to go buy another pair unless they're still under warranty I have to check and see
1,"Very comfortable fit, sounds great! At a fraction of the cost of the big name brands! Also good range on the blue tooth connectivity.  All around very solid product."
1,"Headphones had troubles on the first mile of my first run with them (kept going in and out), but then the problem disappeared and have worked great since. Sound is good."
1,"Excellent battery life, use it all the time and charge a max of twice a week. Bluetooth connectivity is amazingly clear compared to others I used before. Always around my neck keeping “me hands free”."
1,"I am very happy with the Senso Bluetooth headphones, they are easy to use and the sound quality is very good.<br />5/9/19: After several months of regular use the headphones suddenly stopped pairing with my Bluetooth device. I contacted Senso and without hesitation they offered to send me a replacement. The next day I received an email confirming that my replacement headphones are on their way. Great service."
1,These earphones are amazing! The sound quality is impressive!!! Easy to hook up and use!!! ❤️❤️❤️
1,"I wanted a cheap pair of wireless earphones for the gym.  This is actually my first pair of wireless and I was concerned with the aural/audio quality, but have to tell you these sound great.  The set up process couldn't have been easier.<br /><br />Minor complaints:  Could be easier to identify Left & Right sides, powering on and off is minority clunky, and I wish they came in more color options/accents as I bought two pairs, one for me & one for my wife.<br /><br />These really are nit picks... great product."
1,headphones work great. very friendly customer service
0,Bought twice and both sets lasted 3 days. Just stopped powering on. Very cheap. It's sad because they sounded good and we're loud for the 3 days. Smh. Garbage. I'm so mad I have to hit the gym without sound now
0,"The left side just shorted out the other day after a year of light use. I never got them wet or anything, just used them when I would go on runs. Of course, this is just past the warranty window of this product. For the price, these things should last more than a year. Unless you want to buy a new pair each year, I recommend shopping for a higher quality pair elsewhere."
1,"I got these because I wanted to listen to music while I practice shooting hoops. I was worried they were going to be loose or come off as I ran around the court but day #2 and they're steady and haven't slipped off once.<br /><br />I'm running around like crazy, doing lay ups and cutting to the basket and these stay on.<br /><br />I have a iphone 6s and I can walk around the half court with my phone in my bag on the side and there's no issue with the bluetooth.<br /><br />I sweat like crazy so I'll update this later to see how long these last..."
1,Good sound for the price.  Easy to pair with different devices.
0,"The piece of the headphone that wraps around the ear doesn't properly fit. The headphones frequently fall out while running, which is a pain."
1,Extremely light. They stay in place and the sound quality is excellent. Linked perfectly to my Samsung phone.
1,"Great range, excellent battery life, comfortable fit, and fair sound.  The only negative thing is the sound seems to have a bit too much bass in it. Other than that, an excellent product."
1,Easy to use and connect and very good sound quality. Comes with a nice protective travel case. Would definitely purchase again!
0,As per the pictures and reviews; this item comes with a car charger. That is the only reason why I purchased it was because the other types of wireless ear phones don’t have a car charger. Anyway I did not receive a car charger. The box I received does not state it even comes with a car charger. Also I was looking at the items that come with the box and apparently it should have came with a “wire tie” that was missing as well. I am uploading a picture of what I received.
1,"I was worried when I first got these because it seemed like my ears were too small for the over the ear pieces and the ear piece. Turns out the over the ear piece bends to makes it smaller and fit on my ears. It comes with smaller ear pieces, so I swapped those out and it fits in my ear like I want now.  I got these so I could watch tv at night and not worry about bothering my neighbor who goes to bed early. I’ve charged these twice since Christmas, but I would consider myself a light user maybe 30 min- hour at a time, so it last because I make sure it’s turned off."
1,Not bad for the price paid.
1,"I used these both at work and at the gym.<br /><br />The sound quality was perfectly acceptable for what they are. The connectivity range was fine. The earbuds were perfectly comfortable for me.<br /><br />Of course, there were bluetooth issues that often annoyed me. I'd find myself at the gym turning on and off the bluetooth on the phone and turning on and off the headphones annoyingly often; sometimes I just had to completely ""forget"" the device to finally get them to pair. I have the latest version Android on a Nexus 6P but this is just a problem with bluetooth no matter what I'm pairing to, it seems.<br /><br />The general design of wired bluetooth headphones like these is, in my opinion, really annoying for a space where there are other people who might want to talk get my attention; you can have both ears in or both ears out, but if you take out just one it'll be pulling at the other one and it's really annoying.<br /><br />As for things I think this product could have done better...<br /><br />As if I hadn't spent $50 on a pair of headphones I keep in their own case, one of the ears has started losing its connection. I can still get sound out of it if I hold my head just so, but in practice, it's done for, and that happened about 6m after I started using them.<br /><br />Running, at least for me, meant an awful musical experience with these. The weight of each ear means they bounce while running -- not much, but enough that the careful fit / seal required to get reasonable sound quality couldn't be maintained; the sound would just sort of bounce in and out as I ran. Fine for podcasts, but if you care about how music sounds AT ALL (or just get easily annoyed) while running, these might not be for you. I could see this being less of a risk for people with larger ears, though.<br /><br />There's also very little in the way of discerning battery state. I just assumed mine always needed charging unless they were just charged."
1,They really reduce the nois
1,Incredible Earbuds! Takes my workout to the next level! Sound quality is on point. 10/10.
1,Awesome. Bought for everyone in the family
1,"These are awesome for the price and last for hours.  Definitely will purchase again,"
1,I liked them well enough to buy a second pair after I wore the first pair out.
0,"Updated review:  I initially rated these 3-star but am changing to 1.  The more I use them, the more I dislike them.  Key points of dissatisfaction:  1) They inconsistently link to my devices.  Sometimes the earbuds will automatically to a device to which they've been previously link, sometimes I have to re-link them manually and it can take a few tries.  And this is not limit to one device, happens to all three with which I use these.  2) If the buds are linked to more that one device simultaneously, and all of them are within range of the buds, and they are being used by one, as I get out of range of the other(s), I get a beeping sound, then static, as I'm listening to another device via the buds, e.g. they are linked to my phone and ipod; if I am in the yard listening to my ipod and the phone is in the house, and I get far enough away from the phone that the buds are losing their connection to it, I hear clicking and the get static or other interference as I'm listening to the ipod.  Even though I am not listening to anything on the phone.  The only way to eliminate the static is to manually disconnect the phone from the earbuds which means I have to go through the re-linking process with the phone the next time I want to use it with the buds ( and put up with the annoyance of that inconsistent process - see #1 above).  3) These are not great for active exercise.  The ear loops are soft and flexible and do not folds the buds in place during high intensity activity - I continually have to adjust them.  4) Battery life is not great - starting with fully charged buds, if I work in the yard for the afternoon, I run out of juice before the end of the day.  In my earlier review I said I was considering returning but learned that I was past the return period so I'm stuck with them.  I recommend looking at alternatives.<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Initial review:  These are my first bluetooth headphones and I use them primarily at the gym or while working around my house.  I was tired of catching with cord of my wired headphones and yanking out of my ears but was doubtful that I'd get decent quality from bluetooth.  The literature indicated that bluetooth quality has increased and the reviews of these were positive so I ordered.  My experience is mixed.  Sound quality is fine but other issues are disappointing/annoying:  1) Using at the gym is so-so; for lifting weights or stretching they're fine but when the pace picks up, e.g. running on a treadmill, they are wobbly in the ears.  The loop that goes over the ear is a flexible rubber-like material that does not hold them tightly so I have to regularly push them back into place.  2) I use them with an iPod and Android phone. Sometimes they connect immediately but other times it take a few tries; it's frustrating that connecting to the same device works fine one day and not the next when I follow the same process.  Sound is generally stable and clear but other times it's wobbly (like the sound is coming through water); again, that can vary from day to day.  Lastly, when they paired to two devices (i.e. my iPod and phone) but I am using only one (e.g. the iPod) when I get out of range of the other (e.g. the phone) the sound gets wobbly and I get a message that I'm disconnected, although the message does not identify from which device I'm disconnected (although it appears to be referring to the device to which I'm not listening).  The only way to stabilize the sound and eliminate the message is to turn off bluetooth on the other device.  Seems clumsy.  I'm considering returning them and trying another brand.  Consumer Reports recently rated bluetooth headphones and gave some high marks - the Sensos were not reviewed."
1,Great sound.  Sweat a lot in the gym.  Love these
1,"Sound quality isn't the best overall profile is pretty large in the ear,I like a sleeker profile and have heard better sound quality at same price point."
1,"Very happy with these. Worked and had great life out of the box. Took a nice long walk without needing a charge, with using them on and off I can get an 8hr day at work and the range is decent i can get over 20 or 30 feet away from my phone using them so I can leave my phone charging and listen to my music or podcasts."
1,I have used this product for almost two years. I'm really happy with the head phones.
1,"Works great, I think it is water proof as well. No need for extra wires. Great sound quality. But the mic is very sensitive and has background noise/static. It picks up even my breathing sounds."
1,"I love these things, all wireless/Bluetooth audio devices have their short comings but I find these to be the most reliable I have ever crossed paths with. The Customer service with one small delivery problem that was not their fault was so far above and beyond, it defies description. Honesty and integrity like we all dream of getting! When they wear out or break, I will definitely buy another pair if available still, if not I will purchase whatever they have developed to replace them with. Highly recommend and will by more for myself if I ever need to!<br />I was not compensated in any way to review these, I payed full price, regular Joe customer!<br />Cheers, Motorhead!"
1,"The only thing i haven't figured out yet is how to skip a song. Nonetheless, they are a good inexpensive purchase that get the job done."
1,Product came in earlier than expected !!<br />Everything was very well packaged and nothing came in damaged.<br />There were so many accessories that came with these headphones and my dad loved it! Definitely worth the price.
0,Haven't actually tried the headphones but this is how the box showed up.  Outside shipping box was intact.
1,"Love these! So easy to pair and (I have only used them once so far) they are so comfortable. I still have to run in them and see if they stay in but, so far, love them! &#34;"
1,"Easy to set up and use! I could link it to my laptop, phone, and ipad within a minute."
1,Does what it suppose to do. The music comes through great. I like the fact that I don't have wires all over the place. I use it mostly at the gym.
1,"This is a great product, 100% value for money, more than 8 hrs of battery life, more than 50 feet of range. Extremely satisfied with the product.."
0,I have gotten 2 other Senso before and the were great. This Senso earbuds feels cheap and the sound quality is not so great. It also takes a long time to turn on when you press the button. Was kind of disappointed with them.
1,"I've only had these for a few days, but have used them for close to 20 hours and could not be more pleased.  Since I listen to podcasts and audio books just about non-stop, battery life is very important to me.  I was skeptical of the SENSO's stated 8 hour battery life, due in part to Apple saying that their Airpods (at over 5 times the price) can go only 5 hours between charges.  My experience so far with the SENSOs is that, for the kind of listening I do, the battery last for at least 8 hours.  How long the battery will continue to perform at this level is unknown at this point.  At my level of use, I'll be very pleased if the battery continues to perform for a year.  If it does, I'll gladly buy another pair next year!  One other thing I'll like to mention is the many extras included with the SENSOs.  They come with 3 sets of silicon eartips in 3 sizes and a set of foam eartips, a short ribbon-style charging cable, a longer ribbon cable with a micro-USB plug AND a Lighting adapter for charging an iPhone, a dual USB car lighter adapter and a nice case to hold it all.  All of these accessories seem to be of good quality.  This impresses me since my $200 FitBit Surge  came with a charging cable and nothing else..  They didn't even throw in a USB power source of any kind.  This makes me feel like SENSO is trying to earn every penny I paid for their product while companies like FitBit (they are not alone in their apparent belief that customers are fortunate to own one of their priducts) make me feel like a sucker."
1,"Previously, I had the headline:  Weak Bluetooth but surprisingly good sound.  My original review:  Sound better than I expected but Bluetooth connection is very fragile. If I put my relatively new Nexus 6P in my pocket, the sound breaks up.  Typical of cheap electronic devices - especially BT headsets - these have only slight advantages over cheap wired alternatives​.<br /><br />EDIT:  See comments.  In short, the connection was not great but Kimberly from SENSO commented on how I might fix the problem.  Simply plug the headphones into a power source, hold the power button for 7 seconds, and then repair headphones to my phone.  Now, the headphones work flawlessly.  Great sound, great connectivity, and great product support.  What more could you ask?"
1,Honestly great phones.
1,"I got tired of being tangled up with ear buds!!! I saw the rating for the SENSO Bluetooth Headphones were number 1 sellers, so I gave them a try. Glad I did!! They feel great in/on my ears. The flexible support over my ears makes it easy to adjust and remove for control. I synced mine with my Samsung Galaxy S7. Nice highs and deep bass!!! GREAT PURCHASE!! ADDITIONAL INFO: Charging is breeze - red light/charging. Blue light/done. The extra cords are handy. Phone calls come through clear. Because I work in an office, background noise and distractions have been eliminated. AND THE BONUS: 6 - 8 hours of play time!!"
1,"This is great product, great sound quality."
1,Nice fit and ok sound.  Tend to be a bit bass heavy and muddled.  If you are an audiophile you may find the sound lacking....
1,work great
1,I bought these headphones because of the price and the reviews. The sound quality lives up to the hype and the button functions are easy enough to learn (although I wish the large logo was not the hang up button). Unfortunately for me the bluetooth connection was choppy at times. I am fairly sure that it is not my phone because my bluetooth speakers work fine and have a decent range (both are Bose). The range is also not great but that has not been an issue for me as I work out with my phone in my pocket or nearby.
1,"So far so good.  I use them at least 4-5 times a week at the gym.  It holds a good charge for the week and the sound is pretty good.  I won't give it 5 stars though, as the bass is just not there.  If you don't mind minimal bass, then these are perfect.  I still recommend them for the price...you can't beat that!"
1,"Bought these for my wife for her birthday.  They fit well and sound great.  They paired quickly with her iPhone 7.  She really enjoys them, i may end up buying a pair for myself to use while mowing the yard."
1,"I have to get up a lot to retrieve items from the printer at work, which required me to stop my music and take out the wired ear buds every few minutes.  Plus the cord kept catching as I rotated from one side of my L shaped desk to the other side.  Requested these for Mother's Day, hoping they'd at least keep me in my groove.  They are absolutely fabulous!!!  I can only put in one ear because I have to listen for the phone, but it still works incredibly well as far as noise cancellation!  The range in these is supposed to be up to 30 feet, and I say it works a couple of rooms away, even through thick walls!  The only negative I have is the zipper on the pouch messes up from time to time, but I open it back up before the spot where it splits open and re-zip, which usually takes care of the problem.  A great buy for all that you get!!"
1,"I am not one to leave long reviews but these deserve it. from the moment you look at the packaging you will be asking yourself how can they afford this quality packaging for $30. then when you open the box and see a dual port car adaptor (1 1amp and 1 2amp), 2 charging cords, a very nice semi hard carrying case, and 3 sets of different size tips you will think great these are going to sound awful. I charged them up and then quickly turned my Power Beats 3 off, paired these and left for the gym. although they don't have quite the same deep base and sound quality they are far better then any other wireless headphones I have used. they are also louder then the beats! remember these are $30 and the beats are ~$180 I have only used them one day but the battery was still showing 100% on my phone after 3 hours. The down side is they ear hooks are a little big and as they did not fall off my ears they did fall of my daughters. I liked them so much I bought 2 more pairs for my buddies to try out."
1,"A bit tight for my earlopes, but overall pretty good."
1,Great sound and comfortable fit!
1,"I bought these mostly for listening to podcasts, and they're great! The audio quality is not perfect, but I figured that would be the case when paying less than $40 for wireless headphones, and honestly it really doesn't need to be very good when listening to NPR and the like. It'd be passable for music. The balance seems pretty bass biased, but I guess that's just what people are into. My only real complain is the persistent, low volume hiss. However that's been present in most wireless headphones I've used, and I've definitely had worse.<br /><br />Bottom line: these are a great value! If your requirements aren't super high or you're on a budget, these are an excellent solution."
1,My husband  uses them when he works out and he loves them .
0,"Comparatively large vs. other bluetooth headphones which one would assume is to provide better protection, including sweat resistance.  My headphone failed under normal usage (treadmill) within 2 months and no longer works.  From the beginning it had trouble connecting to an Apple touch (would connect but sound but continue to come from Touch instead of headphone) - required several reconnections before it would work.  I have other bluetooth headphones that immediately connect and play well."
0,Good price but the connectivity is somewhat that could be improved from merely 2 feet away in a pocket.
1,value for money
0,"Was great at first then it started to fall apart.  First the ear tips started to fall off; so far I have used 4 replacement tips in less than 6 months.  Last month the left bud stopped working completely without warning; sometimes the sound will play if I wiggle the cord connecting the headphones.  I really liked the headphones when I first bought them, but clearly they are not rigid enough to last even a year."
1,They work.
1,I really like it
1,Device was delivered in timely manner as promised. Setup was easy and sound was great!
0,Loved them. But if you workout too hard and sweat too much they'll cut off on you and not reconnect without being reset and that's even more of a pain.
0,"Sad to report that I got a defective pair- when I plugged these in to the charger, the plastic melted and rendered it useless. :( Returning."
1,"The price is right, the headphones come with a cool carrying case and other items most do not. I like that they are blue tooth... the downfall is the sound QUALITY. They are loud enough but the quality isn't there. They also don't fit right. I think it is the angle the headphone itself is offset at. I've tried all of the extra size fittings and it is either a hastle to get them in to where they fit or they just don't fit right. I do like that the blue tooth can stay connected from about 25-30 feet away. It's a decent product but obviously for around $30 you can't really beat it. If you made a product with better sound quality and that fit a little better for 40-50 $ I would be all over it. This company has strong potential to do more. Thank you for your product"
1,"The Senso ActivBuds S-250 not only sound exceptional, but the also stay in my ears. Something that other &#34;over the ear&#34; headphones failed to do. I contacted their support desk on two occasions and both time times they responded within an hour with instruction that solved my problem. Very happy with the product."
0,"Great during the first month. Waterproof and it stayed in place. Sound quality was good. 2 months later, it stopped working. It no longer connects, and when it does, does not play music (except the occasional word or two for the duration of the song)."
1,So far I love these earbuds they are very comfortable.
1,Great sound! Very comfortable to wear while exercising too!
1,great for the price
1,"I really liked these for the first year I had them, but after that the Bluetooth connection fell off. They still connect to my phone automatically when I turn them on, but there is no audio connection. My music/podcast will be playing but there is no sound from either the phone or these buds. I have to go into settings, disconnect, and reconnect to get audio. Maybe I just got a bad set but I wouldn’t buy these again."
1,Great quality headphones. Easy to use and to pair. Worked great for about 7 months but now it stoped charging and won’t come on no matter what I try ☹️.
1,I use this in the pool for my water exercising.  They fit well and they were easy to set up and use.
0,"I loved these when I first bought them. They were comfortable and worked well even when I was running. After a couple of months, though, they stopped holding a charge, now they won't charge at all and are one of those things lost in that kitchen junk drawer."
1,Satisfied
1,"Excellent sound quality, ear buds are comfortable."
1,"While I've used them at time, they are not exactly a 'go-to' for work outs. Sometimes I go back to the wired connection. These are just a bit bulky. Sound is decent."
1,This is a great product. The instructions are very clear. The performance is simply great! This is my second set. I lost the first set and since I like it so much I purchased it again.
1,"Surprisingly great for the price and, even more surprisingly they're pretty darn good compared to some of the other high priced ones.<br /><br />*****BARE IN MIND***** For whatever reason the playback quality of the audio that informs you of what settings your device is at/what buttons you are clicking is AWFUL and if you only go by that and never try your music on it, you may think that you bought a piece of junk! But, again, that's just the audio quality for that operation and it is not a reflection of the audio quality of the actual headphones themselves."
1,Great quality I recommend it. This sounds great and fast shipping
1,"So, taking into account the fact that they're ~$36, I'm giving them 5 stars.<br /><br />These headphones are interesting. I've never had around the ear earbuds like these before, though I've had around the ear headphones. I should also say I haven't had any other pair of sports headphones around this price range, so I can only attest to what I have. I own a pair of Skullcandy Method wireless sport earbuds, so that's what I have to compare with these Senso's.<br /><br />When I got them, I was really worried about the hooks. They are REALLY flimsy. They have no backing, and they feel like they weren't going to be functional. I actually almost returned them on the spot because of this. HOWEVER, I decided to give them a go, and worked out with the set. They didn't fall out when I ran, or when I was lifting weights, or doing ab work outs. I was a bit surprised, so I've decided to keep them.<br /><br />My only other complaint with the headphones was the quality of the sound. Granted, I own a pair of $200 headphones, as well as $120 pair, and the skullcandy set. The skullcandy's were crisp and clear with the mids and highs, and had an okay synthetic bass. The Sensos seem to have traded the crispness of the mids and highs for some bass. I was really happy listening to EDM and anything with a good bass kick as the centerpiece. However,vocals, midrange, and high range left me a little disappointed. Again, I have mildly expensive music tastes (never owned beats though, hell no).<br />The reason I gave 5 stars, and why I'm not really using the skullcandy's, was because the skullcandy's fall off my neck every time I laid down; these didn't slip at all. Also, Skullcandy's are about $15 more expensive. So for the price, you're getting something thats pretty decent. I'd like to give 4.5 stars, but that's not really an option. If they somehow cleaned up the sound and made the bands a bit more stiff, I'd be %100 behind the brand."
1,"I love them. Great sound and reception. Light, waterproof, excellent packaging and instructions. Great value, in fact, I bought a 2nd pair as backup. Class act all the way!"
1,I am impressed. Great Item.
1,Excellent - wish it had a microphone capability.  I use them on a &#34;short flight&#34; instead of my Bose CQ 35s.
1,Very good price and prompt delivery. Sound quality is decent for the price. Good base and may sound better after break in period.
1,Totally pleased!
1,Nice sound quality and good battery life. look big but they are lightweight.<br />the charging cable is awsome fits my iphone and the headphones.
1,"Using while lifting weights and running at the gym.  I like the sound, and they are lightweight and comfortable. No complaints - very satisfied!"
1,Very nice and was to use. Very pleased.
0,So I got this for my husband's birthday and within one week he said the sound went out in one ear. Soon after our twins were born and ended up in the NICU so it got too hectic to return them. Not sure if it's just a fluke or if the quality is really that bad. My husband hadn't gotten them wet or even sweated with them. He didn't even use them enough to know how the battery holds up for the long haul. Very disappointing.
1,Have had two sets first set lasted years were great. Bought second set a few months ago seem a little lighter on the quality but so far great. Would recommend for gym and cardio.
1,Nice
1,"They are very durable.  I like that the are waterproof since some of my runs are in rain.  They can irritate my ear on occasion during long runs, but sometimes I can minimize that by swapping ear covers.  Very good ear buds for the price!  This is my 3rd pair.  My 1st pair stopped working about 4 months in, but customer service shipped me new ones right away!  The 2nd pair lasted about 1.5 years before the Bluetooth module stopped working.  Worth the money for both quality of audio and amount of the they last."
1,"These are the best low cost BT headset. Light, lasts full 8 hours, and the best dynamic range (bass is amazing for earbuds without added boost). The noise canelling only applies to the MIC, but they are great for the price."""
1,Very nice headphones.
1,"I like how fast it connects every time I use it, and how I can adjust the earpiece. I just hope these will last longer to at least two years because I bought a pair last year in March, and it broke in August this year. Overall, I am happy with the product, I just hope the longevity is there. If it is, Senso will be my go to since I did spent 2 weeks considering what else to purchase besides Senso."
1,"Great product, slips on easily, pairs easily.<br /><br />Simple instructions makes understanding the functions of the device quick and painless.<br /><br />Lots of bonus loot. Multiple different types of usb cables, a 12 volt vehicle power to USB adapter, a small but ascetically pleasing case, and a bunch of replacements/different size ear-plugs.<br /><br />The only down-side (I hesitate to even call it a down-side) to this product is the average sound quality. This is not a device you want to use to get the most out of your music. Nor should you want to, since there are many better products for that specifically. That's not to say it's not worth using for music and other media, but it's sure to draw scorn from unreasonable audiophiles.<br /><br />My home is full of cellular dead-zones with only a few locations that get service. I purchased these so that I can answer my phone while it's charging in one of the few hard-to-reach spots with good reception."
1,The charging port is extremely tight and I thought I was going to break it the first time I plugged it in.  The ear pieces are loose and floppy but held surprisingly well.  the sound quality is okay but not great. They actually have good low end range but muffled mids and highs.
1,Great ear buds perfect for What I needed
1,"I am still getting used to them, learning that is. They seem to be really nice  & I know they will work once I get the hang of them. Thanks🤗"
1,Awesome product. I was concerned at first since they were pretty inexpensive however these things are great.  I'm training for 2 half Ironman races and have worked great for biking and running.
1,So far so good. Nice sound!  I'll post updates.
1,My son bought these and he loves them...will buy again for other children
1,"Sound quality- ehhh its ok, granted you are only spending 36 bucks or so for these things. Personally i find it to be way to bass driven and not enough highs or mids present.<br /><br />Construction- biggest grips here are the large circles before the rubber ear drum inserts and the ear hooks.  The circle part seems to be fairly big and gets in the way of securely fitting in your ear canal. Maybe its just my ears but i have problems getting them in place and staying in place. Takes some fiddling around with these things in order for them to seat right. The ear hooks on these things are my next complaint since they are about worthless, hate to be harsh here but its the truth. They are super flimsy and offer no rigidity at all for support to the ear bud itself. Now they are super soft rubber which is awesome as they cause no irritation what so ever. Easy fix here is to have a piece of fairly rigid plastic be the ear hook backbone and dip or wrap it in the rubber they currently use.<br /><br />Microphone while in a call- Had multiple people tell me that it was hard to hear me while using these for a call. I had to speak loudly and speak super clear in order for the person on the other end to hear me well.<br /><br />Battery life is pretty solid on these things and meets the time listed in specs when brand new and fully charged.<br /><br />Overall I will be returning these due to fitment just being to much of a pain and the audio being way to heavy on bass for me."
1,"Got a pair for my daughter as a Christmas present to use as she worked out. I figured, $30, can't go wrong. HOLY SMOKES BATMAN, these headphones rock. easy to use, sound awesome, noise cancel works great. Don't look elsewhere. BUY THESE. The accessories are worth the $30.00. I liked them so much, I bought a pair for myself, (and I don't even need any). Keep up the great work SENSO :)"
1,I like this headphone but it doesn't seem to fit right and stay around my ear and keep the earbuds in my ear.  I try to use it when I go walking but the ear pieces keep falling out.  Even with the different ear buds.
1,Good quality sound. Easy to use<br />Battery last
0,This is the second pair I have owned. The first were great. This pair showed up with the right speaker not functioning. I did not return them. Too much of a pain. Disappointed to say the least.
1,"One of  the 2 headphones pairs are not working well. It cuts in and out, the connection is lost even when less than 5  to 10 ft away. The other pair works well. Need to return and exchange for new pair.<br /><br />Update Nov 2017:  The Headphones work great. They are susceptible to low flying planes ( I guess their beacon) The company rep contacted me and help me to reset the headsets. They work really work as advertised."
1,Works great kids love them
1,"I haven't had a chance to actually use these headphones in an exercise situation, but the set up was very easy and they worked upon set up."
1,"I purchased these based on the great reviews, but I returned them because they did not have a mic, which I did not notice, and they also felt bulky in my ears and hurt a bit. The sound was good and easy to use, good for running, but really wanted a mic and a smaller ear piece."
1,"Had an issue with first set and customer service folks were AMAZING.  They tried to see if the set I had could be reset to factory, but when that didn't work I had a new set on the way the next day.  It is nice to know that you can actually trust a company to do right by purchasing their product and this company certainly did and I appreciate it and applaud it!  I would certainly purchase them again....love them!"
1,I bought this for my teenage child as a gift.  They work wonderfully and she loves them.<br />The sound is awesome and they are sturdy!  The case is well made too!
1,"Great service and attention.  The product came just as described.  I recently purchased these headphones to use for running, so far so good!"
1,"Great product, very easy to setup, very pleased!"
1,Very pleased with the product.  Delivery was as expected.
1,Best earphones for the price hands down.
1,"I have had these headphones for a couple of months now.  Thus far I am very happy with my purchase.  I love the when I get my products in a timely manner.  So, I workout for hours at a time, 5-6 days a week.  When I purchased these headphones, I was looking for something that was current with what I was seeing everyone around the gym wearing, something wireless (hate being teathered to my phone), and something that was waterproof (I sweat a lot), and something that would not break my pockets.  I went to amazon and compared a few headphones that I saw as top inexpensive products and at the end of the day I settled with the SENSO headphones.  I love that they have the 1 yr warranty just incase something becomes faulty with my headset.  That's one of the main reasons why I settled with this set.  I loved the reviews I read, and that also sold me, and the price was great ($38).<br /><br />When I received the headset I was excited to see if the reviews I read was legit.  I was actually very please to see that the reviews was on point.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Easy to pair with my phone and tablet.<br />2. The sound was AMAZEBALLZ. I hated my iPhone headphones, they just weren't loud enough when at the gym and I'm working out still hearing the gym's music over the gyms intercom system.  That was so annoying.  So now with these headphones I can literally block out the music from the gym and only hear mine, and that's without blowing my eardrums to hell.<br />3. They stay put.  I use to train with my iPhone headphones which I use to love at one point but got tired of having to adjust them back in my ear when I started to sweat real bad, and I hated being teathered to my phone.  The cord would annoyingly hit my arm while I run which throws me mentally.  All that to say this... with the SENSO wireless headphones I don't ever have to adjust my headphones because of the behind the ear hook.  And the cord is completely out of my way.  The cord does not beat against me when I run.  I really forget that I have the headphones on.<br />4. They last in the sauna.  I like to treat myself to the sauna after a hard workout.  I love to take my phone in the sauna and read, play games etc... I usually am still listening to my headphones when I'm in the sauna.  I don't see any difference in sound quality, and its still working strong.  (Yet I have never had a problem with any pair of headphones in a dry sauna).  I usually stay in a sauna for up to 40 minutes.<br />5. Love the carrying case for the headphones.  Compact and durable.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Battery life is ok.  I say that it's ok because I would have to charge my battery after one of my workouts.  I could be at the gym for up to 3 hours.  With this battery I would not be able to go back to the gym the very next day and complete a new workout without it going dead.  I do like that it gives you enough warnings that the battery is about to die.  It only died on my once but it only takes me one time to learn a lesson, so I always charge it before I go back to the gym.<br />2. Slightly bulky-  this is a very small con.  I guess compared to the beats, the SENSO has a slight built to the earpiece.  This is nothing that was a deal breaker at all, just an observation.  When I have them on at the gym they look like everybody else's headsets, and often mistaken for beats.<br /><br />Overall, I would say that I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend this product to anyone looking for a great wireless headset that won't break your pockets."
1,"Great Bluetooth headphones! I looked at beats and even Bose earbuds... these are super loud, I can't even turn it up to medium volume before I consider it enough volume for me, so the power is there.<br /><br />They could use a little bit improvement on the lows rather than the highs being so aggressive.<br />The materials are super soft and you can barely feel them on your ears, the added accessories are great too, love the carrying case. You can tell this company put their sweat and tears to the product and since it's a start up company, is the consumers benefit from that!<br /><br />Overall great earbuds at a great price, don't spend your hard earned money on those other high priced earbuds that do the same or are of less quality than these."
1,Nice sound.  Pairs easily.  Use while playing in poker tournaments.  Does not block noise so I can hear conversations while I play and listen to music.  Very comfortable in my ears.
1,These headphones are the best . Must buy!
1,so far so good!
1,"I like the ear buds, comfortable and sounds great! Easy setup, unlike importing songs to my gear fit 2"
1,"Upside: Short charge time make these headphones almost immediately available.  It takes about 30 minutes and the charge lasts for 8 hours.  The instructions specifically say not to over charge them (do not leave on charger over night) as this may cause the charge to be lesser time.<br />It takes a little getting used to as far as the buttons on the headphone because you can use them to answer and make phone calls, sift through your playlist and adjust the volume. There is a 30 foot range on the blue tooth. There are 3 different ear bud sizes.  I use the small ones, but I still think even a smaller ear bud would work better for me - I guess I have small ears.<br /><br />Downside: they are a little bulky; the charge cord is super short"
1,Love It!
1,My daughter (15yrs) has gone through 4 sets of Beats-earbuds. They have all broken within 6-12 months. The last pair only lasted 18 days. So she asked me for these Senso Bluetooth headphones. She loves these headphones so far. Great sound and they are noise canceling. The talk fuction works great too. we will wait and see how long they last...
1,"I like these headphones , great quality , great fit and price"
1,The sound quality is good the noise cancelation is good and the Bluetooth part is ok but not good Im a landscaper so I put my phone in my pocket and it will skip ever now and then like a cd player or something
1,"Brief setup issue that was handled by company very well and to my liking, but works great."
1,"Purchased this one to work out. The box comes with the headset precharged. Paring it with my Iphone 7 was extremely easy. The sound is excellent, noise cancelling and all. I played with the settings in the iphone (Settings - Music) and it seems to respond very well to the different equalizing options (dance, pop, rock, bass booster, etc). The fit around my ears is excellent also. I used them out of the box without changing the earpieces and they fit me perfectly. Went for a run (5k) sweating quite a bit and they held up perfectly. One of the problems I usually have with these type of headphones is that the cord tends to dance around and that is annoying. These headphones don't have that problem, they come with a cable tie gadget, so I can tame the cable either around my neck or under my chin, nice feature.<br />It also comes with a nice case and and extra charging cable for both iphone and android.<br />Battery held pretty well for a run, and around the house. Finally, I tested the mike in a couple of calls and they went through nicely. Will buy another one as they are excellent for the price."
1,"Just got them, and so far for the price initial quality seems very good, it paired instantly, i have not used it enough to make good judgment but, i will (i listened to a few songs and the sound seemed bassy with mids and highs a bit muffled)"
0,"Pro: sound quality was good, the buds and over ear hooks fit well and held in place while exercising.<br /><br />Con: Bluetooth connection was poor, wind noise overwhelmed the music.<br /><br />Disappointed enough that I returned them."
0,"Unboxed and loved how the headphones fit, and looked. Connected to my iPhone easily and that’s when it went wrong. These headphones are so bass boosted, that vocals in songs are distorted. Even with the iPhone bass reducer EQ setting, the bass is overwhelming (and this is coming from someone who loves bass). The mid- high frequencies are extremely dull and vocals in almost all the songs I tested are lost in the bass. Additionally to the poor audio quality, the car phone mount sticker back was peeled and sticking to the contents of the box."
0,"I had purchased this product and it worked for 3 months. Then they randomly stopped working and would not turn on. They will charge and are fully charge, but when I go to turn them on it never says ""power on"". I am very disappointed that these did not last longer. There is no reason for them not to work as I only use them once a day to work out and they never got wet, were dropped, or stepped on. They simply stopped working."
1,"The fit is great! I have really small ears, so I was worried but these are very comfy! The only thing I DONT like is that when I have my phone on my arm and running, they cut in and out. Not sure if that is a phone issue or a headphones issue. Its kind of annoying, but nothing I cant deal with."
1,The earbuds are great!  The price is amazing.  I bought them to replace my beats that died.  I use them for running and lifting and haven’t had an issue.  Easy to connect and disconnect
0,"I gave these headphones 3 tries, since they seemed to have some good reviews. First time using them was JUST OK. 2nd time was also JUST OK. 3rd time, i almost chucked them on the ground in the middle of my run out of frustration. They are not flexible, they do not stay in/on your ears. I was not even sweating that much as it was a nice, cool, low-60s morning run, so I don't think that had anything to do with them falling out. I am done with them."
1,Gift for my significant other. He loves them.
1,"I kept having to buy new headphones to work out in almost every other month because no matter what brand, they would all stop working. These have lasted me over almost a year now and they work just like when I first got them. Extremely happy with my purchase. I have now bought two more of these to give away to friends as gifts."
1,Works well for the price
0,"These were unbelievably loud and there was not a way to turn the sound down enough, without completely silencing.  There were unusable so I returned them.  Customer service was good though."
0,Not sure if this was just a defective pair or what but they kept having a faulty bluetooth connection - whenever the wind would blow or i'd bend over and wiggle the wire it would cut out the song. Had to return them.
1,Love them! Fit comfortably and sound incredible!!!
1,Great wireless headphones just as good if not better than my daughters &#34;Beats&#34; shes mad now she spent all that money😤
1,I like these headphones! They are especially great for workout be because they don't fall out when your ears get sweaty and also they keep battery pretty good! I've had them for over 6 months. I got a pair for my brother and he likes them too!
1,"I like the packaging and case for the headphones,  all of the different buds replacements which is nice for different ear sizes"
1,Good
1,"Great quality, great service, no complaint whatsoever."
1,"These headphones are comfortable, easy to pair, and have great sound quality. Would recommend."
1,"It work really nice and great noise cancelling and bass, however the ring to hold on to my right ear is quiet loose."
0,"Some black cloth from the earbud came out of it while I was wearing it and it got stuck in my ear and I had to go to the doctor to get it removed. So... 1 star for that guys, wtf."
1,Bought this in February and they started going out in November. Got about 8 months of use out of them.
1,Good sounding headphones.  Better than I expected.
1,best headphones ever great sound
1,Great headphones! I have used them everyday for the commute and for the gym and they last a while. Sweatproof and sound proof. Good value and good customer support.
1,These are my 3rd ones. Came defective. Ear peace rotating and won’t stay in place.  Sound is great as always. That’s why it’s 3 out of 5
1,Will never buy beats by apple ever again. These are just as good. The over the ear hooks are a little flimsy but get the job done well enough. I wear them all day and are comfortable.
0,"So at soon as my wife opened it she loved it, until she noticed that one of the items was missing. Hopefully it works as expected since is charging right now."
0,Work up a sweat and they short out. POS.
1,I love them. Easy to use. (My first Bluetooth device) noise cancelation and comfortable.
1,"Was not originally thrilled with the sound quality but received an email from the company that their customers were their #1 priority. I explained that there seemed to be distortion at medium volume level they sent me an email to factory reset the ear buds. I have to say it improved the quality immensely.<br />Bluetooth works great with my iPhone 6. Excellent quality when talking on the phone. If you like a fair amount of base in your music, you will be very happy with these. As a point of reference I own a par of the Powerbeats2 and GearCircle Bluetooth ear buds as well and these are very much in the same neighborhood on quality sound.<br />One area where the SENSO excel is with ear comfort. The parT that goes around the ear is a soft silicone or rubber that sits gently on your ear and doesn't irritate after hours of wear. I have also never owned a pair of earbuds that fit so securely and softly within the at itself.<br />I don think you can get better sound for the cost."
1,These are super lightweight and easy to connect to my laptop when I work. I haven't used them for exercising just yet but they feel very secure and they won't give me the fatigue that my large over the head headphones cause after a while.  Recommended!
1,"Good audio, having some difficulty in selecting the correct ear channel insert."
1,"Great sound, decent range. Wish the rubber that wraps your ear was more solid and able to form and shape around your ear.."
1,"I've had the headphones for a week now and only have had to do the initial charge and haven't recharge since.  In that time I've had 3 workouts each about 1 hour.  The battery is rated as up to 8 hours play time and I am testing that out but so far so good.<br />The quality of the product is good, they even sent out a car charger which is nice.  Happy with the purchase thus far and think the price is right.<br />I also purchased the 2 year warranty as my prior headphones (very similar) but had Bluephonic logo instead of the Senso logo died after 8 months.<br />And as these are very similar the 2 year warranty at $4.99 seems like a good idea."
0,This thing worked ok for a bit but quality control is definitely an issue. The sound cuts in and out when it gets windy which isn’t a HUGE deal but the straw that broke the camels back wasn’t when I pressed the on button one day and it just depressed permenantly. The button literally sunk in and didnt pop back out. I tried my best to pry it out but it was useless. Needless to say these are now trash.
1,"These headphones are very comfortable and stay in place well. They also have excellent sound quality. I have only used them a few times, but I am very pleased with them thus far!"
1,Very nice set of ear buds.
1,"Excellent product,  I love it."
1,"good quality.<br />fast shipping, direct to my home"
0,Good sound but you cant have your phone far away.  Not even on your body behind you...Very poor connection via bluetooth
1,Awesome quality for the price.
1,"I was quite impressed with these and all that came with it. Very worth the money. I have small ears and have a hard time finding any headphones that fit and at first was worried these would not work as they kept falling off/out, but the over the ear piece is very flexible and once I got that wrapped around tight enough they fit fine; only have had the opportunity to wear them once and they stayed put!!!"
1,Love these headphones! The case and two chargers was a great bonus and the sound quality is great!
0,"I purchased these for my 11-year-old daughter, who tried them once and told me they sounded bad. I tried them myself and she was absolutely right. These are very low-quality headphones.  Listening to these, I have a hard time believing that the reviews touting the quality of this item are legitimate.  Put simply, the sound is not clear or full at all. The similarly priced Taotronics wireless pair I purchased for myself sound like Bose compared to these.  This product is a waste of money if you care about sound quality."
1,"I'm not a music geek, but I like the way these sound and the long playback life will do well for what I bought them to do. They fit fine and had a pair of foam eartips in addition to the silicone ones, which was a bonus for me since they give a great fit.  Even though the short charging cable was missing in the box (I will be contacting them for one), they are a great bargain for those that need or want a long playback life in between charges and not want to shell out a fortune."
1,Can’t say excellent ones but okay with the price
0,"The headphones do work mostly as advertised. They do pair with devices easily, and do produce good sound quality. However, it very easy to cause interference with the  Bluetooth. The mic has a difficult time picking up sound, and hardly works for phone calls."
1,"I really like them.  They work well.  The sound is great.  However, they hurt my ear.  I wish the ear buds were softer."
1,Good sound last long<br />I used these ear buds for a marathon and it was great
1,Replaced headphones quickly.  My daughter loves these headphones.
1,"Nice headphones, lightweight and good sound...quick customer service when I had a question.  I did my research and these fit my needs! Ordered a second pair for my other half too....."
1,"These headphones were &#34;okay&#34; because they didn't sound as good as I was hoping, music sounded a little muffled. I do like the design and were comfortable to wear but the sound was just not working for me. The bass was okay and It was pretty loud for such small earphones and with bluetooth. I gave it 3 stars because they were okay in my opinion."
1,"Product came quickly, with good follow-up,. My husband is enjoying it!"
1,"The headphones are comfortable and the sound is fine, but the problem I had with these was that if there is any wind in your face,  a &#34;wind roar&#34; is produced that is very loud and drowns out the music. Not even a super wind. It has been sunny and in the 70's, so I would call it a pleasant breeze.  I'm walking with these headphones, not cycling or jogging which I would imagine will just intensify the disturbance. Prior to this I had Motorola flex and didn't have the same issue so, for me, this is a deal breaker and I am sending them back."
1,Excellent product loud and clear and costumer service is unbelievable.. Can't go wrong dealing with this vendor or product
1,"The earbuds are comfortable and secure, I never worry about them falling out, which is much better than my old ones. And the button controls are a fantastic feature. Once I figured out that you press the red logo on the side to use the muti-function button, it was all very easy and convenient. Definitely worth the price, I'll never go back to the cheapo earbuds again!"
1,Wonderful headphones. Light and easy to use. I may buy an additional one.
1,One of the best headphones I've ever bought and such a great price!
0,Sound quality is terrible. I don't know how people could say they sound good. They sound like ear buds you would get at the dollar store. If you don't mind poor sound quality they could be ok to wear during exercise or some activity where you wouldn't want to mess up a good pair of headphones.
1,Senso bluetooth headphones are easy to install (the instruction book is easy to follow). The sound offers good quality for the cost. The small case makes it safe to transport the headphones. I would buy them again without hesitation.
1,Endless power. Amazing sound quality and perfect fit. Perfect for my gym practice.
1,A bit big but overall I'm satisfied with quality and design.
0,Not that impressed with sound.  We will see how water proof they are
0,too loud/harsh even at low volume. Just average headphones. Stopped using them in a week or two.
0,Had these for close to 2 months and was happy with the audio quality and battery life. And then one earbud cracked and split open from no real pressure. Very flimsy quality. Was happy with them but would not buy again because I’m worried they’d just break again.
0,These earbuds feel so cheap! I had senso before and they weren't plastic. These feel like I got them from the dollar store. Im disappointed in the quality.
1,"I really like my headphones--they fit easily in my ears and don't hurt. I still think the quietest setting is too loud, but that's a complaint I've had about every pair of wireless headphones I've owned."
1,Awesome headphones with great sound. Especially for the price and it comes with charger cable and lighter adapter to charger in your car. Also come with case to protect them.i would definitely purchase again!
0,Broke after a month or two.
1,"Loving the Senso ActivBubs, very good quality!"
1,The
1,"$30 ??? And they sound GREAT? .....not just pretty good,  not just really good, but yes, GREAT. I spent $249 on Bose Wire Free but the left side kept going out *read the reviews, it's a really bad problem with them*, so I took them back. I ordered a pair of the 1MORE triple driver AND I ordered the SENSO (because I was hoping for a wireless pair)<br />I was going to try both and send one back, figuring the $30 pair would be going back, but had to try because of the reviews, but positive reviews or not, I still figured there's no way $30 headphones would even be worth bothering with. Boy was I shocked. Both sound almost as good as the $249 BOSE, and are actually better *Because they actually work* and the Bose dont work, period.<br /> Bottom line: I'm keeping both.  The 1MORE for at home, the SENSO's for working out ......<br />The sound is shockingly great"
1,Awesome!
1,"Great headphones, and even more amazing value. Purchased another set for my brother. He is going to think I spent $150, but no, $35!"
1,This is the 2nd pair of Senso Ear Buds I order.  The first was a few months ago for my Husband.  He is a Home Improvement Contractor and loves them very much because they are dust and water proof.  So I ordered a pair for me this time.  And I love them so much I am getting ready to order another pair for my sister as a gift as well.<br /><br />/
1,bluetooth connection and sound quality is good and worth for the price you spend. but when you are on call the other person could not hear your voice properly as the mic is fixed with the earbud. used it with iphone6s.<br />I will give 5 stars interms of customer care. They replaced mine since I contacted them for warranty support.
1,"First, I ordered 2 pair at around 11:30 in the morning, and had them when I arrived home from work. That was great.<br />Pulled the headphones out, charged them and connected them to my phone with no problem.<br />I have used this for 2 days and it works great. Just as advertised.<br /><br />Thank you"
1,Work great for the price no problems with connection when I am running.  Nice fit.
1,These are great headphones! They are easy to charge and they quickly linked to my IPhone. The sound quality is full and rich with a balanced tone. They also look stylish and fit comfortably. I'm very happy with my purchase and will probably by more to give as Christmas presents.
1,"These have really good bass. The mids and highs are decent. Don't expect them to sound like jaybirds, but for $40 I would buy these over the jaybirds everyday. The bass is just as good and the mids/highs are only slightly worse. Overall a GREAT product for the price."
0,"I've had them for a couple weeks and they have performed flawlessly.<br />4/4/18<br />Quit working, won't charge or connect with device"
0,Great headphone for as long as it lasted. At $30 it cost me $8 a month to use them until they went dead. I was hoping I had finally found a good product. I guess you get what you pay for.....
1,"For the value, you can't go better here. Great quality, a ton of extras, and when people say they get loud, they aren't kidding!! So glad I bought these... Got the same quality of a $150 pair... For under 40 bucks"
1,Working great with my exercise routine.
1,I use them all the time and have had no problems. They're very comfortable and easily last a whole day.
0,Only right earbud has sound.
1,"I’ve had these since 2017. I’ve wore them running, weight training, mountain biking, rain/sweat.  These have lasted! I’m writing a review three years later because I accidentally left these in my hoodie pocket and they went through a washer and a dryer.  Guess what? Listening to music with them as I write this review! I’ve used beats, jaybirds, and skullcandy. These are the best I’ve owned because of price and their integrity."
1,"I received the headphones a promised. Haven't had a chance to use them for an extended time yet. They are very light and comfortable to wear for the time I used them. Sound was good, but I'm no audiophile. They were easy to pair with iPad and iPhone. Looking forward to using them on a trip next month."
1,I love these.  I run with them. Sound good. Comfortable and charge lasts forever.
1,I just received these headphones and they came quickly and as described. The carry case is handy. The fit is nice and snug and headphones block out surrounding sound. Sound quality is great.  Set up was quick and easy. Very happy with Senso!
1,Works great and easy to use.  Great price too.
1,"Great deal!  Great sound and noise cancelling, too!"
1,"These are great. The sound is good, the packaging is nice, all the extra buds are nice, but, they will not stay on my freakishly weird ears. I've tried everything under the sun, and I'm just going to return them for a over the ear set."
0,"i purchased these to replace an older pair of Bluetooth headphones that broke on one speaker. i was excited for the high reviews on this model and its water resistance as i primarily use it biking so i definitely sweat while using them.<br /><br />The Pros (reason i didn't give 1 star):<br />1. The pairing and audible speech are easy and intuitive. I.e. it says &#34;power on&#34; and will identify if disconnected clearly<br /><br />The Cons:<br />1. Extremely short range, i would say the range where it works best is within 1-2 feet  from the device its connected to, which can be frustrating if im biking since i usually have my phone in a backpack not in front of me. This is by far the most frustrating part of this product, as we speak its breaking out and i have the phone sitting in front of me on a desk 3 feet away.<br /><br />2.  The cord connecting the ear buds is oddly bad quality. It constantly tangles while im simply wearing it, causing lots of tugging motions, sometimes pulling it out of my ears while simply walking in a straight line.<br /><br />I would avoid these as any other Bluetooth headpones cheaper or more expensive have been far superior."
1,"Affordable and functional. Good bass response. Fits kind of weird over the ear but adjustable (unless I'm using them wrong. The arm doesn't hang over the ear from the back, it does from the front. Strange, but it works and is fairly comfortable).<br /><br />I accidentally left them on overnight and they were still on in the morning indicating a long battery life. However, I wish they had auto shutoff if they go for several minutes without audio).<br /><br />Happy with the purchase. I haven't used them as a phone headset so I cannot comment on microphone pickup or quality. I imagine they will be okay, but can't say.<br /><br />As for noise cancellation... not sure if they mean because you can use them to plug up the ear canal or if they actually produce frequencies that cancel outside noises. I'm going to guess because you can use them as earplugs. Either way, didn't buy them to cancel out outside noise and I don't know if that works or not.<br /><br />Happy with purchase. Glad I bought 'em. :)"
1,Love it pertfect. I have never been so hands free!
0,"I wish I could write a good review but I can’t. I went through two pairs with the same issues. First is an incessant beeping, one beep about every ten seconds. The issue seems to be with the Bluetooth connection with my IPhone. I could have lived with that for a $20 product, but more important is that they constantly disconnect and turn off. This can happen after a couple of minutes of use, making them useless. Th3 company was good about replacing the first pair but I won’t bother with pair number two. I will look for something better."
0,"I ordered two pairs of these headphones for both my wife and I. They worked great and loved them until after about a year, they both gave out. I tried resetting them but neither will even turn on!! I tried reaching out to Tekatron but they said warranty expired and there is nothing they can do. What a waste of money. Save your money or spend a little more and get a decent pair of headphones that will last longer than a year."
1,Excellent!
1,For running these are great! I love how easy set up and use is. Prior to these I was using factory ear buds or fun to run in Florida with.<br /><br />Great price good product
0,"I will be ordering a new pair of headphones from a different company. I'll do a better job shopping around. This is my third pair of headphones that has stopped working.<br /><br />These headphones lasted from mid-May 2018 until today, and were sent to me as a replacement for another pair of headphones that stopped working completely in early May (I had those for well under a year). Specifically, with this pair what happened to me today is that the left earbud completely stopped working while the right earbud is still working.<br /><br />When it works, it works well. The audio sounds good and they really are noise cancelling. But after some time/use, a couple of common problems that I had with all three pairs that I owned is 1) When you're trying to talk on the phone, you have to hold out the bud with the built in microphone because otherwise, the person that I'm talking to can't hear me well. 2) If I walk 10 feet away from the device that I'm using, the audio breaks up and disconnects. This started to happen to me over the last couple of weeks with this pair, and today, the left earbud just stopped working. I would suggest to pay a little extra and get better quality headphones. I am giving a star back because their customer service is great and they get back to you very quickly."
1,"SOUND GOOD, I LIKE."
1,I'm completely satisfied.
1,Power/Pause button hurts ears to use when plugged in. Hard to secure in ears without pausing. Volume up/down are not intuitively placed (the button closer to the back of head turns volume up).
1,"light weight, good noise cancellation. good sound quality, easy to connect."
1,""" Just bought my second pair. My last pair were great but finally succumbed to my abuse. These have great battery life and never fall out. And of course, they have awesome sound. Buy these."
1,"So far they are great....I bought them to use on my motorcycle,  so I have not tested them on the motorcycle. ...But I will say 100% very  very satisfied with how fast I got them...the sound quality is very good. I spoke with my mom and she can hear everything in the back with just my phone, but with the sensor Bluetooth headset she hears nothing...so thank you again. ...great service so far...."
1,Love these!!!
1,Used for the first time at the gym today.  They feel good and didn't slip.  Like them very much so far.
0,"I bought these headphones to wear for running and weight lifting. I need cordless because the cord gets in the way when I'm doing squats but also they need to stay in my ears for running.. Unfortunately these are not good. They don't stay in my ears (yes, I've tried the different sizes of buds). .they're bulky and fall out of my ears.. when I try to adjust the cord behind my head they pull the headphone out of my ears. The silicone pieces that wrap behind the ears are incredibly flimsy and way too soft to hold them in place. The sound quality gets garbled when I put my hand near the headphones and the button is so big that when I try to adjust them, i end up accidentally pausing the music.. These are much more annoying than they're worth. I'm sending them back."
1,"Wish the wrap around the ear part wasn't so big but overall it's nice, works well."
1,Bought these earphones for my 12yr old son and they were a great fit. They don't fall out of the ear and have great sound quality. Can be fully charged in 2hrs and can be used for 6hrs no problem. Super happy with my purchase.
0,These headphones though were more expensive than headphones just as nice are really uncomfortable to wear around the ear. I wish there was a way to take off the hook strap that connects on the earbud
1,"I was on a &#34;Blue Tooth&#34; mission for the last few weeks.  I didn't want to take my Dre Beats to the gym because once i have low blood sugar, i tend to lose items.  And Dre Beats are too expensive to be giving away.<br /><br />I went to Costco and bought the Plantronics for about $55.00.  Huge Mistake!  The volume was almost indiscernible, and there was a pronounced imbalance between the Left and Right audio.  To the point, where it was like listening through a monophonic headset.  I took those back, tried to post a review to warn other folks at Costco about my experience?  And they never posted that review.  Guess they know those Plantronics are a $55.00 problem, so they have to move that inventory anyway.<br /><br />I decided to try out Amazon, and see what they had to offer.. These Senso's were under &#34;Amazon's Best Seller&#34; and boy i know why.  The sound quality is unbelievable.  I only have to tap the volume control only once to have better audio decibels than my Dre Beats, as well as the Plantronics.<br /><br />The ear buds fit perfectly.  I placed them on my ears and they fit snugly.  They also seal out outside/environmental noise once you have them adjusted just right.  This is great in my gym because most of the clients come in to talk.  And my gawd, those males sure can talk!  And when they get around an attractive female (Obviously, I'm not included in that number), they talk even louder.<br /><br />Thanks to the Senso blue tooths, i can enjoy/endure my workout in peace.  Granted, many people in my gym (and most gyms i've worked out in)  hate being ignored, and become almost enraged if you don't socialize.<br /><br />This means, you might hear about a woman getting her butt kicked while happily bopping to the Gladys Knight and the Pips, Aretha Franklin, Stevie Ray Vaughn, Michael Jackson, George Clinton, and the P-Funk All Stars..<br /><br />Good times, man.."
1,Thank you very much for  the best and prompt service you've delivered.I do like very much the product and I recommend to everyone who loves to listen the music while working out at the gym.
1,Holds a charge well sound is good also
1,"I've had these ear buds for 2.5 years and they hold a charge for 2-3 weeks. During that time I will do usually 8-12 hours of running per week.  They don't slip, and they come with different sizes of ear pieces.  They are easy to charge and I don't lose them because I tuck the wire into my hat or pony tail. Lately, I haven't even been tucking the wire in and they don't move. Missouri heat and humidity means LOTS of sweat. The waterproofing is the real deal. The sound quality is wonderful, too! No way would I switch to something else!"
0,"They are wireless,  that's the only thing going for them.  If you're looking for noise cancelling,  these are NOT for you!  Edited to add that the description  lists these as water proof (I wouldn't try to find that out) and noise reduction (which they are definitely not).  The loops to go around the ear are too big to actually fit correctly."
1,Nice package. Good quality
1,"Great product,  Shipped quickly as usual"
1,They sound good but  I wish the Bluetooth phone connectivity would work better.  People that are on the phone with me tells me they can barely hear me.  Other then that the headset is ok.
1,I've had the headphones for a couple of weeks but so far they work as desired. I use them to jog and the sound holds up well when I sweat. Also they stay on my ears and don't wobble at all. Very happy with this purchase.
1,These are great! Work well at the gym.
1,Loved it so much that when I accidentally lost them I bought another pair.
1,Got my headphones yesterday and it was a breeze to charge and pair with my phone. Clear sound and comfortable in my ears which has been a problem with other earpieces. Overall very pleased!
1,"Clear, crisp sound, stays in place, comfortable and easy to charge! Highly recommend for runners out there!"
1,It works great. Definitely recommended
1,"Great sound generated from a relatively inexpensive set of headphones.  Accessory kit -compact carrying case, Apple lightning to USB cord, dual port car adapter, extra ear pads, charging cord - is an added bonus!  Would definitely recommend to a friend."
0,"I've had this item a few months now I've had to go back to my old Bluetooth, the quality of sound is not that good for the person on the other end of the call. I do like that it announces the number calling and that it announces when you turn it on or shutting off. I would not buy this product again."
1,"Using the Headphones for some days now, seems to be working great. Its just as described and what I needed. Battery could have been a bit better but it is good and manageable."
0,Fits great but the bass quality and connections are very bad. I’ve had issues weekly at the gym with the music getting gargled even tho my phone is only a food away. Battery seems iffy as well. Only getting 4 the last two times I’ve used them
1,"These are are pretty good for the price. I primarily use them with an iPhone while walking my dogs. I had to completely roll off (turn down) all of the bass in the EQ for Spotify . They don't distort even with the bass louder. This are my first bluetooth earbuds so I'm not sure how the others compare except that these seem to be a little cheaper than some.<br />Durability is key for me - I've had to replace so many earbud/earphones/cords, etc. I just had to try bluetooth.<br />I write back to report on them after a period of time using them."
1,"I’ve had a number of Bluetooth devices and I’ve never had one connect so easily and quickly. It can connect to 2 devices, which is nice when using it with a phone and iPod."
1,Headphones in my opinion are excellent.  They are comfortable and the Bluetooth set up was easy.  They are a good quality product.
1,These earphones have great sounds but you need to change a bit on the equalizer to bring out the capabilities of these earphones. The sounds are great at this price point and the amazing sound isolation is big plus!<br />I use these earbuds mainly for working out in the gym and they are water resistant enough for them to get some sweat on them and not have any issues.<br />Battery last about 6-8 hours worth of listening time.<br />They are overall great sounding earphones and offer great value for what you pay them for!
1,"Sound quality acceptable, but not the best. There are cheaper ear phones out there with the same quality of sound. Relatively comfortable to wear. I wouldn't buy again, instead would buy something cheaper."
1,The quality is really good of the earphones! I can hear people well. On the other hand at times the person I am taking to on the phone when I am in the car they can hear the background noise of the radio.<br /><br />When using the earphones at home or with the car radio low you can hear the person really well on phone.<br /><br />I liked them well that I ordered another pair to keep in my gym bag.  Very nice quality. The packaging was very sturdy and the extra item the company adds for use was really good.
1,"Pretty good for the price, although it stopped working in a few months but the customer service was great and they sent me a new one."
1,Better than the price you pay. I gave 4 stars because it's hard to tell when they are on or off. Other headsets like this have a light that will show you. These too have a light but it shines through a tiny pinhole. Sound is decent and they were easy to pair.
1,"Great battery, good sound, better price."
1,"Impressive for they money, the controls leave a bit to be desired, sound quality is good for they money, and they come with a plethora of options and accessories."
1,Good value.
0,The sound quality was decent nothing special at all. Noice canceling sucks.<br />And I’m never using them again lol. That’s it.
1,Very nice wireless ear buds - I don't know what took me so long to buy some - love not having wires get in my way while running. My only complaint is that they don't sound the best when it's windy outside. Otherwise great product for the price.
1,Love these headphones!  They are very comfortable and fit perfectly in my ears.
1,love these headphones - lost the 1st pair and immediately ordered a replacement pair!
1,"I bought these because of the reviews and ratings. I figured it was a safe gamble given the low cost, and so far it seems to be a big winner.<br /><br />The pictures make it look like you have some rather bulky plastic things on your ears, and honestly they are a bit ungainly, but so are most of the wireless earbuds on the market, so no big knock against these. Fortunately, they feel extremely light and barely noticeable. Some vigorous head shaking (to simulate running) couldn't shake them loose. I don't normally like the earbud style, but these seem pretty solid with the extra security of the soft silicone ear hooks.<br /><br />Sound quality seems great to my unsophisticated ear. I lowered the volume compared to my wired Yurbuds.<br /><br />Pairing with the phone was easy once you know which button did what. Reconnecting after powering back on was flawless as well.<br /><br />Unless they fall apart in the first month, I'm sticking with the 5 star rating."
1,Really good at tempering the airplane noise but remember to charge it :)
1,"Pros- Material is of high quality and is holding up during sweaty gym sessions<br />  - Battery life is as advertised with a solid 8 hours<br />  - Comes with a nice little case to protect the headphone<br />  - Three sizes of plugs for your ears comes with it for maximum comfort<br />Cons- Sound is only ok, for most songs it does the job well but when tested with heavy beat it shows its price tag<br />  - When it gets close to being dead (about 10% battery) an annoying voice tells you its about to die every 30 seconds.<br /><br />Overall a great product for the low price tag."
1,"Very early review, I've only used them twice since receiving them. I bought them for running based on the reviews. They are very comfortable, easy to sinc with my phone and iPad, and have great sound. I received an email from the seller making sure everything worked out and to remind me I have a one year warrenty. So far so good!&#34;"
1,"Super lightweight, great sound and works at least 100 feet from phone. That maybe only downside as can't remember where I set phone down at the gym cause the tunes keep playing loud and clear"
1,great so far
1,"If you're looking for a cheap Bluetooth option with decent sound, you can't go wrong with these. They come with 3 sizes of ear buds & the good thing is that because they hook around the ear they stay put while running."
1,I love my new headphone it's practical an easy to use....now I can not help to have one ♡
1,Had these a week so far and they're great.  The sound is WAY better than any other ear buds I have used.  I would prefer these to have all the electronics and controls in the neck area with just earbuds for ears.  If they change the design in this way it'd be a home run.  I really like the extra cable that has an iPhone tip AND the earbuds tip; AND a two port cigarette charger!
0,"Very disappointed in the lifespan. Less than a year after getting them, they just stopped working. Won't even power on now. You can plug them in to charge, and it shows a full charge the moment it's plugged. But, they are dead. Right in the middle of a song, and boom, no more."
0,"I purchased these after trying out similar headphones by TaoTronics, SoundPeats, and MPow. The other brands did not have over-the-ear hooks like these (instead in-ear fins), but I found these to be extremely comfortable. The bluetooth worked well and connectivity was acceptable. The volume range for these headphones is exceptional compared to others that I have tried, they will go much louder in comparison. I should also mention that the accessories included were welcome and improved the overall product. I wish all such headphones came with a case.<br /><br />I had an issue with the sound quality however. There seemed to be a low end hum that honestly ruined the listening experience. I know that these are supposed to be bass heavy, and I was anticipating that as it fits many of the styles that I enjoy (hard rock, metal, electronic). I really couldn't get over the ever-present hum and it muddied all other ranges of sound.<br /><br />I contacted Invotek's support and they were very prompt in responding. I reset the headphones as directed, but did not experience any difference in sound. Looking back it is likely that I got a defective pair and I should have returned them for an exchange, but instead I ended up returning them. Based on the experiences of others I may pick these up again in the future to give a new pair a shot. Should I do so I will update my review. I really wanted to love these, but the broken low end did ruin my experience."
1,Good product for the money
0,Seeing the reviews on this I went ahead and bought a pair of these thru my friend's account along with his order. Did not bother to do my research because it is cheap but i think it does not deserve the praise people are giving on here.<br />First thing I have noticed is the nasty coil whine (electric buzzing) on sound breaks like when you pause a song or when the song gets a bit quiet. I thought mine was defective but It seems that many have complained about this here when i searched for it so I guess all have this issue.<br />Sound is not balanced at all and too bassy. Highs are far off and everything sounds deep even after attempts of tinkering with audio presets. My stock samsung earphones sound better for comparison.<br />I think it should be cheaper around 15$ for what it is because it has many issues not to mention the build quality is not good. I highly doubt it can handle a splash of water as it is not sealed properly.<br />I would have returned them if i hadnt shipped overseas.
1,VERY HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT THANK YOU
1,My husband uses these while mowing and loves them!
0,"This product sucks, it stop working in a week . Very disappointed that I purchased it."
1,Open the package and it didnt disapoint me. I like how convinient it is when I have to walk and drive. Love it!!!
1,"I love these headphones. It sounds great and is sweat proof. I will have them on while running either outside or on a treadmill, and they will stay in place. Unlike the other headphones I had which fall when I run, these will stay in my ears. It will also work for a long period of time."
1,Very comfortable. Nice sound. Can't wait to use them at the gym.
1,"Incredible headphones, amazing price."
1,Everyone in my gym uses them too
1,Sound quality was great!
1,Ive had many earbuds over the years including high dollar name brand buds as hard as it is to believe these are by far the best ! I just had to replace the fist pair i bought in 2018 one one the buds stopped working . I had got my moneys woth and then some as far as im concerned!  I weld for a living so the environment is not ideal and im pretty sweaty and dirty all day everyday. The battery life on these things is pretty darn good as well .. All and all just a good bang for your buck!
1,"The sound quality really deters me from giving this a better review. I like using these at the gym, they are snug, compact, and the travel case and charger was a plus. However, I am a SQ (sound quality) addict and these are mediocre at best past mid-volume. I feel as if my $10 Gumy earphones have better SQ. The Sensos get the job done and are good for the gym, I really would shell out a little more $ next time and get something with better sound. Just my &#34;humble&#34; opinion."
1,"I researched every wireless headphones I could find on Amazon and went with these.  The sound quality is an improvement over my old headphone. My old headphones would lose bluetooth range and skip at the shortest distances.  These Senso headphones have amazing range.  The buttons allowing you to change volume and track are really great while working out, your phone can stay in your pocket.  One day they stopped turning on, I reached out to Invotek and got a response amazingly fast.  We tried troubleshooting but could not get them to power on.  Invotek sent out a replacement pair that showed up 2 days later.  The customer service alone will keep me recommending these to friends or strangers on the internet."
1,Good quality sound and battery life
1,"I received my Senso headphones two days after ordering through prime.  I like that they include various sizes of ear buds, a nice hard case to protect them and easy to follow instructions.  What I love about them,  along with a very affordable price,  is how easy they are to charge.  There's a charging port located on the right ear piece  that I charge using my cell phone and tablet chargers.  Connecting to Bluetooth was fast and easy with my phone and tablet. They hold a charge for a very long time and will fully charge using my lenova tablet charger in under an hour.  What I dislike - they are too big for me so not as securely attached (although I've gotten used to it and haven't had them fall off) - the small earbuds are tiny, even for my small ears and the medium which came attached are a little larger than average size earbuds but I did get used to this as well. I do recommend buying for the low price they really work great!  These are my first wireless Bluetooth headphones and I'm satisfied, only took off one star due to the large size of the medium ear buds and large not completely secured to my ear back piece to hold in place."
0,I bought these in October 2017 and they died May 30th 2018. Wouldn’t turn on all of a sudden. I used these to workout and run. They wouldn’t occasionally lose the Bluetooth signal as well during my workouts when connected to my phone. Audio would go in and out during the time. Wouldn’t but again.
0,"I was super pumped to see these delivered after all of the great reviews I saw on them. However, that enthusiasm soon faded as soon as I tried using them. They connect to my phone, but the sound constantly skips. It sounds like a CD player skipping except it’s constant. I have tried all of the trouble shooting and nothing seems to work. Sadly, I’ll be returning these."
1,"These are incredible. The base sounds awesome, they stay in my ears, and they are easy to use. I can leave my phone in my bag and walk all the way across the gym and it doesn't lose its Bluetooth signal! My boyfriend who bought the $200 beats is so jealous."
1,"I have to say I'm definitely impressed.  The headphones feel well made and have performed well.  I've put them to the test and even had them connected to two phones simultaneously - one for media and one for calls - and they've not missed a 'beat'.  At less than half the cost of what I usually pay for bluetooth wireless headphones, these are a great deal. Music and media sound good and they don't feel invasive or uncomfortable when I wear them all day.  These definitely stand up well to competitive more expensive brands."
1,Awesome for workouts!
1,I've had mine for over a year and use them for work outs 3x/week and they are still working great. Actually more comfortable than my wireless Beats.
1,"GREAT! I use them everyday, and they are the most comfortable headset I have used for exercising."
0,"The picture is deceiving. The cord is not fixed looking as it appears in the picture of the product.  It's actually free flowing and when wearing the headphones looks wavy and unbalanced, even if the cord it straightened out and all the twists in the flat wire are taken out before placing the speakers over your ears.  So when wearing the headphones, it looks cheaply made and unbalanced. I also was not impressed with the sound quality.  I purchased the headphones due to decent reviews. No I would not recommend them at all."
1,"Not the best bluetooth headphones I've used.<br /><br />The music often get choppy I guess because it's not really connecting? I don't know but my phone is only a foot away from me when I am at the gym. It also is not noise cancellation because I can still hear the gym's music when I have music playing from my earphones. I would still hear it unless I turn the music super loud.<br /><br />The back ear piece part does not really work well with my ears, but maybe that is just me.<br /><br />Tip: Not really good for running."
1,"I purchased this specifically for the over-the-ear feature as most headphones will not stay in my ears when I run.  For that, these work well and address my needs.  That being said, when there is wind, I have found significant wind noise.  In order to mitigate that noise, I have to crank up the volume.  I have not found this issue with other headphones I use for running, but that are tethered to the phone.  Those phones do not have the more boxy frame necessary for the bluetooth and I have not compared this to others (like Beats) with the same sort of design.  Also, the bluetooth sometimes loses connection when my phone is very close.  I do not have that issue with other bluetooth headphones.<br />Finally, if you use these with a sound source where you can adjust the bass/treble, etc. the sound might be good.  As is, I find it quite flat.<br />Then again, if I want high fidelity in a headphone, I turn to my over the ear phones. Would I purchase them again?  Probably, because they meet the need I was looking for; bluetooth with an over-the-ear design."
1,"I have been through several bluetooth headphones in this price range....<br /><br />The good:  sound, packaging, ease of use.<br />The bad:  won't stay in my ears<br /><br />I did change out the ear canal ports to the smallest but when I work out they fall out."
1,Great for the price
1,"I'm very happy with the quality of my headphones, especially for the price."
0,Nope. Worked for a week.  Returned immediately.
1,"The price basically speaks for itself. Not amazing sound quality, but what are we supposed to expect from this price range? it just works, and at this price, that's all i'm asking for."
1,"These are good, but they are not great. The sound quality is still poor, but you get what you pay for. The sound quality​ is better than other brands that I've used but its still not as good as I was expected based on other reviews."
1,"I have at least 4 pairs of these laying around the house and the car.  They're cheap and decent sound quality.  I can loose these and not freak out, and I can keep extras in the gym bag or whatever."
0,"They sound ok, not great and when the battery is low the only warning you get is this annoyyyyyying voice &#34;battery low&#34; every like 10 seconds until you shut them off. Could get a % view on device would be a lot nicer. Also, bought them two months ago and now they cut out and beep every few seconds when I am listening to music even after charging and resetting. Very very very disruptive and irritating. Cool charging cord, but other than that really considering returning."
1,i like the heading set and all but i need to put the volume high to be noise canceling and it just small noise. I still hear louder noise if i turn it up.
1,"Comfy, lightweight and very long battery life. The extra ear pieces really come in handy. You can even wear sunglasses with them."
1,Great headphones for the price.
0,Sweat proof but first time swimming laps they quit working.
1,"We had beats that were not very comfortable and did not last long.  They were trash compared to SENSO and cost a whole lot more money.  We thought we would take a chance on these after reading reviews.  They have great sound and balance.  We use them to listen to audio book and music.  The charge lasts between up to 24 hours.  They are very comfortable to wear.  I barely know I have them on.  I can get about 50 feet away from the source before they start cutting out.  They do not fall out of my ears.  You don't believe you can find much better even at higher prices.  I also bought my husband a pair and he loves his, as well."
1,"Easy to set up and start using, they need to charge first thing but it didn't take as long as instructions said. Very satisfied with sound, compared them to the BOSE sport wireless headphones = very satisfied. For the price it comes with BONUS stuff, case, extra earpieces for best fit, car charger, charge cord, nice packaging- very satisfied."
1,Sound quality really good. Better than expected.<br /><br />Phone quality not so great. Could hear the other end. But the receiving end kept complaining of an echo.
1,Synced with wife's iphone easy and work great outdoors. That's all I needed from these
1,"These headphones are good for the price. If they were any more expensive I would give them 3 stars. I am taking one star away because I wish I could be further from my device and maintain a solid connection, I am only able to be about 15 ft away before the connection fades, it also loses the connection from my iPhone and won't fully reconnect for minutes sometimes.<br /><br />I use these mostly listening to audio books while working out at the gym or doing chores around the house. They are very comfortable but not noise canceling."
1,"SO far so good! Packaging is really professional, you can tell these are made good. Also, I was surprised by all the components it comes with, charger, nice carrying case, extra ear buds, dual charger etc etc. They connected right away with my phone, no problem with capability.  Haven't tried them at the gym or on a run yet. I will come back after a month and see how these hold up. Great sound as well."
1,Good
1,Los auriculares son muy buenos tienen buen sonido la batería dura muchísimo me gusto
1,Charged it up and paired it to my IPhone 6s and away we went. Easy to use and very comfortable.<br /><br />Update: That was three years ago. I am still using these. My family has given me a lot of ear buds but they don't match the Senso's. Now I am using an Iphone 11 and the same story - paired it up and haven't had a problem. The charge last all day for me.
1,"So far so good, I've used them twice.  Setup and use is a breeze on the iphone 7.  Product seems to be of good quality, hoping for the best long term  I bought these because of the reviews I read.<br /><br />One minor issue so far:  while mowing the lawn I squatted down to put gas in the mower and the audio got fuzzy.  The phone was in my back pocket.  Not sure what that was about.  Seems to do fine when not attached to my hip, still testing the range."
1,Very very nice<br />Bass is beautiful<br />Loud and waaaaaaay better than the dre ones<br />Trust me on this ITS WAY BETTER
1,"Honestly, these headphones aren't that bad for the price you're paying.  They block out sound pretty decently and the sound is decent.  I will say that the headphones have too much bass on them so the music sounds a little muffled.  Also, the headphone thing that keeps them on your ear is built rather filmsy. The Buetooth reception is good too.  I'd recommend this for anyone looking for cheap bluetooth headphones that work well when running long distances."
1,"I received the headphone a day before and is in the process of testing it. As advertised, the headphone stays on your head even under a lot of motions. The overall sound is decent, with clear mid/high, punchy bass (little muddy) but you get what you pay for.<br />However, I noticed a buzzing noise when the headphone is on which can be quite annoying if there is no music playing. I have tested it with both iPhone and Android, same buzzing sound so I don't think my phones are the cause. It would be nice if there's a solution because I love the look of this headphone."
1,Delivered as promised!
1,"The case gets an A+.  The sound is good. The buds are a bit big and boxy. The loop that goes around the ear is too big and too flexible. The wire that connects the two buds and goes behind the head is too long and therefore flaps up and down on your back while you run. On a windy day, you hear more wind in your ears than music. The buds are soft and comfortable."
0,Volume buttons began to stick in down position after a month.  May not be all that waterproof and think that sweat maybe the issue?? Needed an exception from Amazon in order to return :(
1,"Pleasantly surprised by these headphones!  I figured I would give these a try before dropping a bunch of money on one of the overpriced name brands.  I really dislike earbuds because they never stay in while working out.  I chose these because of the wrap around ear section hoping it would help keep them in place.  I'm happy to say these fit perfectly and stay in place when walking, running and lifting.  Sound quality is very good, better than I would expect at this price point.  Audiophiles may be able to critique the sound quality but for the casual listener you'll be very pleased.  I typically charge these once per week and have no problem getting 6 - 7 hours out of them.  I like that they have a battery indicator that shows on phones with the latest Bluetooth.  The only negative that I can report is that when running outside in the wind these get some annoying wind noise.  This is only a problem it's quite windy and you are running into the wind.  Overall I'd say these are great bang for the buck and I have no intention of dropping $100+ on headphones I can only imagine are marginally better.<br /><br />Taotronics Comparison:  Prior to purchasing these I boughTaoTronics TT-BH06.  These headphones are considerably better.  The Taotronics I found uncomfortable and hard to keep in.  Also the bluetooth signal on the Taotronics were considerably weaker and would sometimes break up when my phone was in my pocket.  If you are looking for budget bluetooth these Sensos are the right choice."
1,The headphones are awesome with great sound and amazing range for the value price for these headphones.
1,Wish it had a longer battery life but the product works great and stays on my ears when I run even when I'm really sweating.
1,These were a gift for my husband and he is very pleased with them.
1,They are nice
1,Comfortable with excellent sound quality for earbuds.  Great connectivity.  Haven't had one problem since I purchased them.
1,These headphones are awesome.  I have owned 2 sets of beats headphones.  One wired and the other Bluetooth wireless and they are both garbage.  I decided to try the Senso brand because of some of the reviews.  I was skeptical but I have to say they are awesome!  The sound and volume is incredible!  And the best price is that they are a fraction of the cost!  I recommend the Senso brand big time!  Very satisfied on my purchase
1,I like everything about senso.
1,"Bought these, for my niece, for less than $35, and she couldn't be happier.  She commented that she thought the bass was as good or better than my Sol Republic V10s, which all the kids like borrowing.  Looks like they are currently still on sale, so will pick up a pair or two as Christmas gifts."
1,Love these
1,"These showed to be the 3 best wireless earbuds on amazon with amazing Bass, no Bass at all. Would not recomend."
0,I've only had my ear buds a few short months and they literally just stopped working one day.  They still have a full charge but one day I noticed the sound was beginning to fade however it wasn't dawning that the buds were about to die.<br />Things were well up to that point...
0,"Sound is fairly poor quality… Clear, but all in the low mid range -- week low frequency response, and pretty much nothing at all on the high-end. Plus, there is a constant (though quiet) hum whenever connected to a phone which is annoying in a quiet environment.<br /><br />I suppose not awful as an extra set of earphones for $40, but I would not use these as my primary set."
1,"Love em. Too much bass in these so they rattle if you listen to songs with a lot of bass, but that aside, they work and sound GREAT. Good battery life too and range too."
1,"I bought this second one for my wife after having good experience with what I call the ""original"" black version. However, it seems this version is a little cheaper made - at least evidenced by the little charger flap that won't stay in place. Suggests to me lower material quality.<br />The fit into the ear is a little different - not sure if I like it as well, but I didn't try it extensively<br />So overall a little disappointed that this new model didn't do at least as well as old one, or even better, assuming that the manufacturer was really into improved quality"
1,"GREAT NOISE CANCELLATION, AND QUALITY SOUND. ALSO GREAT FOR NO HAND PHONE CONVERSATIONS."
1,"I have never had a pare of headphones that sounded this good, and this Is the least amount of money I have spent on headphones for working out. Bravo! Customer service has already been extremely kind and reassuring that they will help me if I need it. Amazing company, top notch product!"
1,I bought these for the gym & the sound is excellent! They are definitely worth the price. The only reason I didn't give them a five is because of the ear hooks. They're rubber & are a little strange since they are flimsy not solid.
1,"THESE HEADPHONES WORK VERY WELL.  MOST IMPORTANTLY, THEY FIT IN MY TINY EARS AND THE OVER EAR HOOK BENDS EASILY TO SECURE THEM AS I WEAR THEM FOR EXERCISE"
1,Walk to work with them everyday! The battery life is fantastic and so is the sound! I have really enjoyed them so far!
1,"They stay put in ur ears, the feel of the wrap around ear piece was most comfortable. I literally forgot I had them on!!!!! The sound was great 👍 better then my past bluetooth headsets👏👏👏👏👏👏"
1,"They stay in the ear, that was a problem with others. The sound is unbelievable great, if you turned them up to full volume it would blow your head off. I use them with my Galaxy s7 and they work great.  Don't buy a cheap pair you will retreat it."
1,Worked great. Sound quality is everything I expected.
0,The earphones work but the sound is already low quality .I think the headphones are dying slowly .<br />Not recommended for exercise or frequent use
1,"Excellent lightweight Bluetooth. Many similar on the market but the price on these beats the other I have seen. I own 3 different pairs, all with a different name but all work and sound the same. Buy the SENSO. Great buy"
1,The headphones worked great! The sound quality and connection are excellent for the price. I would highly recommend these.
1,I bought them for my teenage daughter she loves them.
0,"As soon as I start running, these fall off my ears. The part that goes up over the ear is not adjustable, so they don't stay on if you have smaller ears. They are &#34;flexible/bendable&#34;, but don't hold. They also have a bit of a crackly sound quality at mid level volume."
1,Excellent Sound Quality- No worries about these coming off my head during walks and bike riding.<br /><br />Sync'd right up to my phone immediately - no issues !
1,"I love these things, don't be fooled by the price, they are great!"
1,"Headphones came as advertised. But if you're running or walking at a fast pace outside with your phone in your pocket the sound becomes distorted, with issues keeping a strong connection."
1,The sound is amazing!
1,These are absolutely the best Bluetooth earbuds available. Easy to pair and great sound. Love the foam ear pieces that came in the set. Don’t pay $100 for a set of the other brands when these are better and cost 1/4 the price. I’am going to order another set
1,"Have only had these headphones a couple of days now, but so far, so good. They're very comfortable and they stay put -- I wore them today during my muay Thai warm up, which includes three rounds of rope jumping, and they stayed put AND sounded great. The sound is very clear, and the noise canceling works well. I've had many pairs of headphones -- both wired and Bluetooth -- and these are by far the best yet! They're very intuitive to use for both music listening and making and receiving phone calls. And they come with a hard carrying case, plus lots of peripherals -- everything you need to keep your headphones charged and sounding great! A great-sounding alternative to the more expensive Powerbeats 2 or 3 because you're not paying for the name! I would definitely recommend these headphones to friends and would buy them to give as a gift."
1,Product works pretty well for the cost. Stays on much better than the typical wireless buds w/o the over ear piece. I do wish the over the ear piece was a bit more rigid and the cord was a bit longer. Overall happy with these.
0,"Wrong accesories, missing car charger :("
1,Great fit - great sound - no issues at all when running and sweating hard ...
1,"I bought 2 of these as gifts. Senso earbuds have great sound and comfort. The recipients of the gifts were very impressed with the quality of these sport type, wireless, bluetooth earbuds. Thanks!"
0,"These headphones are way too heavy to stay in place while jogging. They kept falling out of my ears no matter what position I put them in. They also stick out quite a bit instead of laying flat against your ear. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on these, buy yourself a better pair."
1,"First off, the product itself is great, especially for the cost. Secondly, the product arrived in a wonderful package. Lastly,  a most important the customer service was awesome start to finish. The company followed up to inquire on customer satisfaction.  Recommend product and the customer service.  Great job!"
1,Great product. charge and play. Well designed.
1,"These headphones are great. Came as described. Sound quality if great, comfort and feel level is great.<br /><br />Overall superb headphones"
1,"Excellent product great sound and volume, easy to wear in the gym! Love em,"
1,Excellent buy.
0,"Pros:<br />Price<br />Easy to hook up to your phone<br />Stated battery life is accurate<br /><br />Cons:<br />Sound quality is meh, only good for bass heavy music. I definitely wouldn't recommend them to someone who cares about the way their music sounds<br />Durability, the right earbud stopped working after 5 uses. I was able to get it working again after turning them off and on several times but that only lasted another few uses."
1,So far they are working great.  I'm still in the process of pairing them to various devices. My only question is &#34;how do I know even the better is getting low? I know I'm not supposed to overcharge them&#34;
1,sound and fit or perfect
1,Easy to set up!  The music sounds fantastic!  I would highly recommend the Senso headphones.
1,"I have used these EVERY DAY since February and they are fantastic.  I cannot workout without them.  Battery life is excellent, sweat resistance is excellent, sound quality is great, price is excellent.  Couldn't be happier."
1,"These wireless buds are fantastic. I wouldn't call myself an audiophile, but I do have a discerning ear and I know what sounds cheap. These definitely do not.<br />- Amazing value for the price. I'd pay $60 easy for these.<br />- Very comfortable to wear. Been using these for workouts and listening to music while I work (I'm an artist) and they're solid. Never felt uncomfortable or got that &#34;sweaty ear&#34; feeling in my ear canal.<br />- Sound is bass-heavy with clear mid tones and highs. I like bass, so I don't mind it at all. Very happy with the way they sound right out of the box. I've also never had to turn the volume up all the way, as the isolation from the buds does a great job of keeping out excessive outside noise. I frequently work outside with my tablet, so it's nice to just drown it all out for a bit.<br />- Finally, I really appreciate all the extra little bits you get in the box. The case is great. It's where I keep the charging cable and other ear pieces. And the dual purpose (mini USB/lightning) cigarette lighter charging adapter is already being utilized in my car.<br /><br />Senso, thank you for a great product and package!!!"
1,These are great! Fits great! Mic is pretty good too!
1,Excellent product. Clear stereo sound.
1,Amazing product and pricing is awesome.
1,"I've had these headphones for a couple of weeks now and so far they've been terrific. I bought them for running and they haven't had any problem with them falling off. They pair easily, and they work great when getting a call. Definitely recommend for anyone looking for earbuds to run with."
1,Great product and service!
0,"You may have better luck than I, but my earbuds broke after 1 month of use. Only used them while walking around town."
1,2nd set. Liked them so much I had to have another pair.
1,Love em!!!
1,Superior quality for sound and durability.... Very gym friendly
1,Really like it so far! Doesn't fit super well around my ear and feels a little loose. Maybe my ears are small. Silicone ear hook a little flimsy
1,I've only used them once so far. I like the way they stay in place on my ears. Can't wait to try them out at the gym.
1,"Excellent sound, only issue is there is a lot of wind noise while wearing these and riding a bike over 8 miles an hour."
0,"Worked for 4 months;  sound became so distorted after that time, the headphones were unusable.  I have reset them according to manufacturer instruction a dozen times, but after 5-20 minutes the distortion makes them non-functional."
1,"For the price, these bluetooth earphones are very good. They are VERY comfortable and feel as if they're not there. The sound quality is great. I read some reviews where people said that the bass was weak and/or non-existent. I disagree. The bass was pretty good. I had a good seal which I'm sure played a part in my experience. These can get VERY loud if that's you're thing.<br />  I did have a problem with the pair I had (I returned them). The left ear bud had a constant ringing while playing music or watching videos. This would sort of get drowned out the louder the volume but it was enough to annoy me and not want to deal with anymore. I read some reviews where they described this issue and were sent a new pair. I would've contacted them for another pair but I didn't like the way it looked on me. Since there is no controls on the wire like most ear buds, everything is on the bud itself which makes them rather wide. I would say they're maybe 1/3 to 1/2 an inch wide. That and my ear canal not necessarily going &#34;in to&#34; my head and instead run almost parallel to my cheeks, added with my narrowing face, I looked like I had two Apache style missile launchers coming out of my ears.<br />  I would recommend these for sure if you're lucky to not get defective ones and if you think they'll look good on you (if that matters to you) because they are REALLY comfortable, they don't feel like they're there, and they sound amazing."
1,"You can't beat these bluetooth headphones for the price.  If you got money to throw away then go with Bose for best sound quality, but SENSO gets the job done just fine."
1,"Love these headphones! They are very affordable, have great sound quality, and are comfortable."
1,I returned another brand because they wouldn't charge.  These work well and are very comfortable and well-priced
1,I've bought a lot of Bluetooth headphones before and different kinds....and these are probably my favorite the foam ear tips and very comfortable and make them stay in better when I'm at the gym.and they are sleek looking.
1,Nice Sound Quality. With One year Warranty.
0,"These seemed pretty good for the price. Sound was ok (good enough for workouts) and battery life was decent, but they didn't stay in my ears very well. After one year they started having major connectivity issues, dropping signal, and within a year and a half the battery would only last about 20 mins on a full charge"
1,"I recommend it, they are real simple to use and great"
1,They are very light and stay in my ears. I do find that the volume is louder than I would like at the lowest setting.
1,I bought these for my wife who is extra picky about headphones. I've bought her numerous other brands and she hasn't like any of them. She loves these. They fit snuggly in your ears and the audio quality is amazing. I definitely recommend these.
1,"I just bought two.<br /><br />Considering its price, the product is pretty good.<br />1. Due to two hooks on your ears, it won't fall during running.<br />2. All parts are soft which makes it comfortable to wear.<br />3. Only three buttons, but all common functionalities are available.<br />4. I used Edifier W670BT. This one is far better than that in sound quality.<br />5. Its battery can last longer than W670BT as well.<br /><br />The only two minor cons for me is:<br />1. The built-in mic is at one earphone and the reception isn't very good.<br />2. The earplugs are translucent for the red one, but not for the blue one. For me, I really like the translucent earplugs.<br /><br />In summary, I think this is a quality headphone during running with a reasonable price.<br />I'll recommend it to my friends if they need."
1,"When I told my son in law that I could no longer use earphones with my phone (after a dive into the toilet), he recommended the Senso Bluetooth set. I ordered them immediately. I was impressed by their packaging, the carrying case and how easy it was to pair them with my phone. But what blew me away was the quality of the sound! Superb! Great value! Well done, Invotek!"
1,"I got these because I needed something to use at the gym and around the house, and these are great for the price! Good sound quality (if you're a DJ or picky about your audio quality, you might want to go for something more expensive), i think for this price you won't get anything better! And you can take calls also!"
1,They fit and don't fall out of my ears.
1,I just got these in today and the sound quality is great for the price. They are very comfortable and easy to pair. The call quality is decent. I can hear people really well but the mic is a decent. You might need to speak a little louder. Overall I am happy with the purchase. It is definitely worth the money.
1,"Work well. Battery lasts for a long time and sound is pretty good. Bass is better among most wireless earbuds I've tried but not super crisp. I do notice the audio cuts out while at the gym. Not allot just a second or two, like a scratch on a CD. Otherwise good enough for me!"
1,"The sound is really good, but one single complaint is that the hook that goes around my small ears is a bit big and do not holds the ear piece very securely. But will try the smaller size of the ear piece cover perhaps will hold better."
0,"Since the new iPhone does not have an audio jack, I wanted to be able to charge my phone and listen to music at the same time.  My commutes are very long, which means there are high chances not having enough battery and also, needing to listen to music.  I couldn't give up either!  So I figured buying wireless headphones was the next best thing!<br /><br />$: Great price!! I wanted to try such headphones before committing to expensive ones.  I think these are a great alternative to buying the expensive wireless headsets.<br />Usage: Used them in a half marathon and it was great until my ears were sweating and they kept falling out / I used them when I lift as well and they slip out when I bend over to do deadlifts and such (maybe it's my ears?)<br />Sound: Quality is good, not great<br />Misc: The wire tie came off the first time and I lost it. The company was so nice in mailing me a new one.  Thanks Invotek!<br />Overall, 5-stars for the product and promptness of company fulfilling my needs and ended up keeping these after all =)<br /><br />::UPDATE::<br />My headphones stopped working after 5-months. I'm pretty bummed because I resorted to the headphones that the iPhone came with =( I can't find contact info to contact about the issue since it comes with a one year warranty. Very disappointed!"
1,"I bought these to listen to Audible books and to talk on phone while hiking and biking on trails. They work great! Lightweight,comfortable with great sound and people can hear me well during phone conversations. (My wife could not tell I was using them ). Comes with car charger and two  cords for recharge. Nice."
1,Great product and great price.
1,"These are some very awesome earbuds. I've worn them to the gym and when running multiple times and have never had any problems whatsoever. They have a perfect fit and are completely secure with the loops which you don't even notice after wearing for a few minutes. Bluetooth works flawlessly and the battery life is great. You also get a bunch of accessories like a car charger, carrying case, two charging cables (one for apple products I think) with different earbud fits. These would make a great gift for anyone you know that is an active runner or gym goer."
1,"Love the fit, the sound clarity of music and phone conversations is outstanding and the price cannot be beat.  You need to buy these; you will not be disappointed."
0,"I bought these headphones hoping to get a cheap set of Bluetooth ear buds that I didn't mind getting sweaty during workouts. Unfortunately, as soon as you start running all you can hear is wind noise from the headphones. Turning the volume up excessively loud drowns out the wind noise but it is still audible and now you are listening to music very loudly thus it is hard to hear your surroundings. I was hoping that it was just overly windy during my first few runs with the headphones but that simply isn't the case, the noise has persisted. Will be getting something else to replace them."
0,The Headphones was pretty good but after less than 2 years the power button is broke. And now they are useless
1,"I've had these earbuds for about 9 months, daily use, they are comfortable, easy to use, pairs reliably, buttons are easy to use, they have been very reliable.  However, at the 9 month mark, the charging light went out and after trying to charge it for a few hours to check if the light was just faulty or they are simply no longer charging, it was the latter.  I am leaving this as a 4-star review for now because they are a good earbud, and will see if the warranty (1 year is honored)."
1,"I have bought two pairs of these headphones. Not because the first one failed, but because I love them so much that I want to have a safety pair! Great sound, great quality. The stability of the ear hooks is a little loose but still good"
0,"PRO - You get some free completely unrelated crap with these headphones: card wallet (w/ adhesive to attach to phone case), extra ear plugs of various sizes and materials, and some car vent mounting accessories but none of that matters because that's not what you're looking for are you? You're looking for headphones, but whatever. Everyone loves free crap even if you probably would never want to be seen with said crap.<br />CON - The ear loops are made of play dough or something as you'll be constantly fixing them as you move around. Same with the cable management ""buttons"" that are just a little softer than the ear buds themselves. It takes very little effort for the everything to become loose and useless. What good are headphones if you can't keep them on?<br /><br />TL;DR - The loops are made of cooked spaghetti and the cable management is held together by hopes and dreams. Buy these if you don't plan on actually wearing them."
1,"The product is good, but not for me.  I still use them, but I don't like not being able to just insert the earbuds into my ear.  Sort of a hassle for me."
1,"Awesome headphones.  Lightweight, comfortable (particularly while exercising) and surprisingly good, clear sound.  Easy connectivity.  Very happy"
1,"Great ear buds, and sound is best for the price.."
0,"These headphones do not stay in your ear and always have the feeling they are falling out.  I have used both large and small earplugs and continually adjust, real fun running on a treadmill.  I have gone back to my IPod."
1,"For the price the performance of these earbuds is great. There is no really discernable noise cancellation, but work a properly fitting ear top (I use memory foam) most outside noise is eliminated. I've had no moisture issues, but the fit of the loop is easily bent if your cram them in you pocket."
1,Loves the SENSO Headphones
0,"Plan junk, Bluetooth cuts in and out."
0,I really like the sound quality of the music but as far as the noise canceling microphone it's not
1,Good quality for the money
0,My first pair i bought over a year ago where AMAZING!!! The second pair i bought 2 months ago are garbage... poor connection and battery only last a day
0,"These were returned because they do not stay in the ear very well, but the main reason was because of wind noise. While walking on a breezy day or running, the wind noise is so bad I couldn't even hear my music. My wife had the same problem with the same set I had bought for her too, so I returned both and bought some Insignia  &#34;on ear&#34; style which sound so much better, no wind noise but still able to hear surrounding noises like traffic."
1,"so far (day one) theyre really great.  love the fit, the features, the sound.  ask me after some sweaty workouts...<br /><br />had to return the first pair when the mic stopped working.  i love these headphones.  theyre perfect."
1,"The charger brakes very easily. The 2 in one charging system is the weakes link. They replaced it for me but it broke just a few days later again. O well, I have other chargers."
1,Had it for a month now and it’s working great!
1,Love this product. Just dislike how evertime you go to adjust them the power button is located in area where you turn them off evrytime.
1,👍
1,"I was really, really impressed at the sound these headphones delivered when I first put them on, even prior to charging them first.  While treble-heavy and bass-light, the pure 3D-ness of the sound blew me away.  Even when listening to voice recordings that I recorded with my phone, I was struck by how realistically it seemed that I was actually inside the recorded environments.  That's the first time I've ever experienced that with phone voice recordings.  And music fares even better."
1,"I purchased this headset along with a Panda Bluetooth 4.0 Nano USB adapter to use on my Ubuntu OS laptop, and also for general exercise/running. I had some initial difficulty to get the ear buds to seat properly in my ear, but after I got the hang of it the sound quality improved, and the headset proved very difficult to dislodge. At first the sound quality seemed somewhat 'tinny' but after adjusting a few settings on my laptop it improved dramatically (note: testing on my iphone the sound came through just fine). The quality of the included accessories is much better than I would have expected for the price."
1,Arrive promptly and
1,These headphones are exceptional!  I highly recommend these to anyone looking for workout or hiking buds.
1,Love these.  Perfect for my bike rides. Tthey don't fall out or lose signal when I sweat.
1,Definitley worth the $20.00  I bought them for running and they work great.  Not sure why people would spend hundreds of dollars when you can get these for $20.00.
1,"These fit well and stay in place, and seem to be quite sweat proof. The sound quality with music is okay, but using them with my phone for talking to someone using the microphone is muffled."
1,Excellent product and customer service. Easy access to the quick power on / off button on the side and good sound. Noise suppression could be better.
1,"They are very comfortable, and provide great volume, much louder than other ear phones I've tried."
0,"Avoid these headphones. It quit working after 1 year. Useless warranty, defective manufacturer, save your money and buy another one."
0,I bought Thames figuring they wouldn’t be that great but good enough to at least have a phone conversation with my husband. That was a joke these were absolutely horrible. I sent them back and will never buy any of their products again.
1,I bought my first pair of SENSO Bluetooth headphones over a year ago. Just bought a back up pair in case of disaster. I can’t imagine running without music. Your headphones are perfect. I only use the right headphone and put the left in my sports bra. The hook over the ear allows me to put it on not in my ear. With the sound on very low I can hear everything around me which is so important for running safely.
1,Great product! The sound quality is wonderful and the controls on the top are very easy to work. I would recommend these to my friends and family!
1,What a great set of wireless headphones!  It took less than 30 seconds to pair this headset to an iPod using a Kokkia plug in.  The sound is outstanding and the headphones stayed securely in place for a full 2 hour work out.  Magnificent product for $35!
1,"My first pair broke after 11 months.  I contacted Senso customer support to try and troubleshoot the issue.  We weren’t able to solve the issue so Senso promptly sent a new pair.  Their customer support was prompt, courteous, and overall outstanding.  My first pair were awesome I used them almost everyday."
1,"These are very comfortable, great sound!!"
1,I'm very pleased with this product. The Bluetooth connection is simple and works very well.
1,Love it and no complaint
1,"""It's the second purchase of senso earbuds . I buy it for my family because the quality is excellent"
1,Excelent
1,"Love these! Easy to use and ran 8 miles the first use and they stayed in place and had really good sound quality. Also, can't beat the price!"
0,"I was about to leave a great review (5 star).... but then they broke. They were perfect. The price, sound and mic quality, battery life, comfort, were great. It hasn't even been 30 days yet (almost 30 days) and the ear bud detached from the housing. I'm hoping they will replace them. I really did like them up until they busted. I have used them constantly since I have received them and would maybe understand this happening after a few months even since I use them all the time but not after a few weeks. Delivered Oct 8th broke Oct 30th"
1,It has a good sound quality. Cheaper but most effective. Feel good to use this product.
0,"these cut out so much while im cycling that theyre practically unusable, its like listening to the radio when trying to drive through a tunnel"
1,I'm very happy with the product. The sound is excellent and the different sizes of ear pieces is a very good addition. I've had trouble in the past with ear buds but these stay in my ear and are very comfortable when exercising or just listening. I'm not sure how the phone would work as there is no microphone that I can tell so your phone would have to be close enough to your mouth for that to work well. I also think it would have been nice if you gave some idea of the normal battery time so you would know when to recharge.<br /><br />Thanks for a great product..
1,Amazing headphoness
0,Worked pretty good for 2 months or so.  Then the power button &#34;stuck&#34; and I couldn't fix it.
1,Very nice
1,Absolutely love them. My wife and I use them on our walks connected to my Samsung S8.
1,So far they work great.  My primary usage is listening to sports while relaxing in the whirl pool.  I preferred to have a non-earplug piece.
1,Great sound quality! The customer service is outstanding.
1,"Range is a little week, but sound is good. For $34 there good."
1,"Got these for the wife for Christmas.  She loves the way they feel and sound.  She gets no distortion even when she turns them up high enough to block me and the kid out.  She's been picky about the way ear buds have felt before, but the size options that came included and general designed have worked perfectly for her.  I'd recommend for sure."
1,Loved them. So much better than being tethered to a device. Great customer service. 11 months after purchasing I was having intermittent sound issues. The company replaced the headphones with absolutely no hassle whatsoever. Would be a 5 if the first set hadn't malfunctioned. Hope to have better results second time around.
1,Love these headphones. Good job!
1,"Headphone sound quality is well worth the price. Battery life is impressive. Most importantly, customer was very helpful in replacing the black charger cable that didn't work as well as the white charger I lost. White charger doubles as a micro USB and lightning charger. Awesome customer service experience!"
0,"Sadly, I bought these headphones for my daughter for Christmas. I bought early because of a good sale and we didn't open them until Christmas day. Upon first use the power button caved in and the headphones became unusable. And I can't return because I bought them early and the return time frame ended. Also, my daughter is very delicate with electronics and do not believe this is due to user error. My accident prone daughter has another brand of headphone and has had zero issues."
1,"Good Price.....Excellent sound....Easy to learn to use, and very comfortable to wear...Very happy thus far with the product.  The headphones pair easily with all of our devices from the Kindle Fire to the smartphone, to the computer desktop.  Finally found what I wanted.<br /><br />The product comes with a very nice carrying case, and full directions....unlike some that I've bought lately.  Well packaged and arrived quickly."
1,"I use these every night to go to sleep.  They actually play for 8 hours on a single charge!<br />The sound quality is A+, and their customer support is even better!"
1,"Clear sound, good value.  Thank you!"
0,"They would not charge.  Once the battery died, I couldn't use them again and needed to return them.  They were OK otherwise."
1,"I’ve owned several pair of these Senso Blu-Tooth Earbuds with Outstanding results. They have great sound, they’re very comfortable to wear and the company has great customer service. Even after trying other popular blu tooth earbuds that are currently on the market, Hands Down Senso wins the contest with amazing sound, wounderful bass response, secure fit for all activities and especially the Price !!!"
1,I love the sound quality.  Left earpiece failed and customer service troubleshot the problem.  When they determined it was not repairable the sent me a new one.  Excellent customer service.
1,Very good product... nice quality and strenght! Very good for runners.. long lasting battery!
1,"I love these head phones. Great product, fast shipping, and great customer service."
1,"I own a pair of the  Sol Republic that I paid almost 3 times more for. While they do sound great they were no good for heavy exercise. I came across these while looking for workout headphones. They are perfect for working out, as they move very little and sound just as good as the Sol Republics do. The functions are much easier to use and the fit perfect. These rival any of the more expensive headphones for less."
1,"This headset is amazing for its price, do not miss it :) i dont write reviews but this one needed after I accidentally washed it (it was inside the pocket of my trousers) and its working better than before :D more clear sound now!"
0,"not worth it. I've only had these for a few months and the sound quality has dropped tremendously. They were fine for the first month, but after that, it was like they had a shortage or something. Now they sit at the bottom of my purse in their case. what a waste of money."
1,"Had these for 4 months now, and they've been the best pair I've had at this price point.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Good battery life, I usually only need to charge every other day or so<br />- Earbuds EASILY stay in, not a chance of them falling out due to the around-the-ear clip, great for running<br />- Really good sound indoors or on vehicles (where there's no wind)<br />- Once the bluetooth is synced to the phone/laptop, it automatically syncs every time on power-up, no issues there.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Loud wind sounds when running/cycling, but at the same time better situational awareness of sounds, so not the worst.<br />- Low-battery beep sound is confusing and annoying, took me weeks to figure out what was going on.<br />- Sometimes it has a phantom disconnect/reconnect to bluetooth which has a jarring &#34;DISCONNECTED/CONNECTED&#34; voice."
1,Its great but so thats why i give 4 star because Its Accessory 3 feet charging cable and dual port car charger very pathetic. Dual port charger is very light and bad quality and 3 feet charging cable is not working its duplicate. Otherwise headphone is very great very nice sound quality same like beats headphone and good base.<br />I rate it<br />Headphone 9/10<br />Headphone Case 9/10<br />Headphone short charging cable 10/10<br />Dual port car charger 3/10<br />3 feet charging cable 1/10<br />Shipping 10/10<br />Sound 10/10<br />Sound while call 7/10<br />Battery lasting 8/10<br />Otherwise its good in $30 price.<br />Overall its good no more that good. Thats it!<br />I recomend it.
1,"Love them, easy to install on laptop, great sound quality.  Definitely read instructions to install... I installed on windows 10. Haven't used the mic yet."
1,Very fast shipping. Am very happy with these headphones. They work great and I love they are wireless for the gym!
1,Shipped fast. And sound giid
1,"I use these primarily while running on my treadmill to listen to my big screen TV.  I paired it with a compact Mpow Bluetooth 4.1 tranmitter/receiver (around $25) that plugs in the TV audio jack.  If you do not have a single audio jack on your tv you can buy a cable that converts the two  left and right audio out cables into a sigle audio out cable that the Mpow can plug into.  I use the Mpow on the transmitter setting to send out the TV sound to the headphones.  The sound timing is dead on with the TV video- no lag.  I am very happy with these and use them almost every day.  I also bike outdoors with these paired with my iPhone.  Also, took the SENSO headphones and the Mpow on a business trip and plugged them into the Hotel treadmill which had a built-in TV and it worked great - no more hanging headphone wires that you occasionally knock loose while running.  Great price, great product."
0,"After about 6 months of occasional use it stopped connecting properly with my Apple Watch.  If I hold the watch right next to my head it’s clear, but my hands are at my side the connectivity is in and out."
1,Great sound and comfortable to wear.
1,"My beats had broken and so I turned to Amazon for a different pair. After reading reviews, I purchased these ones. Overall the sound is incredible and it comes with additional ear buds so you can change for comfort. The battery life is way better than my beats so that has been a huge perk. They don't fit well to my ears when I run, but then again any headphone purchase like this is a risk. I definitely recommend though, and for the price you can't beat the sound and the additional items that help to enhance your purchase."
0,These headphones a trash. They don't charge at all.
1,Bought it based on the reviews but shouldn’t have. I work out in the pool and the sound cuts off when I turn my head.
1,Works great
0,"My blue ant pump wireless earbuds wore out on me so I needed to get some new ones. These had a decent price and easy to pair. But that was about it. I took them on a run for a true test. And they failed. First, they did not stay in my ears. The sound was ok. Although, when I was running I heard a or of wind  whistling through the ear buds. I even tried the different bud attachments that came with the headphones. But still hear the whistling of the wind. Hope this helps."
1,"Easy to hook up, great sound and very comfortable."
1,Bought these for a friend they said they sound great.
0,Lasted exactly 1 month. Bought the same one &#34;branded&#34; differently lasted one month as well. Not worth the effort to even send them back.
0,The senso Bluetooth headphones are phenomenal I have recommend everybody to buy theses wonder headphones whoever the gadgets that came with the earphones did not work at all the car plug and the cable don't work at all
1,Love these. Good sound quality
0,"These headphones were never very comfortable but the sound was good enuf for the price so I was happy.....for about a month, after which, they started becoming so difficult to pair. My iPhone 6 has become almost impossible to pair with them. It just won't even show them in range.  I have two other sets that remain easy to pair with my iPhone, they are a different brand however.  These headphones do however pair quiet quickly with both my Toshiba Radius 14&#34; & my Lenovo but they will not pair as stereo headset. Only mono, so that sounds pretty bad. I'll give them to my little nephew to play with as it's too late to return. Will not buy this brand again tho."
1,Stopped working after 10 weeks - purchased as Christmas gift - Amazon return window closed Jan 31  Support window closed March 3  And now they stopped working -  Contacted manufacturer - they are taking care of issue.  Great customer service.
1,Music quality is awesome and earbuds are very easy to use when working out.
1,So far these are great headphones. They stay on very well and the sound is decent. They are good Bluetooth headphones for the money
0,Running.
1,"I use these for running and working out. I have had them in the rain, sauna and steam room with no issues. They are light weight and well constructed and the sound is way better than you would expect from this price point. I choose these over my Beats especially with their water resistance. Keep it up SENSO!"
1,This is a really great value. Well built and easily worth the money!
1,"Love these things, the range without your phone is about 15-20 feet? I’ve got tiny ears so I needed ones that wrapped around the ear and these work perfectly. Great sound quality too"
1,Changed my way of listening. Love them they work well except for occasional disconnect from phone.
1,"I bought these a little over a month ago and I haven't stopped using them since! The sound quality is great and the battery life is refreshing. I do turn them off when i am not using them. My only complaint is that even with the smaller size ear buds, they are still a little big for my ears but seeing as I have never found earbuds that fit my ears- I can't really hold that against them.<br /><br />UPDATE: I've had these for about 5 months now and I still love them!"
1,"I bought a set of Senso S250 earbuds back in March of 2018. It has been great for working out, for travel, listening to music at work. I highly recommend the memory foam ones.<br /><br />Last week my earbuds just stopped charging. They would turn on, connect, work, but could not connect to any of the micro USB chargers I had. I reached out to customer service around 6:45am on Thursday morning, and by the next Monday I had a new pair in my hands. Quick, easy, and courteous service.<br /><br />I love these earbuds and would have gladly bought a second pair, but the 1 year warranty awarded me a pair to replace the non-charging ones. Just in time for another trip! Those memory foam earbuds are great for airplane pressure and sound blocking!"
1,"These headphones were exactly what I needed.  With the over ear hooks, they stay on while I'm in the garden.<br />I specifically bought them to listen to books while I'm in the garden, and not have to worry about &#34;cutting the cord&#34; with my garden clippers when I'm pruning bushes.  So far they work as advertised, are comfortable, and I am able to hear my audio books just fine."
1,Good stuff. No issues.
1,Great product and decently priced. This is my second pair because my dog decided to crunch the first ones up.  This model is slightly different than the first one with the volume buttons protruding a little less but the quality has not changed.
1,IT IS VERY GOOD FOR WALKING AT LISTENING TO MUSIC IN MY HOME. THE SOUND IS VERY G00D
1,"I have a difficult time finding earbuds that fit in my tiny ear canals, and these were recommended by people who specifically have my problem finding a comfortable fit. I got them today, charged them, and tried them out. They came with four sets of traditional covers and 1 set of covers that are like foam earplugs. I traded out the traditional covers for the earplug version. They are incredibly comfortable, and do a great job of blocking external noise. After wearing them for well over an hour my ears weren’t sore at all, and they stayed put thanks to the earplug covers and the adjustable ear loops. Sound quality was better than expected—I don’t expect earbuds under $30 to sound like over-$100 models—but these are quite good, with adequate bass presence. Pairing was fairly easy, and while I’m still learning the controls I’m sure I’ll be happy with how things work once I get used to them. For the price I’m very happy with this purchase."
1,"I received these headphones as a gift and I love them. I am a runner, have used wireless headphones for a few years. This is the third brand and my far the best for my sport. They are comfortable and most importantly STAY PUT & I'm not constantly pushing the earbuds back in the ear! Good sound quality and usual battery life. Very happy!"
1,It is good worth for money I like it
1,"The quality is very good, the workmanship is fine, the wearer is comfortable, the sound quality is very good, the bass is heavy, the color is very good, it is fashionable, the electricity is enough, it is very durable"
1,Headphones are great for the gym. I like the way they wrap on your ear so when your working out at the gym they rarely fall. The audio quality is good as well. Battery life is good usually last me a week with a full charge so I don’t need to worry about charging them too often.
1,"Good sound,  great price."
1,Got these today and listened to recording of Metallica at us bank a month ago and they sound amazing. Like I'm at the concert. Blown away
0,"I haven’t had a chance to use these yet, but the wire tie was not included in my package as advertised."
1,"After having a chance to A/B these “Senso Bluetooth Earbuds” with my similarly-priced “Monoprice Large Driver Bluetooth Earbuds”, I was disappointed that these Senso’s have a much more lo-fi/compressed sound compared to the Monoprice as well as a strange, unpleasant EQ frequency profile.  I bought these Senso earbuds because my Monoprice earbuds didn’t get quite loud enough to drown out the gym sounds, however these Sensos acheive about the same volume level as the Monoprice unfortunately.<br /><br />I’d recommend against these Senso earbuds and suggest that most people would be much happier with the sound quality of the “Monoprice Large Driver Bluetooth Earbuds”, which are similarly priced (I bought them on sale for $11, average seems to be $15 - $20)."
1,Good headphones. The fit perfectly. I was expecting a better sound quality. I think is a good product for the price
1,"Bought 2 pair for my kids and they loved them.  easy to sync, good long range on bluetooth pick up and they a very good at noise reduction.  I went bant and bought a pair for myself.  great for plane rides."
1,Just OK.
1,I love how light weight they are. I like that there isn't a heavy mic piece on the chord that goes around your neck. They are very stylish and who doesn't love a 2-in-1 charging cable. No problems with the bluetooth set up! Great value for a wonderful product.
0,Terrible. Stopped working within two months. Both lights stay on. Have tried every reset option. Do not pair any longer.
1,Packaged nicely. The sound quality is awesome. Great product. I would highly recommend these ear buds to anyone looking for a quality product.
1,Excellent headphones. Quality sounds and comfort.
1,Best wireless ear buds I've used.  Sound quality is amazing and the battery life is awesome for such a high quality headset.
1,"These earbuds are by far some of the best that I've ever purchased and I have had some pricy ones. The fit is so comfortable and what great sound! I have had 2 pair of Samsung level U headsets and these are so much better! I like them so much, that I've ordered another pair for my daughter. It's so nice to be able to run and workout with comfortable and well fitting earbuds!"
1,Earpieces are comfortable to wear and very secure.  I am very pleased. Only negative issue I had was how small the type was in the directions. Big magnifier fixed that.
1,I bought these back in March 2017.  Use them for running maybe 2-3 times a week.  Now all of a sudden they will not charge.  Practically brand new.  I noticed other buyers have had the same charging issue with these headphones so it's obviously a consistent issue that the company needs to address.  I don't want to buy a new pair and would prefer Amazon provide a replacement.  Very frustrating!
1,I wanted a new pair of Bluetooth ear buds for the gym - old pair got washed :( - and ones with some good bass... these were the ones.  My old ones were very twangy and high treble.  These give a more balanced sound.
1,"I've had these a few days now and haven't had any issues at all. Easy to charge, easy to pair, easy to operate. This is my first pair of Bluetooth headphones and I wasn't looking for/needing anything fancy. I just needed some that were Bluetooth. These fit the bill perfectly."
1,I purchased these earbuds for my daughter. She absolutely loves them!  They are very comfortable and have great sound quality. They are also affordably priced.
1,Used with a wireless transmitter hooked to my Roku TV. Got feedback hum in them from the TV. Tried with my cellphone and they worked well. Used while running on my treadmill. No problems with them falling out or sweat.
1,"My niece, who is a runner, told me to purchase these.  So far they are great!  They stay in my ears, are comfortable, and sound quality is great!"
1,"I  ordered 2 pair for a mc ride to Memphis on my Harley. My son is very happy, but I could not hear.  Not loud enough.  Otherwise worked well."
1,"The sound is not mind blowing, but good enough especially for audiobooks and podcasts. Decent battery life, good build quality and a great accessory package (that lightning/micro usb charging cable is great!) . If they could get the sound on par with, say, the Apple Earpods I moved over from I would've been much happier with them."
1,I bought these earbuds after doing careful product research. I use them at the gym and they are perfect. I also appreciate the little zip up carrying case for carrying the device and extra ear tips. When I did have an issue - customer service responded unbelievably fast and took care of the issue to my complete satisfaction.
1,Works as advertised.
1,"they feel great, sound great, light weight.. and do not slip out of the ear as my others do.  At first I thought the over the ear part was really cheap and not going to do what it supposed to do.... I was WRONG..  For the prices they are great headphones.  You get a  two charging cords one  short one 3feet long that even has an adapter for your Iphone.  Car charger is very nice and well built also.  Senso pull out all the stops on these."
1,Comfortable and good value. Good sound quality and long battery life
1,Husband loves these so much he bought two pair!
1,"Very nice wireless headphones. The sound is great. They are easy to use. I'm glad I caught them on sale and did not pay full price, or I probably would have sent them back. I give 4 stars because the part that goes over the ears is a very soft rubber and, therefore, very flimsy. As a result, they are not that tight and sometimes try to work their way out of my ears. That is annoying, especially when I'm running."
1,"They work fine and have a great battery life, they also feel very durable.  Sound quality is good for the price."
1,Works great during training season. A overall great product. Perfect clarity outdoors.
1,"They made a great product at a very reasonable price, no brainer recomendation!"
1,"My earbuds arrived yesterday. The packaging was great. They came with clear instructions. I charged the earbuds and paired them, and the sound was crystal clear! Can't wait to try them on a run! Thanks so much."
1,"Good sound, long battery use from each charge, and comfortable. I'm sure there are better earbuds out there, but they cost a LOT more than these. These are pretty good, at an excellent price! And I like that they are connected. I suppose I might lose them at some point, but that's a lot less likely than losing just one if they weren't connected."
0,the bluetooth quit working after about 4 months. A reset did not help. I am very disappointed.
1,"Really good sound when listening to music, never cuts out, BUT if you don't have any sort of music or background audio playing and you start typing it makes an unbearably loud noise for some gosh forsaken reason, probably the reason it is discontinued. When trying to connect, if it is a saved device my iphone has a wonky time connecting to it, but once its connected it stays connected. Very very good battery life and charges super fast so 5/5 stars there. really only complaint is the loud noise it makes when typing without background audio, if you can deal with that then this is a very good priced bluetooth headphone, but i wish i knew beforehand it made the noise. I would rate 5/5 stars if it wasn't for the noise that's how bad it is."
1,"Very good headphones, one year warranty, and excellent costumer’s services. No complaints so far."
1,"I've only had them for two days, but so far so good. They fit well, the button is responsive, the sound quality is good. I hope they are durable. That has been my main issue with bluetooth headphones, but this is a good pair so far."
1,"I am very much enjoying the new headphones, I really appreciate your business. I look forward for more products to purchase in the near future.<br /><br />Thank You!<br />Alex ontiveros"
0,Claim to be waterproof but in actual fact are NOT....complete waste of money and failed within the year warranty.<br />Do the right thing manufacturer and replace them. Subjected to gym sweat and failed....garbage.
1,Bought these in Oct 7 2017. It’s now Jan 22 2019 and they still work great.<br />-Good sound<br />-Bluetooth<br />-Doesn’t hurt ears<br />-good battery life<br />-easy to clean
1,"I’m not a sound expert, but I think the music sounds fine & I have used them for a few phone calls which has worked well. I’d say battery life is around 4 hours constant use? The part that wraps around your ear doesn’t really change sizes to hug around your ear if you try to squeeze/resize it. It’s too big for my ear, but they stay in pretty well while I’m running. I often have a headband on anyway that I put around them & they are a little bulky for that. There was one day the wind was blowing & I didn’t have a headband on & since they’re a little bulky there was a LOT of wind noise. I was a little worried about the cord flopping around as I ran, but I haven’t noticed it."
1,"The sound quality is amazing. Love that it comes with a car charger for when I forget to charge it, just plug it in on the way to the gym and I'm good to go for my workout. So far no complaints at all! Super comfortable around the ear also, don't even notice they are on."
1,These are great! Not super noise cancelling but perfect for me- and the battery life is awesome
1,Great earbuds for the price point. Forgot they were in my jeans and washed them and they still work.  Earbud I.D. tip size is 3.8 .
1,Work really well and the sound is great!
0,Worst headphones ever. Had them a year..  Don't even work anymore
1,They are perfect for my needs
0,"Sound quality is great.  But have problems with bluetooth connection cutting out all the time.  My phone can be within 1-2 feet of the headset, and if I turn my head to the right the feed cuts out.  Very annoying."
0,Very poor quality. Last model was much better. Disconet from phone too often. Falls down all day long.
1,I love my Senso earbuds!! I lost my original pair so this is my 2nd pair.  I highly recommend them.
1,These headphones are amazing. The clarity that comes from them rivals headphones that cost three times as much. But what makes it even better than higher priced brands is the level of customer service.<br /><br />Less than a week after ordering I had an email from the company asking how I liked them. I had a question about replacement memory foam ear tips (these things are incredible) and in less than 15 minutes I had a reply telling me an extra pair was en route to me.<br /><br />Buy these things. They are amazing.
1,great sound
1,"Great sound and comfortable. The loops take some of the weight off the ear buds and so far the comfort has been great.<br /><br />Update: Buds died recently, but Senso easily and quickly replaced. New ones are working great. Thanks Senso"
1,Exactly as described. Works well during workouts without falling out of ears and is comfortable. Sound is heavy on the bass like other reviews mentioned but that was fine for me. Minus one star for randomly unpairing from my phone when in use.
1,I have only had these for a short amount of time. I use them at the gym and find that they are very comfortable for the hour and a half that I wear them. They stay in my ears very well and the sound quality is great.
0,"I wanted this to work, but It kept disconnecting(even from a short range)<br />now it too late to return... will have to eat it...."
1,No doubts. The best pair of Bluetooth headphones I have ever had. 100% recommended. Great sound quality.
1,I have tried 3 different headphones over the years but then I found these. They are awesome! I never loose the connection while I am in the pool I couldn't do my workout without them.
1,"So far the headphones are great, I have an iphone and the connect to the Bluetooth with easy the very first time. I run and box while wearing them and there is no problems with slipping, comfort or sound quality. absolutely happy with my purchase"
0,I have owned this for just over the year so of course the warranty ran out.  The sound was good and I was happy with the comfort.  The sound started cutting out while I was listening to music a few months ago.  I repaired them more then 3x and still had the same problem.  Im using a Samsung S5 and paired another cheaper headset and the problem was solved and is isolated as being this headset.  So you will get one good year out of them.
0,"Quality on these is not that high, even considering the price point.  I, personally, couldn't find a comfortable position for them to fit in my ears without the sound being muted or muffled.  With my phone in my left pocket, I couldn't turn my head to the right without the sound cutting in and out and as far as I could tell, there was no perceivable noise canceling going on."
1,Great sound. Best in bluetooth headphone connect and battery life
1,Wear them to workout
1,Noise cancelling is very good. I walk on a treadmill and watch TV or movies while working out. No problem hearing. I actually had to turn down the volume. Very good!
1,Only used them one day but damn I love these! I've always used regular earbuds with the chord and jack into the phone. But those always seem to die quickly or short out or one earbud mutes out.<br /><br />I only use them for working out at the gym for music.<br /><br />My boyfriend has the beats version of these which are way more expensive. I wasn't about to spend that much. So I searched for some good reviews and landed on these. They're almost the same as his but I like these ones whole charging plug and interface better.<br /><br />It has great sound quality and they stayed in my ears the whole workout even through jumping squats!<br /><br />Very pleased!!!!
1,"I have never had a set of headphones of the in-ear type that would actually stay in my ears without slowly wiggling out, but this pair does! I love the sleek design, the hard shell carrying case that comes in the box, and the overall quality of this product. The sound is quite loud, I've never had my volume up above 50%. The headphones do seem to be a bit heavy on the bass side, though I could easily correct this by downloading an audio equalizer app. The only thing that bugs me a little about it is the orientation of the volume +/- buttons. The - button is facing forward, when I intuitively think that forward would be +. It just took a little getting used to. But I love these headphones!"
1,Nice headphones :)
1,"Love these! Another BT set I paid the same for fell apart after 30 days. These are well designed and made. The on off button is large, red and positioned by itself on the side of the right earpiece, easy to feel and impossible to mix up with the other controls. Linking to devices is automatic. Sound is very good. These come with a bunch of earbud shapes and sizes, a longer and shorter charging cable and a 2 port USB for your car. The longer cable converts from mini USB to iPhone 6 tip, so you can charge your phone and the earphones at the same time. Not sure how long the charge lasts - at least 90 minutes. This all comes in a nifty little zipper case."
1,"First good thing right out of the box, they were easy to set up with bluetooth.<br />Comfortable fit, good sound quality and good phone sound quality.<br />Very nice product"
1,I LIKE THE HEADSET  VERY MUCH . I LIKE THE PLAY TIME. I LIKE THE WAY THEY CONNECT . THE SOUND IS GOOD .I AM A SENIOR AND USE BLUETOOTH  VERY  MUCH .THE AROUND THE BACK WIRE IS LONG ENOUGH .  THE CARRY IS NICE THE CHARGING PLUG IS NICE.  I LISTEN TO AUDIOBOOKS A LOT AND THE  2 PLUG CHARGER WILL WORK WELL .THE EAR PLUG  .ASSORTMENT IS SO \ SO  THE ASSORTMENT IS A LITTLE LARGE . THIS HEADSET IS ONE OF THE BEST FOR THE PRICE. THANK YOU FOR THE INTREST &#62; I WILL SAVE YOUR INFO &#62;HOPE I DONT NEED HELP<br />  PAUL BISH
0,The sound quality and pairing is good. The unit is bulky on your ears. The way the unit is designed the cord is better if in front not behind your neck. This looks weird. Also the ear hooks are too big and they don't actually do anything to hold the buds in your ear.
1,"Bought these for my dad, he uses them everyday and loves the sound quality. They stay on his ears very well."
1,much better than expected for the price
1,I use it in my morning running exercise. It is comfy and not falling off. The sound quality is good.
1,Very clean sound  No problems
1,Awesome head phones sound really good and bluetooth has a good range
1,These are the best headphones I have ever owned.  The sound is crystal clear and they are very comfortable. I would highly recommend them!
1,Exceltent product. Very good price
0,"10k+ reviews sold it for me and I decided to give these a try. For the price you're paying, most of it is going towards the accessories. I don't need a car charger or an extra usb cable, that's not what I am here to buy. These earbuds are weirdly shaped that they cause me discomfort. I don't know if my ear is weird or what, but I can't wear them for more than 15 mins without feeling pain. Not to mention the running + wind howling. I'll be returning these."
1,Comfortable good sounds
1,"funcionan muy bien, buen sonido y fácil de utilizar."
1,Excellent quality headphones. I use the for running & the sound is incredible.
0,I've had 2 sets of these. Both of them lasted about 4 months then wouldn't charge. I'm going out to buy a better set.
0,"We ordered it after seeing so many reviews. First of all this should be used best as a toy. Cheap quality, sound is bad and plastic that goes over the ear is so flimsy that it does not stay on ear while running which is the only purpose you would buy this.<br />Next part, their customer service is horrible. Product that I received was not sealed and when I opened it earbuds seems to be used. Secondly, they advertised lot of bonus accessories like mobile phone wallet and car vent holder that comes with it but I received none of those. When I reached out to their customer service, they asked me to just return the product to Amazon. Easy right. That’s what they business model is. I feel most of the reviews are fake as lot of these companies lure positive reviews by offering customers some freebies. Beware and buy it only if you are ok with using it as occasionally for emergency use only."
1,"Easy to set up, good sound quality, and comfortable fit that doesn't slip off/out of the ears. Good quality for the price, and I like the case so I don't have to throw them loosely in my gym bag. Had a question about the memory foam ear buds which was addressed quickly."
1,They are good for the price and the sound.  The actual quality of the headphones is not that great.  The black started chipping away after 2 weeks of use.  They already look beat up like i have had them for 2 years.
0,Worthless.  The clips that go over the ear are of such soft rubber that the earphones will fall off your ear at the slightest motion.  Buy these only if you plan to sit absolutely motionless while you wear them.
0,"This headphones doesn't work at all after 3 months since purchase. It cannot be powered on and cannot be charged. I usually used it at weekend when hiking. So, the times of using this is very limited. The quality of this product is bad. I will purchase another bluetooth headphone, but never choose this again."
1,"I LOVVE THEM! The sound is PERFECT !! No complaints at all ! They are everything you would want and expect ! When I am wearing them I cannot hear anything or anyone trying to speak to me !! No static , the music is clear. This is the first time I ever bought a pair and I feel so lucky that I have absolutely no coming  complaints and feel I totally scored bc they truly are perfect ! They fit perfectly on and in my ears and do not fall out !"
1,Got this for my husband.  He uses it almost all day and now he doesnt listen to me.
1,"Okay - I was just blown away by the quality of these headphones for the price! Awesome! When ordering them, I didn't pay attention to the what else I was going to receive. Check it out!<br /><br />Thanks, SENSO!<br /><br />V"
1,The headphones have great sound. Unfortunately the ear hook sucks.  Made of flexible rubber and is stretched out big. Does not stay on ear while running.
0,"The headphones are a bit clunky to use.  The ear pieces are huge and have to be bent around your ear.  The sound quality is good but after a period of a few months, they did not take or hold a charge.  Since they are under warranty the company is sending new ones.  I must say that their customer service has been excellent and very responsive."
1,Great service and product!  Thank you!!
1,Too big for my ears. Good for men or people with big ears!!
1,My old Bluetooth headphones finally stopped working on me after about 3 years so I bought these after reading some reviews. They sound clearer and last about 2 hours more than my old ones (~8 hours vs. ~6 hours). I still don't like the way they fit because of the loops but they're good enough.
1,Can’t believe the sound quality of theses headphones.  It’s absolutley AMAZING!!  They paired up easily  with my iPhone 8. I use them them for running and cycling. I sweat my butt off and these things haven’t missed yet.<br /><br />Bought these to replace a pair of Powerbeats 3 that kept quitting on me.  I’m a runner and a cyclist so I sweat.  The beats would last about 2 months before quitting. In 14 months I went thru 4 pair of beats. Saw these and I thought I would give them a try.  1 month in and no issues!<br /><br />Highly recommended
1,These headphones are amazing.
1,"Very comfortable, good sound and a great value"
1,Pretty good sound and reliable.  Sometimes very seldom the sound cuts out on one side.
1,These slip from my ear even on my stationary bike.
0,"These are not adjustable headphones, they will not fit small ears."
1,This product is amazing for its price. Sound quality is great and they stay in your ear. They give you options on the earbuds and I like the red memory foam option makes it very comfortable to wear all day. I am a delivery driver and I’ve tested these to the max. the battery life is like advertised. the weatherproofing is solid I’ve used them in all day rain. I would definitely recommend them.
1,"These things are fantastic, at a fraction of the price of the branded version. I am always concerned buying an off brand product, but gave a try due to the large number of positive reviews. These feel very sturdy and included a bunch of extra stuff I wasn't expecting! A nice carrying case, car charger and USB cable, along with rubber tips for different ear canal sizes. I am very satisfied, and considering getting the gf a pair for her birthday."
1,Great headphones. great company to work with.
1,"I bought this headset after my second pair LG Bluetooth headset died after 6 months of use. I immediately fell in love this headset after the first use: it connects to my iPhone 6s seamlessly, the sound quality is superb for a ~$30 Bluetooth headphones. The customer service is fabulous. Overall, I am satisfied with this purchase.<br /><br />Update on 8/8/2017:<br /><br />After 4 months of use, the left earbud started to have issues, so I contacted the seller and was so impressed with their superb customer service. They gave some useful tips of troubleshooting. However, I still did not get any luck, so they decided to ship me a replacement with any hesitation. I received the replacement today! I am very happy with this experience, and highly recommend this seller. FIVE STARS!"
0,terribly low bluetooth range not even 20 ft
1,"First impressions were amazing, the packaging was spot on. I loved the box, the extras and the carrying case. They are comfortable and easy to use. The only gripe so far is the sound quality. I bought another pair of Bluetooth headphones for less cost but they had better sound quality. These are definitely not the greatest pair of headphones if you like amazing music. And that's kinda what headphones are for.  I wish I could rate them higher, because the presentation was immaculate."
0,I bought this product before and was very happy with it. I use it daily while driving and job sites. After a year the battery started failing so ordered again. 1 month into use the answer button broke. I have to use the phone to make call then can use device. Also I did not notice this was the older model from the one I had. I will pay more attention on next order.
1,Great quality headphones for the price. Best sound you can get out of the size. Great car charger as well. They also make a great hands free talking device. Amazing
1,"This is my third pair of these headphones, because they are the only ones I've found that can rival the noise of New York streets, and they stay on my ears (which no other earpod style headphones ever do). Love them."
1,Good product
0,Too difficult to charge . I’ve gone back to cheap wired headphones.
1,"I really like this product, however, be aware that the rechargeable battery life is about 18 months. Per Senso, at that point, you will need to throw the head set away and buy a new one !<br />Probably not !"
1,"These headphones work well for quite a decent amount of time. They don't take very long to charge. I use them while working, delivering food. The calling function seems to be clear. They are more comfortable than other earbuds I have tried."
1,"I love the headphones and it's the best one I have yet to own.  Fully charged headphones do last a long time which is my favorite part. The only thing I came across that I do not like is when I'm working out, it tends to become loose more than I like to.  But nothing like a readjustment to do the trick."
1,These headphones are great for running! They work well and are well worth the money
1,"Love most everything about them great sound, bass & volume for the money.  Only minor negative is although they have ear hooks the body component on each ear piece is kinda big and square (probably why sound good) but I think as a result they sometimes will come out of my ear while running fairly hard or sweating.  But well worth the money."
1,Great sound. Holds charge. Great but.
1,For the price these are pretty great.<br />They stick out a bit so if you bike with them you will get wind noise.<br />Even still for a wireless set of headphones they work well with reasonable sound quality.
1,These have worked absolutely wonderful. More than I expected.
1,Very easy to sync & the sound quality it’s very good
1,"Got my headphones, love them so far, haven't had no problems with them, hope they can last me for awhile"
1,Great in-ear Bluetooth headphones.  Very comfortable sounds great. Great price.
1,love it
1,The price was right for my use and needs. It's nice that the headphones are easy to use also works well with my phone.
1,"For just trying them out, better than I expected. I will write a better review once I've used the head phones at the gym<br /><br />Updated review! 9-16-2017 So I have used them twice at the gym and the only issue I seem to have with them is I keep having to adjust them. They are comfortable, but I wish you were able to tighten up the hold on the soft rubber pieces around your ear. Not everyone has the same size ear.  That would be my only recommendation to better this product and send it over the top.  The sound quality is great, battery life is awesome. Easy to use and hook up to you phone. Just need to be able to tighten up the rubber pieces around your ear, maybe by placing a metal wire inside so you can squeeze it to snug up arou d your ear."
1,These did exactly what they said they would do. Easy to connect to Bluetooth and comfortable on my ears.
1,"They work just as advertised - great bass and a good fit with lots of different ear bud options for the right fit.  Sometimes is wonky when connecting to my computer then to my phone, but eventually works itself out."
1,This is the second pair I purchased in 2 years they hold up well.
1,"for the price, these are really good. However, the over the ear things don't really touch my hear/head at all... actually I'm not sure why they're there... Also this might sound weird but they don't go very quiet. I work in a very quiet office and I'm worried people can hear my music, on my iphone I can turn the volume down to 2 and it's still pretty loud, but below that they make a beep sound and then stop playing. They are a lot more comfortable than other headphones I've tried and you don't have to force them into your ears like others. Easy to use."
1,"Headphones sound great however I'm not thrilled with the fit. The ear loop is not removable, adjustable and does not fit will with my ears."
1,"Great seller and fantastic product! Easy to pair, convenient carrying case and lots of extra goodies."
1,Not quite as comfortable as I'd hoped.  They work very well and pair easily.
1,The battery life is great and for the price you really cannot beat the sound.  I have issues with a lot of ear buds falling out during a run and these stay in place perfectly.
1,The sound is fantastic and connectivity is seamless.  There is no noise cancelling but the form factor and volume is totally worth it.  Battery life is about 4 hours
1,These SENSO wireless headphones have worked well for me and I'm an avid runner.  I recently experienced a product failure where the device would not turn on.  I contacted Customer Service/Support and they had a few suggestions for me to try.  When those didn't work they offered me a full replacement!  What I really appreciated is their quick response.  Although the claim response time is listed as 24-48 hours they actually responded in less than 15 minutes!
1,very good only one small thing and that is the power/activate button seems to where I want to push to make sure they are in my ear well. other wise they are great. Long battery life and very comfortable.
1,"I have had these for about three months and have been pleased with them. I do have problems when using them for phone calls where the other folks will say they cannot hear me well, even though I'm in a quiet area and speaking up, so the mic quality may leave something to be desired, but most of the time I just use them for listening while running, and they've done well for that. The only thing I wish they included was a clip on the wire to enable you to clip them to your collar. I've had other bluetooth headsets similar to these and the ability to clip them to the back collar is very helpful when you only have one in or neither in, to keep them from shifting around (or falling off)."
1,"Works well.  Noise cancelling appears to be passive, not active, mostly a function of how &#34;tightly&#34; the earbuds are plugged in your ears.  They are really great for using while on the street, in that auto noise is still heard (for safety's sake) while the desired audio from my cellphone is quite audible, and with good fidelity.  They have a powerful audio level so one must be careful with the volume control.  Handling incoming/outgoing phone calls works fine, as does forward/back music selection."
0,I am so disappointed.  I have been using these for less than 2 weeks and the audio goes in and out.  I have to power down and power up a few times for them to start working again. I am definitely returning them.
1,Worth every penny and more sound was clear
1,"So sick. Great range from your phone. Decent phone mic for calls. Stay on ear perfectly. Automatically connects when turned on, with bt on. Sound is great. BEST OF ALL....$30 compared to those $300 beats. I will buy these 10 times before I ever by beats."
1,Awesome headphones
0,"I was VERY unhappy with these headphones! The sound is very good but the Blue Tooth connection is very bad. i tried them on three different devices and found that the slightest movement interrupted the signal, i couldn't put my phone in my pocket without the signal cutting out! I do not recommend this product!"
1,"I have a neurological disorder that makes it hard to hold things like a smart phone much of the time. Having a hands free way of talking on the phone and listening to music not only frees up my hands to do other things, but helps me avoid dropping my phone. The ear buds are comfortable and I have no trouble with reception anywhere in my apartment or even out to my porch no matter where I leave my phone."
1,"The bluetooth connected seamlessly. The earbuds stay in my ear even when hanging upside down. The earbuds are not uncomfortable and the cord noise from moving around with them is very minimal.<br /><br />I have only had these couple days, but if they keep performing as they have, I can confidently say these headphones exceeded my expectations."
1,These do not stay in my ears as well as I'd like but they are nice and serve their purpose.
1,First time I can wear ear buds that don't fall out!
1,"My concerns (which were limited to an acute issue -- the product had, until then, been wonderful) were dealt with expediently and courteously. I have been extremely pleased with my dealings with SENSO."
1,"Excellent product. The buds fit smoothly and stay put even while running.  The outer ear holders are barely noticeable, very comfortable and do their job perfectly.  BT range is as advertised and no drops or skips.  Controls are adequate and function well. Sound is good, not excellent but good and for BT, that is itself an accomplishment.  Extremely happy with this purchase.  Might just order another one as a spare or for work."
1,"This is my second pair of these. Lost my first pair on a business trip. Love them! Easy to use, great sound and super comfortable."
1,My wife so far loves it. Holding the charge for long time as described.
1,This is my second pair i really like them. My first pair got ran over accidentally by my John Deere. i didn't have them in my ears. Got bummed when that happened. Thanks to Prime had the new pair in two days.
1,"Compare these to bigger brand names, you will be suprised. Great for the gym, they pair immediately with every usage, feel great and sound even better.<br />Raderdave Santa barbara"
1,These are great. Very light weight and easy to use. They stay on when you bend and move around. Good sound quality.
0,Very disappointed. These were delivered quickly and with great accessories but unfortunately they stopped worked in just two weeks. Loved the weight and ear fitting (I often have a hard time finding ones that fit properly) but extremely disappointed in the extremely short lifespan. Wish I hadn't spent the money.
1,"Doesn't sounds as well as some other earphones on the market, but for the money you couldn't ask for more"
0,"Headphones keep connecting and disconnecting on their own. Also, there is way too much interference with these headphones. My phone will be LITERALLY RIGHT NEXT TO ME and the headphones will be cutting in and out. Absolutely horrible connection. I've bought cheaper ones at Wal-Mart that worked better. Save your money and get something else. Only good thing is the battery life."
1,Best part: music is very clear and makes it easy to pick out parts of the bands.  That quality makes the music come to life for me.  Thanks for your great design and quality.
1,Son increíbles!!!!
1,Wife loves them ..
1,"Recently I purchased two pairs of these headphones for me and my wife. They work well enough so that you won't be disappointed. I would suggest listening to your music, using EACH of the interchangeable ear pieces.  This will allow you to find the most comfortable fit and  help you figure out which size produces the best music quality for your taste. For example: the medium size earpiece was more comfortable, but the large earpiece produced better music quality for my listening taste.  The bass was deeper and didn't sound &#34;hollow&#34;. The company will follow up with an email, reminding you of the one-year warranty and will offer any assistance for  any dissatisfaction. For me, I feel comfortable knowing that."
1,Really nice sound from the headphones and they stay on during workout! they sit good in/on the ear to.
1,"Like many others who have gave reviews, I too have tried multiple brands of wireless headphones. I think I finally found a pair that is going to work. The Senso headphones have outstanding sound quality and are very comfortable and very easy to use.  Something I didn't expect was to also receive two free charging cords as well as a dual car adapter and a very nice case to store them in. I have only had them for about a week but  I am very pleased with my purchase and highly recommend the Senso headphones to everyone who is considering getting a pair of wireless earbuds !!"
1,Love them
1,"These were a gift for my college age son and he loves the headphones.  These are our second pair, he was very impressed with the battery life and sound quality of his Senso's.  He is a big time user of the device and requested a second pair after about two years of use on the original ones.  He said that one of the ear piece was not playing anymore.  This is not a defect but rather extensive abuse and use of the product.  The build and battery life is impressive.  We will be customers and recommend this product to our friends.  Keep up the good work"
1,Actually really great ear phones. The battery lasted the full 8 hours as advertised with my music playing all day. Didn't have any issues with connecting to my Android phone and it supports connecting to two devices! Super easy to switch between my phone and laptop.
1,"Sound is good, but they cut out randomly even when my phone is on my person so I know it's not a distance issue."
1,"This is one of the better ones that I had tried ever since my original Moto ones broke. The headphone stays on during work out, and it's comfortable because the ear loop is soft rubber that sometimes you don't even feel that it's there. The sound quality is also on the better side too. So I purchased this second pair for my wife."
1,"Battery lasts a long time./Noise Cancelling is great. I've fallen asleep with them on using private listening w/ my Roku TV to block out my husbands snoring, which works great. I still have more than 50% battery life the next morning. This is my second pair only because I couldn't find my last pair. But now I have two, one for workouts and one for private listening. EarPods without a wire always fall out of my ears so these work great if you ever have that issue. Also, I love the cute carrying was which has enough space for the usb charger. Great buy"
1,"I use these headphones for listening to podcasts, youtube videos and listening to books. I find them very comfortable, having the various bud sizes is a great option. They have a good battery life. You are warned not to over-charge them, and especially not to charge them overnight, so I set an alarm on my phone to remind myself to unplug them. I love not being tethered by ordinary headphones, I used to get wrapped up in the wire and hated that! These meet all my needs and at a much more reasonable price."
0,"I use these with my Iphone 5 while running and cutting grass. They sound great and I like the rubber wheel that keeps the cord from flopping while running. I have 2 issues:<br />1. The bluetooth connection drops out if I have the phone in my pocket. I have tried a waist belt to carry my phone and this works OK unless I turn my head or have my shirt over the belt carrier. I tried the fix the company posted on another reviewer's complaint several times and it still drops out. I have owned bluetooth headphones that did not drop out under the same conditions.<br />2. The down volume controller on the headphone broke, so I have to use the phone to control volume and change songs.<br /><br />I am now looking for a new set of headphones."
1,love them!!
1,"The sound quality for me is better than average but still muddy to a point. My biggest thing is that even though the they state noise cancel, when riding on a motorcycle and over 40 mph, it gets very hard to hear with them full blast."
0,"Few days into ownership, can't hold a conversation on it anymore. Hear every other word."
1,"Love these headphones, but they wouldn't charge. Customer service was all over it, sending me out a new set!"
0,I ordered these headphones because they had lots of good reviews on Amazon. However once I received them I was disappointed with there overall product.<br /><br />What I liked:<br />- they where only 20 bucks<br />- they came with a nice storage case<br /><br />What I disliked:<br />- cheep bulky construction<br />- poor noise canceling (if any)<br />- horrible sound quality<br />- no fine tunning volume adjustment<br /><br />The headphones where bulky and did not fit snuggly in my ear (even with the difference earpieces) they definitely we're not noise canceling.<br /><br />The sound was vary bass-y okay for pop or like Daddy Yanky but you didn't get a nice crisp sound. Also at higher volume it was very distorted.<br /><br />I was unable to make fine adjustment to the volume at lower volume. It was either way too loud or not loud enough.<br /><br />I will be returning them I'd trying something else.
0,"The loose wire gets in the way when working out and is flimsy. The ear buds are uncomfortable. Once I put it on I regretted buying it, it makes you look nerdy."
1,good
1,I love these headphones! They have great sound and I don't have to worry about them falling off my ears or annoying cords getting in the way. I had one small issue (user error) and I contacted customer service and they responded to my email promptly and helped me figure out what I was doing wrong.
1,"I was looking for Bluetooth headphones and came upon these via Amazon. Four thousand reviews catch your eye. The hard part about purchasing any headphone is the impossible task of knowing whether or not they will fit. I've learned that I'm a straight up earbud kinda guy as opposed to the more (forgive me but I don't know the right word to use here) triangular style that came with my Samsung Edge phone. They just don't stay in my ear.<br />I've only had these headphones for a couple days but I can say that the fit is perfect for me, the sound is solid, and they work they way they have been designed. They are very comfortable for me...especially the over-the-ear piece. Don't really know you have them on.<br />Since it's only been a couple days there is still more to learn about the product. Haven't really used it for phone calls other than the initial setup to test functionality. So far so good and as of now I'm very satisfied with this purchase."
0,"Poor Bluetooth connection, poor sound quality, not comfortable when you run. I am not sure which function of headphones it does correctly."
0,The sound cuts out frequently no matter how close the phone is.
1,"Bought these after borrowing my boyfriend's Beats for years. Now, if I ever forget to charge these and I'm forced to borrow his headphones to go for a run, it's THE WORST! The sound quality is so much better on these, and I think the buttons are more intuitive to use. Plus, they fit my ears much more comfortably."
1,They were easy to pair with my android. I used them to watch movies on a 6hr flight. They were comfortable. Sound is great & on/off is intuitive. I like that they tell you when they are paired.
1,It is good to use sports
1,"Losses the signal a bit much for my taste, but does sound fine."
1,These are great for jogging and the battery works very well.
1,I love these headphones!  They are so comfortable and very easy to set up and pair.  Don't hesitate to buy!
1,Excellent quality!! sound great!!
1,"These headphones are great! I use them every single day. Good sound, GREAT bass tones. I listen to a lot of EDM so the bass is an important feature. They pair easily, I've never had a problem with them. The earpieces are good quality. I use the squishy ones and wash them weekly and they are still holding up really well."
0,I have tried to love them but I just can’t.  They cut out and are not comfortable.
1,"For the price I paid, its not bad. But its not entirely to my satisfaction. I have cycled through plenty of headphones over the years. I mostly use them while running and working out. This Senso headphone is clearly a knock-off of the PwrBeats3. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. The good things: The bluetooth pairing is simple and straightforward, charges pretty quickly, does the job for most part when you wear it while running or doing other things. The bad things: (1) too bulky an that curved plastic thing that goes behind the earlobe doesn't always conform to the ear. Its just some cheap plastic. It cannot be molded or fitted to your ear.The buds seem to protrude out of your ear like big pods and make you look like a sci-fi movie character. (2) Its not really sweat resistant. Sweat will go inside and spoil the sound for you. (3) They always (especially the right side one for me) seem to come out of the ear or move out and you have to tuck them in every few minutes. (4) my dual pronged charging cable is essentially useless because the connector that's meant for iPhone or iPod doesn't actually charge the device. I don't know why they bothered with it! The other connector that charges the headphones works fine. (5) no noise cancellation. None of the headphones I ever used were 100% noise cancelling but this one is on the lower end of the spectrum. I can hear pretty much all the noise around me. (6) the sound quality is average. But I wasn't expecting it to be great in the first place. Overall, I think that this headphones is fine for the price they charge. I can't say much about how long it will last. Pretty much all the headphones I have tried over the years stop working after a year, and I have tried both high-end ones costing 200 dollars and cheapens selling for  20 dollars. I am yet to find a headphone that actually &#34;works&#34; for the purpose of running and working out."
1,"Well fitting and comfortable. Unfortunately the first pair would not turn on after about 14 months of use, but I did order a second pair because of the reasonable pricing and good fit and sound."
1,Great sound!
1,Easy to set up and works great.  I use them at the gym. Zero complaints.
1,they're ok for the price. i don't think the volume buttons work any longer. sound ain't great but they're fine for the gym. don't expect great sound from these.
0,"I bought the headphone in June 2017, after the good evaluations of the product, but I was disappointed because it did not prove to be the sweat test, stopped working after a running."
1,"these headphones are working out great thus far, though they are a bit odd looking while on your head, but since they are performing so far so good I think this can be overlooked.  I hope they are waterproof as advertised, something I have not tried them for to this point but will be shortly.  Look for an update on the waterproof side of things, I intend to use them for swimming laps in the pool, at the surface and without diving under the water."
0,"Worked for a couple weeks. Then the bluetooth connection started dropping in an out as i ran, even if my phone was on an armband. Then the thing stopped connecting at all, not to my phone, not to my tablet, not to my buddy's phone."
1,"Even after reading the reviews, I was a bit septical. I love these headphones and the ear buds offer such a nice fit. These feel stable, durable and they sound AMAZING. The noise cancellation works incredibly well too. These are my go to headphones!"
1,These are the best money can buy!!  I've purchased 3 pairs of &#34;Beats&#34; in the past 2 years and they can't come close to these headphones. They provide plenty of bass for true sound and the light weight makes them perfect for working out.  I'm buying 2 more pairs just to have them.  Great product and the extra accessories that came along with the headphones were a nice surprise.  A++++++
1,Purchased for my daughter and she loves them.
1,"My first pair of wireless earphones.  I did not want to break the bank on a new pair, especially since I was purchasing online vs. in a store and would not be able to try on.  Price on Amazon was very attractive, and they are a tremendous value given the comfort and sound quality of these phones.  Simple to operate.  Nice case with accessories.  Most important, the phones stay put in my ears given the angled buds and well designed ear hooks."
1,The Wow product
1,These fit fine and I like the battery life. But their connectivity is an issue. I have pared these with both my iPhone and my Apple watch. Regardless of which device I am using when I go for a run the earbuds cut in and out. Probably going to try a different brand.
1,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G8JO5F2/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0
0,I've been using them for a few months and they keep disconnecting and cutting out. Super irritating. But the battery life is pretty good.
1,"These worked great when I had them for about 3 weeks, however lately they would connect however not play anything"
0,"I bought these headphones 3 months ago and I wear them pretty much everyday at my desk. The battery life was great and sound amazing. I was pretty impressed with the price and easy wearability as well. Three weeks ago the left ear stopped producing sound. I tried to do my own trouble shooting and still no success. Yesterday my right ear stopped working, would not turn on or connect at all. I am extremely disappointed and it is such a waste. After scrolling through more reviews (you have to dig), I noticed that others had experienced the same thing.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!"
1,Great sound and fit! I like the included selection of addictional buds and carryover by case. I mostly wear them during my very sweaty indoor cycling sesssions and they performed great.
1,Nice produce. Prompt delivery.<br />Job well done.
1,"Got these for Christmas and purchased a pair for a family member too.  So far, so good.  I wish the the pieces that secure the headphones around your ear were a bit more able to be molded to my ear with memory wire like my pair of wired headphones.  I also wonder if the flap that secures the bluetooth charging port will tear off at some point but it is too soon to call.  Overall, I'd buy them again."
1,"Works and sounds great!  Keeps a charge for an extended period of time. Great product, especially with a great price."
1,"Good value for cost. I use them as workout headphones for my Peloton bike. However, they are bass heavy and will let sweat for me."
0,EDIT 2: received the replacement headphones and they are exactly the same as the original one with the same issues meaning that I did not receive a faulty product in the first place. The sound is muffled and many are complaining of the same thing here in Amazon.<br />Definitely NOT recommended.<br /><br />EDIT: got a satisfactory customer support and they sent me replacement headphones. I will update this review when I try the new replacement headphones.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br />Sound quality is so bad.<br />I read the manual and they said it might happen when it's not fully charged but in my case there's so much background noise even when fully charged. There is so much difference in sound quality compared to another Bluetooth headphone I use.<br /><br />I'm even thinking that I might have gotten a faulty product even though there are no observable signs of that and it was sold by Invotek but it is possible.<br /><br />I don't know how this got to be a best selling product but this is definitely not one I can recommend.
1,Work great. Love the charger cable
1,Okay but main ear piece keeps slidding off when I workout. Has about a 10ft blue tooth radius then static.
1,The great and the come with different size earbud. I like that a can connect to ether my  phone or tablet for easy listen but not at the same time.  This was a great buy.
1,"After using this thing for awhile I realize that its audio quality was okay. However, another problem became apparent. This headphone begins to spam low power messages every few seconds when it's running out of power. To me, the power might as well be dead because it spams the low power message so much that I cant listen to anything else."
1,works great for the price i paid. it is definitely a steal!!
1,"Love these headphones. Excellent fit, great sound, fantastic price, convenient accessories. Initial concern about background buzz easily fixed by lowering volume on headphones and raising it on source. Thank you."
1,Work really well and arrived in great condition!!
1,Very good product for the price. No complaints.
1,"Great earbuds, work well"
1,The sound is very good however the ear piece and hook is hard to work with. The piece that inserts into the ear seems larger than usual and fallls out. The hook piece is not design to cup the ear correctly.  Over all disappointed by the product.
0,"I bought these headphones on a lightning deal during prime day.  After looking at all the reviews giving it 5 stars, i figured i couldn't go wrong.  Unfortunately,  I was wrong.  Let me start by saying these headphones have pretty decent sound if you are indoors.  they may have been just slightly bass heavy, but that was OK for me as i kind of like my music that way.  The problem with these headphones is the horrible wind noise you get from them when you are outdoors.  It makes the headphones virtually useless as the music is totally drowned out by the wind.  After trying to reposition the earbuds, etc, I came to the conclusion that it is an inherent defect in the headphones themselves.  I have another pair of bluetooth headphones and even on the most windy days they keep that sound out pretty well.  In the end, it was so bad that i did end up returning these headphones for a refund."
1,"I’ve been using this headphone a couple times a week during my commute for about a month.<br /><br />Brought this after my friend recommend this brand.<br /><br />At first the headphone was great.  But now I get connectivity issues.  For an example, I would hear the confirmation that “the headphones are now connected” (if my bluetooth is on when I power on the headphones) but it will not connect to my phone until a minute later or more, or until i go to my phone settings to manually connect.  Sometimes I have to restart the headphones several times.<br /><br />Sometimes the volume buttons don’t work and I would have to change the volume using my phone. Sometimes the buttons do work, but I will have to press super hard.<br /><br />I really don’t have any other headphones to compare to as this is my first pair of Bluetooth headphones. My friend doesn’t have any issues with her headphones but that maybe because she has the older version."
0,"I purchased these to replace lost headphones...found my lost ones and didn't use these till I lost my old ones again. Wish I hadn't waited so long to try these out only to discover that they don't work. They connected to my phone and worked maybe 3 or 4 times tops. They are fully charged, and volume is up... but they do not work."
1,I have purchased several pair of bluetooth headphones over the years and these are the only ones which have survived daily use and lots of sweat contact.
1,Very easy to use. Very comfortable to wear. Connects to my phone as soon as they are powered up. Would definitely recommend to a friend.
1,Comfortable and nice sound. Connectivity comes and goes when phone is in my pocket but it eventually clears up quickly.
1,Have ordered 4 pair now for me and kids.  Great sound quality! Returned the Bose headphones I had bought.  Band that goes around ear is very pliable which allows you to mold it perfectly to your ear.  Very easy to use and great price!  So far so good!
1,It does good for the prize.
1,"I find that I get static sometimes. 1. If it is loud. 2. Not fully charged 3 phone is in pants pocket rather than shirt (too far away) It is excellent for answering the phone. It stays on very well. it is comfortable to wear.<br /><br />I find that I get static sometimes if. 1. too loud 2. too far away (Phone in pants rather than shirt) 3. not fully charged. It is comfortable, great for answering the phone, stays in place."
1,Absolutely love them the sound is perfect love the colors so far they are water resistant Best buy I've ever made on earbuds
1,Great headphones so far. Awesome sound no cutting in and out like the other brands. Hats off to Senso. Will let everyone know how good they are.
1,"We purchased these earphones almost 2 years ago. After ten months of use the button malfunctioned and the earphones were useless, I contacted the manufacturer and they were very helpful. All I had to provide was the order info and a picture to show the damaged earphones. They honored the 1 year warranty and we received a replacement within a few days. The headphones are great for anyone who needs handsfree communication or listening to music, good quality at an affordable price."
1,Works great fits in the ear right sound is loud and clear i would definitely recommend this to anyone
1,"very nice product, great accessories, nice packaging, gift recipient immediately wondered what other products company offers"
0,I loved the fit of these headphones but they only worked for two weeks. They no longer will turn on - the power button sticks. Really disappointed in product.
1,Very good rich bass and sound.. arrived super fast and in great shape. The carry case is awesome... can put everything in side of it. Would buy again
1,Great for listening.  Not so good for talking.
1,These headphones are every bit as good as those that cost 3 or 4 times as much. Excellent product at a reasonable price.
0,"Pros:<br />•inexpensive<br />•good sound quality when connected<br /><br />Cons:<br />•my primary use with these is running, and they pick up a very loud wind sound when running in anything but still air (quite annoying but forgiveable)<br />•Though the over-ear clips certainly help keep them ON the ear, I had a lot of difficulty keeping the buds INSIDE my ear (while running) compared to other Bluetooth ear buds<br />•I'm not sure if the set I received was just on the low end of the manufacturer's specification requirements for connectivity, but unless my phone was on an arm band less than a foot away from the headset, these had much difficulty gaining a continuous connection, especially when located anywhere at waist level.  This is really just unacceptable and the main reason I had to return.  Essentially, loss of primary function from a reasonable distance :("
1,"The sound is great, but the quality is cheap"
1,Great headphones
1,"Works as expected. Did notice much more wind noise, but solid product."
1,Work very well! They slip around a bit on my ears but work well!
0,"This product lasted barely longer than a year!  It no longer pairs and the start up voice is very slow, almost like it’s speaking in slow motion"
1,Outstanding product and outstanding follow-up.  I've already purchased a second set.  I was in the gym the other day and a gentlemen asked me if he could look at my headphones; so I allowed him.  He showed me his which were very similar but he paid $154.  Now he is going to purchase these as another set.<br /><br />Great job!
1,I love these headphones!  The sound is amazing!!!
1,My teenage son says that these work great!  This is a wonderful purchase for the price!
1,Excellent for the $
1,I looooove these headphones! The added cords and accessories were a nice treat as well. I wear these running everyday and I love them!!!
1,"I’ve went through 5 pairs of beats by Dre headphones in the last 3yrs.  I sweat a lot when training & the controls go out within 6-7 months...<br />I decided to give the Senso’s a try.  Very impressed.  Sound quality is as good as any I’ve tried.  Fit well & still comfortable after 2hr run.<br />Not quite as low profile as the beats (very small difference)... but, for the money...  1/7th the price...  I’ll stick with these moving forward."
1,"Best headphones i've ever owned. Sound is amazing, especially the bass for songs in the gym. I've been telling all my friends about this product. Hope they last although I'm probably going to buy a spare pair for the future at that price.<br /><br />Thanks"
1,I have used these for 2 days.. So far I am very happy.. I am not the person that needs perfect sound as I can't hear well anyway.. The volume and bass seem very good.. Hi notes perhaps a little harsh at really high volume.. Though I am using it with my Samsung gear fit 2 and I can't adjust anything but volume with it..<br />They fit me well and I am very happy with it. Especially at the price. I have paid 3 times more for regular headphones that were not as good.
0,The left speaker barely works.  Very disappointed and this pair was a waste of money.
1,"Best I've ever owned! For the price, it can't be beat!...<br /><br />When I opened the packaging I felt like an appreciated customer. Very professional job.<br />Thanks, Bill"
1,"Overall, these headphones have been very good and reliable. I use them everyday during commute to work. They're also great for exercise. While running i have no issues. Even while jumping, it never falls out or a connection problem. Very nice product 😀"
1,Good quality for music listening. Especially while working out. Not good for phone calls / business calls. It picks up too much of surrounding sounds so the person on receiving end cannot hear well.
1,Very nice product for the price. It is amazing that it comes with 3 different ear bud sizes and you can use the most comfortable one based on your ears. Extremely user friendly even you can you ( caveman ) can set up in seconds. Looks and feels good. Not those cheap looking material.
1,Thank you so much for sending me a note. Unfortunately I had to send the headphones back as they did not pay her with my Apple Watch
0,"After a couple of months of using it,  It disconnects on and off, frustrating."
1,Excellent! As good as the $150 headphones
1,Very good for running
1,Beautiful sound; comfortable to run with; flawlessly paired with my phone right out of the box ... and great price.
1,They work!! It was easy to pair with my Iphone and Ipad and I'm ecstatic over the way they fit and I haven't yet even tried to other two sized earbuds that came with them. The carrying case is perfect for a gym bag or an airplane carry on bag.  The one-year  guarantee and the live tech support gives me confidence that I have a quality product at a bargain price.
1,I have had these 6 months and i use them when i go to the gym. Everything was good but now they won't hold a charge. When charged they only last for about an hour. I guess i will be going back to  cable connected head phones. I would not recommend these as clearly the battery does not last.<br /><br />12/07/2018 Update: SENSO replaced the headphones and the second pair have been great. Upgraded my review!
1,I can not write a proper review because my daughter didn't get to use her head phones for an entire day before she lost them. She enjoyed them for a couple of hours until they fell out of her sweatshirt pocket and we never found them. She did not have any complaints for the short timeframe that she did get to use them.
1,"Easy connection, great sound. Beats the pants off of the Apple ear buds. I don't have another bluetooth set to compare them to, and I don't think I will try. These things rock!"
0,Heavy Air Sound outside while Biking or Running or even walking.<br />This this just works in fine closed rooms. NOT A SPORTS HEADSET. just headset for inside rooms.
0,"Very disappointed with these earbuds, but not surprised for the money. Never made it past poor connectivity to devices. Second issue was the design and the unbelievable amount of wind noise created by the them. Just by walking in the wind with this pair of earbuds on made a very loud wind noise in your ears."
1,Love them so far.  These ear phones comes with the extras all in one package and on the front end.
1,Love these. Great for working out. Haven't used them to talk just play music. Great sound at a great price. And they stay put.
1,"These easily outlasted my Beats. I run 3 to 4 times a week, always outside, for over an hour each time, and they're still going strong after 9 months. They are light and don't stay on my ears that tightly, so on windy days, there's a loud whistling like I'm running in a wind tunnel."
1,"Got my son two sets of wireless headphones for Christmas and turns out, these sound better than the Beats which were twice the price."
1,GREAT product...charge lasts & lasts...sound is unbelievable...comfort great too!
1,"Pros: Sound quality awesome for the cost, battery life as good as advertised if not better, controls are intuitive and pairing is easy, price is awesome for what you get, comes with lots of bonus gadgets which I appreciated, fit is comfortable and it comes with enough different sized buds that you should be able to find one that's right for you.<br /><br />Cons: I think this is only a problem for me because I have had it with most headphones, but if you sweat into your ears on longer runs they will slide out a bit and you have to push them back into your ear to get good sound.  With the extra over ear bit though, they never actually fall off and it's a minor incovenience... frankly I had to reach like crazy to come up with anything negative to say at all!"
1,Was skeptical but once received amazed by sound quality and fit highly recommend
1,My family and I have been using senso bluetooth headphones for several years now. These are incredible. The battery lasts at least 8 hours. I use mine as earplugs (because they cancel sounds better than standard ear plugs). I had one issue with mine and the company replaced them for free. We have been very happy with the customer service! Great buy!
1,"*****Update*****<br />I've lived with these for a few weeks now. I can't wait for them to die. I'll still maintain my 3 star rating, but there are two annoying issues. First is the battery. These may last about a week of gym time. That's 2 hours for 4 days a week on average.  Given the size I guess this is okay, but much worse than the 3 to 4 weeks that my last set lasted. There's also very little warning. You get the low battery notice and you may get 5 mins before it dies.<br /><br />Second issue is that when you sweat a lot (justing the word 'gym' makes me sweat) the band sticks to your back which then works the earphone out of your ear. To remedy that I sometimes have the band in front of my neck instead of behind. Still, it's pretty annoying.<br /><br />Bass is still bad. I was hoping that these would break-in, but nope. I listen to hip hop and these just can't handle it. Strictly podcasts in the gym now.<br />***** End Update*****<br /><br />I ordered these along with the others that look almost exactly the same (aka Treblab, Ranpu, Arkey).<br /><br />Sound quality of these were the most acceptable when compared to those other in-ear headphones.  Overall there's too much bass which usually is something I like, but the bass is a bit &#34;muddy&#34; and it effects the mids and highs.  I ended up having to get a global equalizer app on my phone to smooth things out as much as possible.  I primarily listen to podcasts when working out, so the sound is acceptable.  If I listened to a lot of music I'd return these along with all of the ones that I mentioned above.<br /><br />From a comfort standpoint the left side is pretty comfortable.  The right side kept sliding out of my ear a bit.  I'll experiment with the other earbuds, but I think I'm going to see if I can order some memory foam buds.  The Treblab headphones came with some and I really like those.  Other than the occasional re-positioning after completing a workout set the comfort is really good.  They're very light and you barely notice them after awhile.<br /><br />Overall I'm happy with the purchase.  I wish the bass was better and didn't effect the overall sound quality, but for my purposes; which is strictly gym use; these are good.  I'd also like a set of included memory foam inserts, but given everything else that comes with these I can see why they were left out.<br /><br />Oh, the Bluetooth connection is stable and has no issues in my gym, but I'm usually no more than 20' away from my phone.  Again, that works for my needs."
1,What a bargain for pretty decent wireless earbuds. Hold a charge really well and pretty good sound quality.perect for working out
1,"I am still getting used to them in the gym. The ear buds seem a little stiff for me, but maybe they will conform to the ear over time, but overall very good."
1,Bought these for my wife.  She loves them! The sound is really good and they were easy to set up.
1,Good price point and good sound for the value.  I bought two pairs of these bad boys: one for mowing the lawn and the other for less sweaty activities.  They fit on the ear fairly well but do have a tendency to pop out of the ear during more strenuous activity.  But I don't mind since they don't cost that much.  Put on a headband and all is well.
0,"I always have a hard time finding ear buds that will stay in my ear, so I thought i would try these with the hook around the ear. They still don't stay in when I move around a lot. I bought them for running, guess that's not gonna work too well. The sound is ok, seems to have a lot of bass, they don't cancel out noise too well since they won't stay inside my ear. Looking for something different."
0,"This product is of inferior quality. After a month and a half of daily use, the charging port broke off of the circuit board and sank inside the right ear earbud. RUN AWAY!!!<br />DO NOT PURCHASE!!!!<br />ALL OTHER EARBUDS ARE BETTER!!!"
0,Only worked for 60 days.  Battery would not recharge. Warrantied for 30 days.
1,"So far used it for a month. I wear it when I run for ~30 min everyday, on 10-25% volume, hooked up to my iPhone SE that is in one of those armbands. Overall not impressed, but I feel like I got my money's worth.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Clear sound - I'm no audiophile, but I can tell there's an improvement in quality over the cheap bluetooth earbuds I bought in the $10-20 range.<br />Decent battery life - recharge every 2 weeks, so i guess 6-7 hours of battery life on that volume.<br />Easy controls - no buttons have broken yet<br />Stays on your year - haven't had issues with the earpiece falling off<br />Fast chargetime<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Weak signal - The on/off is in the right earpiece, so I guess the bluetooth hardware is there too... If i wear my armband on my left (opposite) arm, the music will often stutter. When I wear the armband on my right arm so it's close to the earpiece, almost no issues. Support told me it's something about resetting the pairing, but I think it's a hardware issue.<br /><br />Poor low battery indicator - The &#34;Low Battery&#34; voice will pop up about 2 minutes before the battery runs out. I went out for a run yesterday, and in the beginning of the run I heard &#34;Low Battery&#34;... and the earbuds powered off 2 minutes later."
1,"I was somewhat skeptical about ordering a $20 pair of headphones, however upon opening the package and listening to them, I'm convinced that they are more than worth the price of admission. The setup was easy and the sound quality matches headphones I have paid 4x as much for. They also stay securely in place, something other similar headphones have not done for me. The packaging was very nice and the carrying case was more than I expected for the price."
1,"These headphones will not hold a charge after a handful of weeks. First 2 weeks, they would hold a charge for about 5 -6 hours of use. Thereafter, the charge quickly dropped to about 2.5 hours. Only 6 weeks after purchase, they will not hold a charge.<br />• However, I have been pleasantly surprised by the response from SENSO. Upon seeing my problem, they immediately reached out with troubleshooting assistance and finally a replacement.  I find it rare and refreshing that SENSO not only states that they are committed to ensuring customer satisfaction but that THEY ACTUALLY FOLLOW THROUGH ON THEIR PROMISE OF SATISFACTION."
1,The ear phones are great. I like how they fit and that they hurt mt ears like the iPhone does.
1,Look these are worth it. None of the other nonsense works for this price. You want a cheap pair of bluetooth headphones for casual use. Boom
1,Best headphones by far for the money.
1,"I bought these headphones because they got really good reviews on other websites and I wanted a pair of wireless headphones. I own a pair of the higher priced headphones and these are very comparable in sound. I wear these at the gym and I am truly lost in my music, there's no outside sound interference. I really can't complain about the charge on the headset, it lasts a couple of gym visits and my phone calls are clear. The set also comes with a a few chargers and different size ear buds. I really can't say what a great deal I feel I stumbled upon - it is WELL worth the price. They also email you to make sure you're satisfied - and I like that follow up. AND, this is NOT a paid for review - I like them that much. Lol"
1,Just received it today. Surprisingly comfortable for me. No problem paring with my phone and the sound is decent. Stays in my ear when I exercise. Will see if the battery will last. Overall it is a good purchase at this price range based on my current experience.
0,"Bluetooth connection is not good when I put my phone in my pocket<br />Update :<br />4 months of use , showered in it did the 1st time, now the right earbud is very low on volume."
1,The wrap-around part of the earphone feels very good. Good quality sound for a good price. Very helpful customer support as well.
1,"Unlike the copycat Chinese product, much easier to use and last longer"
1,I purchased these for the gym and they work great. The battery life usually lasts two workouts before I need to recharge and Sound is decent. My only complaint is the prices that go over your ear are not adjustable so they don’t fit as snugly as I would like.
1,Love the product! Great bass and long lasting battery. I had an issue with the charging port and tried factory resetting it but it still wouldn't charge so I contacted the manufacture and they replaced the headphones. Great service and fast shipping!
1,Product shipped rapidly was well packaged. For the price the sound quality battery life and ease of use were spot on. Will be ordering another set.
0,"After about 1 year if frequent use, the battery was low and they won't recharge when plugged in, so they are unusable now. Very disappointing and would not recommend to purchase."
1,"I'm very happy with the product. It's light,easy to pair and use. I have tried many other earbuds, but they frustrated me because they don't either fit or come lose. I'm thinking of ordering one for my husband once I wear them for a while."
1,great music airbuds..replacement headphone is also very good..
1,"Reading through these reviews its amazing how the same technology works differently for different people,the first set of hear buds I bought never worked right out of the box and they were around 60 bucks so I was reluctant to try again but figured I would go with the cheaper ones,they work fine but in order to not have any skips or drop outs I practically have to have the device strapped to my forhead,if I hold it directly in front of me its fine but if I put it in my pocket the skips and drop outs start,so it seems to me this technology has a ways to go yet.....the distance issue is sketchy as well and I find the issue goes away if I'm indoors,as if the signal is diluted somehow outside with no walls bounderies....overall good."
0,The sound quality was awful. There was a significant squelch where I was previously used to clear sound.
1,"I like them. Their  light, loud, comfortable, and a good price. The fact that their waterproof is great to. Shower with them all the time and still work."
1,Love them so far. They comfortable and the sound quality is great. Easy to connect. It comes with a short and long charging cable which is very convenient. Would recommend.
0,"I had another pair of Sensos for about 5 years until they recently stopped taking a charge.  They were never GREAT, but they were cheap and adequate for listening to music or podcasts while working around the house. The old pair also had flexible adjustable ear hooks that I could bend and mold to fit more comfortable over my ears.<br />So, I came back to this product page (which helpfully informed me I had bought the same product 5 years previously) and ordered a new pair to replace the dead ones. The product I received was NOT the same as the one I was replacing.<br />The earpieces are fixed, no longer bendable.  The sound is incredibly tinny and a bit crackly.  The earpieces feel considerably lighter and generally cheaper.<br />I sent them back a few days after receiving them, so I can't speak to their battery life or charging time. At least the return process was painless (brought them to Khol's) and I was refunded the same day I dropped them off."
1,Very comfortable<br />Great sound
1,"I have not had many hours using them but overall they are not bad as to quality of the product, the fit is below average, the weight tends to allow them to come out of my ears if moving. The testing is on going."
1,"Bought these to use while running, lifting, and doing HIIT.<br /><br />Pros: Light weight, buttons are very crisp/solid, decent sounding audio, lots of accessories (duel port car charger: 1 and 2 amp slots, 2 charging cables: one 3 foot cable, one 11 inch cable<br /><br />Cons: They do not stay very secure while running and moving around (I wore sunglasses and had to put the arm of the glasses over the ear hook to keep them steady while running), the audio did cut out intermittently like my phone was several rooms away even though I was wearing it in an arm band only 6 inches away, the wire tie does not stay on very well so there if you try to adjust it while wearing the headphones there is a good chance you will just end up pulling it off."
1,Fantastic product!!!
1,"Ordered two sets and liked so well, ordered an additional set. Great value!"
1,These headphones are insanely good for the price. Just connect it with Bluetooth and they fit snugly around my ears while I exercise or if I just want to use them for hands free. This is a must buy for this price and quality!
1,The bass is not good in these things... I will make it work.
0,All I wanted to do was listen to music in the bath.  I submerge the earbuds in about 2 inches of water and they're broken. Are you kidding me?
1,Have used the headphones for a week and a half and love them. Sound is great and they are light weight and stay in my ears very well. The only concern I have is the last 2 times I used them my music skipped. Was wondering why that is happening?
0,I enjoyed the quality of sound HOWEVER these stopped working which means they lasted just over 3 months. I would not suggest anyone should buy them.
1,"Sound quality is amazing, but they really don't stay in your ear. I workout with these and they constantly move. The rubbery part the should hold them In place is too soft and allows them to move too much. Too bad because the sound quality is really good."
1,good quality headphone
0,"This is our 2nd pair. The first pair (which was amazing) was stolen so we got another. This pair is definitely not as good. After a month, they will randomly turn on and start playing music, even in another room sitting on a shelf with absolutely nobody and nothing around. And of course, it's outside the return period."
1,Fit loosely around ears and poor sound quality
1,"They work great. My problem is that they do not stay on my ears, the ear hooks are soft and I cannot make them stay on. (My ears bend easily)They come with a case and charger and I am disappointed that they did not work for me"
0,Not much I like about them they fall off my ears all day at work I do landscaping can easily hear equipment n barely hear music they die quicker than 8 hours don’t recommend
1,I use it when I workout
1,Happy with my purchase
1,Ok so my job allows us  to listen to music on the weekends but I also have to use my hands so I've been looking for and reading reviews on wireless headsets with good sound quality but the issue is my ears are pretty small so I knew going into it the thought of just wasting my money just to fall out of my ear when I looked at this one and read the  reviews all the reviews on here was great  so I decides to trust and try  it . when I received them I was extremely happy the earpiece itself is flexable so even with my small ears I can move it around to adjust to my needs.  I am also happy with ordering through Amazon because when it was delivered it was raining so I was afraid when I got home that it would have been destroyed but Amazon itself put it in a nice plastic bag to keep it safe. This particular purchase came with a nice case charging cable to charge it and I also like the additional information that I gave that you can't use a cheap charger otherwise it'll somehow destroy the earbuds so that's a nice little tidbit of information that was useful to me. This particular purchase also came with a card holder that I can put on the back of my phone and also a phone holder a magnetic one that I could hook to my car which is pretty nice I got rid of my big bulky one  and just clicked it on to my vent and put the little magnet on back of my phone and Bam there you go. back to the earphones  itself. it was really nice to be able to work hands-free take a phone call listen to my music and  call with just a single touch even though I still have to learn the buttons on where they are as I hung up on the person I was talking to a couple times but other than that I was extremely happy with this purchase and I will purchase again. The customer service has been great letting me know that there is a warranty and that if I need anything to let them know through single email and they'll be in contact within 24 hours I hope to never have to use them but it's nice to know that they're there if I need them.
1,Excellent product.  Highly recommended since the reviews are excellent. I decided to purchase an extended warranty which was very reasonable.  For the price is great!!
1,"I had a pair of beats headphones for two years before they stopped working. I couldn't bring myself to pay so much for another pair. I found these headphones and they are awesome. They are loud, don't fall out while working out, and isolate noise at the gym. I told everyone about them."
1,"great sound, easy to use and great price, bought them for my wife, probably will get another set for myself."
1,Love it
1,Paired easily.  Sound is very good and are very comfortable to wear.
1,"Excellent headphones. I use them frequently while running and the sound quality doesn’t degrade once I start to sweat. There is some mild movement  around my ears depending on my movements but otherwise very stable. I lost the little cable stay provided almost as soon as I got it out of the box, however I don’t feel that it’s takes away from the quality of these headphones given the price."
1,Great sound
1,"Culpe con las espectativas, no tuve que gastar $100USD para unos buenos audifonos"
1,"Update: They made it almost a year. I got them in January of 2017 and now one side has all but totally died. I am a bit sad. These have been the best set of ear buds that I have had, corded or BT.<br /><br />The sound quality is pretty good, not great, but well worth $30. The battery life is just about as good as advertised at about 6 to 7 hours. I use these for working out and doing cardio and they stay in my ears and have never been even remotely uncomfortable. Also, they do a very good job of blocking outside sounds. I like these earbuds a lot. They are my go to even though I have several other pairs."
1,"these are the best so far...strong durable, fit well, good sound, no static"
1,"Great wireless earbuds, especially for the price! My only wish was if the ear hooks were slightly firmer, but hey, that's my ears. I appreciate them for music and what not, but they're not totally the best for phone, as you either need to keep them dangling from your neck at all times or in your ear at all times in order to answer a call quickly."
0,They are uncomfortable and don't fit. I contacted the customers service to ask questions and was referred to Amazon even though this is your product.
1,I have only used these one time but they worked very well. Great sound and they stayed in my ears which is usually a problem for me.
1,"To start of , ITS AMAZING, nice sound, perfect to the ear , nice clear sounds, love this product might even need to get another pair"
1,Love it!!  Easy to Use and ready to rock!!
1,I purchased these headphones for my 80 year old mother.....she uses them everyday for her swim class.....they are easy to use.
1,the sounds quality is average but he volume levels are great and the music doesn't bleed out.<br /><br />The ear prices stay in place for the most part but the rubber pieces around the ear to help them stay in are not adjustable and feel loose all the time.  I haven't had them fall out though which was my issue with previous ear buds.<br /><br />Overall I have happy with the product for the price. Not even close to being as good as Bose or beats version but for a fraction of the cost you can't go wrong.<br /><br />Comes with a lightning charger as well.  Doesn't work very well.
1,THIS SENSO BLUEBOOTH HEADPHONE IS AMAZING!!!!!  THE SOUND IS CRISP AND CLEAR.  THE DISTANCE IT ALLOWS ME FROM MY SOURCE IS WONDERFUL!  I ESPECIALLY LIKE THE VOICE NOTIFICATON WHEN I TURN IT ON OR OFF!  THE ADDED BONUS OF ACCESSORIES IS A CUTE LAGNIAPPE!
1,Use them right now = I love that I can have them attach to two different device at the same time.  I have them hooked up to both my iPhone and my iPad.
1,"Connected the ear buds and got back to work without no problems or distractions!<br /><br />When moving around outside my office area (beyond 10') and listening to music the audio does cut out a bit but not too disruptive for my causal listening.  Inside my office the audio doesn't cut out at all.  I won't generally be more than 10' from my audio source so this isn't a deal breaker for me.  The audio quality certainly isn't amazing, but it isn't bad either.  I didn't notice any noise cancellation - felt and sounded more like wearing ear plugs than active noise cancellation. For context, when wearing the both ear buds and playing music at low volume I could barely hear noises around me.  As far as comfort goes, I'm glad there are multiple sizes of ear tips but wearing the stock (medium?) tips for 2 hours straight didn't render any discomfort at all.<br /><br />UPDATE: I've found the audio does in fact cut out... a lot.  But only when the audio source is inside something like a backpack, pocket, or purse.  When sitting on top of a desk, there are no audio issues so these have been great for connecting to my computer, not so much for biking or walking.<br /><br />What would I change?  It would be great to have adjustable ear hooks and reverse the volume up/down controls (I keep turning the volume down when I want to turn it up)."
1,I was looking for some cheap ear buds for work just incase I lose them it wouldn't be a big deal and these are just as good as my Beats.
1,"This is a Christmas present for my son who will be arriving in mid-Jan. I’ll ask how he like them, then. Had good reviews, reasonable price."
1,"These are good headphones, but if you plan on riding a bike with these, don’t buy them. Their profile makes the wind noise extremely loud and you pretty much cant hear anything from them unless you turn them up more than you should when riding. They are probably fine for any other exercise or use, but not for riding a bike."
1,"Didn't quite make it a year before they died. When they were working, they were pretty decent sound quality and fit for the price. Not sure if I'll replace them with another pair or go for a big name brand this time around."
1,Love my new headphones and all the bonus accessories! Definitely recommend this to all my friends
1,Excellent thank you very much
1,"I bought a pair for my son at college to replace his PowerBeats which got squished/broken in his gym bag.  He needed something to replace them, and I was looking for decent quality at a MUCH lower price- since the expensive originals didn't seem built to take much abuse.  He's had these for a couple of weeks now and reports that they are 'bad ass'.  Can't get much higher praise than that from a 20 year old."
0,I would not get these. I have bought 2 pair already and they stop working within 3 months. I use them for working out. Not worth it and not durable.
0,No longer working.  Was mostly satisfied with them for the couple months they worked.
1,Got a great price. Good quality
1,This is my first purchase of a wireless headset. I charged the battery and tested them out for about 15 minutes and so far so good. I look forward to using them in the gym.
1,Best Bluetooth earbuds I have ever had!!! Works without causing pain to ear and definitely sounds excellent!!
1,Great investment. Work perfectly.
1,"A++ Quality, I love it!"
0,The power button was pushed all the way in when I got it Tuesday so I couldn't pair it or turn it on my feeling was really hurt I was looking forward to these head phone's
1,Good but has noise when the wind blows when riding a bike or running
1,Love love those headphones great for someone who wants beats but hated the price of them. These are a great alternative
1,"My wife loves these! Has a really good wireless range and sounds great, and they are super comfortable. And apparently have great sound as my wife can literally hear nothing around her when she has them on!"
1,Works better than my Targus wireless headphones.
1,"Received today and no problems pairing with my watch and phone. Great deal as it comes with a case, extra earbud covers, car charger, and iPhone compatible cord. Sound quality is good enough for me and wears comfortably on the ears. I will update after a few runs."
1,"Tech support is amazing!!  Packaging was amazing.  It came with 2 USB cords!!?!?  nuts.  Came with 3 sizes of ear buds and a car charger!?  This company rocks.  not to mention great sound!!<br /><br />Only one drawback, I wish the necklace was hardened and shorter.  But that is nothign."
0,Great headphones sounds amazing. Only bad thing is that they don't hold a charge anymore
0,"It has to be charged :(  one more item I need to charge and cords,<br /> also the clip on dash board mounted glue did not hold to the back of the phone it falls off, doesn't work"
1,"Good sound quality, long battery life and they stay in my ear. Works well for me so far."
1,"I give it 4 star. To start the headphone battery lasted as advertised. Fit snug inside my ears and stay during workout. Right out of the box the bass is way high drowning the highs of the speaker. I use this on my Xperia and was able to control with equalizer. I gave it 4 star because the high are no where to be heard, ALL bass, very low highs."
1,"I never leave reviews on products, but I will gladly make an exception for these. I realized I had these for almost 2 years now and just lost my pair recently. Super sad. I did not realize how much I loved them until they were gone! As a college student, $200 target headphones are not an option. When I unfortunately couldn't find mine, I got on here and purchased another. I may have paid the extra just to have them delivered the next day. My right hand, my go to. These are GREAT quality for an awesome price. I use them to work out every day. I noticed some upgrades on my new pair, easier opening to charging port (yay), faster charge, AND even seem better quality. Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
1,yes 5 stars. I did have one issue and contacted Senso support. Support was awesome and sent me a new pair.
0,"They work, but right out of the box the left earbud has a buzzing sound that is persistent. The sound also sounds very flat.<br /><br />The packaging is nice and comes with a great case and a few accessories, but unfortunately the buzzing is too annoying to use and the fact it started right out of the box makes me wonder how long until these just stop working. :/"
1,"Work great and comfortable, but can't run with them as the wind noise from the microphone makes it impossible to hear your music.  And I don't even run very fast."
1,This ear buds are amazing I also have the $150 pair of headphones and they don't come close to the sound quality this put out.
1,The only reason that this didn't get 5 stars is because the ear loops don't fit me (and the package didn't come with any adjustable sizes) BUT the earbuds themselves actually fit pretty snug in my ears and they have managed to stay put without the loops. The sound cancelling quality is more than enough for my day to day and working out as well.
1,"My headphone lasted about 1 yr and 2 months. It stopped working past week.<br /><br />While it was working, the sound was great, durable for workouts, and no problem with bluetooth connection.<br /><br />If you want something that lasts over time, invest few extra bucks and purchase other one."
1,Great headphones. Very lightweight.  They stay put throughout workouts. Sound is very clear.
0,On my SECOND paid. Stopped working again. Both didn't last more than a few months.
1,"Holy Cowbells BatMan. When I first turned them on I barely had any bass. Contacted customer support and they suggested plugging the headset into the charger and pressing the power button for 7 seconds. Also deleting the unit from my BT list in the phone. Then unplugging the unit, pairing with my phone and boom. The headset works perfectly. I get massive bass."
1,Working as expected. Hope they last. I work outside  a lot.
0,"These broke within two months. Earpiece cracked. They had good sound, but appear to be pretty cheaply made. Very disappointing. I had high hopes for these. They sounded beats than my Beats!"
1,fast delivery.  Great for workouts. . .stays in place!!
1,Great product and excellent customer service!
1,Work surprisingly well for how low-priced they are. I'll never go back to traditional wired earbuds. Fantastic for running and working out.
1,"I've had about 15 different brands of theses over the ear BT headphones and these were, until recently, the best...not just for the value but sound quality better than all others except Beats & Bose.<br />Comfort:  Handles sprints, jumping and long distance without falling out like most others.<br />Range:  1/2 the length of basketball court before getting choppy<br />Skipping:  Never skips when in range<br />Connection:  Not very good.  Often need to power off/on a few cycles to connect.<br />Button location: Most BTs cram the buttons making it hard to find the right button.  This has the power on side and volume on top; very nice.<br />Calls:  Good/Average<br />Charge:  Similar to most...good"
0,"When I run while wearing these, I can still hear the air whooshing in around them. Definitely not a good seal."
1,Great headphones! They stick to your ears pretty well and it is nice that they have the 3 different sizes to adjust to your ears!<br /><br />My only concern with these is once the battery low it will not stop telling you that the battery is low which is quite annoying but otherwise a great product!
1,"Fantastic headphones. Comfortable. They get an okay because although they're waterproof, they're worthless for swimming. The minute you put either the transmitting device, or the headphones under water it breaks the connection. In fact I have problems sometimes maintaining connection when I first start up on the elliptical with my Apple Watch 2, it will be intermittent until it figures out yep, that's what I'm supposed to do, transmit the music, then it's fine. Now could it be the 6500 other bluetooth signals in the gym confusing it? Sure, but that's not my fault, and nothing I can do about that. It also has problems with sound gain (pick up) on phone calls. No one seems to be able to hear me if I try and use these to make a phone call. So I use them and don't worry about copious amounts of sweat, or sitting in the hot tub with them on, but I do have to take my watch off and lay it on the deck, because if I put the watch under the water it breaks the connection.<br /><br />*UPDATE***<br />Since writing this article I have been contacted by the seller and while it was determined the headphones were defective, they definitely are not intended for swimming. So I elected to have a refund in lieu of a new set sent out. Thanks to the retailer who's great customer service, I've changed my rating from 3 to 4 stars. 3 for product, 5 for retailer. Averaged. -C"
1,Love this product...easy to connect...great sound.
1,They are a Christmas gift for my grandson.
1,works well. Sounds ok. Doesnt fall off. The only downside is it doesnt filter outside noise that well. But good buy for its price...
1,"They arrived the next day.  That have great sounds and great base.  I have small ears, but they fit in nicely. They charge quickly."
1,My son loves these headphones.
1,Great for the price. No complaints
1,These headphones work great and are easy to wear at the gym. The sound quality is good and they work when I run and get sweaty. Great product and great price!
1,Finally got around to getting hands free in the car. Looks good. Volume on microphone sounds a little muffled.
1,They work great they fit comfortably good value I don't think I will ever spend over $50 on any other Bluetooth headphones just not worth it
1,"Bought these after my POS Beats By Dre earbuds died randomly. These are soooo much better all around, from the sound to the noise cancellation. While jogging all I heard was the pure sound of my favorite bands! As well, I have jacked up ears so regular earbuds wont work, they have to be the over the ear kind, and the softness of the wrap didnt make my ears overly sweaty or irritated! Awesome product, awesome price, I plan on outfitting the other workout-a-holics in my family for Christmas this year!"
0,1.  Cover fell off left earbud and was consequently lost.<br />2.  Amazon sent a replacement unit.<br />3.  Same left earbud cover fell off the replacement; cover lost<br />4.  Using earbud with electrical tape covering area that should have a cover.
0,They didn't last long. Not good quality.
1,Love these headphones—and the price.
0,The first pair died after first charge. The second after 3 charges but it is too late to return them.
1,Absolutely worth the money. Great for working out. 2nd pair Ive bought only because I lost the first pair. I would definitely recommend.
1,Even the smallest tips are too big for my ear.
0,"Worthless product. Delivered July 7th, 2018, stopped working not even 3 months later on October 4th, 2018. Very disappointed."
1,Impressive Quality sound!! Very impressed with the overall design. The SENSO is a good choice for those that doesn't want to pay a lot of money for the big brands...
1,"Sound, connectivity, fast shipping, and FIT are great!"
0,Wouldn't stay in my ears.  Didn't test sound quality or anything else.  My spouse didn't like the feel of it either.  Too bulky.
1,"Excellent value. I'm very happy with the headphones, and was quite surprised by the number of accessories that came with them."
1,Wonderful product! Gave three of these for Christmas. My daughter says hers are great. Wonderful Seller with excellent communication.
1,Great sound and perfect for workouts as well as hands free while driving
1,All around great love them better than my Beats 2 except that the ear hooks are too flimsy and dont hold as good
0,"I had no complaints initially. They stayed in my ears, I ran with them, and I liked the little case. After 1.5 months I had two times where they only lasted about 2 hours before needing a charge. Then the next time they just never charged while being plugged in."
1,I bought this product for my 14 year old grandson . He LOVES THEM .  Great sound !!  100% SATISFIED !!
1,"These headphones really helped with my workout. They don't fall out of my ears, they're comfortable, easy to use, and I'm not bothered by outside noise."
1,"Nice buds. I have been looking for buds that will not be affected by sweat, when am cutting grass, or working out. The bass is beautiful and the ease of connecting are nice also. i recommend these buds to anyone that wants something good, but doesn't cost you a arm, or leg."
1,"Bought these about 2 weeks ago to replace the powerBeats 2 ear buds since they would no longer hold a charge. The price for these was very good. So I though I would try them even though there was some concern on reviews as to the floppy ear holder. I run 10 to 20 miles a on a treadmill. I watch TV to pass the time. I needed ear phones that would be loud enough to hear over the noise of the treadmill. I would give these head phones 5 Starts for their volume. I love the controls. I have only charged them once and after 6 hours of running they are still loud and clear.  They are much clearer and louder then the PowerBeats 2 that I replaced. Again I would give them a 5 for clarity. Unfortunately, the ear wrap is so weak that these will not stay in my ear. The PowerBeats ear warp is much stouter then the SENSO, however, neither of these are ideal for my ears. I guess I have different ears ten anyone else on the planet. Ear buds do not stay in my ears. Once I started sweating, the Senso drop out of my ears in maybe 10 steps. So disappointing that the ear wrap does not have the ability to be shaped/bent to fit my ear. To correct this issue I had to tape a thin wire made from a cheap dry cleaner hanger to the Senso. With the wire, the ear wrap is now moldable/bendable and fits my ear so the buds are more stable in my ear. Wish that the folks at SENSO were athletes  and knew that the ear wrap is just too flimsy if you are doing any activity"
1,"Only used it a couple of times nut so far so good, great sound, confortable to use and easy to connect, very satisfied of buy and service"
0,useless after  a couple of months
0,The speaker fell out while the headphones were on my ear :/
1,"Received them two days ago, and used them for the first time yesterday.  Clear beautiful sound, easy to use instructions, comfortable in the ear.  They were shipped already charged up fully, so they were ready to use immediately.  Love the one year warranty, I'll be using them on a daily basis."
1,"Delivered quickly, nice carrying case with several accessories.  I am pleased the quality of the product and the volume is out of this world.  Most wireless headphones are attenuated to protect your eardrums but these will play loud which I like.  As they say if its too loud then you're too old. LOL Not really, listen responsibly to protect yourself but it is nice having the extra volume boost if you're working out in a noisy gym etc."
1,"Absolutely thrilled with it. I didn't expect such great sound quality, I really thought it would just another pair of bluetooth earphones but I must say I'm really thrilled with the audio quality."
1,"These fit very comfortably over my ear and have a decent Bluetooth range on them. I hate having to carry my phone on me while I’m at the gym as I tend to get very distracted. For the price, the sound quality is better than expected honestly. I have a couple pairs of over ear Sony bass boosters that sound superb, but they are too bulky to work out in (and also cost well over $150 and I would hate to break them)- input these bad boys. Haven’t tried phone calls yet so no comment on that. They also included a magnet to attach my phone to the dash (kinda random, but nice) and a 3M wallet pocket to attach to the back of your phone case (again, very random, but it feels to be decent quality). I have a pop socket on the back of my phone so I can’t comment on the performance of either of those things.<br />Very happy with the price:performance. Give them a shot."
1,"Perfect so far. Great sound quality, quite comfortable, and all around a great pair of ear buds.Also, at this price range, are you kidding me!"
1,"Great sound, plenty of bass, and incredible durability.  This is my second pair, bought as a gift.  They pair in a flash, no skipping, and take a beating.  My first pair is still working as well as day one, and used everyday for over six months.  I have asked way too much from them, running in pouring rain, but they have not failed.  Best money I have ever spent.  Awesome product."
1,love these
0,"This is a failed product, it works for 6 months at best, bought 2 of them and they quit almost at the same time"
1,"1. The beep to tell you the volume is at max is way to loud.<br />2. The cable is flat, this makes it easier to get stuck your neck, so when turning your head be prepared for one to come off.<br /><br />Edit - lasted 11 months of Daily use until the left speaker started cutting out. dropped 1 more stars<br /><br />Back to 4 stars - Customer support and as the headphones were in warranty they sent a new pair within 3 days. Fantastic stuff !!"
1,Headphones are good quality for a cheap price.
1,These have amazing sound and are very easy to use. They paired with my phone right away and the controls are easy to access. I like the packaging and the carrying case. You can really crank up the volume if need be. For the price they are a solid purchase. The over the ear hook is a very soft rubber and not a more rigid plastic if that is what you are looking for.  I have been using quite a bit and the battery is still at 95% so that is also great!
1,"Great product and a good price. I recently decided to get wireless headphones and returned the first pair I got from a different company in this price range. The first pair I had were so tinny I couldn't even enjoy podcasts. I returned them and went with these. The Senso Activebuds are great. Music sounds good, bass and treble are balanced. Very happy. I was also impressed with a follow up e-mail I received from Senso inquiring about my satisfaction. They seemed willing to listen to and resolve any complaints. I have none."
1,"Very impressed.  Fast shipping, the ear buds work great and are super comfortable."
1,I bought two pairs for my sons. Both love them!  They wear them to the gym every day.  The only improvement would be a firmer grip around the ears.  I'm currently purchasing a pair for myself.<br /><br />Update: It’s only been a few months and one pair is not working. The price has gone up considerably so disappointed.
1,Great product!! Very happy amazing sound
0,Son incomodos y cuando se corre se escucha el sonido del impacto del aire
1,These are great.  My only concern was that the first charge only lasted a few hours but not sure if they were fully charged.  Having wireless earbuds make things so much easier and the sound is great.
1,They work perfectly with my computer and my phone
0,"As a person with smaller ears, I found these headphones to be too bulky. The volume setting seemed to skip its lowest setting, which made it unbearably loud in certain environments, so I ended up replacing with the lighter Phaiser BHS-730 Bluetooth Headphones."
0,I bought these on March 2nd and they worked great until about two days again when they stopped turning on.  If they would have still worked this review would have been 5 stars. disappointed.
1,"For the price and performance, these aren't too bad. I bought them mainly for their water resistant quality. I use them only for exercising, and I sweat a lot. I always rinse them lightly after using them.I bought these April 2017, and they've started to have problems this April 2018. The sound in the right ear is really low compared to the left ear. I work out about 4-5 times a week, mainly in a gym. I think the failure is in the rubber battery flap which is really flimsy.<br /><br />I always set headphones at a hearing level that allows me to hear what's going on around me to maintain awareness of my surroundings, but also to ensure I'm not blasting my eardrums out. Sometimes when I run in windy conditions, the wind can get caught in them, so they're not air tight.<br /><br />I'm not crazy about the fit, but I've yet to find headphones that fit perfectly and comfortably while I exercise. If you have hair that can tuck behind your ears, these will not stay on well because your hair will keep the loop that hangs over the ear from staying on well. You'll either have to pin your hair back or not tuck it behind the ear. Also, I sometimes have to move the wire a little from one side or the other on my shoulders when I'm sweaty because it sticks to my skin and starts pulling on the ear buds.<br /><br />The over-ear loop helps keep the buds in, but once you get sweaty from working out, they do have a tendency to start slipping. I find that by about 15-20 minutes of intense running and working up a sweat, I have to start pushing the buds back in and tucking the over-ear loops in again.<br /><br />Bluetooth pairing is super easy and works perfectly every time. The buttons function perfectly every time.<br /><br />When looking at much more expensive bluetooth headphones, they seem to have equal complaints and problems so I figure why pay that much more for something that will probably last only about as long as these?"
1,These are amazing headphones.
1,My son loves these! Work great!
1,Great sound quality and excellent customer service made the purchase of these headphones a good investment.
1,The Senso bluetooth head phones have an excellent quality sound and deep bass sound.  Sound clear. Im so glad with the purchase.
1,Comfortable headphones
1,"So far so good. The box comes with all the accessories you'll ever need. Unlike other bluetooth earphones where they just sell you the earphones and nothing else. Here you won't have to spend extra for an extension cord, or an extra earbud because everything is already provided for. It seems like they have already thought of everything you'd ever need. And it even comes with warranty. Why else would you spend a hundred or so dollars for a more expensive earphone when you can get a cheaper earphone that comes complete with everything you'd ever need.<br /><br />You can already feel the great build quality just by touching it. And the instructions on how to use it are so simple and clear. Sound is also great. I thought at first that they might have compromised with the sound to make it price-competitive. But I've tried various earphones in my time and this one stands out in terms of sound quality. You really can't ask for anything more. No wonder it's amazon's best selling earphone."
0,"the headphones have reception problems. I wear my phone on my belt and stream music to the headphones, it is making my music choppy. I know it is the headphones fault b/c when I power down the headphones and continue listening to the very same station from my cellphone speaker, it streams perfectly. Senso does not list a phone # only an opportunity to e-mail, don't have the patience to deal with it...chances are I will get less than stellar customer care if I do follow-up. Very disappointed."
1,"This headphone has very good sound quality, just doesn't fit my ear well. It's probably because I have small ear."
0,Terrible sound! Music sounds muffled and absolutely no bass. Could buy these cheap headphones at any low end retailer for $1-$5 so don’t waste $30 on these. Returning
0,I re-ordered these because I loved the first ones. The newest ones have been updated to be bendable ear pieces and don’t hold to my ears very well because the shape doesn’t hold.
1,These  are perfect:)  LOVE THEM.
1,Great product.  Love the sound.  Comfortable.
1,I brought this product for family and friends. Nice packaging and quality for the price!
1,This is my 3rd set in a year. 1st still works fine 2nd got crushed by 200lb tool box and 3rd is great. I recommend these to anyone looking for Bluetooth headphones. The battery will last for a 11 out of a 12 hour shift for me. I will always buy these.
1,I’m very happy with my earbuds.
1,"Had Senso bluetooth earphones that I'd bought a few years ago and had been very happy with them, but lately they were cutting out and I didn't understand why, until I noticed I'd been basically mistreating them, not careful and tugging on the wire. Decided to purchase these, an updated version. The difference in updated quality was immediately noticeable. They pair up immediately, on/off and pause controls seem much better, and the earpiece that goes around the ear is easily moldable to the ear. Love these."
1,I like them I would only say I’ve owned three sets and they only last around 6 months
1,Decent. It bulky
0,42 minutes into the first workout with these on and the right side already does not work properly. Right audio cuts in and out or the volume is nearly mute. Needs to be returned asap.
1,"Great quality for the price. It's bluetooth so I don't expect it to sound as good as 3.5mm headphones, but these are fantastic for working out at the gym. Comfortable, and I'm the type of person who hates in-ear buds."
1,Fit's nice and sound quality is good.
1,"These headphones are great. I use these for mountain biking and running all the time. I bought two pairs.  One as a gift and one for me. The battery stopped charging on me,  it happens, their customer service immediately replaced them....with ease.  I would recommend this company and headphones"
1,These headphones are amazing! The first time I used them I mowed the lawn and realized at one point I couldn't hear the lawnmower. Definitely noise cancelling! They fit in my ears great and stay in place. The sound quality is amazing and more than I expected for the small amount of money I paid! I highly recommend these ear buds to anyone!
1,this was a great buy!! They work well and are easy to use. Affordable and perfect for any type of exercise.
0,"Constantly skips, can't make it through a full song without multiple skips, put it in right side of pocket it improves but its ridiculous. For supposed $120+ headphones this is crazy."
1,Very happy with purchase  they have quality sound
1,"I'm so happy I went with these headphones! For the price, you get so much - different size earbuds (including memory foam!), a long and short charging cable, car charger, and carrying case. The sound itself is really good, and I listen to different kinds of music ranging from pop, edm, and rock. The Bluetooth connection hasn't given me any issues like randomly dropping or sounding fuzzy, with either music or calls. Overall I'm really happy with these, especially given the price. I'm definitely recommending them to all my friends."
0,I forgot to write a review.  I really would not recommend this.  It did not work from day one.  Wrote to the company and the response was a direction to reset it.  It still did not work.  I tossed it in the garbage and bought a different brand.  Waste of money
1,Have used the headphones a couple days and so far they are awesome!!
0,"The audio stutters very often even when my phone is very close to me, unobstructed by any material. Also I feel like some magnets would really help for when you just have it around your neck. Could have been designed better, what a disappointment."
1,"The headphones were easy to connect to my phone and laptop via bluetooth. Quality is good, and I'm still waiting to see how long a charge lasts. So far, so good. Thanks for being a responsible manufacturer/retailer."
0,I'm very disappointed in these headphones they were working great and the best headphones I have ever had until one day they stopped charging.
1,"Great design,good sound, good noise canceling . One of the foam earpieces was damaged upon opening so I called up and immediately got someone on the phone who immediately  took my information and said they will send out a new pair of earpieces. Great headphones and obviously great customer service!! I think it was a good purchase. Will update if need be"
1,The sound quality is great. They don't feel secure and stick out a bit further them I'd like.
1,Awesome sound and blocks out outside noise.  Love theses!
1,Tried these out on a 13 mile bike ride today and they worked great.  Connected with no problems and has a good solid sound with good range.
1,I purchased these headphones due to other user's reviews. They are working great and charge fast. I can't complain! I recommend fitting them tight into your ear prior to working out so they don't fall out due to sweat.
1,Great product. Super robust and great sound quality. Was happy with all the accessories they gave along with the headphones.
1,The best headphones!!!
1,"Sounds better than some wired ear buds costing twice as much.  Very comfortable,  but I can imagine them being difficult to fit for those with small ears. Comes with an amazing amount of accessories for the price.<br /><br />The charging cable is difficult it insert and I feel like I am going to break the headphones every time."
1,Work great  sound great
1,awesome easy to set up and sound great
1,I received these and really liked how they were packaged. They looked nice as well. Unfortunately they were too big for my ears and I returned them. I didn't turn them on so I can review sound quality or the Bluetooth pairing.  I would like to note that the refund was prompt and easy. I also received a link to customer service to make sure I was satisfied. They have great customer service so that's why I gave the product 4 stars. It should also be noted I have small ears and I would think they would fit most people.
1,I bought these to exercise in and do yard work.  They stay in place and work great and very easy to use
1,"These seem to be always on sale way below their MSRP. For that, they are very nice. However, I would not pay full price for these headphones.<br />They come in a nice case with a lot of different ear options. Personally, I stick with the memory-foam-like material because they are quite comfortable.<br />Wind interference is not much of an issue. Walking on a windy beach or walking, in general, is fine with little to no wind resistance. Driving with the windows down is a little bit more annoying, but nothing horrible.<br />Sometimes the headphones will turn on if bumped enough in their carrying case.<br />They will last a full day if charged over night. Unless youre listening to bass-heavy music all the time, as these headphones have a very nice low-end."
1,"In terms of value for the price, this product is great.  However, these are the first bluetooth buds I've purchased and have quickly discovered that, when jogging, I have to have my phone on my right side and preferably within two feet or so of the right bud (which houses the bluetooth receiver), or else the sound cuts in and out a lot.  My new understanding is that this issue is common to all bluetooth buds.  This is only when I'm jogging.  Other than this one point, the sound is great (deep, robust sound).  My daughter also has a pair for use at the gym, and she loves them."
0,"after about  10 usage power button falls and to power it on, you need to open the whole mechanism and press the little dot manually, then close it again. :)"
0,Didn't work for me. Bought another brand and love them.
0,I’ve had a hard time keeping the buds in my ears. I’ve tried a couple different size earbuds and it still seems to come out.
1,"These are amazing. Have great sound, the ear buds are comfortable to wear and stay in place while working out. I love them"
1,"Great headphones for the price. Battery life is great and storage is easy. really bassy, but turn it down a little or EQ it"
1,"Love these! Was looking for a nice bluetooth headphone to pair with my iPhone 7 Plus along with something I can wear while at the gym. This work great! They come in a case along with a car charger and cord for both the headphones and an iPhone. Also, I have been using the headphones since Friday (today is Tuesday) and they still have lots of charge to them. I highly recommend!"
1,Great fit. Easy to use. Packaging appeals and product much more valuable than other brands which I have tested and send back.<br />I use them during sports
1,I enjoy it a lot
1,Excellent Earphone with a great sound and many remote control functions
0,It's not water proof I can't charge it anymore
1,"Had them for a week, great battery life and amazing sound. Set up to new source in seconds, still haven't read first instruction."
0,These were comfortable in the ears but I could not get them to charge. I finally figured out that the prongs inside the ear piece were bent back. I had to return and never got to use them. Seemed kinda cheep and big let down.
0,If you're looking for headphones that fall out every other foot strike these are for you! Earpiece fits loosely like a wet strand of spaghetti and ear bud is too large for ear canal and different sizes were not included.
1,Perfect 🤗
1,"Great headphones!  Battery lasts forever, noise cancelling, sound great, sweatproof, with a 1-year warranty.  That came into play for me because after 3 months of use I couldn't get them to turn on so I sent an email to the Senso customer support.  Brand new headphones are on the way!"
0,"Not great , kept my iPod touch in my shirt pocket and it would occasionally skip listening to music ."
1,"Well let me start with they have a nice packaging of their product. Comes with everything you could possible need. Build quality is pretty good. I did not think the ear arms were going to do much good, since they are made of soft flexible rubber. But to my surprise they held very well. They paired very easy with my phone.  Now the down fall of these headphones. They have no mid's or high end. All they have is bloated bass. I guess if you are in to bass heavy music you may not mind. But they just do not sound good. I guess I am not surprised for the $35 I paid for them. I have some other pairs of lower end headphone/ earbuds and they sound way better."
1,Got these for my husband and he loves them. They can go 2-3 days without being charged even listening through them for 8+hrs a day
0,"I bought these earbuds 4 months ago and they were great, until I lost them. I bought a replacement pair last week, thinking it would be the same quality, but the sound quality was horrible. Beware of this product if it has historically good reviews, they may have lowered the quality of the sound to save money. I was getting distortion at mid level volume, and any song with decent base sounded horrible."
1,These earbuds are fantastic. I will be ordering another pair. Ordered a second pair. These are fantastic.
1,These are amazing sound better than any name brand headphones that are 150 dollars and up. They are loud these sound better than beats soundsport and all the bose headphones there amazing!
1,These are one of the best earbuds I purchased. Tried Bose and JBL's and these by fair were much better at a great price
1,Good quality with reasonable pricing
1,"I was having a problem, but i got support just in minutes from Senso, and problem solved, 100% recommended!"
1,"Just received these  A few days ago and I am so thrilled with them.  They are comfortable to wear, sound great and have a good connectivity. Very easy to set up and use and I love all the gear that came with. Especially the carrying case. Very happy with this purchase"
0,they are ok but seem to lose connection often.  ok updating these things suck. cut in and out its like the speaker at the drive through
1,Worked almost instantaneously without even reading a word! Just pushed al the buttons once and it paired - and music emanated!
1,"Great, light weight and easy to use"
1,"I had issue with my earbuds; however, I contacted with Senso help support and they solved my problem very quickly and smoothly without any problems. They have very fast and effective help support. I recommend this brand for sure."
1,"very good considering the price, i definitely am not an audiophile, but these are better than I thought theyd be and better than many earbuds ive bought in similar or more expensive price ranges."
1,"These are favorite headphones hands down. The quality is excellent and very clear and will let you hear all songs the way they are meant to sound. They cancel noise extremely well so I usually have to leave one slightly out of my ear while at work so it's certainly does it's job there. I also use it all day at work and then the gym and battery still has juice. You can shake your head without these things coming off which is a huge plus for me. They also have a suorising amount of useful functions. The mic is great quality and nobody ever has a hard time hearing me and it reads the contact name and number of the person calling you. The last and final surprise is how much the package comes with. Love these headphones and already bought another as a gift and all my friends are getting them now.<br /><br />TLDR. AMAZING sound, mic, and stay on your ears. Great for gym and anything else."
1,"These headphones are a fantastic value and from what I have found the best battery life on Bluetooth wireless headphones for under $40, you cannot beat these no pun intended when you pair the price, quality, and customer service. I have use these headphones now for about 9 months, and they were used heavily. And itafter all that time and the thousands of hours of podcasts one of the ears actually died on me but with this company their customer service was so prompt and all they did was make sure I actually ordered the headset and sent me a new one no problem.<br /><br />Long story short, you are not going to find better headphones for the price, quality, and awesome battery life I can confirm it is upwards of eight hours and the sound quality is superb especially for the value. Do not waste your money on crazy high-end Bluetooth headphones When these headphones do more justice."
1,"I listen to these all day at work. When I’m at home and now the lawn, they don’t fall out of my ears."
1,"Work good in the gym, but outside doing things like mowing the lawn or riding the motorcycle they like to constantly break up or disconnect. In the gym my phone is in my bag, outdoor activities it's on my person. The mic works decently, I do have to talk loudly at times. Overall they work for what I use them for."
1,"I am very pleased with the headset,  delivery was quick and right out of the box everything worked great.  Great price and great product!"
1,"THEY HAVE GREAT SOUND, COMFORTABLE TO WEAR AND I LOVE THE FACT THAT THEY ARE RECHARGEABLE.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM."
1,&#34; Very happy with my purchase. Sound quality is amazing. Perfect for running! &#34;
0,"I purchased this product due to my other workout wireless phones going out. I went forward with this purchase because it had extras like card wallet and a magnetic phone mount. Although I do like the extras, I have no use for them.<br /><br />One thing I do not like about this headphone is that it wraps my right ear but not my left... so as I'm jump roping or running, the left one tends to fall off. The left and right hook are not curved the same. I am thinking of dipping the right hook into hot water or use a heat gun to warp it but haven't done it yet. The old earphones I had was designed the same way but it does not fall off like this one does. I might need to either reconsider next future purchases that have this hook issue."
0,Broke after 7 months. Plastic snapped off. Mist be poorly made.
1,"Bought two of these for wife and I to take jogging. So far they work great, impressive case with different ear bud sizes, cord wrap.<br /><br />Charger cords are legit but they come with a double USB car charger instead of home. Not an issue for us as we have lots"
1,"Wow....Comes with charger from cars!I  feel good !The headphones appeared as described...I enjoyed the video one lady posted,So I learned everything about my new headphones even before receiving them...works great!The sound is awesomely good !"
1,"I've had other in ear wireless headphones before and most of them keep falling off, this one has silicon ear buds and stays in place. Very comfortable and the sound quality is quite good. This is supposed to be water resistant (haven't had that experience yet) and that's a plus."
1,"The Senso version seems as if it comes from the same basic design as others you can find but the sound quality has less bass (or more highs) depending on your perspective. The extra ""goodies"" are an added touch over the competition. The lady with the English accent tells me when it turns on and off and the battery level is low."
1,"I was skeptical that these headphones would deliver, but goodness! The comfort and sound quality is exceptional for the price.  Best purchase that I've made in a while. Step aside DreBeats!"
1,"The headphones are very comfortable and the sound quality is really good. The battery life is not that great but it can easily survive an hour of train ride to and from work which is all I need, I like the buttons on the headphones. You can change the volume, skip tracks, and play/pause the music using these buttons which is very convenient. The microphone is pretty decent. I don't really use the microphone to talk to people but whenever i did use it, I didn't receive any complaints from the other end. My voice was clear and they had no problems hearing me. But I have only used the microphone twice so I can't say how it will behave in crowded and loud places.<br />The only negative is that it sometimes turns on on its own when it is in my pocket, which drains the battery. It will warn you more than once when the battery is low, which could get annoying if you are trying to enjoy the last few minutes of music.<br />I looked at a lot of other headphones before buying these and I'm glad I went with these. They are really good headphones, specially for this price, My friends bought similar headphones for about $100 and the sound quality isn't that different when compared to those $100 headphones. I highly recommend these headphones for someone looking to buy headphones in $30-$50 range. They are even better than some more expensive headphones."
1,"amazing product, shipping and wonderful seller"
1,Headphones are easy to carry and provide great sound quality. Overall very satisfied for the amount of money I paid!
1,"These headphones generally work, but they have a few issues.  They don't fit very well in my ears.  They stay in OKAY, but I find myself pushing them back in every 5 or 10 minutes, which gets old after a while.  I think they just don't have a long enough ear piece, so if you have big ears, or long ear canals, they can't get fully lodged/positioned in the ear, even with the largest size ear tips, because the large circular backdrop of the earbud prevents them from getting far enough into the ear.  In addition, due to their bulkiness, when I run outside there is a really bad wind noise that drowns out the music, even when it's not that windy out."
1,"Very comfortable.  Paired with my Kindle 4th generation tablet with no issues whatsoever.  Comes in a small, handy case.  Ear holders flexible, offering enough stability without feeling binding in anyway.  I've just started with them, so I can't comment on durability - but so far, an excellent item and value."
1,I am very satisfied with the Senso headphones. Great sound.
1,Excellent ear buds!  A pleasure to use.
0,Great sound quality but for some reason the headphones won't take a charge. Unable to charge :(
1,"Look, these aren't winning any awards for sound quality or durability.  But that's not why I bought them.  I bought them as a cheap headphones to wear while working out.  If I ruin them, I don't care.  But they sound fine and fit ok."
1,"There are amazing for the price.  Buying earbuds online is a trick and the best info are the reviews and knowing if you like  the bass, voice or melody  parts of music.  These are mid range headphones very good for audio books less good for the bottom thud of say movie music.  Great how they fit, adjust and stay in your ear.  If you have bought a few paris in your life here is a key.  The cord is a perfect length and durable.  A great buy."
0,First pair I bought lasted 3 years.  This pair- just over a month.  Won't charge.
1,"These headphones are extremely comfortable, easy to pair, and charge quickly. Excellent packaging, and good instructions. I bought them primarily to watch movies while not disturbing the household. I would rate the sound quality as very good. These are a great value and really much better than I interpreted the description."
1,"Great quality, good price and really comfy!"
1,I looked at reviews before purchasing these earbuds...they were ranked the best of the lower priced ones. I absolutely LOVE them!!  I would recommend these to anyone who doesn't want to spend an arm and a leg but still wants good sound!!  They are comfortable and easy to use!!!  I will tell everyone I know that they are AWESOME!!!!!
1,"Decent quality. Good battery life and great value. Had some quality issues when headphones were connected to two other Bluetooth devices at the same time, but I just turned Bluetooth off in on of the devices and the problem stopped."
1,"Very nice product, ear pice finish could be better quality."
0,"These headphones deserve a far higher rating than their 'Stars' would indicate. I bought them on Prime day, thinking that they would be a great low cost option for yard work, mountain biking, etc. When I used them the first time, the bass was insanely disproportionate. I like bass, and this was too much. I had to turn the EQ in my phone way down to make it tolerable. That was just the start though, as soon as I used them, I knew that they were going back. The sound cuts out any time they were further than a foot or two from my phone. Having my hand over my phone or bending over to work in my garden actually made them completely unpair from the phone. This is by no means acceptable for an 'active' device. Needless to say, they went back."
0,I used to love these ~ this is my 2nd pair that just quit working. They will not turn on. 30 bucks isnt that cheap tl have this happen TWICE!  I'm super annoyed!
1,"Works great , No problems on using it<br />Thank you so much"
1,As far as quality I was a bit disappointed. It's not the worst sound but far from the best. Bass is over exaggerated so the treble is suffering. Anyone who has posted crystal clear sound is lying. But I guess for the money what do you expect. I'll stick to my jabra
0,"I bought these Senso earbuds based on the reviews on Amazon and for the price.  The old saying &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; is true.  The earbuds themselves and the packaging are pretty darn nice - especially for the price.  On initial connection with my Fitbit watch, they sounded great!  Great volume, fit in my ears well - I thought I had made a great buy.  I used them for one treadmill workout in the gym.  For most of it, they worked great, then with about 15 minutes left in my workout, they began to cut in an out.<br /><br />I took them home, and fully charged them.  Then a day later I used them for an outdoor run.  Just awful.  Completely cut out, disconnected from my watch to the point that I had to take them off and run without music.  At first, I thought it might be the Bluetooth in my watch, so I connected them to my iPod Nano.  I have used the Nano with other Bluetooth headphones and it's range is amazing.  But the Nano had the same issues with the Senso headphones - connected, then immediately started cutting in and out.<br /><br />So now what I am left with is really nice packaging and a nice case and ear buds that look and fit well, but do not work.  Junk.  Don't buy them - despite the positive reviews.  I suspect the manufacturer is using review &#34;bots&#34; or trolls or something, because these earbuds are just  garbage."
1,"The sound Quality is great and the battery life is impressive, only down side is the mic does not work well, I have to take off the right earpiece and hang it on my shirt near my mouth other wise the person on the other line cannot hear me"
1,Love these head phones they work good and have excellent sound quality.
1,"20 star, after bought more than 5 expenses Bluetooth, this one is excellent."
1,"These headphones have great sound quality! My friend recommended these to me because she also loves them!! The company also has great customer service! I'm going to bring these with me on vacation abroad, and they quickly answered my question!"
1,"I am very hard on headphones and I have have 3 pair of &#34;Beats&#34; similar to these. I can honestly say that the sound quality of these are just as good, if not better than any of my Beats. There really isn't much of a comparison on the bass. These Senso's are much better there!  Also, they come with a set of noice canceling ear bud covers, which is awesome! I have only been using these headphones for about 2 weeks. So, only time will tell about the wear. I can honestly say, save your money and buy these instead of &#34;Beats&#34;"
0,Great sound...rich bass. I've had them for a year and really liked them but this morning the on/off button froze. Could not turn them on. I have to find another pair of earbuds to work out in...
0,Malfunctions after 3 months. bluetooth connection is weak. sound cuts out a lot if you just move. Clearly not just a Bluetooth problem.  Waste of money.
1,"Headphones work great! I had beats previously and had trouble with them, no trouble at all with these so far!"
1,Works great
1,"This is good for the price, nothing better than that"
1,love them
1,Got these 2 days sooner than expected and I've been using them everyday and I have to tell you they are by far the best I've ever had!!!  Awesome sound and  very comfortable.
1,I use these headphones when I go work out at the gym and I can say that they work very well for this. They are comfortable despite my big head and ears. The battery life is as advertised at about 8 hours and I have never reached the point of low battery as I charge them after about 6-7 hours of use. The sound quality is great and a good buy if you are looking for budget Bluetooth Head Phones .
1,"Easy to set up, comfortable and sound good. Haven't tried them with a phone call yet. Just received them, so still in the learning stage."
1,"Extremely nice Bluetooth earbuds. 8 hour playtime (music), lots of unexpected extras-car charger, long and short usb charging cables. In addition to the traditional multiple size ear inserts, you get a set of ear inserts which are not traditional, they conform lot putty in your ear and are very comfortable. The best base I've ever heard in a wireless Bluetooth set up ever. The set comes nicely packaged and include a carrying case. Waterproof and high quality, I love them."
1,"Excellent performance and product, very well made and follow up email nice touch.  Fully satisfied"
1,"For this price, this product packs amazing features. So comfortable for the gym, for running or just normal use. If you're looking to buy bluetooth earphones, look no further get this one. The sound quality is amazing and I don't ever go full volume. 10/10!<br /><br />Note : I was not contacted or prompted to write this review. This is my honest opinion after use."
1,"Amazing sound quality, amazing sound canceling, and comfortable. Huh? Sorry I couldn't hear you."
0,"I was very pleased with the product, worked well and very good sound. But now, after 2 months of purchase, it simply stoped to charge. There's nothing I do that makes its battery charge again."
1,"Head phones are great, good volume and battery life. Was super excited about the dual cable (android and iPhone cable in one cord) that came with it, which unfortunately does not work, super disappointed."
1,Very pleased with this purchase. Very high quality and great price
1,These SENSO bluetooth head phones provide excellent sound.They are easy to use and I use them to listen to music streaming through my android phone. You have to be close to your device but not right on top of it but my phone is usually in my pocket.However in my small apartment I can really put the phone anywhere and the headphone pick up perfectly. The battery lasts quite a while and recharges quickly via a small usb cable. Very good product.
1,These headphones are great! Really great value.
0,would not stay in my ears while working out
1,I have small ears and they fit perfectly inside the ear  and the silicone ear piece that fits over the ear is very comfortable. Also noise  cancelling is amazing. I use them at gym and on treadmill. Would buy again.
1,"I love it, thanx great product"
1,Great item great seller
1,I liked them so well that I ordered 2 more pairs. They even synced up to my laptop.
1,I love my senso Bluetooth headphones! They have been perfect for my daily running! The company is so awesome in their customer service. My headphones stopped charging and they offered to send me a new pair
1,"These are great!!!!! Battery life is good, and most importantly, comfort is good. I wear them at work to ignore all my coworkers and have used them running as well. No slipping and EASY control. Mute button, song replay or skip function, and volume controls. Also comes with an awesome case, 2 charging cables, and 3 different ear bud sizes. Packaging was beautiful and 24/7 custom support is even better, though I dont see having any issues with them. Fast charging too."
1,Really easy to pair up to my MP3 player.
1,"Rarely write reviews, I've looked for wireless headphones for years, gotten many and returned many.  I can't recommend these highly enough, the quality, fit, clarity when making calls is like nothing I've ever tried.  Simply Awesome!"
1,Great sound at an even better price. They are more comfortable than my previous wireless headphones. Cant wait to try them out when I go for a run.
1,"Like the design, and sound quality. I own three other bluetooth head-phones--$20$50 range. This one so far is the best one"
1,"great headphones, last long time although i only use it 30min each time"
1,"So far I like them. Very lightweighted and convenient. The only flaw for me is slight misplacement of earbuds when I am turning my head to sides. However, for such a price these headset is perfect for jogging or cycling workouts.<br />P.S.: didn't try to use them for calling as I don't believe they can provide any good quality of conversation. I had a bunch of other devices like this, so it is a common flaw among the competitors."
1,"One thousand times better than wireless beats by Dre, love these headphones"
1,Love love love this headphones! I originally wanted completely wireless but after buying a pair that's battery wouldn't last more than 2 uses I ordered my second pair of headphones and scored these bad boys. Battery lasts for at least 7-10 days. Super easy to use. Easy to connect and turn on and off. When u have the ear buds in it tells you that it is powering on or off so you don't accidentally leave them on.  They come with a hard case which makes them easy to keep up with as well and multiple cords for charging. I move and jump around alot while working out and they don't fall out. Wish it would have been my first choice so I wouldn't have wasted $25 in the beginning. Amazon's top pick is always right.  ✔
1,Great headphones. I have a bunch of blue tooth sets but these are the loudest. Awesome especially for the price!
1,"very pleased with the sound quality; I read many reviews on this product, glad I made this purchase!!"
1,"The part that wraps around your ear is too flimsy, needs to be more firm. Besides that it is a very good headphone, connects to bluetooth very easily, battery life is good and range is decent, cut out a little bit when behind walls, but for the price a decent set of headphones."
1,"Let's just say these earbuds are great if you want two sub-woofers directly in your ear. For rock and alternative music, they sound tinny and very bassy. I've never had to use the equalizer on my phone, but I had to turn the 60 Hz frequency all the way down around -8 dB to get a normal amount of bass and increase other frequencies.<br /><br />With that out of the way, the headphones powered up and paired with my phone in just a few seconds. Fit is comfortable and the wire isn't intrusive. I wish there was a way to tighten the wrap around my ears, but they'll keep them on my head in the case that they fell out of my ear. They have a good weight and design.<br /><br />The extras weren't necessary, but look high quality. I don't have a micro-USB or Lightning compatible device (I have USB-C), but the cable looks very nice and allows you to switch between the two (micro-USB and Lightning). Haven't used the car charger but it looks nice; I already have a good one but I'm sure a friend will snatch these up. The case for the headphones are good quality with a nice faux carbon fiber look - great if you want to take them in a bag or backpack.<br /><br />All in all, these headphones are great if you want to take your music with you, but don't expect great sound.<br /><br />Update: The sound is actually decent if you heavily modify it with an equalizer, though not many people know to do this. Not sure if all apps and phones have one, but if you have Android and Google Play Music, you're good to go. Not entirely sure if I believe any of the reviews on this product - be aware."
1,This device is perhaps the best BT head phone I've ever used. Setup and operation is very straightforward. Sound is very good too.
1,I bought it for my daughter and she is loving everything about it.
1,Best earbuds I've owned.  Great quality sound and they actually stay in my ear (took them out for a 5 mile spin and no issues).  I run a lot and am hard on headphones so I'll see how long they last.  Great little carrying case and the accessories included make this a solid purchase.  Thinking about ordering another pair just to keep in the office.
1,My husband loves these. We gave them to him for father's day. They seem to hold a charge longer than his previous pair.
1,"Very good product for my running exercises. So far, no problems. Love it!!"
0,"Failed.  Won't turn on, even following reset.  Blue light on when charging.  Switch cover appears to have separated from sweat/water exposure.  Blue light emitting around switch and cover edges."
1,"I can't complain. I use these headphones for bicycling. They sound great and once I changed the earpieces to the smaller ones, they felt great. A really good product."
1,"So far, so good. I have enormous ear holes, so the biggest ear tips almost seal, but that's true of all of these. The sound is good and as loud as I need it to be. I would recommend these. If there are any problems, All report back."
1,These headsets are very light and ready for fitness or lying around and listening.  The sound quality was put to the test with video files on YouTube!  Amazing... and you get a  Lightning cable for the purchase.... Genius
1,"Excellent first impression.  Over many years, since the Walkman I run with music on a daily basis.  That means many hours a year... over the years I have used many brands and types of earphones... I keep searching for one that lasts at least a year... I have high hopes for this one.  I just got them today  and everything looks and sounds good.  We will see how it evolves as the miles unfold.<br /><br />First month and everything working perfectly, great battery duration and the best part is that you get a verbal notification that the battery is running low as oppose to other brands that just simply die on the middle of a run. So far so good but we still have 11 months to go...<br /><br />Review update... after having a 5 star I will have to dowgrade it to 1... today 8.5.17 I am not able to turn on the headphones, there is no red light when plugged to the electrical outlet in simple words:  dead headphones.  Almost 5 months of enjoying an excellent product, too bad is not made to last even 6 months...<br /><br />I was feeling pretty frustated and decided to contact Amazon Customer Service to have my headphones replaced since there is a 1 year warranty.  I understand that a production line is not able to produce 100% quality products,  and I will hope that my first headphones simply went on the wrong side of the statics. Amazon CS  were not able to replace them in the first place due to their third pary replacement policy. Amazon CS  suggested me to contact SENSO directly and they unfortunatelly gave me  the wrong information. I went direclty to the SENSO website and filed the claim.  Amazon came back to me and offered me a solution, they issued a refund and suggested me to buy the headphones back so they could ship it ASAP and assume the shipping expenses.  I proceeded and meanwhile SENSO also answered my claim, they noticed the refund and  my new purchase of the new set, they appologize for the inconvenience and issued a 10% discount on the replacement purchase.<br /><br />Overall I want to make clear that as a customer I fill backed up by both companies, there is no more you can ask for.  Rate is up to 5 stars again!<br /><br />I am now a happy camper, running again with the SENSO headphones, which by the way have improved with a new earbud design!  Will hear from me as time advances."
1,"These are great earbuds, I have only used them for a couple of week, or I would give them a five. We shall see. I plan on getting a set for my son."
1,"GREAT and AFFORDABLE  for working out<br /><br />Good in sound, needs more base. Also the ear bud could be more comfortable but maybe it's my ears so I dont know about that.<br /><br />Overall great product for the price"
1,"Great product, A ++!!!"
1,"My first bluetooth pair, so I am not the best to review this item. It works for me in the gym."
1,Love this headphones to gym in. Ear buds don't stay in my ear no matter what size covers I use. The hook over the ear is great and the sound is awesome. And way cheaper than higher end headphones.
1,Sound quality
1,"Decent quality sound, but left earpiece had a high pitched ringing sound that was incredibly annoying, especially if listening at low volumes or to videos with pauses in audio. Didn't have any problems connecting to my phone or Gear S3. Stopped working after a year, however, but not terribly surprised. Worth for the price, but I won't be buying another pair due to the ringing sound."
1,awesome
0,Finally got a chance to open it. Worked with my phone but when I tried it in the water it stopped working. Waisted of money. Useless.
1,"These are decent, good price and work well until my dogs got a hold of them and tore them up. Would buy again though."
1,I love these. So comfortable.  Sound is great.
1,"These are by far the best headphones I have ever purchased. I never invested in any of my headphones until I got these and I am very pleased. They have already outlasted my previous ones. I use them for running and lifting and I never have to adjust them throughout my workouts. They have a decent battery life - I charge them every 3 - 4 workouts, which usually last about 1:40 minutes. I ALWAYS have my music blasting. They also conceal outside noise and sometimes I'll even wear them to focus a bit more and detach from everything when at school. The little back piece that loops around your ear is rubber and flexible. It is attached to the ear piece and fits nicely around my ear lobe. I never had an issue after getting sweat on them. They are pretty nice and worth the investment!"
1,"Excellent product. These wireless earbuds are simply amazing. I bought 2 sets. One for watching tv via bluetooth and one for my bluetooth enabled mp3 player. Easy to use, light and holds a solid charge for over 8 + hours of use. I recommend these to anyone and might be buying a few more as gifts for friends. Good quality, high marks for ease of use and charge length."
1,"Love these headphones! I’ve had them for a little over a year now and they still work great. Easy to pair, although a few times it takes a few seconds to connect when you turn them on. Battery life is great and charging seems pretty fast. Great deal for these wireless headphones."
1,"I shop Amazon basically all of the time, but I don't believe I've ever taken the time to write a review before.  I will take the time now, because I spent hours reading wireless headphone reviews, looking for user opinions and judgments, before I finally just caved and bought the most popular pair.<br /><br />So, what did I think of these headphones?  I love them.  First things first - I'm not an audiophile.  If you are, you probably won't be all that impressed.  But then again, if you are buying 40$ wireless headphones for the music quality, you might want to re-assess your goals.<br /><br />That said, the sound quality is excellent for the price.  I run about 30 miles a week, including a 15-mile Saturday run.  There were a lot of comments about the noise from the wind, and while it IS noticeable, it doesn't overpower the sound or anything.  These are not truly noise-cancelling headphones, which was alright for me, as someone who runs alongside highways and roads.  What matters is that, while I can hear just enough to know when traffic is coming, the music is always loud and clear.<br /><br />The earpieces took a couple of experiments to get right, but once I got the right setup, both ears stay perfectly in place for hours of sweaty running.  The sound is almost TOO loud at first, but is easily adjustable through the earpiece while running.  The cord occasionally sticks to my sweaty neck, but it's a minor annoyance at worse.<br /><br />And now the two best parts of these headphones, in my opinion.  First is battery life - as someone who runs for multiple hours, this is VERY important to me.  I was able to get about 8 hours of use out of the first charge.  I haven't attempted running it down that far since.  I charge them once a week for an hour, and they are never extinguished.  Second is pairing.  These pair automatically, and hold the pair as I move throughout my house, often 30 feet and 3 walls away.  The two conditions I was most concerned with in looking for wireless headphones was battery time, and pairing/signal strength.  I was wary of bold claims in both of these areas, but these headphones absolutely deliver up to promised functionality, and beyond.<br /><br />Final prognosis - if you can't spend 40$ on these headphones, you need to get out of the wireless headphone market.  The cost-to-value ratio on these bad boys is amazing, and I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a budget-friendly solution.<br /><br />I have never been paid or otherwise compensated for any kind of review on any site.  I am not a guy who typically reviews items after purchasing them.  There are only two Jeremy Hurtt's alive, and I'm the Arkansas one.  This review is 100% my own views, created 100% out of my genuine motivation to recommend these headphones."
0,Don't understand the misleading high ratings. The sound cuts in and out while walking and the ear hooks are mushy soft and rubbery -- not secure.  Sent them back for a refund the next day after receipt.
1,"I really like these things.  The fit is very good, and the sound is great.  Bluetooth pairing was a piece of cake, and they pair instantly every time I turn them on.  I think that the battery life is longer than what the specs indicate.  I had bought BEATS for my son, and these look nearly identical, sound about the same, for a third the price!"
1,Omg I just got this headphones deliver and they are sick the sound is amazing the bass is awesome I strongly recommend this product for the price of $37 bucks the sound quality is ridiculous is like Beats for a fraction of the price  yeahhhhhhhh boyyyyyyyyyyy
0,"Disposable Bluetooth headset. Nicely packaged, yet the battery soldered in this headset is trash."
1,I've had these headphones for 6 months. I could not love them more. The sound is clear and they're small & light enough that they do not bother my ears. The microphone is clear enough that I am able to hold conversations without problems. They're ideal if you value sound quality but don't want to spend a lot.
1,"They are amazing!! Sound is great the mic is very clear, so overall it’s s great accessory for any phone user on the go. When running they are lite and stay in place."
1,"Fantastic headphones, as someone who exercises regularly I hated constantly having to either choose sound and a cord or distorted sound and bluetooth. This delivers the best of both worlds with amazing base, greats highs and mids, solid control functionality, and great design to hold in place. My only complaint comes with the answering of phone calls, as the sounds is always quieter than the music."
1,Excellent
1,Very comfortable and great sound! Stocking up for holidays!
0,I paid 30 dollars for this item hoping it would have a longer battery life and maybe even a better sound then my previous ones I bought for 20.<br /><br />Pros<br />-Battery life is as stated<br />-They stay in your ear<br />-very good at blocking sound<br /><br />Cons<br />- MUFFLED muffled muffled sound<br />Seriously this is why they are so horrible they are muffled<br />My 20$ earphones had better sound than these<br />- they are unattractive bully and stick out of your head
1,""" Excellent set of wireless headphones that sit comfortably and snuggly in and around my ears Nice sound.Unfortunately, they stopped working after 2 months (wouldn’t charge). Still giving the company and the headphones 5 stars as I got sent a new pair within 2 days of contacting them! Anyone can have a defective product-it’s how you handle it that matters-and this company has excellent customer service!""<br /> , adjustable fit around the outer ear - perfect for running as the headphones cannot fall out of your ears like they can on other models. Excellent customer service!"
1,Im told the mic audio is low when on phone calls. But audio is awesome
1,"These headphones have absolutely beautiful sound for whatever your needs. I loved them so much I bought both my Mom and sister a pair as a gift! No need to spend lots of money (on big brand names) when SENSO headphones are better at less than 25% the cost. Trust me, you will love these!!"
1,Great sounding.  Bluetooth works great.
1,Received headphones today and had significant distortion in one of the buds<br />Senso customer service provided a quick fix (reset) that seemed to resolve the problem<br />Excellent customer service<br />Buds sound good.
1,"These work as described, have good controls on them for volume, pause/play and skipping tracks.  They are comfortable to wear but like all these types of headphones take a minute to put on right.  The only issue I have is they don't sounds very good unless you really get them in your ear snuggly.  Now, everyone has different sized ear canals but I used the smallest rubber ear pieces they provided and I still have difficulty getting them situated right.  That could just be me ear holes, your results may vary.  If you don't get them in their sug, they sounds rather tinny.  Get them in right and it makes a big difference.  For $30 with the case and the magnetic phone holder for your car, it's a very good deal."
1,"Nice product, I would buy them again."
0,worked for 3 weeks then would not charge anymore
1,"They don't pop in my ear! Other Bluetooth headphone hurt by popping loud static in my ears but these, I'm happy to report, do not. The red case matches the red accent of the headphones. They have a pretty good reach, maybe 20 feet plus 2 walls of interference before they started to cut out. Connecting it to my phone was easy. They came with a battery charge so I could use it straight out of the box. I've used it 3x in the past 2 weeks and have not needed to recharge it. I do often click the button when placing them in my ear, but that's okay. They came with several sets of ear buds and the default is a really nice set of buds, similar to ear plugs. Excellent buy."
0,"Man these headphones are not all that AT ALL. the microphone is SUPER LOW, you have to damn near yell for the other person to hear you. The noise cancelling SUCKS ASS. I do not understand why it has such large following and as many positive comments it has but the only good couple things this head piece has going for itself is that it is waterproof and it can go around your neck. Other than that it's GARBAGE."
1,My wife's headphones stopped working and she wanted me to order another pair ASAP. She loves them!
0,"Worked great for 2 weeks and then stopped pairing with any device, in fact, they will not go into pairing mode at all. Tried a factory reset but no luck there. They turn on and off but that is about it. Guessing this is why the price is reduced."
1,Well worth it. Priced well and does the job
1,"I have tried several different brands of wireless earbuds and these are the best. They stay on your ears, are rather durable, the sound is great and the microphone is pretty good for phone calls. The customer service was great, they sent me a new pair immediately when my first pair stopped working. I would highly recommend these!"
1,"The headphones worked fine for 2 weeks, no noticable problems.. After that, the outside part of the cover fell off when I set them down, but it clipped right back on so I didn't worry about it. Later though, after I set them down for awhile, I picked them up and noticed the micro usb receptacle used to charge them had come loose and was floating around inside the earbuds. So I have no way of charging them and they are sitting dead on my shelf.. I tried contacting Senso but they didn't respond, and now my return period is up. Disappointed at the moment but, if Senso can fix this for me, I'll bump up the rating to five stars.<br /><br />EDIT: I looked in the box the earbuds came in and found a 1 year warranty. After registering that, I contacted Senso again and they were able to send a replacement pair. I don't know how long this pair will last, but I'm giving them 5 stars for the support team."
1,Great stuff! Has lasted me over a year with no issues.
1,Nice crisp sound. They really do stay put while working out! An excellent value.
0,"Honestly, I was disappointed (and I started with reasonably low expectations, I thought).  The over-the-ear hook is simply too soft and flexible to offer much in the way of stabilization.  But the major problem I had was the poor BT performance; if I was wearing the headphones and then put my phone in my front-left pants pocket, the audio started to break up.  Taking the phone out of my left pocket, or putting the phone in my right pocket, and the audio cleared up.  Just holding the phone against my body on the left side was enough to cause problems.<br /><br />When the BT signal was clear, the audio performance was fine.  Nothing to complain about, and nothing to &#34;write home&#34; about.  Microphone performance was acceptable.<br /><br />Battery life was also poor.  After charging for 2 hours (seemed to be a full charge, based on the LED), I got approx 90 min of phone call and 30-45 min of listening to audio before it gave me the low-battery warning.  When the low-battery warning started, it was still reporting 30% charge.  It shut-off shortly thereafter.<br /><br />Honestly, I'm not returning them because, for the money, I'll keep them as a &#34;backup set&#34; and also use the car charger and combined microUSB / lightning cable.  I'm just going to order a different set and try those."
1,"The earphones are exactly as described.  I have had problems with other similar products, quality wasn’t as nice and earplugs weren’t secure.  This is not the case with the Senso earphones.  They stay secure throughout my workout and I couldn’t be happier."
0,Worked for 6 weeks no longer turns on. Tried to contact for warranty exchange they just ignore my messages
0,"I loved these headphones when I first received them. After one week, I noticed poor connection after 45 minutes which progressively got worse until it was all static. I followed the instructions to disconnect the Bluetooth connection to no avail. After 3 weeks, they would no longer charge. Don’t buy these headphones."
1,"Just received them but so far I'm very pleased. Good fit, good sound, work as advertised.<br />Modified a week later: Sound is good, battery life seems good after a week of 1 hour play time. The only problem I have is I need a size smaller for my ear piece. The left side fits great, the right side should be a size smaller to fit well. The headphones come with 3 sets of earpieces. Need 1 size smaller!"
1,Was able to use and enjoyed
1,Kind of bulky. I must have small ears because even the smallest buds feel pretty snug!
1,These headphones went through a clothes washer and perm press dry and still work.  Much recommended.
1,great sound and the mic works great as well.
0,"This product is defective and has a persistent buzzing sound in the earbuds. I tried to reach out three times, two by email with no response, and once from Invotek customer service. They recommended a factory reset, but that did not work, or a replacement for the same product. I recommend going through Amazon instead of Invotek for a replacement. This was the second set of headphones I purchased through Amazon and the same problem persisted. There is a constant buzzing in the left earphone that makes listening to anything unbearable. Factory reset did not resolve the issue. I prefer to put my money elsewhere to buy a higher quality product to avoid this issue. I want to be clear that I got great customer service from Amazon but inadequate customer service from Invotek."
1,"Nice ear buds. But? Bought these for my wife. Tried them out my self, they have a lot of bass. Sound pretty good though I thought for ear buds. Then I rode my bike with them on. A lot or wind noise,and yes they are stuffed in my ears really tight. Sound pretty good as long as your not moving to fast. I personally don’t like a lot of bass and these produce way more bass than treble.  Not for me. I guess she may like them I hope."
1,"These are great headphones, I bought them for my teen daughters' new iphones. (I bought two) They are very happy with them.<br />This headphone connects really fast and seamlessly with my smart tv. I have one of those curved smart tv's and the connection is better than with the powerbeats.And I am going to use the 10% discount coupon I got on each of the headphones to buy one more for myself. So that's 20% off."
1,"The sound quality is pretty good, clear sound, soft bass and it’s great for running."
1,"No trouble connecting the headphones they were cutting in and out , but could have been connection issue with Pandora. No trouble at all in the gym, I can’t get very far away from my phone. The volume is good and clear. They feel great and stay in place. I would recommend them to any that ask."
0,"Terrible sound quality, literally no low end sound. Like many others here, I had a pair from last year and loved the sound. Both the quality of it, and that these can get loud enough to drown out city noises while running.<br /><br />I lost that pair and ordered a new one and they just aren't the same. Reached out to Senso customer service which was great and had a few suggestions but those didn't work. I thought I might have just gotten a dud pair and was going to do an exchange, but there are so many other reviews by people like me that previously owned these so I'm just returning and starting the search over."
1,"I wasn't sure what to buy when I started looking for a set of economically priced wireless ear buds.  These seemed good after reading a few reviews from folks that do similar things that I do.  My main activities are in the gym lifting weights, walking, and riding my bike long distances.  For all of these activities, I've had no problems and they're very comfortable and don't come close to coming off my ears, it is like you almost forget they're even attached to you.<br /><br />I'd recommend these to friends and family."
1,"These headphones sound really good. The bass is just right, I can hear instruments I never noticed in songs. I wear them at night to listen to rainstorms to help me sleep and in the evenings to dance around (my new form of exercise). I highly recommend these to those who do not have hundred to spend on quality wireless headphones. I am still experimenting with the extra ear sizes but that does not detract from the sound from this set of headphones. You should not be disappointed."
0,"Work fine, sound quality is just ok."
1,Very good sound.
1,They have been super convenient. Always easy switching between my computer and phone for calls and music.
1,I love the low bass response and noise cancelation on this headset. Excellent customer service. I will definitely buy from this seller again!
1,"Work great, same if not better then same Style purchased 12-18 months back that I broke cable on.<br /><br />Product was received in about 7 days from purchase which is fast for APO shipping considering it transits USA first before being sent overseas for Military delivery."
1,"The first time I bought these headphones I loved them! After one year, they just stopped working. So, I bought another pair in October.. and after only a month and a half of use they stopped working!!  The quality of sound is excellent, but they won't last long. I would only buy these as an emergency set of headphones. That's it."
0,"I have had 3 replacement headphones within the last year. The company refused to issue a refund the last 2 times my headphones have died. They are great headphones when they work, but every single pair have quit working in about 3-5 months. I would not recommend these headphones to anyone or buy from Tekatron or a Senso product again. They do not refund when their products don't work."
0,This the second pair I had and I haven't had these one for a month now and they won't charge up now .I don't know what else to fo
1,Very nice headphones that stay in my ears during a workout. They have good volume control and decent range.
1,"I love these headphones.  They are lightweight, good sound and have a good connection to my iPhone.  I'm going to get a pair for my husband."
1,"I ordered this because it was well rated and my Bluephonic wireless earphones broke. The add ons were a plus but I didn’t receive what was pictured. Instead of another cable and a car charger, I received a magnetic car mount and a phone card sleeve. I don’t know how to feel about these since I have a pop socket on my phone but it wasn’t what I ordered. As for the headphones themselves, they’re just a clone of the old Bluephonics earbuds I had before. Literally identical in buttons, button controls, and the voice that says “Power On” and “Power Off”. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing because I liked my bluephonics but I was expecting a new product, not a clone."
1,Sound is good. Do not fit as snugly as I would like even after changing to different size ear pads. Does not consistently connect although automated message says connected.
1,"Great product, amazing customer service. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because one of the ear buds failed within a month of use.  For the money still a great product, and customer service immediately replaced the defective set without question. Will update to 5 stars if the replacement set does not fail.<br />update: replacement set works like a charm, 5 stars."
1,Awesome
0,"I ordered this product on March 28, 2018. As of today July 14, 2018 it is not staying on to pair with my phone or iPad. This is ridiculous because the other reviews I read stated how they are reliable and durable. The product is ok, but not the greatest for talking because its hard for the other person on the other end to hear me at times. It does it job as far as listening to music. It is not as versitile as I would have liked it to be. I cannot reach the vender for whatever reason. I haven't had these headphones for 4 months and unable to use them."
0,Having trouble keeping them in
0,You cannot wear it more than 30 mins. It hurts
1,"I bought these for my little brother who loves to go running, and he absolutely loves them! They don't fall out and he wears them constantly. Plus, should anything happen to them, they're under a one year warranty."
1,These earphones are the best.
1,Just as good as the more expensive models
1,Very impressed with this product. Lightweight and comfortable with very good sound. The 1year warranty is nice too.
1,So far so good!
1,Use them often...good sound quality and versatile.
1,"For the money, these are great little headphones.  Clear sound and i have no complaints!  Well worth the purchase!"
1,They've been great. Stay in place and work exactly how they should. Love it.
1,Great product and great customer support! Thank you again Kimberly Pollak<br /> Senso Support!
1,Great headphones and great sound. Only small thing that irks me is the minor disturbing interference when pressing the buttons on the earbuds.
1,Works well. Haven't tried it with a Fitbit yet. I will love it if it works with the Fitbit to listen to music.
1,"these are the best headphones I've used for running to date.  I previously used wired variants ( Bose &amp; Monster earbuds, Klipsch on ears).  and the Sensos by far are best suited for this purpose.  when paired with the comply tips, the headphones provide a snug fit and a decent seal.  the sound quality is clear with more pronounced highs than lows (but this could be ameliorated by using larger comply tips).  the volume output is robust as well and often find myself lowering the volume from the default setting.  there is some occasional static when adjusting the earbuds for better fit  or when controlling the music app (Spotify in my case) while running but this could be caused by sporadic Bluetooth signal while being outdoors.  these are well priced headphones with high build quality which I hope will contribute to its durability."
1,Great product for a great price.
1,"I recently bought this wireless headphones because I had some that weren't good enough and were the same price as this and let me tell you this are some 5 star quality headphones they block the sound, they are light weight, they can be very loud if you like that but you probably won't need to turn up the volume to the max because they sound pretty good with the standard phone sound and the headphone default volume. If I lose them or break them by accident I would definitely buy them again. This are too good for the price!"
1,Bought these for my husband and he loves them!  Works out everyday with them.
1,"The SENSO headphones work well and stay on your ear much better than the non-looped versions.  This is a much bigger deal when running, as the earbud-only style fall out due to sweat and bouncing. They are easy to set up and connect to my iPhone automatically when turned on.<br /><br />Most importantly, I've found the SENSO client service to be outstanding.  I had a problem with an earlier purchased pair's LED light not working.  I contacted customer service about their 1-year warranty and they responded within an hour.  They offered a few FAQ style remedies, which I tried but did not work.  They again responded immediately and offered to send me a new pair.  I found this to be a refreshing experience that has made me a big fan of the company."
0,"The worked great for over a month, then they started to struggle, now they are useless. They won't connect with anything, the flashing bluetooth light is gone, no bluetooth enabled device can find the signal. I wish I could still get my money back."
1,THEY WORK GREAT.
0,The charging port fell out of the unit just after the return window.
1,"So, i purchased the original set less than a year ago, and although i really liked the product, it started to loose around out of the right ear, so i decided to contact customer service as it was under warranty. They were very quick to reply, trouble show and ultimately yo replace the ear buds. So i thought i was extremely satisfied at that point bases on the experience. As everyone should know, a product is only as good as the service behind it, as it will eventually need servicing, so here's where things completely changed. When I got my replacement bud, one plate was completely off, which I managed to snap in place, but another piece, the one that controls volume and forward-backward movement was missing, rendering it pretty useless. So I contacted service, this time, NOBODY contacted me for DAYS, and they said they would help. Since then, I have emailed with two people from service team who helped me with the replacement (4 times) I even sent them pics of the missing piece and they never even bothered to reply, much less fix the situation. Since I am in technology, I know how critical service is to its success, and at this point I want to discourage anyone from purchasing this product based on the complete lack of service from their team.what if the same thing happened to your car?? There are too many other great options for wireless buds on the market to go with one who is so careless and blatant with their lack of support. I will definitely not recommend that anyone but this product unless you want to go thru the same headaches I have. This is a real shame!"
0,"Sound was not as expected, muffled and can’t hear audio books on them"
1,Great product
1,after a few months the hooks around the ear is loose and won’t stay in place
1,Worth the price
1,Bought as a gift. My husband is thrilled with these. He has a large range to move about the gym away from his iphone. Stays charged long. Fits well.
0,"I plugged these in to charge and the red light comes on for a couple of minutes, then shuts off.  Tried it with my phone charger instead and the same thing; the red light comes on and then immediately shuts off.  What a rip off.  I wouldn't recommend these to anyone."
0,"I bought these on July 13, exactly three months later (today September 13) they stopped working. I liked them a lot, I liked the case how they fit and feel. Unfortunately it is not a reliable product.<br /><br />I turned them on and just heard something, I heard it pop and they didn't turn on again. I've tried to recharge them but the lights are not turning on."
1,Actually works well for its price point. Has more bass than balanced sound. I use it for outdoors and I sweat a lot and so far so good. One thing I found however being bluetooth is that it does have interference and cuts out when I'm using a weed whacker (weed trimmer).
0,After a month it no longer pairs with my iPhone 7.
1,I am pleasantly surprised with the quality of my new headphones. they were easy to sync and the sound is great. I recommend them to anyone.
0,"It makes so much noise when air flows through it, it's useless when riding a bike.  It also has all kinds of connection issues where the palyer device doesn't see it as available bluetooth thing it connect to.  I definitely won't buy another one of these pieces of chocolate again!"
1,"I had Bluetooth Beats before this.. and JBL before that. These are easily comparable in sound. Definitely just as loud I live in Houston and my gym is in a warehouse so I’m sweating constantly. I mean I’m realllly sweating and these things have lasted a couple of months now and show no signs of failure like my others have. They stay charged longer than my beats did. I’ve charged mine not even 10 times now and I’m working out every day. No one told me to write this review. I knew if they were doing great I would write a review after a few weeks.<br /><br />Cons - the ear piece can bend around your ear, so for ME* when I’m running I have to have the chord around the front in order to stay on when it’s windy or I’m running fast. They don’t fall out if I wear them this way so that’s not too bad. Secondly, when the battery is low, it will warn you and they did quickly after within minutes. * just be sure to charge them once a week or so and you won’t have this problem."
1,I really like these earbuds
1,Very happy with the sound and how comfortable they are
1,"This is my first pair of Bluetooth headphones, so I'll do my best to give an honest review.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Lightweight<br />- Comfortable<br />- Stay on my ears<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Minimal bass<br />- Skip at times even when my phone is literally right next to me (Not sure if this is common with Bluetooth headphones)<br />- Poor quality<br />  - I have had these about 10 months and have had to request a replacement twice now. The first time one of the volume buttons got stuck, so I was unable to either increase or decrease the volume (I can't remember which). Just recently, the power button has become jammed, so I was unable to turn the headphones on. With that being said, both times the company was quick to respond and resolve the issues."
1,Sound is great but they don't stay on my ears
1,"I’ve only just set them up. But so far, so good."
0,"The build quality is relatively poor (even the LED status light isn't aligned correctly with the hole it is supposed to shine through), but that doesn't translate into a poor experience.  Quite the opposite.  It is at least 5x cheaper than the Beats or equivalent name brand offerings, and outside of dropping the connection about 10-100x more (rare for Beats given my experience and use cases where the source/iPhone is in my pocket) - it is a outstanding value.<br /><br />UPDATE:  After a few months of light use (no rain at all) - these crapped out.  Work for a few minutes and then disconnect."
1,"I bought these for my step-daughter and she told me she absolutely loves them....there comfortable, they sound amazing, and for the gym they are perfect...a great buy....and great service. The owner of the Company takes great pride in this product and I can see why, do yourself a favor and grab a pair, you won't regret the purchase........."
1,"Definitely waterproof, mine went through a complete wash cycle and came out working great."
1,"If you use them for indoor use, I highly recommend them.  I am torn with these because I love them but there is a lot of wind noise when I use them outside.  I walk 3 miles in the morning and the park I walk in is wide open.  The wind noise through these is bad.  I did not even think to look into that b/c this is my first set of earbuds with a microphone.  I did not realize that a microphone you can't turn off means wind noise.  So...long story short....for use inside like in a gym....BUY BUY BUY!  If you are a runner, walker, work outside, etc....find one where you can turn off the microphone."
1,For this amount of money is fair enough..not the best sound but still acceptable.
1,Great for the price. Too bad I left them in the gym :( at least I wasn’t hundreds of dollars in the hole. Plan on getting another pair.
1,The ear buds arrived on time and are much better than my old pair that cost more money.  A great buy for the cost conscious consumer!!
1,I like the sound.  It works perfectly and has a good sound  and range.  Is comfortable and I would buy again.
1,"Comfortable, they last all day at work without charging but the range is not very far, can only walk about 12ft from the sorce before it starts to break up the signal"
1,"used on work sites, good crisp clear sound with nice bass. can't beat for the price"
1,"Sound quality is good, but the button placement is awful. The button lies right over the ear which makes changing songs, volumes, etc a bit difficult and also annoying as there is a very audible click every time."
1,My son loves his Senso headphones.  He says it's his favorite Christmas present.  Will definitely get a set for myself.
1,The price was right -on sale! I own a good blue tooth headset but the bulk around the neck was getting uncomfortable with some health gear that I must carry.  The Senso seems to be a good choice but I'm going to use the slider that come with strap to pin the headset to my clothes.  It is so lightweight I am afraid I will not feel it if it comes off.  The sound is a tiny bit tinny it is not bad. The on and off function is a bit fickle and sometimes requires multiple attempts to turn the earphones on or off.<br /><br />One drawback is that there were virtually no instructions with the headset. Fortunately its operation is fairly intuitive. It did not say how you can make a phone call. I discovered that if I said Okay Google and then stated person's name with the word &#34;call&#34; before it works better than the other headset.  It also would have been helpful if there were directions with the 3 ft cord.  I discovered that there was a slider thst when pulled would reveal the connector to an android  phone.  I will probably go to the manufacturer's website and see if I can find comprehensive instructions.
1,"Comfortable in ear, but sound quality is not good, way poorer than my iPhone earplugs. If you use it for audio book, it’s ok, but if you really look for good bass music, don’t buy it."
1,Great headphones.  Really easy to set-up and use!  Pretty comfortable to wear too.
1,Outstanding comfort and sound. Paired it with my Blu Vivo iPhone. Three times a week Im in cardiac rehab exercise clinic. Put my favorite songs on micro disc and Im in my own space.
1,I did not use the product. I purchased as a gift. The recipient loves them. Says he uses daily and performs up to his expectations.
1,"I am very pleased with the Headphone set. I did have a difficult time connecting to Blue tooth. But once I figured it out, they worked fine!<br />I did notice that there was only one set of earbuds. Should there be more?"
1,These are great!  I love the control buttons on the earpiece.  Also the case and accessories that come with it and even the little box for storage are great.
1,Easy set up.  Nice extras in package like the carry case.
1,"Quality is great...cord is too short or too long, it hits the back of my neck or my throat when I wear a shirt with no collar and I think it's a bug, I don't like bugs...you have to turn the volume way down to get the noise reduction to work if you are walking and talking outside and there is any wind at all, I understand that is normal for any unit with noise reduction, maybe not with a more expensive one???..Excellent battery system, quick charge and last many hours for me, I use it a lot...I wouldn't buy this exact one again...Wide selection of ear plugs, I got a good fit!"
0,"The first pair I bought fell apart, this pair is so bassy I can't listen to it.  In a drawer now."
1,May be better than name brand items with a way better price.  Love them!
1,Excellent sound quality. Easy to use. Good value for the money.
0,Bluetooth continually disconnected from IPhone intermittently. Returned.
1,"Only had them a few days, but they pair quickly, sound great, and stay in my ears. Generous supply of accessories - Siamese charging cable (iPhone and micro USB, car charger adaptor). When I wear them on my bike there's a lot of wind noise b/c of their design."
1,"i bought this second pair for my wife because i m realy happy with this headphone. realy good sound, battery long time use. fast charging. for this price you will never find something like this quality."
0,"These are essentially a copy of the  taotronics old model. For the price,  I guess they are ok. However,  they are not great headphones. First off, the ear buds themselves are small. For me, they both drop far into the ear canal causing discomfort. Also, since the battery and electronics are on your ear, they are heavy and very noticeable. Because they stick out, lots of wind noise on the bike.<br /><br />One final thing. The company throws in a charging cord and car charger and a nice case. All of these I have already. What's the cost minus that stufd?"
1,I bought this in 2017 it is still working fine as it was working on first day. Important about that is microphone works well.
1,"These headphones have very good sound considering how inexpensive they are.<br /><br />My only complaint is that they are subject to interfierence from other, nearby Bluetooth devices."
1,"Pretty good headphones that are easy to use, and seem pretty durable. For some rap songs it does not handle bass that well at high volumes, but for most genres of music the quality is above average. Have used for a month now without any issues."
0,"I didn't expect much for the price, but these are not good headphones. The bass is cranked up beyond what is reasonable. The fit leaves a lot to be desired as I can't even get the buds all the way seated in my ears, which makes the noise cancellation worthless. The power/play button is situated in such a way that when you are trying to insert the earbud you either have to press it or awkwardly grip it as to not push the button. I would not buy these again."
1,Great sound and quality manufacturing
1,"Edit#1:  The company has reached out and taken the action to ship me a new set.  Will further update the review when I op test the new set.<br /><br />Edit#2:  I have received the replacement unit and it functions perfectly.  It immediately paired and maintained its pair for a 40 minute run.  Thanks to SENSO for standing behind their product.<br /><br />Original:<br />I have had this product for a month, and cannot give it more than one star. I will give the manufacturer credit for fantastic packaging.  It came with a very nice storage case, charge cable, thunderbolt cable, and car USB adapter.  All of those products look great and function as expected, with the exception of the thunderbolt cable being unable to charge an iPad.<br /><br />However, the earbuds themselves simply don't work.  In more than 15 workout sessions I have never managed to have the earbuds hold a stable uplink with my phone (iPhone 6s).  I have tried everything I can think of.  I wear my phone on my right arm, so as to be as close to the receiving earbud as possible, and the connection still constantly cuts in and out.  I have never used them at less than a full charge.  I have tried these with multiple devices, Android and Apple, with no success.  They have been nothing but a distraction, which is definitely not the point of wearing earbuds during a workout.<br /><br />Spend a few dollars more.  No matter how much these cost the value is still zero if they don't work."
1,"Good headphones, good sound and base response.  Have to re-pair them every once in a while though"
1,Great headphones! Just as the add described.
1,Ordered these for my very picky high maintenance bf.. he is happy with them.. says they have excellant sound  quality..
1,There was an issue with the left ear of the headphone and I e-mailed the Senso Support team to get an replacement for it and they responded within 48 hours. Hassle-free. Great service. Amazing product.
1,Great sound quality for the price
1,So far so good they work good and I loved the price for the quality that you get.
1,"Honestly some of the best headphones I have owned for really cheap.  Comfortable, battery lasts forever, and they dont fall out, just all around a perfect buy."
1,Good sound and great value. I would have it at 5 stars but they've been cutting out on me at times. Seems to improve if I power them off and then back on. May be my iPhone but doesn't indicate the signal is dropping so I suspect the issue lies with the headphones unfortunately
1,The headphones arrived prior to promised delivery date.  These were a gift and the person receiving it only had excellent things to say.  The accessories and case that were included were wonderful.  Excellent product -- thank you so much!!!!!
1,These are a really good sounding nice quality headphone. I'm very pleased with them. I also appreciate your follow up on my satisfaction with them.
1,Earbuds are very comfortable. It was very easy to sync to my devices. Highly recommend these to anyone looking for a Bluetooth Earbud.
1,"I was looking for a good product to work with my iPad and my iPhone, this fits the ticket. Good buy"
1,"Tried several earbuds and was not happy until these. They are comfortable and have good sound. I use them for audio books, YouTube vids, and movies, and I like them for those things. Bass could be better, but for the price they suit me fine."
1,Great product
1,"They work great!  Sound is good, comfortable fit in my ear.  Just what I was looking for!"
1,Works well for at the gym. Habent used for phone conversations. Just music. I like them alot.
1,Very nice sound!
0,"Sound is very tinny, difficult to hear. I am returning them."
0,got them wet in a pool for around 10 seconds at maybe 3 inches under water and now they don't work and wont even hold a charge. -5*'s
0,Piece of CRAP!<br />battery does not recharge.  Used 3-4 times.
1,Good headphones for a great price.  Definitely recommend if need a reasonable price.
1,"Great sound, even while I wear them while working in the yard working up a sweat. Would recommend."
1,Far exceeded my expectations......got em on sale for $10......are you kidding me ? 😃
1,"Really good, especially for the price!"
1,I was a bit skeptical when buying but thought to give it a try from all the good reviews about this product and I absolutely love it ... definetly worth the try ... good quality good sound good isolation not so good mic but overall .. totally recommend it
1,Very good sound for such a small headset.
1,Great sounding ear buds.... very comfortable... my only suggestion... make the activation buttons bigger...
1,"decent headphones and after a few months, we had a problem and the company was extremely easy to deal with.  They just sent us a new pair."
0,"This is the second pair I've bought. The first pair I bought a year ago was pretty good, but the battery died recently and wouldn't charge. I liked it the first time...the quality was good for the price. But the second pair I bought, the power button broke after a couple days of gentle use and I could no longer turn it on. So I either acquired superhuman strength over the few days it worked, or the product is very cheap and low quality. Buyer be warned."
0,"Used for the first time today, and no sound in the right ear bud. Received a faulty pair from what I can tell"
1,"The battery life is strong with this one, I can usually go 4 to 5 days without needing to recharge it (using it ~2 hours a day). Sound quality is amazing for the price that it is. On the other-hand, Bluetooth has its pros and cons. Cons: Audio lag occurs sporadically but it usually fixes itself quickly. Pro: I'm also able to get about a solid 6 feet away from my phone without having connectivity issues."
1,"Awsome customer support. my charging port got pushed in, so i contacted customer support and they quickily got me a replacement.  Thanks Senso"
1,"They seem pretty decent, but as a person who has smaller ears the non adjustable ear cuff is a huge bummer and deal breaker."
1,Ok for the price but the range is bad. Even having the phone in my pocket the audio cuts off
1,So far I really like the headphones! Just received this week so I am enjoying getting to know how things work. Prompt delivery and looks to be of excillent quality
1,Fits good in my ears without falling out even when splitting and stacking wood. Pairs easily with my android phone. Has a good sound to it. Love the easy function of the buttons on the headphones.
1,"Love these.  I tried multiple headphones for running/biking.  These are great for noise cancelling and have a pretty impressive sound quality.  They dont &#34;go in&#34; your ear, they more less set in your ear but are very secure and stable.  Have wore for nearly 2 hours while running and biking and you forget you have them on.  Highly recommend"
0,"I really wanted to like these headphones.  I've probably had 10 different pairs of bluetooth &#34;fitness&#34; headphones in the last year, and they've all failed in a similar way.  With the SENSOs, I felt I'd found the perfect match.  The hook keeps the headphone in the ear, and the sound quality is simply great.  The battery life was good too. I say &#34;was&#34; because I was in the middle of a workout about 10 days after I got the headphones when they randomly powered off and disconnected.  I had charged them the day before, so I knew the battery should have had juice, but sure enough, they were dead a doornail.  I guess it's back to the drawing board."
1,Fantastic!!
0,"The only reason I am giving this product one star is because I can't give it any less. The carelessness of the seller is beyond anything I've seen. I took these out of the box and tried listening to them, and when I tried changing the volume it crashed and stopped working. I thought charging it would help, but it would intermittently lose contact and stop charging. It went straight to the garbage can, didn't even bother wasting my time returning it. For anyone considering, buying, think twice. I've had my fair share of experience with cheap Bluetooth headphones and I can guarantee you at this price it is far better to get wired headphones."
1,Sound and voice quality are wonderful. Couldn't be happier!
1,"Yeah,  I've had it for about 3 days and so far so good. I'll keep y'all updated."
0,I have tried every size of the ear pieces and NONE of them stay in my ears.<br />After about 5 minutes they fall out.<br />Sound quality is quite good when they are in..<br />Save your money and buy something else...
1,"Love these head phones. Hooked up very easily. Great sound, and volume goes way up!<br />Haven't had any problems with these coming out of my ear. I am a plumber and i use them all day. Im always under sinks and they stay in.<br />Also work out with them and Not one problem with them.<br />Pause feature by just touching the ear bud is great and very usefull.<br />I would buy these ear buds again, and again."
1,"Lower music quality than the super expensive headphones but especially considering the price I love them. Work well up to the limit, fit my ears, pairs with multiple devices (iphone, mac). would buy again"
1,"Arrived quickly, my husband likes them a lot"
1,"These headphones are better than all of the high priced one's in the market today. Absolutely love them. Base is awesome, feels comfortable.. Great product!!!"
1,Great headphones!
1,"I've been using bluetooth headphones from Mpow for a few years and bought these when I needed a new pair. These are far superior to my old pair in sound quality and comfort, but I was very surprised with how easily they lose connection with my phone. Apparently it's a common problem with bluetooth that it doesn't transmit through the body well, but I never even knew it was an issue until I used these and looked up why they weren't working. I keep my phone in my left pocket most of the time and that's enough to make these headphones unusable. I wore them for a run and I tried holding my phone in my belt, and the music paused and skipped every couple seconds regardless of which side of my body my phone was on.<br /><br />If an inconsistent connection is something you're used to or can work around then these headphones are fantastic for the price and easily deserve a 4 or 5 star rating, but I'll be getting another pair of my old ones so I don't have to think about where on my body I hold my phone."
1,"Love them, use them during my walks. The music quality is excellent for the price."
1,"These headphones are beyond great. Very comfortable to wear, great sound and the mic works much much better than any I've tried on similar headphones. Sound is clear and crisp which is excellent, but thecomfort level is off the charts. The part that wraps around the ear is soft and pliable but just sturdy enough to hold them to your ears without worrying they will fall out."
1,"Quality product, reasonable price"
1,"I liked it when all desired features come together<br />This product is integrated, however I’d suggest to make the carry case as big as the packet to keep all the contents in for better mobility I know the packet is strong but most people used to throw it."
1,These headphones have some of the best sound that I've heard with bluetooth headphones.  There is no lag when watching videos and they stay firm when exercising.  The charge lasts a long time and the carrying case is not too big but very protective.  The dual microUSB/iPhone charging cable was a convenient bonus that reduces clutter when travelling.
1,"I was skeptical at first due to their cost. They fit great, pairing was easy and the sound is awesome. They are definitely worth it, even better than the more expensive pair I had that broke within six months."
1,Excellent sound quality. Value for money.
1,I have a pair and left them on the plane. So these are my replacement pair. I do love him and that’s why I bought the exact same pair.
1,"These headphones might be good for someone with medium or large ears, but mine are on the small side. As a result, the headphones regularly fall out of my ears, despite trying the included pads. This is because the hooks that go over my ears are about 1cm too tall."
1,"Terrific sound!  Sweat proof and stay in your ears even when exercising.  I'm be been searching for good sounding wireless headphones for a while and these fit the bill.  They charge quickly and I had no problems pairing with my iPhone and a Samsung smart TV.  They have a good battery life, clear crisp sound with decent bass when listening to music!"
0,Stopped working completely after two weeks. Not at all worth the money spent.
1,thats why i bought a second one  price and quality is ok
1,Worked well for 3 months.  When they stopped working were replaced with out any issues
1,Update 03/04/18:  My headphones died on me about 9 months after buying them. I called customer service and they had shipped me a new pair in about three days. Awesome customer service!!!<br /><br />I really like these. They are a bit bulky but work great. I can get at least three hours use on a single charge. Came with nice case and charging cable. Im happy with this purchase.
1,"The battery life is AMAZING! I've had them for a month and used them 6-8 times for 30 minutes each time, and let them sit in between, and I'm now at 82% battery. I haven't tried taking them swimming or anything yet but they're fine in the rain. On runs, they wiggle lose frequently, so I have to push them back in every two minutes. On a bike or stationary bike, they're fine."
1,"Everything great, not giving it 5 Because battery status feedback is very in accurate. both in the led charguing and the phone battery status"
1,"Family, these joints are banging..not going to sugar coat it..if you want to hear low hip hop bass and clear mids and highs...unbelievable..can't beat the price ..."
0,Battery life insufficient and wires kept getting in the way
1,"Fits great, wears well (not too heavy), only downside is I have to charge it after 2 uses. That 3hr battery life sucks!"
0,"This is the FOURTH pair of these headphones I've had, and the company has changed things - not for the better. First, on a weird ""why did they do that?"" point, the feedback voice, which had a slightly British female voice, is now an Asian woman's voice. Have no idea why they changed it. Second, the Bluetooth range is less than before. With older pairs I could walk down the hall and still be connected. Here, if I go into the next room the headphones start cutting out. Third, audio feedback is gone. Previously you would get a tone when lowering the volume one click before the volume hit zero. Now there's no tone so when lowering volume you aren't sure if there's just been a pause/silence in your program or whether you lowered the volume all the way to zero. My last two pairs also had the left ear headphone stop working after awhile - obviously from wire connections from the right ear where the electronics mostly are. Overall I don't think I'll get another pair of these,<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW ON FIRST PAIR: I switched to these after the THIRD pair of Trelab headphones I had gave up the cost. While not as light, the battery life is better and they've worked perfectly . I use them for walking, working out, around the office and at home daily.  When I had a problem with the volume switch getting stuck (so that you couldn't increase the volume on the headsets without using the phone app) Senso support quickly replaced the headphone under warranty without issue."
1,"They were GREAT for a little over six months, then had a minor reception difficulty which was quickly resolved. Thanks!"
1,No dislikes so far!
0,Sound decent but the right ear fell out on day one so I had to super glue it back on
1,"works well for what I bought it for, sometimes while running earpiece breaks its seal and you cant hear as well"
1,Work good.  Easily connected to my Samsung phone with Bluetooth.  Good sound quality and fit my ears well.<br /><br />Only 3 stars because they have bad wind noise when facing the wind.  Even a 15 mph wind (common in Nebraska) will be so noisy I have to turn volume way up to hear audio books.  Only a problem when facing into wind.
1,"What an awesome pair of wireless headphones!  The sound is awesome, was very easy to connect to my iphone 7plus and I absolutely love them.  Can't believe all the accessories it comes with and very nicely packaged.  Would highly recommend."
1,"these lil guys sound great, fit is amazing... comes with xtras that might be needed, adapter, cords etc.. clear sound, mic works good too... why waste money on beats these kick ass"
1,"These work pretty well, sound quality is solid, not amazing, but as good as I would ever need for the gym.  Fit in my ears was just ok.  The really weird thing about these is that the on/off button is right on the side (where the red circle is), and they don't stay in your ears super well, so at least once a workout I have to shove them back into my ear and then they turn off.  It's such a bizarre design flaw, esp as other buttons are better placed."
1,"Wow, what a great buy!  I almost bought wireless headphones for 3 times the price but these are an incredible value with great sound!  I am very happy with this purchase."
1,Calidad buena
1,great deal for money comes with case and some charging accesories works good so far.
1,Good for working out
1,Great headphones. Long battery life.
1,"I rarely leave a review - sorry fellow Amazonians! But, I've purchased several Bluetooth headphones at this price point, and these are the best. Good sound, fast charge, and GREAT battery life."
1,"Absolutely love the headphones! They fit nicely and stay on my ears. And they sound great and have excellent Bluetooth range! I even got a note from the CEO after I received the headphones, which was a nice touch (I realize the message was automated but it was still a nice touch). Highly recommend!"
1,Great value.  Work well. Pleased.
1,So far these are working great and are the only ear buds that stay in my ear while running
1,"I've had these for about 4 years now and still going strong.  Battery life is still good, and the sound is very good for the price."
1,"Accessories is perfect, come with car charger and love that come with 3foot charging cable. bass sound is quite strong and not my preference."
1,Impressed at the quality and professionally packaged. Voice is clear easy to use and fits my ears perfectly. THANKS.
1,Arrived in great condition and just charged the headphones and to our surprise sounded much better than expected.  Good buy so far
0,"Won't stay put for nothing, impossible to workout with these."
1,Work really Well with my iphone.
1,"Reasonably priced.  Good sound quality.  I gave a 4 star rating for sound because it isn't perfect.  Nevertheless, it sounds good.  The price is right!  I had a more expensive pair before these, from another company, and these are by far better.  They stay in my ears fairly well too."
1,Great Bluetooth ear buds work great for the price sound is pretty good...
1,"2nd Review:<br />Used the earphones for about 3 months for treadmill workouts. Right ear headphone dramatically reduced, may not be sweatproof. Changed the earpods but no help as the right earphone is not working.<br /><br />Great product and fast, efficient delivery- quick to setup and connected to my iphone 7+ immediately on bluetooth.<br />my problems with other earphones have either been they don't fit when I am on the treadmill or the earphones don't &#34;feel&#34; right when I am running. I do run fairly fast and needed wireless headphones that wouldn't jostle or bounce up and down and these were just GREAT! what is more, the price is unbeatable."
1,They work great. Happy with the purchase.
1,"These earbuds fit perfectly; easy to use, good sound quality, and great improvement to plug-ins which have been a problem with my iphone.  Even more important, had a problem mostly of my own making within a week or two of purchase.  I contacted the product rep and they sent me a complementary replacement pair.  Outstanding consumer service."
1,"I have owned both the 250 and 255 models.  If your into more crisp mids and highs, go with the 255's.  If you like a little more richer bass, the 250's are you ticket.  They are both amazing pieces, would and will buy again.  A pair of mine got sent through the washer and have stopped working.  I work all day so having two pair, one on the charger is really nice.  Always switching between the two models I have developed an ear to see their difference.  If I had to choose I would find a 250 over the 255.  If you scroll down after all the pictures it will say whether you are looking at the 250 or 255."
1,Finally found headphones that work on my Iphone 6 and actually have a microphone that works.
1,Great headphones love them
1,Awesome
0,"Awesome sound, and physical deign, until they stopped connecting via Bluetooth after 4.5 months."
0,"Sound is fine, but they are not super well made. The button for turning on off/pausing is poorly designed and doesn’t function half the time."
1,"just got it a few days ago and everything from sound quality and the comfort in wearing these awhile is good,no neg. so far."
0,Total junk... worked for 32 days and now nothing. Barely stayed connected when they working. Absolute junk!!!
1,The headphones are good for the price. They stay in place for the most part while I run and lift. They also seem to be pretty sweat proof. The most important thing for me is that they don’t feel uncomfortable like some other earphones. I use the medium size caps.
1,i dont know. i lost it in less than 24 hrs....
1,Nothing to dislike
1,Comfortable and easy to use. Pairs quickly.
1,"These are awesome. Great price too. Battery holds charge for a long time. I work out 2-3x a week at the gym and I only have to charge it once a month. Awesome sound, can really feel the bass. They fit good even when running or doing CrossFit style workouts. Totally recommend this product."
0,"They seem to have difficulty syncing to iphone, I have to turn them on and off several times to get them to work properly. It says connected when they are not connected. They also have vary short range, I can’t walk into another room without the feed dropping out."
1,These are great. I just got them. Easy to sync with Iphone....great sound for the price. I have Bose Ultra Sound that I use all the time but wanted a wireless pair as well.<br />Would buy again. Snug fit and they dont fall out.
0,"So uncomfortable, none of the ear inserts fit. When I was walking outside and it was even slightly windy the connection would get spotty and eventually disconnect. I couldn’t walk more than 2 feet from my phone without it disconnecting. Overall a massive disappointment"
1,"These are so good. They have good sound, fit easily in my ear, and I love that they have the flexible piece that goes over the ear. It just gives it a little better security from falling than just the bud in my ear. Plus, they don't hurt my ears if I wear it for a long time. Very easy to use. All I had to do was put my phone in pairing mode and it connected immediately. I would definitely recommend these."
1,ear buds are very comfortable and sound is very crisp. easy to use as well
1,"I accidentally broke my headphones and they actually replaced them for me. Truly amazing customer service. Quality of the headphones is 10/10 for price, and the sound is superb. Bass is responsive, mids are only slightly short, and highs are super clear. Amazing, honestly."
1,I bought these for my husband and he loves them.  Totally great purchase.

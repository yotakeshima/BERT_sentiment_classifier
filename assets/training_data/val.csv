1,"Works great, I use them to listen/watch movies while on the treadmill.  Also works great for telephone conversations."
1,These Bluetooth earbuds are fantastic. They were easy to pair with my phone. The sound quality is incredible. I use them in the gym while working out. I love these earbuds.
1,"If you are looking for headphones for your workout or every day use this is your product .I was looking in to buy Powerbeats3 but they have no so good reviews plus they are very expensive , this ones has great sound won't break the bank and they are just mighty !!!!"
0,Don't waste your money.
1,These have been great so far. I workout every day these stay put no matter what I am doing even running. It is easy to link to any devise. It seems to hold a charge for a while. I would definitely refer them to a friend.
1,"This is nice and comfortable, but has echo when talking on it.  To minimize echo (on other person's side), I pull out one side of ear piece."
1,Wow!!!  These are the best headphones I have ever had. The Bluetooth connection was quick and the sound is terrific.
1,Excellent
1,great product
1,"There were some accessories that were supposed to come free with headphones.  One being the magnetic car vent clip that I did not get.  Otherwise, they seem to be working alright.  Haven't had them but a week."
1,"Bought these as a gift for my boyfriend who is very picky when it comes to Bluetooth headsets. A lot of research went into choosing this brand and they did not disappoint. Not only did my boyfriend rave about the performance of these headphones, the company actually provides reliable support for their warranty. After heavily using the headsets for approximately 9 months, one of the earpieces began shorting. I got a prompt response from a representative who gave me troubleshooting tips after which they accepted full responsibility for the issue being experienced and sent a replacement."
0,used them once and now they no longer even charge. Worst headphones i've ever owned. You'd be better off with a 10 dollar pair from CVS.
1,Great sound quality and blocks noise pretty well for the price point.
1,"Headphones look great and sound good too. My ears got sore from wearing them after a while ,but thats just me getting used to them"
1,Look cheap and a little bit clunky but sounds fine!!
1,"I have only had my ear buds for 3 days, but so far so good.  I bought these to replace my beats, and the price caught my attention.  The sound quality is very nice and crisp, and the charge lasts a long time.  Pairing was also easy.  They seem pretty sturdy and come with a nice case.  If I have any problems I will update my review. As of right now I am very happy."
1,"Two days in to these 'phones and so far so good: nice sound, good seal on the ears (I had to switch to the medium sized buds, but that's why they give you options), and no trouble at all connecting to my phone. It's very nice not to keep ripping a terminal out of one or another when the gym machine tangles with the dangling cord of my wired 'phones."
1,Amazing. Exactly what I was after.
0,Worst product ever. Would not turn on despite following all of the instructions multiple times and ensuring the instructions were followed precisely. How hard is it to make a product that simply turns on?
1,"This is my absolute favorite pair of headphones.<br />They work well when I’m working out, running, or driving and need to take a call. The sound quality is very clear and the battery lasts for quite a while. With the amount that I use these, I am very pleased with the price that I paid for them."
1,I just bought my 3rd one. Love this brand and style.
1,I love them!
1,"Rapid delivery and unit works wel.  I have to get used to where the various control buttons are located.  Otherwise, I inadvertently hit them when making adjustments.  Good quality sound."
1,"better than expected, works in the water, the loop are a bit on the big size for my ears but they work. good bang for the buck."
1,"These ear buds have amazing sound quality and fit very comfortably. They came with a carrying case, ear bud charger, and I-phone charger. Additionally there were small medium and large ear bud fitting to adjust to the size of your ear. I would definitely recommend these."
1,Great headphones at a great price.  This is third pair purchased in my family.  Purchase was easy and delivery was super fast.
1,"Excellent. Feels a little bit big but has never fallen off. You don't notice any movement when your running and totally does the job, Sound is great and I would recommend to anybody looking for headphones to wear when running"
1,"These headphones are great for the price. Work really great and stay in place. Comes with different sizes of ear cushions small, medium and large. Will fit comfortably in any ear."
1,Headphones are great. Highly recommend.
1,i wish the power button is on different location.
1,"I've been an Audio Tech in churches and small clubs for over 17 years. I know audio. These buds are very good. Not just &#34;good for the price&#34;, but genuinely good! From the sweet nuances in Whitney Houston's voice, to the subtle ghost chords you hear in Stevie Ray Vaughn's version of Little Wing. Have I found a con? Yes, but it not worth even mentioning. Very happy with this purchase."
1,I work outdoors a lot and this way I don't miss phone calls and can listen to the music from my phone.  Does everything I wanted.
1,"I was surprised when I opened up the box containing my new earbuds set. I expected only headphones, but I also got a dual port car charger, two charging cables (short and long), extra ear tips, and a sweet carrying case for all that stuff. That's quite a deal for $39. And yes, the headphones work well: sound is good and they're easy to operate."
1,"I am sure these would pale in comparison to some of the other offerings out there, but these are less than half the price of others. I had the highly regarded Anker sportbuds which were alright, but could always stick to the neck and pull out of the ears. The foam earplug material does a great job of dampening ambient outside nose (read: not noise cancelling) and helping seal the buds for a high fidelity sound. They are easy to work and their pairing works well. The over ear securement keeps the bud in place, even if it isn't in the ear completely, so you aren't wrestling it on a run or in the middle of a workout. If you want a good set of bluetooth buds that you aren't afraid of breakage or loss, these are worth the money, 100%"
1,These headphones are great for working out whether it be running or weight lifting. Do a pretty good job at drowning outside noise out. Only thing wrong with these would be they stick out quite a bit. Aside from that great headphones.
1,These headphones came in on time and Im VERY happy with the sound quality and how easy they were to set up and pair with my phone!
1,I am 3 years into Medicare and had no difficulty paring the headphones to my iPhone.  The headphones are comfortable and have performed very well on the road and on the treadmill.  I have been very please with them.
1,I was looking for Bluetooth earphones that would stay in place. These fit the bill. They are easy to set up and connect to my phone. The buds seal well  and have good sound quality. I can move around with these staying solidly in place. I would have given this item five stars except the tone has a bit too much base. Other than that they are great for the price
1,"If you're looking for a great pair of Bluetooth headphones I highly recommend these! I've used my brother's Beats Powerbeats which inspired me to want to buy a similar pair, however I wasn't too fond of shelling out over $130 for headphones especially since my wired Beats ear buds didn't last very long. Searching for a cheaper alternative I came across these and after some consideration I bought them and am sure glad I did! As far as I'm concerned these are better than the Powerbeats in about every conceivable way. They are more comfortable to wear, they feel lighter, the connection with my phone is better, they come with more accessories, they are less expensive and the sound is great! They are so loud, it's ridiculous. I am so glad I purchased these, they could easily be $100+ for the quality. Do yourself a favor and buy a pair or two."
1,"These are durable and attractive. They hold their charge for a long time. They come with a sturdy case, charger, & extra earbuds. I feel like I got more than I paid for. My cousin and my guy friend has the same ones also. They are great for the gym or jogging outside."
1,"The headphones work great, after I finally learned how to turn them on (I'm a  first time user of wireless headphones)."
1,"Great ear buds with a fabulous sound!  I bought them b/c of the reviews.  They are worthy of five stars, and an incredible value to boot!"
1,Great product!!! Will be ordering one for my wife
1,great Christmas gift
1,I love my new headphones...perfect for the gym!
1,Use it for work  battery didn’t last long
1,"This is the second set purchased for this seller and the experience was a pleasure.  The sound quality is excellent, the adjustability and fit are more than good, and the sellers are genuinely interested in your satisfaction, what more could you ask?"
1,Fast shipping. Good quality
1,"Great headphones for any sort of sport enthusiast. I use mine for mainly gym use, they sound great and are very comfortable drowning out any unwanted gym noise. I did use them at home and fell asleep with them waking up 3 hours later thinking they might need to be charged so I plugged them in and it wasn't about 10 mins later they were fully charged and ready to go again, so they have a great long lasting battery life."
1,"Got mine on sale on prime day, I really like them. A few weeks prior I bought a different cheaper Brand pair(it was like $12) had literally no base and the battery didn't last very long. These have lots of base, are very comfortable, battery is great, and have way better build quality. To top that if you get a 2 charge cables(a regular short one and a larger one with with 2 heads on it for android or iPhone), a sturdy case, and a car charger with 2 USB ports. You also get the different sized ear plug things. It was an absolute steal on sale, definitely worth the regular price."
0,The music quality is somehow okay. Problem is whenever i'm driving and talking to someone using that headset i'm always getting choppy voice issues. Happened several times. I will return this headset.
1,"Very light weight but great sound with rich bass.  Kit came with 3x Eartips, wire tie, carry case, Dual Port Car Charger and both a long and a short charging cord.  I got them on sale but they compare to sets 2-3 times the price.  Oh, and they'll comfortable."
1,I  picked these up a few days ago and am impressed by the sound quality.  First off the bass is excellent.  I've actually had to turn it down with my phone's EQ.  My first impression was it's a perfect fit.  They are light weight and I  don't even feel them when working out.  They charged up quickly and easily with the supplied USB cable.  I can't say anything about battery life yet but will give this review an update after I've cycled thru them a few times.<br />I highly recommend taking a look at these wireless/Bluetooth ear buds if your in the market.  They even come with a cool little case to store them in when they aren't being used.
1,"I got these for my husband because he has been wanting some wireless headphones, thought about spending extra for the completely wireless ones, but we were both afraid he would lose them. He has been using them for a few days now and loves them. I swear half the time I look at him he is either wearing them or has them around his neck. They are about the size of a Bluetooth on his ears, so in all honesty it does look a little weird, but that is his only complaint. The sound is good and they stay on his ears perfectly."
0,Too big
0,"Perfect customer service but a crappy product. These headphones are heavy and flimsy on your ears. When you try to put them on your ears the ear hooks don't get set in place naturally. As if the hooks don't work together with these big and bulky earbuds. When you take one of the earbuds out it tends to fall back around and eventually pulls the other earbud out of your ear. Also, it feels like you're inside a tank when these headphones are fully set in your ears.<br />So again, heavy, flimsy, the wire between the headphones doesn't work, and they feel like you're ten feet underwater. The only reason I purchased these over any other ones is because of the customer reviews. But now I don't understand why are these so highly rated...Apparently the reviews could be deceiving when it comes to purchasing certain products online. As a product designer myself the only conclusion I can come up with is that the online selling science and industry still has to evolve."
1,"I just received my earbuds yesterday. I was very impressed with the quality of these. The carrying case, car charger, and not one but two charging cables  made me think that I'd just made a 100 dollar plus purchase. The sound was very impressive. One year warranty, plus a ten dollar gift certificate - I'm rather amazed."
1,"Only had them for a week, so far so good, the sound would be better with more midrange"
1,Good sound quality and quick charging.
1,"They are small, loud and I can fit them anywhere"
1,"They are good, Ilike them."
1,I like the clear  and volume of the sound. I support all the reviews. I am a rock & roll guy and you will love them.
1,"I'f like to switch out the loop that goes over each ear if possible ( not detachable -or are they?)<br /><br /> I jogged with them on.  I was feeling the rubber loop  flappin around (annoying) .<br />I think these would be perfect for any Med /Lg  ear Sized  Male Sports enthusiast ..,<br />&#62;&#62;I'll cut the hooks off &#60;&#60; -who cares these were inexpensive for  good sound<br /><br />I also had trouble going to the next track using the button on headset<br /><br />lol you asked"
1,"sound is great and you can wear them in your ears for hours and no irratation....by far the best headphones I’ve Owned and I even bought an extra pair in case I forget them at home, well worth the money"
1,Product is so good and works so well I ordered a second pair in case my other pair break.
0,"Stopped working, after a few uses. Contacted support and was instructed to do a reset, still did not work. I can't return since I have passed the return window."
1,I love these ear buds! Clear listening and easy to use! No cords getting in my way! Love them!
1,Great product
1,"I pay what I get so I don’t want to complain too much about the sound. I bought it for my workout. But it doesn’t stay on my eat and feel a little uncomfortable, which bothers me a lot."
1,"Update to this review- the three foot charging cord is not compatible with the ear bud charging port.  Changing review to 3 stars until problem is resolved.  This is my first purchase of wireless headphones and I'm very pleased.  I bought this brand because it had both a large number of reviews and a very high rating.  The ear piece is very comfortable and stays in my ears (I often have issues with ear buds).  The &#34;sport&#34; function that wraps around the top of the ear is very flexible and comfortable.  Sound quality is great, I've already recommended these to others."
1,"set up was easy--linked right up. stays put through running and cycling with the one exception: Keep and use the cord tie. The long connecting cord is 'tangle free' version, thick and sticks to your neck when you turn your head during a workout--pulls the headphone out. Adjust the length to keep the cord snug and its fine. sound is great. Definitely noise cancelling so keep your head on a swivel in traffic."
1,"Very satisfied! Especially with customer service! Headphones are great, work just as advertised and sound great. Highly recommend. But so far, their customer support is some of the best around to make sure I am satisfied and happy with the product."
0,Worked first few times now they just cut in and out. Useless and annoying. Waste of money.
1,Didn't really fit my ears but they worked well. Only used for a month or so.
1,"I bought this as a birthday gift for my boyfriend. I have no knowledge of technology so I basically just guessed and picked a pair of headphones based on reviews. He loves them! Good quality, comes with a case and extra buds. Now he can use his computer while I'm watching tv without bothering each other! Recommend."
1,Bass distorts a little when on high volume but this is typical.  I did not like the kink the twist tie on the cord creates when packaged.  I assume this will work out over time but a different way of coiling the cord would eliminate this.
1,"""Sounds great. Nice case and supplied car holder and a cc wallet"""
0,"It's ok. I thought about returning it but I need a set now and can't be bothered looking for another one.  So, I'll keep it.<br />The package didn't come with extra eartips or the wire tie like it says on the packaging. Not sure what the wire tie is for so I didn't worry about not getting that but extra eartips would have been nice to have. It came with a cute round zipped pouch tho.<br />It says wireless up to 30ft but I lose the sound few feet away when I go into another room. May be I have thick walls but my previous headset allowed me to walk around the house and even to the basement and back without sound interruption.<br />The cable that goes around the neck is too stiff...it digs into back of the neck when walking or jogging and pulls to one side with movement so I have to keep pulling it away to center it. The ear hooks pop off if the eartips aren't jammed into ears firmly. The battery life is crazy quick I didn't get 8 hours like it says. May be the one I received has some issues but it certainly doesn't hold up to the promise it says with its description.<br />I am not super happy with it. It just does the job for now, but I will not buy this again and I will not recommend it to a friend."
0,I really liked these until the battery won’t hold charge anymore.
1,Using them for a month; easy to use; sound quality is great! You do not have to pay 150 dollars for the same quality
1,"These headphones are awesome.  Great sound, fit great, and very comfortable."
0,"Terrible battery life, and at 50% it starts warning me that it has a &#34;Low Battery?&#34; Are you joking me? With how much I have to charge these they don't even qualify as wireless. To top it all off, it is horrible at pairing to my iPhone. It will say connected, then I press play and it just plays out of the phone."
0,"The good thing is the sound quality.<br />But the bad outweigh the good. Even with the smallest earpieces, the design doesn't allow them to stay on your ears. the hook is bendable to hold them on place, but it is till to large and doesn't keep them secure. they constantly fall out. When the are n, they feel awkward and uncomfortable.<br /><br />You may not pair them to more than 1 device."
1,Comfortable fit. Clear crisp sound. Effortless to pair.
1,Can't beat the price. Definitely worth it! No complaints.
1,Includes additional ear pieces for my big ear holes. Very good sound quality for price and size.
0,Liked product until one of the ear pieces tear up. I wish it lasted for more than 2 weeks. :(
1,"Good sound, I have tried them in the gym and they hold up really well for vigorous activity; also very comfortable."
0,"They worked great for the first year.  After that they would go in and out when I ran when my hand would go down.  Assuming it was the Bluetooth connectivity.  When that started happening, I decided to test out the waterproof rating which it claims it has. IPX7 is for 3 meters or less for 30 minutes or less.  I swam for 10 minutes never going more than two feet deep and they busted on the first lap.  They were already busting so I am not too sad about it.  DO NOT BUY if you plan on swimming or need long term earbuds."
1,"Great sounds, easy to use."
1,Delivered as promised. Easy setup.
1,"The headphones sound good, have a great battery life, and durability. I experienced a problem with mine, and within 30 minutes of contacting the support service, my new headphones were being sent. I definitely recommend these headphones to anyone looking for solid headphones, especially for use in the gym."
1,Best buy I ever made! Bought it for my husband so I don't have to listen to him watching youtube videos. It is great! He loves it and so do I!
1,Super value. Very comfortable. On a full charge these last a long time!
1,Love them
0,They won't turn on.  I've done all the trouble shooting with no luck.
1,"Bought this product particularly because of the accessories that came with it, and it has exceeded expectations. Great sound quality, and excellent battery life."
1,"I wasn't sure if I would be impressed with these or not, but I really like them! The sound is pretty amazing! Was hoping for more base! I have some other headphones around the same price as these and I can definitely tell you the sound of these sound so much better! Battery life is better than my iPhone! 😂"
1,not the best headphones. Went back to the Powerbeats and thebattery died after 3 months..
1,These headphones are great for the price.  Good quality sound and durable.
0,"Product stopped working after 1.5 years. Just died, wont charge or eigher turn on. Very disappointed."
0,"Truly a cheaply made product. After 4 good weeks with Senso earbuds the molded section (allowing you to skip tracks, increase volume, etc.) just broke off and I am unable to fix the problem handy though I may be. Not worth returning and won't get fooled again (Who reference)."
1,Excellent value and great performance
1,"Got this pair a month ago. The sound quality isn't bad for the price. One problem that I noticed is the Bluetooth connectivity. I use this both on my phone and watch, and on both I experience stutter in playing music even in close distances"
1,"Was gifted these headphones Christmas 2018 loved them from the jump. I've used them every day the sound is perfect, sync quickly, comes with additional tips, a spiffy case, and to top it off a year warranty. All this for the low price of $20. Buy them you won't regret it!<br /><br />The year warranty comes in handy which I used today my replacement set will soon be on the way. Awesome company that stands by their word."
1,"Great Sound, Great Fit!!!"
0,"I really loved the headphones UNTIL, the left earphone failed to work or works sporadically.  I don't use them often, so imagine my surprise when the left side of the earphone just stopped working.  So disappointing!"
0,"I used these mainly for phone conversations. They are to sensitive, the caller on other end can hear my footsteps. If there is a slight breeze, forget it, they won't hear a single word you say. Not a good product."
1,Excellent headphones 👍😁👌
1,Excellent for workouts.
0,They work poorly and do not stay in place during a run or similar activities so I am not very happy with the purchase. I have tried different products and this item has been one of the worst.
1,Thank you!
1,I just got this and used it for my workouts and runs this week.  What an amazing set of headphones for the price!  Forget about those expensive Beats this will suffice and surpass them!!
1,Excellent headphones. Great sound.
1,Very good product.
1,"I lost these headphones in my closet for over a year. I even bought another pair to replace them. Then over a year later, I found them again still with a 75% charge. epic"
1,Have used them while biking and they stay in place very well.  They allow me to hear approaching traffic but still deliver decent sound quality for music.  These ear buds offer a lot of value for the money and come with a nice set of accessories!  So far - very pleased.
0,These are not great. They do not fit well and have poor battery life. They do not stay situated in the eat well and slip out so much they are not worth the trouble of using
1,"Amazing, save your money and get these!"
1,"I have been using these for a month and enjoying the heck out of them. They have been a solid pair of headphones with good sound and a great battery.<br />The water resistance is a huge plus, I use them at work and don't have to worry about them. I had always had to stop listening to music to spray off the mats, now I just keep rolling through the night.<br />The built in microphone only gives a minimal amount of difference from my phone (that could also just be from the size of my head).<br />Only thing that I have noticed that gets me... not enough to loose a star, I wish the case was just a little bigger. Once I turned then on closing the case, so they where dead when I pulled them back out. So just a grrr for the inconvenience but that was on me."
1,"They work great, have no issues, would buy again."
1,"Works well.  However, it gives &#34;low battery warning&#34; only two or three minutes before the charge is over.  It is almost as good as not getting a warning."
1,"I purchased these to use at the gym, based on reviews and the sweat resistance.  The battery life is better than I expected and the sound is sufficient (bass is a bit boomy), but there are a few negatives:<br /><br />- When turning on, Bluetooth connectivity is not consistent. Sometimes it connects to my iPhone 7 and correctly identifies as a headset and shows the battery capacity, while others it needs to be connected, disconnected and re-connected again before it will work.<br /><br />- About half of the time, I have to manually select the headphones in the Music app or just wait 20-30 seconds. Several times, music just played from the iPhone speaker instead.  Bluetooth connectivity between my iPhone and other devices has been seamless.<br /><br />- The wire connecting them seems to be too long and is always something I'm conscious of.  It also constantly gets 'caught' when I turn my head and I have to take my hands off the treadmill's heartbeat sensors to adjust the wire, or one of the ear pods pops out of my ears. I tried the included wire cincher thing, but it just popped out of that when I turned my head - useless. Also the ear hooks are quite useless, as they have no rigidity - they're just rubbery and seem to serve no purpose whatsoever.<br /><br />- The only ear pieces that come with these that seem to really work for me are the spongy foam ones - all others seem to be too big and pop out...a problem I have never had with any other earbuds.  I do not use the foam ones because I use these at the gym and while on the treadmill, so I'm sweating a lot and I don't want that sweat soaking into the earbud tips and forming bacteria. Also, because the seal of the ear piece inside my ear is not tight, when sweat drips down, it gets inside my ear, which is quite gross.<br /><br />- Skipping a song on these is a different experience from all other headsets I've used.  Instead of knowing when you're listening to music and when you're using the phone (or just not listening to music), you have different buttons for skipping a song and redialing the last number.  Not remembering this, I double tapped the main button (like all other headsets) and it stopped the music and started calling someone.  To skip a song, you must hold down one of the volume keys...something that is not intuitive and will probably result in people adjusting the volume by accident instead. I just don't understand why they couldn't have kept a consistent behavior here."
1,"Terrific Head set -- quality, as promised."
1,They work fine.  Too large for my ears.  That's the only reason they rated 3 stars
0,"The headphones work fine. The sound is fine and battery life is too. The wire was bent when they came in, but I hung them in my car and they straightened out. The reason I give two stars is that I hate the way these turn on and off. The button presses itself in the case in my laptop bag and calls the last person in my call history. This is very annoying. I wouldn't buy these again because of it."
1,"Very cool product: great sound, easy to connect, light weight, and great for use while exercising."
1,"When I first paired these headphones with my iphone, they kept cutting in and out.  I emailed SENSO customer service, who responded in about a day.  I followed the reset recommendation of the customer service rep and now the headphones work great.  Very good quality sound for music and phone calls.  My only complaint is that I would actually like to be able to turn the volume down more than the headphones will let me."
1,"I purchased these during a &#34;one day&#34; sale.  Funny that's it called a one day sale as it's still on sale now as the same price as when I purchased it.  I am impressed with the amount of accessories that they provide with the headphones.  You get a nice quality hard case along with a cigarette lighter charger with two usb inputs and some additional ear plugs.  You also get a short usb cord but there wasn't a regular plug outlet which was surprising.  The sound is above average and you get decent bass.  They fit well and I never have to adjust them when exercising.  The controls are located directly on the right earphone so it may be awkward for some folks.  I've accidentally hung up on people during calls when I've tried to adjust my volume.  I could also attribute that to user error.  I had had some connection issues with my iPhone 6S where the headphones will randomly disconnect but then reconnect.  I also have occasional issues with crackling but only rarely.<br /><br />Battery life is good and I can get through most of the day before I have to charge them.  I'd estimate the actual battery life with mixed calls (50%) and listening to music (50%) at about 6 hours.<br /><br />If wouldn't purchase these at full price (allegedly $160 or so) but if you get these for $50 or less, it's a good deal."
1,These are superb for anyone with severe hearing loss and or wear hearing aids. I have a hard time finding a product that I can hear well and also has good sound quality. This product has it all. I am extremely satisfied and I highly recommend them. Also note that I am a professional musician and am very picky with sound products. Excellent bang for the buck..
1,I’m impressed with all the accessories that came with it. This company cares about your satisfaction with the product.
1,"These are awesome. Great sound, very good battery life, intuitive controls, audible voice-command responses eliminate guessing. Great fit around ear, stay put regardless of the activity, several ear bud size choices included, other goodies as well. The only thing I'm not wild about is the charger port rubber cap (which is a good thing!) could be easier to pop off and replace. Tweezers are almost necessary. Get your glasses out, you'll need them. Still, a minor annoyance and I'd buy them again since they're holding up well over time."
1,these are almost as good as some 50 - 100$ ones just like it someone actually thought i had their nice expensive ones that look the same. lasted so far too and i get covered with stuff when i work but they have lasted through.
1,Bought these for my son for his workouts kept buying the wireless beats twice that is and they died and cost more to fix.  Found these and they r awesome and working great !!  Would highly recommend them
1,"Great wireless headphones!  Bluetooth range is excellent and sound is great!  High recommend these to anyone, especially sports minded people that use them for workouts.  They stay put and don't fall out when exercising."
1,"Nice headphones just what I was looking for, and the sound is great too."
1,We really enjoy these earbuds. A lot cheaper than beats but I would rank it just as good in quality!
1,They work great!
1,They were good.
1,"The headphones work great for the first couple of months.  Unfortunately, after 4-5 months one of the speakers stop working.  From a quality stand point, it' a good headphone for the price.  Battery life is great.  Sound quality is pretty good."
1,"I'm happy with the purchase, it have a great sound and so easy to setup"
1,Cool beans
1,Best value for money you can get. Works great. Very comfortable while running.
0,"Update- only lasted 18 months. After about 18 months, the sound started to go in and out on these. I don't expect them to last forever, but more than a year and a half would have been nice. I contacted customer service, but they only offered me a $3 coupon off a new pair. I won't be ordering this brand again."
0,sound quality is very poor. not happy with it
1,Very comfortable. They look a little bulky on my ear but from the side they look great.<br />As for quality - AWESOME! While I'm working out I don't have to keep fixing or repositioning them. Forgot they are even on my ear for 2 hours (:
1,Very good quality for its price.
0,Didnt care for the ear piece that goes over your ear. It's just flimsy rubber. So unless your ear is already that size you can't adjust it at all. Most of these have an adjustable wire in that piece so you can move it to fit your ear. These just kept fall off of me. Plus I'm mad they took out 10 dollars to ship it back. ***update*** My refund is 23something and I paid 36. Where did the 13 dollars go?
1,"These are some very awesome earbuds. I've worn them to the gym and when running multiple times and have never had any problems whatsoever. They have a perfect fit and are completely secure with the loops which you don't even notice after wearing for a few minutes. Bluetooth works flawlessly and the battery life is great. You also get a bunch of accessories like a car charger, carrying case, two charging cables (one for apple products I think) with different earbud fits. These would make a great gift for anyone you know that is an active runner or gym goer."
1,I would highly recommend these headphones.  They are secure and stay in while exercising and are have good sound quality for the value.
1,My bf loves them
1,"I searched around for the perfect Bluetooth headphones at a reasonable price. I've had these for almost a year and am extremely satisfied. I'm a musician so sound quality was important, and I use them 3-4 times a week when working out. They stay in my ear when running and are very loud. Only downside is they are not great for phone calls because the mic is not close to your mouth."
1,"Have had other brands and this by far is best of all.  Returned Apple brand; did not like them; not as comfortable.  These are much more comfortable.  Battery life is very good.  I listen to a lot of radio, up to 8 hours, and battery has never gotten low."
1,Very sturdy. A little clunky. But they work great.
1,"I use these for running, mowing the yard, and just sitting on the couch.  They connect to my iPhone SE flawlessly, fit well, and provide great sound.  Great buds for the price."
1,"love them, lightweight, long battery and great sound!"
1,"My previous bluetooth earbuds died so I saw all the positive reviews on the Senso and decided to go with it. I like that it comes with all the extras, that it has a long battery life and that it immediately connects to my phone and I don't have to go into settings, disconnect and reconnect like my old set required me to do.<br /><br />Update: I have been using these earbuds for awhile and am not really satisfied but I don't know what the cause is. I have an iphone 5 and when I use these buds the music skips all the time. I have tried rebooting both the buds and the phone, I have turned off wifi, I have moved the phone around on my body thinking my bod was shielding the signal, I have taken the phone to the shop and had them look for circuit board cracks or corrosion. I was told that if the bluetooth is acting up, it can't be repaired and to fix it would encompass replacing the phone's motherboard and if I was going to do that it would be better off to get a new phone. So then I got out my old phone, a Samsung S3, and decided I would use it for my MP3 files. I found that the Samsung was also skipping. I was doing floor stretches at the gym and had the phone laying on the floor beside me about an arm's length away. It was still skipping. I found that I could pass my hand over my phone about 3 or 4 inches away from it and the file would skip. I am beginning to wonder if I were to spend $$$ on a new phone if it would still act the same. Do my new earbuds have low reception capabilities? Anyone else having problems with skipping? How do I fix it? Should I return this?"
1,"Awesome ear phones, extremely functional and easy to use. Sound is great, plus they look good."
0,These headphones are far from long lasting. I’ve owned a few pairs and they've all petered out after as few as three months (longest was 7).
1,"Sound quality and fit is good. However, the noise generated from even mild wind is extremely loud."
1,"Great product, promptly delivery and great customer service.  I couldn't be happier."
1,These work really well! The sound quality is really good and feels very comfortable.
1,"After 1 week of using them and getting used to the features and capabilities, they are great! I hesitate to say the best I've ever owned, but, they certainly are the best value for the price."
0,"1) The headphones either did not work, or wouldn't connect to multiple devices.<br />2) They are WAY too big!! I thought I had normal sized ears but these kept falling off!"
1,"I have had two pairs of these headphones, love them for workin out and have even bought a pair for a runner in the family. When my headphones unexpectedly stopped working, I contacted the seller. They provided clear troubleshooting steps and when the issue was still not resolved they sent a new replacement set out for me. Thanks for the excellent service!"
1,"I bought these for my husband after two sets of beats3 let us down. He loves them! He uses them to workout, no issues."
1,They work great!  When the bass comes in hard it causes too much rumble.  I have to turn them down for that.
1,"Got this product at such discounted price. Unbelievable, so many things in just one order: car charge, wireless headphone, long and 2-in-1 usb charging cable, the case... Such a deal!"
1,Great sound and no more tangled wire to catch on everything as I walk buy.  Should have got these years ago
1,I love 'em. They just work. Syncing is quick and seemless.
1,Great value and definitely sweat resistant
1,"Work great, pairs with multiple devices. Comes with a great selection of interchangeable ear buds.<br /><br />Edit: Reducing to 3 stars. When I was running with them, I noticed them getting fairly wet. I can barely hear the right ear bud anymore."
1,This is my first ever wireless headphone device. I used them for the first time today and am VERY happy I purchased.<br /><br />I noticed I can walk about 2-3ft away from my phone before the “signal” gets staticky. I’m not electronically savvy and I had no issue connecting the ear buds to my phone.... however I can’t figure out how to turn it off so my phone doesn’t always go to Bluetooth lol
1,Great headphones - I was looking for something that would stay in my ears and on my head while jogging on the treadmill or while I'm out cutting the grass.  These were just what I was looking for.  They were easy to pair and were plenty loud enough.  These aren't for audiphiles (I have my Audio Technica's for that) but they're great for durable portability when you're on the move.
1,"This is my second set of these headphones. They both lasted an average of 6 months being used about 8 hours a day and the battery life averaged 10-12 hours playtime. The first set failed when the battery stopped accepting a charge, and the second the left earpiece began to cut out and died. The company did honor their warranty though and were pleasant to work with and sent me a new pair (after I filed a claim for the second pair). The sound quality is secondary for my needs because I listen primarily to audiobooks or podcasts, as long as I can hear speech I’m good. I also replaced the plastic buds with foam ones for better noise canceling and comfort. I give the headphones a 3, they’re average but inexpensive, the company is 4.5 to a 5. A little slow to respond, but no hassle. I think once my next pair gives up I’ll probably look for something wireless.  For intermittent use, like for working out or something these would be great."
1,this was a gift
1,Wish the range was longer and wish it had a longer charge. Quality is good but the part that goes around your ears are flimsy.  My friends make fun of me and call the sheats
1,AAAAA+++++++
1,The sound quality is exceedingly good for the price. Build quality isn't the best but the warranty guarantees that one pair will at least last you one year.
1,Boyfriend loved them! He uses them during his cardio exercises and it's so nice that he doesnt have to worry about chords hanging around.
1,Love these headphones. Great quality for the price.
1,"Amazing!!! Loud, clear sound, INSTANT bluetooth connectivity, very stylish, super-light.  Thank you!!"
1,The headphones arrived on time and worked right out of the box. Easy to pair with all my devices. Too chilly to be out getting sweaty but that will come soon enough
0,There is literally nothing positive I can say about these earphones.  The bluetooth receiver is so weak that I would have connection issues with my phone being only as far as my back pocket.<br /><br />Pure Junk.
0,Won't stay around my ears. Too flimsy
0,Used these for running. They stopped taking a charge within the first month
1,"These are decent headphones for the price.  Personally, I think they could be a little better in the higher tone range. That could be personal preference.  The overall fit is great and doesn't feel as if they want to fall out. They come with a handy hard case, usb charging cable, and different sizes of eartips.  Well worth the price!"
1,"This bluetooth headset is pretty good. Not the best I've used, but it's also not meant to have superb sound quality. They're meant to work while running or sweating, and they do that.<br /><br />I did notice a little skipping during movement, but it wasn't as bad as some other bluetooth devices I've tried. I don't know how well they'd hold up for full out running but I had few issues jogging around my room.<br /><br />They do start to feel uncomfortable after a while, after maybe an hour, but they should be fine for a work out.<br /><br />I had no issues with them falling out though. They angle nicely into my ear and the rubbery grips stayed in place behind my ear.<br /><br />The car charger and usb cables were nice, but I didn't like how one of them is a dual micro usb and lightning cable. I mean, it's nice, in a way, but arbitrary Apple peripheral rubs me wrong.<br /><br />I think if you are looking for a good set of buds that have decent bass for their size for light exercise, these are a good fit, but maybe look into something more substantial for a heavy work out.<br /><br />Please do not attempt to submerge these in water. Water resistant is not the same as water proof.<br /><br />These were provided to me at no cost by the seller to test and review."
0,I'm clueless as to how these get so many good reviews.  The sound quality is mediocre (not terrible but not great either).  They wont go very loud.  There is no indication that they are charging when you plug them in.  There is no indication of the charge level when you power them up so you have no way of knowing how long they will last.  They do notify you (with a audible voice) when they are about to die but it doesn't give you much time before they die.  Here's the kicker:  I only used them twice &amp; they either won't charge (I have no way of knowing since there's no indicator) or they won't power up.  I wasted my time &amp; money.
1,Light and stay on head during sports
0,"I bought them for running and functionally they’re just fine.  BUT, the sound quality is very poor."
1,"Ah, this is very, but very good.  I am extremely satisfied with it"
1,"Very pleased with this purchase.  Was considering a more expensive pair but when I read the positive reviews on these I decided to give them a try.  I have not been disappointed.  They are very comfortable in my ears and stay in place, the sound is excellent, the instructions for charging and pairing are very easy to follow.  I use mine mainly while cycling and love not having a cord tethering me to the bike where my phone is.  I also where them around the house and have found the range to be very good.  I would recommend these wireless earbuds."
1,Received headphones on Sunday and just amazed at the quality and construction.  They were easy to synch with my iphone and the sound quality was excellent.  I have a set of Bose noise cancelling headphones that I compared them too and honestly hear little difference.  Plus I love  not having my phone tethered to the headphones.  I would definitely recommend these SENSO headphones to my friends.
1,Good product for the price
1,"After many days of struggle to find good earphones I found this beauty. The charge can stay for solid 5 hours, awesome sound quality. I am in total love with it."
1,Love them! Great sound! Hold a charge for a long time....days and days....
1,They were a gift for my 18 year old son who runs.  They were nicely packaged and he has loved them!  Thank you for producing a great product that is affordable!
1,"Absolutely in love with them!!! Amazing stereo sound, inexpensive, and overall very comfortable!!! I am completely satisfied with them!!! Battery life, so far, is awesome!!! Will definitely recommend anyone to give these babies a try!!!"
1,"arrived on time.  product was exactly as described, would purchase again."
1,"The headphones are great!  I have a hard time finding ear phones that will stay in my ears, and these ones fit well, are comfortable, and have great sound."
1,I like the packaging of the headphones very well put together. And I also I like how well they sound and the extra accessories that comes with them.
1,"Easy to use. Good sound quality. Bass is decent. Not sound proof; you can hear wind. Battery life is decent. If used almost everyday, it needs charging every 2 days. Charges quickly too! Not a hassle to wear or use. Sticks to ear fine. Fits my ears fine too! This bluetooth earbuds, unlike most, doesnt flash red and blue LED's brightly and is not distracting to others. Quality doesnt feel cheap. Worth the buy if youre looking for decent bass, bluetooth, durable quality, easy to use, not so flashy, bluetooth head phonea. Sound quality is good too. Worth 30 something bucks."
1,I have run sweat and used these in the grocery store. Sounds great and durable
1,"These are exactly what I was looking for in a bluetooth earphone set. Sound is fantastic, I like the multiple ear bud sizes because I have tiny ears.  These fit perfectly inside and out.  Very easy to use.  very happy with my purchase"
1,5 Stars so far. I love them to this point. So fed up with the Power Beats 3 and them turning off right in the middle of my work out. I will post more later since I've only had them in use for 2 days.
0,The hooks that go around the ears are too large and floppy and would not stay on during even easy exercise movement. I read this in other reviews but decided to try for myself.  They were right.
0,"Sound starting cutting out on only the 4th time of use and usually happened when my phone was in my pocket. It was even fully charged. I saw other people have this issue as well. This was my 3rd pair of bluetooth headphones I tried, oh well, onto the 4th try."
1,Hello.So far this headphone are working great.I like them alot
1,The sound quality is great but the ear hook is overly large and flimsy making it somewhat difficult to secure tightly to your ear but nevertheless they do not fall out I just am picky about my earbuds feeling loose likentheyre going to eventually fall off.
0,Item returned. When used with a phone the party receiving the call heard their own voice echo.  Works fine for music.
1,First few runs with these headphones have been great. Logged around 10 miles on three runs with them and no issues at all. They stay on my ears solidly and have a great sound. (I listen to podcasts and audio books while I run). Great ear phones for running.
1,They fit very well and are very comfortable. Especially for my big head. I do a lot of heavy lifting in the gym and these by far have been the most comfortable and reliable pair of Bluetooth headphones I've used. Also it has great battery life.
1,What a great product
0,"Kept slipping out, no properly sized earbuds available. After 1 week 1 earphone went out."
0,"Poor sound quality,  The ear piece broke off of the unit after a few uses  Do not recommend."
1,"I am usually very tech challenged, however, I took these out of the box, read the quick and easy to follow instructions and was connected and listening to my music in 5 minutes. I even answered a phone call and had great reception. The sound is better than my Bose earbuds and having no cords prevent me from accidentally dropping my phone. I've recommended these to my friends and coworkers and 2 have already ordered. Thanks!"
1,Wishe they were smaller but<br />Quality is great !!! Battery great!! & love the price<br />Stuffl like this gets lost easily in my life !!!
1,Excellent headphones with great battery life and quick charging time. Great with most all activities.
1,it’s hard to find ear buds that are comfortable and these do a better job than most I’ve tried - the cord doesn’t behind the ears doesn’t feel like it is in the way and I like that it connects them so I don’t misplace one. I am wondering if they make multiple size earbuds and how often do they need replaced ?
1,"Awesome headphones, IMO they sound just like the beats and I even compared them to my girlfriends beats and they are same shape and size. The only difference is the logo on them for a fraction of the price. Not quite sure on the 8 hour battery life, I was surprised the first week of using them I hadn't recharged them in 3-4 days and they still said 50% but then the following day it went from 50% to 0% and shut off during beginning of my workout."
0,Better than the Apple Beats that broke after 8 months. Never mind. These only lasted two months.
1,Awesome product. Does everything the manufacturer says... most definitely deserves a 5 star rating!!!
1,"These are pretty good especially for the price. They are a little big for my ears but they manage to stay on while I'm running if I turn it to go as far behind my ear as it can. I have only been doing light running, anywhere from 4.5 to 6 MPH. They don't last more than about 12 hrs before needing a charge though."
1,Great buy and great value. Sound is solid and good quality. Nicely packaged with a great little storage box/carrier. Would buy again.
0,"The battery lasts really long with these, but beware if you have small ears!!<br /><br />I run a lot and used these for my last marathon. I spent an annoying amount of time fixing these so they would stay in throughout my race. Once you start to sweat they slip out.<br /><br />Sound is good though!"
1,"Comfortable, great sound. Good battery"
1,These ear buds fit comfortably and the sound quality is good. They paired and performed as advertised. The packaging was slick as well. I recommend these ear buds for working out or chillin on the beach.
0,Never got to use the product. I held the multifunctional button for 2 seconds as instructed. Nothing happened. No led indicator light came on. I tried holding the button for 5 seconds to see if I could pair my phone with the headphones... Nothing. The charging light came on(solid red) for about 5 minutes then turned blue to let me know it was completely charged. Tried again no luck. Never got to use the product and waited a long time for my product. Sending the headphones back. I don't want to risk getting another defected product.
0,"Bought these to replace a pair of Sony wireless earbuds where the on/off button fell off and got lost.  These earbuds fit well, have buttons that can't fall off and have good sound. I also liked the quick charge abilty. Instructions are also clear and easy to follow. Since my initial comment , I have used them many times in both long and short runs. They don't stay in place in my ears that well despite changing sizes in war pieces. They are ok if not running. Better for walking, biking, or just sitting and listening to music."
1,"Can’t beat the price compared to the popular beats earphone. The sound quality isn’t that great compared to beats though. I like it for casual work out and to keep the sounds of machines, dumbbells hitting the floor, and people grunting"
1,"I use it for riding my bike.  Don't expect to use Siri, but handles music well.  You can redial the previous number, but other than that, answering calls is all to expect.  It's comfy in my ears, as well as on them.  These are the waterproof BT earphones for rain/sweat you are looking for...<br />I buy all my stuff--no discounts, no gimmes."
1,"These headphones arrived promptly and as advertised.  For the money, the quality appears to be really good.  I only gave it 4 stars because I have only used them a few times and I want to see how well they hold up before I rate them any higher.  All of the functions work well (bluetooth connection, volume, and multifunction button).  I'll update the review after I've used them more."
1,"I have been using my Senso headphones for almost a year now and I have very much enjoyed using them.  The sound quality is excellent and  is well distributed from highs to lows.  They can work for two or three days without a charge.  They fit well on my ears and have never fallen out during a gym workout, walk, bike ride or a run.  They came with a nice set of ear tips so as to fit the earbuds to the size of the ear canal.  Also includes a well-make hard-shell travel case.<br /><br />Yesterday, I noticed some crackling in the left bud.  I got in touch with Tekatron customer support this morning (Saturday) and, believe it or not, they responded to my email within an hour or so.  They suggested a hard reset which unfortunately didn’t fix the problem.  But when I wrote back to them - once again they responding within the hour or so) they told they would send me a replacement.  There are not that many tech companies that give you such immediate and excellent customer service, especially when a product is almost a year old.<br /><br />I highly recommend the Senso Bluetooth Headphones for you listening pleasure while on the move.  Also know that Tekatron just an email away and you will get top-notch customer service."
1,"Great sound quality. Quick pairing with iPhone. Very comfortable. Have not tested in water yet, but looks solid."
0,"So very disappointed in this product. You'd think 18,000+ reviews would be an indicator of good quality...but the background noise/static is absolutely awful. Tried the factory reset, and it was still really bad. You get what you pay for.  Returning immediately."
0,My daughter said they hurt her ears
1,Update - 1/8/19<br /><br />I am updating my review because Senso saw my review and they immediately contacted me.  We tried to see if we had to reset the headphones and realized they were defected.  They sent me a replacement pair ASAP.<br /><br />Thank you Senso team for caring so much about your customers and the quick turnaround.<br /><br />I’ve only had these headphones for two months and they turn off by themselves. It’s so annoying when I’m working out and they turn off and I turn them back on and they turn off again.  This happens at least every minute
1,"I bought these and they are perfect for my spring/summer exercise. they are great to cancel the roads and people talking while I am running. they are perfect for my ears, fit and don't fall out. GREAT BUY"
1,Great set of headphones ! Crystal clear audio. Fits nicely ....great seller....thanks !
1,"Great earphones, very clear, easy to control, comfortable around the ears."
1,Quality material
1,Bought as a Christmas gift and they were a big hit and work well.  Great price point as well.
1,"I purchased these about a month ago to use at work and during exercising and I love them.  Very comfortable to wear, battery does last a long time - I charge them maybe one time a week.  The battery life shows up on my iPhone, which is really helpful.  Sound is good, and I've used the microphone a few times and has worked well.  I've already recommended these."
1,Good quality for the money. My wife says they sound better that our dons $150 beats.
1,Love these! Easy to connect to my bluetooth devices; sound quality and fit are great too!
1,"Works perfectly with LG V10, best bluetooth headphone !"
1,"This is my third set - I have them situated all over so that I have quick access.  Yes, I know there is a wire running between the earpods but it doesn't bother me.  Great sound, convenient, long lasting . .  Need I say more?"
1,The best headphones I ever owned. During the work they stay on without any problem. Definitely recommended.
1,I am so far very happy with the ear buds. They are very comfortable and sound quality is very good.
1,clear and concise directions. Very easy to operate from multiple sources. Definitely a keeper!!
1,Work just fine. They do pull to one side while running and sometimes cut in and out but overall they do the job.
0, 
1,"I just bought these headphones for my boyfriend for his boyfriend. I received them yesterday, and he loves them!"
1,They work underwater which is why I went with them. I read lots of reviews on a lot of different headsets to find some that actually worked well.
1,Great value for the money.
1,Great headphones.They paired up fast good sound quality.<br /> Great price.
1,"really great headphones,  paired up perfectly and sound great."
1,"I use these at the gym for about an hour at a time, about 5 days per week, mostly for running and weight-lifting. They work well."
1,When I was first looking for a Bluetooth set of headphones I went through all of the normal channels for review. And let me tell you I hit a bunch of snags along the way some headphones I got did not hold well over my ears. Some headphones I got did not fit in my ear. But the worst were the ones I tried that sounded horrible. So I went on to amazon and thought I'll give one more pair with a great review a shot. Well let me tell you these are amazing first the hooks over your ear hold them snug but the flexible hook doesn't feel heavy or hurt like some start to do. Second they come with an assorted set of earbuds to fit all shapes and sizes but the memory foam style they come with are perfect. All you do is squeeze them and let them expand in your ear and they are snug and to be honest cancel a lot of outside noise out. And lest the sound quality and range of volume impress and the bass is dynamic but not over powering perfect for most pump up workout songs. These will be my go to brand for a long time and am excited to see what they have in store for the future!
1,"Great bluetoooth headphones for the price. Very light. Sounds amazing. Holding the 5th star for one small thing. The ear hook couldnt be molded around my ear unlike its Beats counterpart for a better fit. But so far, its really good."
1,"These work well, overall good sound quality, and a variety of sizes for the rubber ear cups"
0,The ad said waterproof and not sweatproof. I bought so I can use in pool for surface swimming. First time using the headphones shut down and would not turn back on.
1,"Light weight, long lasting battery life, could get better range but for the money these are definitely a great value."
1,"Ive had these for 2 years and use them at the gym. I love these so much! They dont fall off when working out, sound quality is amazing, and battery life is very good. I use these 5 days/week for 1 hour more or so each day. Once fully charged, they are good for the whole week."
1,"They sound great and stay in place surprisingly well! Senso has fantastic customer service. I run every morning down a fairly busy road and love these headphones, noise cancellation is great!"
1,Good quality
1,Works amazingly and long battery life
1,"Seem to wick moisture well if you're a heavy sweater, I use mostly for cardio at the gym"
1,I work in auto body so I'm moving around all day.  These headphones are awesome!  They stay in place and are loud!  I love them!
1,My husband absolutely loves these headphones!! They go very loud and have a rich but not overpowering bass. Everywhere we go people think they are beats headphones
1,The sound is excellent. The time they last is 8 hours. Gets me thought the workday.
1,"Works like a charm. Lightweight, good sound. No connectivity issues."
1,Very handy for calling and hands free
1,"These were a gift for my 14 year old daughter and she LOVES them! She's even making telephone calls, which is a giant leap in her telephone functionality usage. The reception is crystal clear."
1,Stopped charging after 5 months. Will contact seller. Hopefully they fix this. Otherwise they worked great. I loved them.<br /><br />Edit: New headphones in the mail. Customer service was quick and nice.
1,I needed something like this for my workouts! So glad they work just great!
1,My husband and I have been using these for months and are very pleased with them. The range is about 30 feet inside our house and the sound quality is very good. We like that you can control the volume and the play/pause button right on the right ear piece.
1,"I've been using these for two months.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Headphones stay in ears firmly<br />Outside noises are significantly quieter<br />The volume gets more than loud enough<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Sound quality is below average. It's acceptable for talk radio or spoken podcasts, but music is muffled and there is no treble.<br /><br />The left earbud is louder than the right. I have to loosen the left one a bit to even the volume out.<br /><br />The wire gets caught on my shirt, so when I turn my head, the earbud tries to come out of either ear.<br /><br />Sometimes they disconnect suddenly, then reconnect. It will do this several times in a row. I have to turn them off manually and then back on.<br /><br />Summary:  These earbuds are the same as the other &#34;cheap&#34; ones being sold on Amazon. You get what you pay for. In the long run, you're better off buying higher quality bluetooth earbuds than going cheap and being frustrated."
1,"Had these headphones for a little over 2 years, awesome product. But today I swam with them on and now they won’t come back on"
1,"I use these for working out. Had many other  “waterproof” brands that crapped out on me, but these I’ve had for over a year and they still work great! Sound is very good, not the highest quality but really good if you’re not expecting perfect and for the price point well worth it. By far the best deal out and you get really good quality. Highly recommended."
1,They sound great! By far the best earbuds I have found for the price.
0,"I purchased this based on all the reviews, however I find them extremely uncomfortable and cannot wear them for more than 20-30 minutes. Also unlike what many other reviews state, the sound quality is not great."
1,"These are super comfortable (the ear loops are very soft so you don't feel them once they're in place), stay on while exercising, and sound great. The extras in the package are a nice bonus. Would definitely recommend to anyone."
1,"My two biggest issue is that these headphones disconnects or something when I place my phone in the my back pocketa of my pants and the discomfort after wearing them for awhile. They sound great, really loud, clear, and easily blocks sound. I use them everyday for work and love them."
1,I bought them for my Granddaughter and she said they where the best she had used.
0,I was very impressed until I heard the sound quality. Sounds very muffled and it seems to be getting worse as time goes on. I've only had them a couple weeks so far. I was hoping for more. You're obviously not going to get incredible sound in this price range but it should still be better than this...
1,These work perfectly for me when I work out. Great product!
1,"Bought these to wear primarily on my commute to and from work (I ride a bus or take light rail into downtown Houston). These work great with my iPhone and are comfortable for hours at a time. The noise-cancelling feature works alright, although not enough to drown out every noise. I'd highly recommend these to anyone looking for high quality, hands-free headphones.<br /><br />Update: I bought another pair for working out. I work out 3x a week, fairly intensively. These do a decent job, although with the soft rubber piece, the headphones can get jostled during movement. However the fit is very comfortable and the range is pretty good. I can set my iPod down and walk about 30 feet away and still get a strong signal."
1,"I purchased these earbuds for a more tangle-free workout. Not only was the price so great, the sound quality, comfort, and included accessories make this product an outstanding purchase. Highly recommended!!"
1,"Generally happy with them, it's comfortable and has good sound, only issue I find with them is the left speaker sounds not as loud as the right.  But worth the price and they stay put while working out!"
1,Cord gets tight when I turn my head. Left ear doesn’t play as loud anymore probably due to the cord being pulled as I turn my head. Had to replace these with a wireless set.
0,"When I first got them I loved them. They sound good and I'm able to talk on the phone with them as well. However, a month after I got them the battery went bad and the return window closed. Now I'm stuck with them."
0,Stopped working around 11 months into infrequent use.  Senso support told me to try resetting it which didn't work.  Apparently I'm out of luck since I purchased this through amazon warehouse deals.  Based on my experience I can't recommend something that doesn't last a year.
1,"[[VIDEOID:fe4039dc4231ae7d06bdb9fba7106478]] I just get them<br />Great sound 👍Mic good 👍<br />They look great !!!, I can’t wait to test them in the gym tomorrow !!!!"
1,"I love these headphones.  I looked around a bit before I bought these.  They sound great, battery life is pretty good.  I'm a big fan of the cord that holds them together.  Makes it easy to temporarily take them out and let them hang around my neck.  Great purchase!!!"
1,"This is my first pair of bluetooth headphones, but I really like them.  Quick charge, super easy to pair, and they sound phenomenal.  The included carry case is great for storing them when not in use, or to toss in a gym bag without them getting tangled inside the bag. I keep the extra charger in the car, which is a  plus! Very happy with my purchase."
1,Good while they lasted. Had them for about a year before the charge would not hold. Now they don’t work at all. Disappointing to have to replace them after a year of use. I’d recommend them to someone who need some they wouldn’t mind losing. Other than that I’d go with a higher quality option.
1,"Los mejores que tuve para hacer ejercicios, sin preocupación de sudarlo o que se saliera del oído"
1,This is a complete package. So far I can get 3-4 days of workouts on one charge. It works exactly a described.
1,Great headphones and great company! My headphone's charger broke and the company gave me a new pair under the one year warranty!
1,There was good for the first couple weeks but after
1,"Use when mowing lawn. They stay in my ear, sound great, and are only 20 bucks."
0,"The sound quality , electronics and battery life is just fine but the ergonomics could be better.  The ear hook is too flexible and does not help secure them well but I returned them because the blue LED blinks all the time when in normal use and if you use them in bed when using your phone or kindle it will drive you insane.  The LED is faces in the same direction as your sight so it's in your peripheral vision giving you a seizure. I used some blue electrical tape, it's all i had shined right through two pieces.  Also the materiel does not allow adhesive to stick to it..  I want the LED for button function and charging so don't want cover it all the time..  Why does it have to be on when in normal use?  You only need the LED for button function and charging not when in use.  I would not have returned them if not for LED issue. If you never use them in the dark then they are fine.  I gave it two stars because the engineers should have caught this . There is no reason for LED to blink all the time drawing power from battery with no purpose?  Yes I know the power drain is insignificant but still.  Fix it guys on next production run."
1,Good fit. Good sound. Good value.
1,"Easy to wear.  Good fit.  Ridiculously easy pairing. (Tested with my Samsung TV, Google Phone, and iMac.) The charging time was quick...about two hours.<br /><br />The sound quality is good.  NOT TOO HEAVY ON THE BASS!  Surprisingly good with Spotify.<br /><br />They aren't Grado's or Bose. But for 30 bucks you aren't going to get a better blue tooth headphone."
1,Perfect thank you
1,"These headphones are superior to many wireless earphones costing far more, and I've tried several. The bass can be a bit heavy, so there are some adjustments that you will need to make if available on your device. Raw sound quality is still quite nice, and the fit to your ears is more impressive. I was a bit unsure if the buds would remain stable inside of the ear as I move around, but I was pleasantly surprised to find them extremely comfortable. The earpiece hook is made from a soft, rubbery material, and doesn't irritate the outer ear in any way. Honestly, you don't even feel it after some time. There is a nice case included, and several adjustment buds for different ear sizes. Battery life is amazing, I've listened to them on and off for days without charging. Call quality has been decent, but inconsistent. I'll need more time to update the review to determine if the problem has been the headphones, or the caller's mobile device. Some calls have been excellent, while others have varied with and without the Senso unit. Nevertheless, these headphones should certainly be purchased without hesitation. Highly recommend!"
1,"i like the feel, but have not been able to put it to the test yet"
1,"Very nice. Lots to offer in the packaging. Comes w/ a case/ extra chargers, ear size cushions, car charger ect. Sound is good, functionality is versatile."
1,Great product great sound quality!
0,"Passive noise canceling is not noise canceling. It's noise isolating, meaning they rely on a tight fit to keep the noise out. Noise canceling is a circuit that reads the incoming waveform of the sound of the room you are in, and produces its opposite waveform, thus canceling it."
1,"Great headphones for the money. Stays put while active, super easy to control volume, answer calls. Will buy another for my son."
1,Great product and great customer service.
1,Exactly what I was looking for
1,Great product for the price.
1,"For the price, great headphones!!"
1,"Great price and support.  Had them for eight months and used them daily. They recently gave out and the manufacturer backed it up with a replacement.  Thank you!<br /><br />Update: after about six more months on the replacement the left side volume went down.  Still, four stars for the support and overall durability compared to similarly priced products on Amazon,."
0,"I ordered 2 sets of these, they sound good but the reason for the 2 stars only comment is that one of them which it was a gift for my GF had an issue with volume buttons didn't work properly, she was able to volume up but couldn't turn it down, so she had to use the phone every time she wanted to lower the music, i tried to contact the seller via phone but i couldn't because i live overseas"
1,Love the freedom the headphones give me--in and outdoors.
0,"The sound quality and battery life was great! I grabbed these for work because i have to move around alot and its too easy for a headphone cord to get snagged. However this became a problem with these as well, it says 30 feet, but really it means 30 feet if angled the right direction. Besides leaving my phone(fully charged) on the table top while walking around the table I also tried leaving it in a hip pocket with the top poking out and I still got a choppy signal. Icant carry my phone in my hand while working, back to cords for me I guess."
1,The headphones fit great in my ears.  Good sound quality. Long battery life.
1,"Sound was good but Product is NOT waterproof... NOT FOR SWIMMING! Under the IPX7 designation, will be able to withstand immersion in water up to 1 meter. It stopped working immediately when submersed in 5 inches under."
1,Great quality sounds so good
1,I have had these headphones for several months now and they are great. The sound quality is pretty good and battery life last a long while. Would recommend purchasing!
1,These were a gift for my son's 21st birthday. He said they sound great and he wears them everyday to the gym.
1,"So I wanted to wait until I was able to really test out these head phones before writing this review. It has been about a week since I received these in the mail. They arrived right when they said they would and the box was in excellent condition, which of course you expect from amazon. I was so excited after reading all the reviews before purchasing to be honest it was between these and a pair that was well needless to say WAY more expensive. I decided to take a chance on these and all I would be out would be 25 bucks and a lesson learned of you get what you pay for lol. Well let me tell you it has been well over a week since I had these and all I can do is rave about them to everyone who will listen. So let me break it down for you.<br /><br />PROS (AND LET ME TELL YOU THERE IS ALOT OF THEM)<br /><br />Firstly the battery life is AMAZING I just now charged after getting it out of the box and using it for over a week straight. Yes I used it for Netflix and Pandora at the Gym, Yes I used it for phone calls while cleaning the house, and I even used it on a hiking trip with pretty much no way to charge my phone or the headset and it still kept on ticking it even outlasted my brand new Iphone which I was extremely impressed by. So it says 8 hours of use it will give you that and probably a lot more.<br /><br />Secondly it fits so comfortably in my ear. Seriously this was a big consideration for me I usually hate in the ear head phones preferring my over the ear set or my gaming headset. That being said I was impressed and surprised at the range of sizes and styles it offered for fitting in one persons ear. They fit really comfortably and even after a couple hours in still didn't hurt my ear.<br /><br />Third They stayed on my ears! I know this goes back to the second point out fit but I decided to talk about it separate because it was important to me I was able to do high impact cardio in these without having to adjust them and let me tell you I put these to the test running, hiking, and lifting, these things stayed put no matter what I was doing.<br /><br />Which leads me to the Fourth thing I love about them. They are water resistant !!!!!! I mean when you work out how many of you have killed your headphones because of sweat? I know I have and these I have even dropped them in the sink. NOT SOMETHING I RECOMMEND! But they just kept on ticking. Of course I could have just been extremely lucky so don't try this at home.<br /><br />Number 5 on our count down of why you should buy these headphones. They are so easy to operate even my grandma could do it! They pair super easy and with all the Bluetooth enabled devices I have tried them on including my computer (HP laptop), Tablet (Ipad), Phone (Iphone), Ipod, and the husbands LG phone and my old HTC.<br /><br />Number 6. The Sound is great especially for the price! It is clear and has great volume controls but don't expect something like Bose sound to come out of these headphones. I could hear every lyric or word spoken and everyone who I talked to using the mic could hear me so there are zero complaints there. I could turn them up to about half way and drown out the world around me.<br /><br />Number 7 Charging we have already talked about battery life now lets get to charging. So I killed them it took me a week to do it but I killed them dead completely dead and plugged them into the lightening charger that came with and bam before I knew it they were at 100% in about an hour to an hour and a half for how long they last this charging time is awesome.<br /><br />Number 8 All the stuff they come with. So most Bluetooth head sits will come with the device and then will come with a charging cable and that is it. Well these come with different ear pieces to insure comfort, a nice carrying case to put them in, a car charger (yes you heard me right a car charger I was shocked by this myself) and two charging cables.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />I just have one they aren't noise cancelling I cant just put them on and have the world drowned out. I read they were only passive but it was still disappointing but not a 5 star deal breaker.<br /><br />So over all these for the money have been the best thing I have bought in a long time! I am glad that I took a chance on these and cant be more happy with my purchase."
1,"For the price, these are great set of headphones. I bought my set in May of 2017 and ended up buying my boyfriend a set in September 2017 since he kept stealing mine. They fit comfortably and securely while running. They felt sturdy and the sound quality was good.<br /><br />Here's the downside: they didn't last. They don't hold up to sweat and moisture like they say they do. Had to retire mine this weekend (Jan 2018) this was after a slow decline in the sound volume to the point where treadmill noise drown out the music/tv show I was listening to. I run every other day so I may have expected too much out of these but I really liked them.<br /><br />Also, the power button on the side of my boyfriend's set is now sticking. He is going to see if the button of mine can be used to salvage his.<br /><br />I replaced them with a cheaper set which I hated but will use as a back up However, I inevitably broke down and bought the Bose SoundSports."
1,"These are quality headphones,  purchased for my 13 year old super easy to use , great product"
1,Good sound and nice that the BT feature allows for phone calls despite no microphone to speak of...  Mine did come with the wire between each ear piece somewhat bent and therefore will not lie evenly around my neck.
1,They work OK.  But they have a tendency to &#34;cut out&#34; (choppy reception) from time to time even when the source devise is within 10 feet.
1,"Been using these headphones while running for about a month or two now. They pair up with my S7 with no issues. The range seems good. I ran in the rain once and they held up well, but did cut out a few times over the course of 2 hours. My ears are rather small so it was awesome that they include different sized &#34;ear adapters&#34; Not sure what to call them. Battery life has been great. I only wear them in one ear; my left ear seems to not like any ear bud that I've tried so far. These headphones have been a great value."
1,"Love love the fit, sound and design. But only lasted 1 year. Lost sound In 1 bid and wont hold power."
1,"Excellent sound, comfortable and stable in ears and easy setup!  What more could you want?"
1,These are great sounding and stay in place while running.
1,"The sound quality is poor and the headphones keep falling out of my ear while running... The Bluetooth aspect is nice, but overall just another waste of money."
1,"I wish there could be a 4.5 rate.  Everything works perfect in this headphones for a very affordable price. Nice package, very easy to be paired, volume very good, only thing that didn't let me give it 5 stars was that there were rust stain in the micro USB cable. But it's not a big deal who doesn't have a micro USB charger nowadays."
0,"These were great for the week that they worked.  Battery life was as advertised & I went a full week of going to the gym without having to recharge them.  Today they crapped out on me after fully recharging them.  They disconnected from my phone randomly & now they won’t connect all together.  Not sure if the ones I got were defective or not, hopefully the seller will reach out and provide me with a replacement set as They are super comfortable for running with"
1,"One of the best headphones I've ever had. I never liked bud headphones. I always preferred On ear, over ear, or regular headphones. And to be honest I didn't know these were earbuds. If I had known I wouldn't have bought them, however I love my mistake. Give these a try before dismissing them because they are buds, you won't be disappointed. These really are noise cancelling headphones. I wear them while playing basketball and I can't even hear myself dribble the ball. The ear grip keeps them on my head even while sprinting. Not to even mention that you can pause, raise or lower volume, skip and go back songs, and even answer calls and talk! The IPx7 rating is awesome, as I've worn them while in the shower, with no problems. They last a long time, with at least a day and a half battery life. The only &#34;downside&#34; I've found is that they don't push bass that much, but unless you immediately try other headphones after these, you won't notice it. These are a bargain right now with the discount, and if you are considering them you should snatch them up often. I don't write reviews often,  and I only do so when I genuinely feel the product deserves it."
1,There are great headphones compatible with others costing much more
0,"I am planning to return these headphones. They are too heavy for my ears. Tried using them for a day and my ears started hurting.<br />Also, the mic doesn’t seem to work well since most people I tried to talk to couldn’t hear me loud n clear.<br />I expected better with the price I paid for these in comparison to other similar headphones."
1,"I have particularly small ears and always struggle with ear buds no matter the sizes offered. I needed earbuds for cycling and long distance workouts. I also needed Bluetooth because cords pulled my earphones out no matter what. Sound quality was a factor but not first priority...until I got these Senso headphones! Sound is amazing and the Bluetooth range is phenomenal- trying them out, I can walk all over my house without disruption. The headphones stay on well so far but it’s winter so I am only using trainer for rides. For is great so far, though it took some adjusting to make secure. I have high hopes for these headphones! Better than any I have tried and the price makes the trial well with it! Shipping was faster than expected and the case is great size for in my bag & won’t lose them. Extras are fantastic and so appreciated. One charge has lasted three days so far w about 4 hrs of use.<br />Seller was fantastic and easy to order from, packaging was secure and I had nothing but good experience with this Seller and product!"
0,Poorly made.
1,Sound quality is excellent. Easy to use. Would recommend highly.
1,So far the sound and quality of the headphones are amazing. The price along was so great I bought 2!
1,"Amazing sound quality. Comfortable, light, and easy-to-use."
1,sound is great. long change. earbuds fit well. case is a nice touch. great or the cost.
1,These fit fine.  Excellent service in replacing the prior ones which apparently were constructed a little off.
1,These are fantastic headphones!  I was looking for some and didn't want to spend a lot on a set and these came up on sale..  great purchase.  if your looking for some Wireless headphones get these! They come with a nice carrying case
1,They honored the warranty and replaced my headphones quickly when I reported how the volume button kept falling off after 7 months. I would buy these again.
1,The work fine
1,"The sound from the headset is awesome the only draw back for me personally is the silicone ear hooks, l.tipically need a more firm loop so my problem is loops wont stay on which means tje buds far out of my ears while running or working out."
1,"great headphones, decided to try this since the Beats were out of stock and honestly not disappointed. The quality is a bit lower but at almost a 4th of the cost I dont think many of us can complain."
0,Bought them in May and they just quit working in August. Won't charge. Completely dead.
0,"I hate to leave a bad review.<br />The price was great.  But the connection would tick and pop, and get really bad if i was more than 5 feet from the phone.<br />When on phone calls, the other end would complain of a bad echo and amplified background noise.<br />Had no choice but to return them .<br />The return procedure was painless ( Amazon rocks )"
1,"I have yet to try these out at the gym but plan to tomorrow. I'm most certain they will hold up well! When I first got these I was amazed by the sound with it being blue-tooth, but the quality is amazing! They are comfortable and fit my ears perfectly and the battery life is amazing. I took them right out of the box and used them and have yet to still charge them. I plan on getting my wife a pair of these. The only con I can really think of is the blinking light when they're on. Other than that there are no cons. Jump on this deal while you can and enjoy a great pair of ear buds!"
1,"Great product, quick service!"
1,Easy.  Great seller.
0,"Great ear buds , especially for the price , I would have done 5 stars if the cord was longer and also if they would magnify to each other . They are very comfortable in the ear and come with a great carrying case . I would definitely buy again if need be.<br />I’m now on my third different pair and I’m starting to not like these as much as before , parts are literally falling off , my brand new pair that I’ve had for a week but just started using this morning , the loop that goes over the ear literally fell off when I hooked it over my ear. Not a good product like it used to be"
1,I really enjoyed them. I'D ADD MORE Bass tho . Their like tweeters
1,Very nice easy set up. Love the sound quality.
0,"So the good news is that the battery seems to last a long time, I haven't exactly measured how long but they last while I listen to brain.fm for 6 hours at night, about 2 hours of podcast per day and they charge family quickly less than 2 hours.<br /><br />So the bad whenever I go into play a podcast, video, instagram video or headspace a second before the sound comes on I can now hear a slight static sound and now I can hear it over the meditation or podcast and it is driving me insane.<br /><br />So I am looking for a new pair and can not recommend these because of that."
1,Amazing.  We bought 3 more right after using this product.
1,Love them
0,"Update: after some months , they don't work properly. Either they are connected and I can't hear out of them or they cut in and out. Lately they are not working for me and I have to buy a new one.<br /><br />This is my first Bluetooth headphone. Love them, easy to use. fits right on my ear and doesn't fall out. good range. its not complicated and the packaging doesn't have one million gadgets with it. easy to set up.<br /><br />love it<br />thanks"
1,"Great product. Amazing sound for the price point, great battery life. Switches easily between devices. Use every single day for hours at a time and never have any issues with discomfort. When the left speaker started cutting in and out 6 months after purchase I contacted the seller and they reached out to me almost immediately. After a round of troubleshooting they immediately confirmed my address and shipped a replacement pair. A+ customer service. I couldn't be happier with my product and my experience."
0,"I bought these last year for the sole purpose of running/working out. They have been great up until about a couple months ago when they randomly started turning off mid work out and wouldnt reconnect to my phone until about a half hour after. Same thing happened today except they wont even turn on anymore, i push the button and the blue light flashes  but thats it. I have it connected to the charger right now but the lights not turning on. I assume they are dead now. I expected them to last longer than a year."
0,Poor Sound quality comparing to $10 jvc earphones. Still works after 1 year but did not use as often because of sound quality. Connects Bluetooth with no issues.
0,"They worked fairly well but would often just cut in and out for no reason.  They also picked up a lot of wind noise when outside and walking or jogging into the wind.  But today they stopped charging after less than 9 months of use.  Maybe I shouldn't expect much for the price, but at least of year of use is not too much to ask.<br /><br />I also could not pair them to a bluetooth transmitter I bought for my TV.  Apparently they don't support the A2DP profile so I couldn't use them to listen to TV when my wife was trying to sleep."
0,I am not a sound snob but the mids and treble are so bad it sounds like your hearing the music under water. Also did not stay in my ear and fell off even with the ear clip since the clip is very flimsy and offers only token support.
1,They are pretty good but hard to turn down enough. Can be just a little loud.
1,Easy to set up and use. The sound quality is very good!
0,"I purchased this item on May 2.<br /><br />I used it at work and workouts, gentle treatment and about 2 hours per day 5 days per week.  Charging was fine, Bluetooth stayed engaged around 15 feet and through a closed door. Controls were fine after a little time getting used to them.<br /><br />June 22, one of the earbuds broke from the earpiece and is dangling by a single wire.<br /><br />Return window closed on June 1, so I got 7 weeks of use before it broke. I'm an adult, did not treat them roughly at all and probably treated them more gently than average.<br /><br />Very disappointed with the lack of durability.  The simple act of inserting and removing the headphones shouldn't ruin them in 7 weeks.<br /><br />I can not recommend this item, search for something with better durability."
1,Works but falls off the ear more then it should. Sounds great. If recommend them for weight lifters. Running......nahhh
0,Head phones were great at first. I purchased on August 7th I think. I would like a full refund. They will not charge and it's only been 2 months.<br />Disappointed to say the least.
1,"Best feature - Adjustable shape ear loops. The little loops that hook around your ears are adjustable rubber, so you can bend/mold them to your ear/head. Some headphones have stiff loops that point inward and dig into my head a little bit, giving me a headache after a few hours. Not these. Soft rubber loops perfect for any head shape or size.<br /><br />Decent quality sound, battery lasts a long time. Wear them for 8+ hours at work, then the gym afterwards. I charge in my car to/from work, no problems with battery dying on me yet. Takes an hour or 2 to charge to 100%, but I've found that's pretty standard time for these things.<br /><br />They're not noise reducing, but what earbud is? Overall great purchase, will buy again if these ever crap out on me."
1,Love it. My 1st pair had an American accent my new pair has a British accent
0,"I bought a pair of these 6mo ago & I love them, 5stars!!  So I bought a 2nd set as back up. The 2nd set, although they look EXACTLY like the 1st set, purchased from the EXACT same seller.  They're just a cheap and inferior knock off of the set I bought originally.<br />The quality of the material is cheap, my guess is they won't last very long.<br />The sound quality isn't even close the other set.<br />It is very difficult to plug them into a charger. (1st set, very smooth & easy. And works with other chargers)<br />Constantly slip off my head when I'm active ( really annoying) (( 1st set hardly ever slips off))<br /><br />So it seems like Luck of the Draw with this product.  If you get a good one, you'll be happy with it.  If you get a cheapy version, you'll probably return it.  Good Luck!"
0,"Purchased waterproof headphones with 8 hour battery life and 30 feet radius.  Unfortunately, they did not work underwater, less than 10 foot radius and battery lasted less than 40 minutes.  Do not buy."
1,Excellent product worth the money and the fit is excellant
1,very compact package for so many components. I think it is a great gift option to go with.I use this head phone mainly for excercise . The bending strap allow me to adjust the constraint on my ear . So it is more comfortable compared to other headphones
1,"I bought these headphones for my wife as an early birthday gift. She was thrilled when she got them and even more thrilled after using them on a long run and for cleaning around the apartment. She loved using these while cleaning as she could clearly hear her music over the vacuum and didn't have to deal with wires and cords getting tangled up. It was spitting rain for most of her run and they continued to work perfectly. These headphones are comfortable and stayed on/in her ears better than any other headphones she's tried.<br /><br />My wife loves these headphones, we highly recommend. A great birthday buy!"
1,"Headphones mostly work as expected. They do all the things headphones need to do.<br /><br />I have two gripes though. First, when you sync it with your phone or tablet, it sends back battery information, which gets displayed on your phone. Don't trust that number. Mine said 90% until it decided it had low batteries. Then it said 30% until it turned itself off.<br /><br />Second, it said in the manual that you can have it sync to multiple devices at the same time, but can only play from one. This is true. However, some devices apparently play back silence instead of nothing. This causes the audio to be garbled from the device you were trying to listen to and causes it to switch back and forth to each device and beep in your ear when that happens. At first glance, it seems like connectivity issues, but I fixed it by turning off Bluetooth on the device I wasn't using.<br /><br />Also comes with a nice case and a nice box for keeping the charger, manual, extra ear buds, car magnet thing, etc."
1,"If you use the headphone to listen the music,it is soso."
1,Good headphones but can't use them to talk. The person on the other end of calls always hear echo.
1,"Fantastic sound, noise cancelling is excellent, & the fit is great! I can't wait to run with them later today!"
1,Just got them in and used them once. So far they sound great. Looking forward to using them on our long flight to Scottland
1,Good quality product. Glad to have it.
0,These were great while they lasted. Just under a year of use about 3 times per week and they will no longer connect to any Bluetooth device I’ve tried.
1,Clarity in conversation is best and it sits on your ear like it's not even there. Love it
0,"Easy to pair up to is about the only good quality. These have very poor sound quality. They are very muffled and staticky sounding on both ends when using for calls. They aren't noise cancelling like they claim either. You have to stay within 4 feet of your phone or you will lose Bluetooth, I tried with 3 different phones and all had the same results. I guess you get what you pay for, $30 doesn't buy very good headphones. They will work in a pinch."
1,Seem to only get about 9-11 months of use before needing to replace (based on the two pairs I purchased on 6/2017 and 3/2018)
1,"The headphones fit well, sound is great, and they look good."
1,"I was inspired by the abundance of positive reviews and purchased these headphones. They were my first wireless set. Unfortunately, I didn't even get to hear the sound quality, as they simply wouldn't stay put. I'm not talking about the ear buds (there are various bud sizes included), rather the attachment that loops around each ear. There is only one size available, and it is not meant for smaller ears. I couldn't even walk across the room without it sliding off. Additionally, the placement of the on/off/volume controls were on the earpiece, which was awkward. Needless to say, I had to return the unit, and went for the Anker brand ones (which both fit and are fabulous). To the company's credit, the packaging was nice, the unit had numerous accessories and the return process was a breeze. They just weren't the right headphones for me."
1,"Great battery, great sound and they stay on! Absolutely love them! Also pretty great all the extra accessories it comes with! I'm a happy customer!"
1,"Great headphone and good quality!<br /><br />Second comment, I had to send it back as it hurts me because I am wearing a glass. I don't recommend for those who are wearing glasses."
1,"Had these for a week, will change my review if I becomes necessary in the future. Until then, these work great! I live in a townhouse, so after syncing them with my phone, I listened to music while upstairs (phone downstairs) and it was fantastic. The real test will come at the gym, until then I give 5 stars. Also, I didn't know, but you can't sync them while charging."
0,"Worked for a little while (maybe 1 week?) then died and wouldn't take a charge. After that, nothing I could do would get them to start."
1,"I'm pleased with the product, thus far I haven't had the chance to use them in their full capacity I just kind of charged them & made sure they were working & tested the features but I bought them for running"
1,Exelent sound. If I knew it I would buy it as a first and did not rely on some others brands.And good for running. Keeps well in your ears.
1,"It’s unbelievable headphones by this price !!!<br />I can’t believe that , amazing battery life , bass and amazing noise cancellation,, I’m so excited with it"
1,Nice fit for hard to fit ears.  Many ear buds are painful to my ears and these fit and sound very well.
1,Better than my power beats 3...I'm done paying for a NAME....
1,"LIght weight, comfortable. Easy sync with my android phone. However, does not sync with my pc at work. I have a plug in unit to make the computer blue tooth and works with jaw bone conducting headset, but not with these. I have not tried it with my laptop which has an internal bluetooth system. But, I do like these for the gym, for sure. The rubber is soft and very flexible."
0,These were great and all as other reviews have said except mine make this high pitched buzzing sound in the left ear bud while they are turned on. It took me a while before I noticed it but now I can't forget about it.
0,"If you have small ears, do not buy these. I ordered these headphones because the reviews stated that they had good sound quality and fit great. The sound quality is not bad, but the fit is terrible. I couldn't get them to fit my ears, so I opted to return the product, only to find that they charged me almost $8 in shipping to return the item. I was very disappointed."
1,Can't go wrong at this price point.  Only word of caution is adjustable over ear component can be a bit finicky.
1,gift for my wife. So glad you included the different sized ear cushions .
1,as much I use Senso headphone that much love it.  it is good product but somewhat it is not waterproof it is water-resistant. it is enough water-resistant to use in any sweat or sport above the ground.
0,Really bad bluetooth connection.
1,Excellent quality sound and also came with a perfect case and a dozen replacement earbuds.
1,"I have had these headphones for about 10 months. I use them for running about 4 times per week. They seem to work for about 10 hours before needing to be charged. They charge quickly. While running they stay in my ears fairly well, with minimal adjustment compared to other pairs of headphones."
1,I bought this set to have something to use when cutting grass and plane trips. Has good sound but does sound muffled at times.  This set tends to disconnect and reconnect from Bluetooth which can be frustrating but turning the headset off and back on again after the initial connection more often than not fixes the issue for the rest of the listening session.  Not sure why it can't stay connected the first time.  I have experienced this issue on several devices and many different environments. The battery life is very good an I get several uses out of it before recharging it.
1,Awesome sound and comfort
1,I recently received two other pairs of Bluetooth headphones. Tje SENSO headphones are the only ones I will use. Upon first use I didn't have to adjust or press them back into place during a 2 hour work out. My ears did not hurt on the inside or outside when I was finished and the sound quality was beyond anything I have used before.
1,love it!!!!!!
1,Fantastic value for great sound and battery life.
1,Received them a few days ago. They are awesome. Same sound quality as Beats
1,This was a great product I used this everyday now when riding my e bicycle the sound quality was good for the price
1,Great Product; Fit comfortably; Good Sound; Very reasonably priced!!
1,"I purchased these days before leaving on an extended overseas trip. I received them and left 5 days later.  My initial impression is that they came well packaged and seemed solidly built. The sound was amazing for headphones at this price point- they sound like they cost considerably more. Very strong on the bass so if you don't like bass then they may not be for you. A huge improvement/upgrade the Apple buds that came with iPhone 7 plus. I used them on a 12 hour flight and battery life is at least 6-7 hours - maybe 8. They are easy to recharge. They fit my ears well but the part that fits around the ear is very flexible so I'm not sure how they would work out for jogging/physical activity etc. I will leave that to others. For everything else they are good. The noise cancelling may not be as good as over the ear pieces but they did minimize the screams of a young child on a long flight. I would rate them very good for headphones of this type.<br />At some point during one of the flights the Bluetooth disconnected while I was sleeping and I couldn't get it to pair with either iPhone or iPad. I had left the guide at home. When we landed I emailed Senso from a time zone 15 hours ahead of them. I got an almost immediate response with very clear directions on how to re-pair and. PDF of the guide. The directions worked and the headphones have worked great since. They have also sent a follow up email to make sure. I call that great customer service.<br /><br />Overall, very pleased so far - I will update."
1,"Love these headphones. Sound is great, mic is clear, battery life is great, they don't fall out of my ear...<br />Without a doubt the best blue tooth headphones I've gotten so far. Great value!"
0,Had headphones for a week used at gym and think there great<br />now it's three mouths and there dead . won't charge or turn on
1,I received the box sometime. Great Packaging. Not a lot of waste and no plastic to have to cut through. After opening the box I found everything that was supposed to be included. Not quite sure what the longer cord is used for as it seems that it is useless with the device as there's nowhere to plug that cord into the device for charging purposes. The device seems to work as stated. I think possibly the cord could be just a slightly bit longer as I did notice while biking and turning to look left and right the court would seem to need to be a bit longer so as to not bind and pull the plugs from the ears. I think it might help to have the multi-purpose button raised a bit which makes it easier to find. I may need to play with the ear inserts as the sound was not nearly as nice or loud while biking as my wired set of earbuds I have been using. Wind noise was a major factor when biking using these earbuds. Would have received five stars had the sound been better.
1,"I just got these today so my opinion might change after a while but my first response is wow! The sound on these is really good especially the bass. If you want some boomin bass these are the headphones for you! Another thing that I loved about these headphones is that they came fully charged. I love when wireless stuff comes already charged so I can use it right away. That was a huge plus for me! They cancelled out noise pretty well. I could barely hear my dogs barking over the music. They were super easy to pair up with my phone and fit really could comfortably. I like that it came with a car charger, a carrying case, and (this was weird but cool) an iPhone lightning charger. I wasn't expecting all of that! Overall these headphones are awesome and are a great deal."
0,These headphones got water damage from sweat within the first week I owned them.
1,"These are great.  Awesome sound quality, cheap price, and really comfortable.  Call quality is good (not great) but gets the job done"
1,A+ Great Product
1,LOVE them the noise cancelling  feature is the best and make for very clear phone calls on botrh ends of the call not to mention the crystal clear sound of the music! Very happy with my purchase!
0,"These Headphones sound great! The problem is that this is my second set and both sets just around the 3-month period stop pairing. And the reset program stops working also. My wife also purchased a set when I got my first set and her's also stopped working around that same time. so, if you like great sound for a couple of months and have no problem throwing them away at that point these are for you."
1,I Love It. they are great when I am doing my workout and the best is that they don't fall up
1,I really liked the set I bought and reluctantly gave it to my son after he asked me for a set.  I recommend this product as it has very good sound.  The two cons are the battery does not last long and the little rubber cover where you plug it to charge wore very fast.
1,"I've had these for a few months now and I love them. They are not as good a noise blocking as some others I have had but they sound great and are convenient. I have to turn the volume up a little more than I like when mowing the lawn but other than that they are perfect. I love them for my workouts on the exercise bike. When I put on other headphones I miss the quality of the sound these offer, that is saying something when it comes to bluetooth headphones."
0,"For the price, I was expecting a lot better. They do not stay in your ear when exercising at all. the part meant to go behind your ear is extremely flimsy. It does have nice accessories but other than that, stay away from these."
1,"I've had these since June 2017. I use them at the gym. They pair easily w/my Android phone. The sound is good, and loud when I want them to be. The foam earbuds part of these get grotty pretty fast. This is my only complaint. Sweat is not kind. I've tried soaking the foam buds in warm water with dish soap to clean them. It would be good if you could get replacement foam thingies for them. Oh....and they fit well over in my ears and are comfortable. Your mileage may vary"
1,Does it’s job but does not cancel noise at all.
0,"I have tiny ears and everything falls out. I had read online these were great for small ears, but they were too painful."
1,"First pair of Bluetooth buds I've ever bought. They're comfortable, sound great, and if you've never used wireless buds before, you'll never want to go back. The battery life is about eight hours of constant use - enough to get you through your work day. At $40, these are certainly a worthwhile investment."
1,Sound is great but they don't stay in my ears. Tried all 3 sizes of the plastic parts and none of them stay in my ear while running and thats when I use them the most.
1,Very good headset and good sound quality. I've used them for working out at the gym to snowboarding on mountains and still have no problem with them.
1,highly recommend - sound is great; fit is strong for all activities; can't beat the value
1,"I’m a finish carpenter. When other trades are on the job site, I generally have to listen to their taste in music.NO more......I purchased this headphone set and found a new world. Thank you Senso for a comfortable ( even with glasses) headset. Such a rich, complete sound and the ability to listen to MY music.........."
1,These headphones are great. They easily connect to my iPhone and they stay put when I am running. The cord that runs behind my neck is awesome in keeping it out of the way while I work out. Great product!
0,These stopped working in less than a month.
1,"These headphones are simply awesome, Perfectly fulfills my needs - Sweat proof, Solid battery, No noise, Good Quality, Fits perfectly (most of the other earphones i tried, starts to hurt my ears after a while, these doesn't). Most importantly, allows me to answer calls and also make calls(recent dial). I would definitely suggest SENSO in this price range."
1,"These are great.  The sound is fantastic and they stay really well on my ears.  I haven't used them for running yet, but I layed pavers down in my yard with these on and they never slipped, no matter how sweaty I was.  Highly recommended!"
1,"Fair for the price. It connected easily, charged quickly, and has decent sound (I'm not a sound expert). It doesn't stay on my ears as well as expected, and falls off more on the right side - is that my ear, or the product? Annoying either way. Still, wireless ear buds for under $30, with zero technical issues, is a win."
1,Perfect
1,"These have very good battery life (6hours+ of consistent use per charge). The sound is good, they connect easy and they lasted me over 8 months until I lost them haha. I'd say they were worth the money. I'm ordering my replacement pair now :)"
1,These headphones are awesome.  The quality of sound is equally matched by their comfort. I experienced a minor glitch with them and customer service was on top of it right away.  I would buy anything from this company knowing they back up their product with quality service.
1,Work Great at a fraction of the cost of Beats.
0,I'm not sure why the reviews are so high on this product. The earbuds stopped syncing to my iPhone 7 after one week. I have tried resetting the earbuds and they still won't sync. Don't waste your money on this product.
1,"Good sound, comfortable. I liked all the extras, including the carry case and the charging cords. Good value for the money."
1,I bought a second pair for my friend. These are great.
1,Great blue-tooth headphones at an affordable price
1,Love them!!  They work great!!  Sound is great!  Price is great!  Last but not least the syncing was so very easy!!  Worked the very first time!! Comes with a great little case!!
1,Awesome headphones and in a great price
1,these headphones are great I started running a lot and they stay in my ears very well. they do not have as good of base as the beats do but in my opinion they are way more worth the buy. they are a lot cheaper than the beats and are just as good in almost every way 10/10 would buy again.
1,"Bought a pair for myself and thought they met the mark for an introductory pair of Bluetooth headphones, so I bought a second pair to give as a gift. The sound quality is very good and the battery works for a long time, but it is impossible to un-kink the strap after you take them out of the box- it is also a little too long and can get caught in your shirt/ponytail. For a relatively inexpensive pair of headphones, these work quite well- just know what you're paying for!"
1,"I was very happy when I got them initially thought the sound was great. But as time has gone on the sound doesn't seem as crisp.  I stream amazon prime music and at times the sound is fuzzy and I switch to my apple earbuds and the sound is fine. Not sure what's going on there. Bluetooth phone calls are fine. Not sure I'm keeping them, for the price point this may be what you get. I have the smallest earbuds on and after several hours my ears hurt😕"
1,Great product and customer service.
1,"bought 2 pairs 1 for my 18 year old son and 1 for me, love them good sound easy to use and comfortable. I have small ears so had to pull my ear lobe a bit, but then they fit great. well worth the money!"
1,"The wire seems too stiff, but good sound and add on items"
0,So this is what $30 bluetooth headphones sound like. Well then I guess I got what I deserve. Will teach me to try to save money on not spend $159. Now I have to spend that and the $30 I spent on these.
1,"Good fit. Tubes stay on the device and do not fall out, as they did for my previous headphones. Sound is very good, with good bass. Rubber ear hooks are comfortable though a little on the loose and wiggly side."
1,excellent
1,excellent quality and remarkable performance at a great price.
1,Excellent! Battery charge lasts soooooo long!<br />Amazing customer service that replaced with ease.
1,My husband loves them
1,Sound quality is great! And the battery last a long time.
1,"I got these today, but I love them already!! I just returned back other brand, but these are awesome! Great sound! (I am very picky). I just hope it stays that way! I also love how comfortable the rubber is over the ears!"
1,works better then my old beats headphones even the distances works better but the only thing is the little tab that covers the charging port can be tricky to remove when needed to charge and gets frustrating. overall i cant complain especially for the price.
1,"I didn't receive the whole items as stated in the description but I was reached out by SENSO support and promised me to deliver the missing items, they were very nice. I will update when I receive the items."
1,Love this headphones! Had a pair of Beats before but I love these better! Sound is great and they stay on my ears! Plus you get more accessories in the box included in the price! Great value and quality for the money!
1,"When I told my husband how little I paid for this product his reply was..&#34;Oh...probably will not be that great a quality for that price.&#34; I happily told him he was wrong. I am so satisfied with how it charges so quickly, how it was easy to use with my android and my Kindle....love the pause button...and it is very comfortable to the ears."
1,"Been using these for a few weeks now and love them! Great noise cancellation, very comfortable and they stay in place throughout my workout."
1,"Let me start by clarifying that these perform much better than expected. The charge lasts as long as advertised and charges faster than expected. The sound is terrific and the mic is also TOO good (picks up ambient sounds).<br /><br />The only issue, and ultimately the reason I need to buds is that the shape really hurts my ear. That's not a defect for these buds, though, it's because I have pretty big ears and that just aren't shaped well for these buds. I wish it wasn't the case, but I am finally looking for a new pair after having to stop using them today.<br /><br />They are amazingly secure, though. I've never once had them fall out, regardless of what I was doing.<br /><br />This is ultimately my fault because I should have returned them. Amazon is notoriously great when it comes to returns. I thought I'd break them in, but they are just too well made and don't warp or mold at all."
1,"Awesome Bluetooth head phones. After I bought mine, I purchased another pair for my wife. Would recommend this product to anyone."
1,These are truly great headphones. The battery keeps very well ( I've been using them for about 20 hours total and have only lost about 25% of the battery. The noise cancelling works very well. They stay in the ear even when violently shaking my head. Overall they are great for the price.
1,"This ear buds work excellent in my home but when I get in my gym they get so choppy, I guess interference and they are unusable for the poupose. I have seen other members using wireless earbuds in the gym and they seem to be ok but I will survive, I guess this is not the vendors fault but my investment did not pay off"
1,"These are about as good as you can expect at this price point. I've never owned high-end bluetooth ear buds, but these sound good to me, and I learned an important lesson. My first pair (I received them as a gift) lasted about 1 year and then a short developed in the wire where it connected to the left ear. It occurred to me that this could happen to any brand when you throw this into the gym bag and cary them around unprotected. But even if you put them into their case every time, you're still folding and bending that wire. So it seems like more expensive brands would be subject to this and therefore a waste of money. I purchased a second pair and they are working fine still. I recommend these."
1,I love this head phones. An awkward fit at first but they really do work well. I will update my review after my first run. I was able to seemlessly connect to my iPad then iPhone. Make calls. Love them.
1,After a week of daily use I have to say that Senso's headphones are good quality. The battery life is decent and the sound quality is great. I'm considering getting another set as a gift for my father for his runs.
1,The product can have a stronger ear support
1,Good
1,Wonderful and worth the buy!
0,I was disappointed with the sound quality on these and find them difficult to pair with my device (didn't come with instructions). I would NOT buy this again and am seriously considering returning them due to the low quality sound.
1,"Great sound quality. Comparable to my more expensive Beats. Silicone feels comfortable around my ears doesn't irritate at all. Glad that it came with smaller size earbuds as the stock ones were too big to fit in my ear without falling out. Overall, a great pair of headphones so far and the extras are a nice touch."
1,"Updated 22/09/2017<br /><br />I had received a defective headphone set and was contacted after writing this review asking me to get in touch with tech support. Their response was fast and after confirming my order details they sent a replacement.  I received it 3-5 days later, which was quick!<br /><br />After receiving my replacement, I am pleased to say this is what I expected. The port closes tightly and securely this time and the sound is CRISP! I would definitely purchase other items from this company in the future.<br /><br />** Therefore I'm changing it to a 5 star review **<br /><br />***********<br />I've seen good reviews about this headphone, but I'm completely disappointed!<br /><br />The sound is much louder than normal headphones, which is a plus.<br /><br />However, the quality of the sound is not great! It is completely muffled, bass is weak and flat.  I've had better success with non Hi-Fi headphones!<br />I noticed the difference when I first used it and I plugged in my regular headphone which connects via headphone jack, that is Hi-Fi, and the difference is night and day.<br /><br />It says it's waterproof, but the charging port cover doesn't even close properly.<br /><br />The plus of this, it brings a lot of accessories and it is light weight!"
1,I am one of the unfortunate people who cannot wear earbuds for and extended period of time because they make my ears hurt. As a result I resolved never to purchase buds again. While deployed in Afghanistan I saw Senso were being offered at a reduced price and saw that numerous people that had the same problem as me were giving these headphones high marks. I decided to give them a shot and I am glad I did. They have a clear sound with great bass. The battery life is as advertised.  I am very pleased with the product and would recommend these to anyone looking for a wireless headphone.
1,I bought this product on November they were great In all the ways but for some reason two weeks ago they started to turn off by them selves every two minutes so stop using them. What to get them repair or replace?
0,The earphones are comfortable and have reasonable sound quality when listening to the spoken word.  With infrequent use the right earphone stopped working after 18 months. I will look for a longer lasting product.
1,"I bought these to replace a much more expensive set that died after 3 years of almost daily use... In the few days I waited for these to arrive, I borrowed my wife's mid-price set of wireless headphones and they were terrible... no bass, poor fit...<br />I was glad when my SENSO headphones arrived but frankly, I didn't have very high expectations for these as they are $125 less expensive than my last pair... after a week of daily use, I am very impressed by the sound quality.  They charge quickly and are quite comfortable to wear. The controls are backwards from what I am used to... the &#34;back button&#34; increases volume and advances tracks... the &#34;front button&#34; lowers the volume and goes back a track. They paired quickly with my Galaxy S7 and continue to connect quickly when turned on. Don't let the low price scare you off.... you won't be disappointed with these."
1,"Senso is an AMAZING company.  They make an incredible product, go over and beyond with customer service support, and throw in extra gifts.  And the price of this wonderful product is so reasonable!  Thank you so much, Senso!"
1,These are awesome they work great and cost way less than the big name brands but they are just as good in quality
1,Best headphones ever! Ran a 5K with them today and had no problems. They also connect well with my Apple Watch!
1,Highly Recommend
1,"Sounds way better than I thought they would for the price. Great bass and can go very loud. Never had any connectivity issues. Plus the company gives you a one year warranty. I do wish the ear hooks were a bit firmer as sometimes they started to slide/get pulled down as I move around. I would be glad to buy these again<br /><br />EDIT: Currently 9 months into using these almost daily. Never had any problems up until a few days ago when the left earbud stopped working. I contacted support and they responded faster than any support I've ever received. They were helpful, efficient, and when it came to it they were happy to replace them for me. I'm more than happy with this product and company"
1,Bought these as a gift for my friend who works outside and from his truck - he is so pleased with the quality of these wireless earbuds. He is no longer getting tangled up in the wires from his previous buds and the sound quality is exceptional.
1,Sound quality is great.
1,"Great product, great service! Highly recommend"
1,"They are comfortable and a great value, but could use a little more bass"
1,"Pairs with several devices. car stereo, smart phone, PC. all seem to work well"
1,Use them every day
1,Perform exactly as advertised
1,"The perfect headphones, it was so worth it"
1,Headphones are great except one thing.  At very low bass audio there is some audio distortion.  It's not terribly bad and most sounds from shows never hit that low bass range but it can be annoying.  Could just be I got a bad one also.
1,Great item. Bought for Father's Day on prime and works well.
1,Great  sound quality
0,"I want to like these headphones, they work well when they work but they don't last. 🙁 My first pair stopped charging after 6 months, my second pair has started frequently disconnecting from my phone."
1,These are my first wireless headphones. They really are sweat proof. The headphones really do stay in place while running. Highly recommend to buy these!
1,"I think it's decent sound, but with good battery and enough fit my ears. And the big issue is quality of mic - unfortunately, person is on the other site doesn't hear me at all :("
1,"The headphones have good sound quality and nice design, their customer services are very helpful and their responsiveness is very fast. I had an issue with my headphones and they replaced it for me immediately."
1,"These do exactly what I wanted them for, listening to the television later at night. Once paired they stay paired very well. I tried disconnecting them from the tv Transmitter to use with my phone but could not accomplish the task. Maybe that could be highlighted in the next instructions that Senso prints out. However I have no repairing issues. These are connected!"
1,Sucks that you can't use it while charging.
1,Nice!
1,"It is a good solid headset compared to other products in the market. The buttons are easy to access and works well. My only complain is that the microphone doesn't work well so if you expect to receive and make phone calls, this is not the product for you."
0,"Purchased this as a birthday gift, and they did not get the bonus magnetic clip or cell phone holder as shown in picture in the box.  Can bonus items be sent??"
0,Disappointed in the quality. Broke after about 2 months of use. The side popped out and the audio stopped working in one ear.
1,JUST RECEIVED THESE AND LOVE THEM!!
1,great sound for small lilghtweight buds
1,"The sound quality and all was great! Problem I have, is the part that wraps around your ear is so long, that it will not stay on my ears! Nor my friends. And when I lay back on the bench, it just falls off. Possibly I got a defective pair? I am not sure"
1,"These are my first pair of Bluetooth headphones so I am not sure how these compare to others, but they are amazing. Great audio, easy to make phone calls and the set up was simple. I went about three weeks of daily use before having to charge them. Highly recommend!"
0,Purchased one pair that lasted about 6 months before any issues. The headphones started having connection difficulties at a very close range. Contacted customer support who sent out a replacement within a couple weeks. The replacement broke within the first month. The device would not properly power on. I contacted customer support again and they had a much longer process so I declined to get them replaced as I didn't want to wait the time without headphones only to receive a pair that breaks again.
1,"I cant get them to stay on properly.  My daughter loves hers, that why I bought them.  Just not for me!"
1,Outstanding headphones...  great sound and battery life is excellent.
1,Sounds great but so far limited connection as battery powers lowers. On first charge ran about 3 hours maybe will get better as charges increase
1,Excellent pair of headphones.
1,I was skeptical about these since they are so cheap but I was pleasantly surprised. Sound quality pretty good and I can go a long time without having to charge them.
1,"I bought these based on the price point and reviews.  I used them during my runs, yard work and listening to my favorite music.  Sound quality is great.  I liked these so much I bought them as gifts too."
1,"I waited a month before I posted a review, because I want to test the headphones.  I have to say they have been great.  I use them primarily for working out and they have performed as well as my old Beats.  In fact, my old Beats had issues after 11 months.  I got them replaced and that pair went bad after six months.  This is a great deal.  The constant repeat of &#34;battery low&#34; every minute or so (when its low) is a little annoying but a small price to pay.  The company also offers warranty on these, so they are willing to work with you if an issue does come up."
0,"This is my third pair of inexpensive Bluetooth headphones over the past couple of years. While functional, they are definitely the worst ones I have purchased. They are comparatively heavy and bulky. They slip out after jogging a couple of miles. Once I start sweating the speaker gets blocked with sweat and I can’t hear anything until they dry out a day later. They are no good on the bike because their profile creates a lot of wind noise."
0,"These were great while they lasted. The sound was great, fit was fine and I was impressed with all the accessories that came with these. However I bought them in mid December and at just a bit over two months now in February they have completely died. Literally just died which is why I'm writing this review because I loved these so much and am annoyed. I was listening to music when suddenly the music stopped, there was a sizzle sound and then silence. I plugged them into the charger and no lights or anything. I'll contact customer support but if you're thinking about buying these cross your fingers you get a good pair that wont die."
0,"Their customer service is HORRIBLE! Reason for my rating. On a good note, the earphones are great. The quality of the sound is great especially for the price. Comfortable and nice looking."
1,fast shipping. thank you. Love this item. They work great..
1,"Decent sound, easy to set up and use, comfortable with different sized earbuds for all ear sizes. I would definitely recommend for the price."
1,They are awesome very Happy!!
1,Just received them but so far I love them.  Very comfortable and the sound is pretty good as well.  Love the 1 year warranty as well!
1,"I used to have the Powerbeats and then they got misplaced and lost. I've been looking for a new pair of Bluetooth wireless ear buds and these had good reviews. So far, I've been super impressed with them! They come with a short and long charging cord and a car charging USB port which is SO nice! The sound quality is great and the charge has lasted me about 3 - hour long workouts so far and possibly longer. I'm super happy I got these instead of breaking the bank to buy the Powerbeats!"
1,"First, let me comment about the seller and then I'll discuss the headphones.  These folks are amazing.  I assume the seller is a small company, and they are truly on top of taking care of their customers.  I've had two issues with the headphones (I'll discuss in the product review below).  The first time, I emailed the seller on a Friday evening around 6pm.  I assumed I'd hear from them the following Monday after the weekend.  I was wrong.  They wrote me back at 8:30 that same evening.  They were able to fix my problem via emails and I was able to use the headphones that same evening.  The second time I had a problem I emailed them again.  It was on a Sunday at 5:42 p.m.  They wrote me back that same evening.  This time they weren't able to resolve my issue but promised to send me replacement headphones.  I received them two days later - on Tuesday.  That's incredible customer service, and these guys deserve five stars just for their dedication and responsiveness.<br /><br />Now on to the headphones review.  I'm a runner and I bought these specifically to use while running.  I haven't used them for telephone calls or any other purpose, so these comments are completely geared toward using these headphones to listen to music while exercising and running.  I've been using them for a little over a month.  First, the sound quality.  For the price ($37), I think they sound pretty good. I was a musician in a past life, and there are definitely headphones out there that sound better.  These are by no means &#34;studio quality,&#34; but they sound very good.  Some folks on here complained about the bass being a bit heavy, but I kind of like it.  I've used other headphones that have virtually no bass and sound very metallic.  These headphones are pretty well balanced.  And, as others have mentioned, you can download an equalizer app if you really want to dial them in and EQ down the bass.  But I think they sound more than good the way they are.  You won't get audiophile sound for $37 and if that's your goal, you're shopping down the wrong aisle.<br /><br />You can nitpick little things all you want with any product purchase, but for $37 and all the included features, these headphones are very decent and deserve all the great reviews.  For running, I wanted headphones that were &#34;sweatproof,&#34; wireless, loud and that would stay put in my ears while running.  These headphones are all those things.  With the hook design for the ears, they rarely move around in my ears, and I've had no issues with them having to be adjusted.  The wireless is great, and I've never had an issue with them connecting to my Samsung Galaxy S8 +.  They are also plenty loud.<br /><br />To alleviate and fears of those contemplating making this purchase, I'll address some of the complaints I've seen in other reviews.  Some mentioned that the power button is awkwardly placed in the middle of the right ear headphone and can get pushed accidentally while adjusting the headphone. This is true.  However, it seriously only took me maybe one outing to adjust to the power button placement, and it hasn't bothered me since.  Others think the ear hooks aren't comfortable - I think they're fine.  If you're going running, the hooks are awesome.  These headphones stay put and don't move around - all because of the hooks.  I used some other &#34;hookless&#34; headphones while running the other day, and every two minutes I had to adjust them - big pain in the butt.  I've also read some complaints about the wire sticking to your neck.  That did bother me the first few runs.  I don't think this problem is unique to these headphones.  I think any similar &#34;wireless&#34; headphones will have one wire between right and left sides and that wire has to be routed.  Regardless, I figured out to simply run the wire over the top of my head.  Since I always wear a hat when I run, the wire is now under my hat and not on my neck.  If you're not wearing a hat, I also think using some Body Glide or other similar product on the wire would solve the problem.  Lastly, battery life - very acceptable as far as I'm concerned.  I almost always charge them fully before I leave the house, and I've never had an issue.  They charge very quickly, so I keep them charged.  I know I can't outrun the battery on these, and that's good enough for me.  Other folks might be concerned whether these headphones will die after eight hours or after nine hours.  I will never run long enough in one outing to find that out, so not an issue for me.<br /><br />Lastly, let me mention the specific problems I have experienced with these headphone.  The first time I contacted the company, it was because sound was only coming out of the left side.  They suggested I perform a &#34;factory reset,&#34; which apparently can cure a number of oddities.  Sure enough, the factory reset fixed my sound problem and all was good.  So... if you're having any weird issues with your headphones, go for the factory reset first.  It's simple to do: (1) Power them off and plug the headphones in so they are charging; (2)  While charging, hold the power button down for seven seconds.  And that's it; factory reset accomplished.<br /><br />The most recent problem I had with the headphones was the same issue - no sound coming from the right side.  Factory resets didn't fix the problem.  Interestingly, last night I was playing with them and now they work again.  And this morning, the replacements arrived from my Sunday email.  So I now have two functioning sets.  I can't comment on the longevity of these headphones as I've only had them for a little over a month, but I can say that the company takes their customer service very seriously.  You can rest assured that the one year warranty is not a gimmick.  Everything breaks at some point.  At least you know you can count on these guys to make things right and not leave you high and dry.  That's good enough for me."
1,"These are excellent, inexpensive bluetooth earbuds.  I use them at the gym and work out very hard.  They haven't failed me.  They provide clear, crisp sound.  I can hear everything being said on my iPad even over the noise of the background music and machines being used.  I highly recommend them."
1,I love these headphones. Sound quality is way better than I expected. I can use them 4 or 5 times at the gym before recharging.
1,"Great price and great sound. They have stayed in my ears mostly. I had purchased a pair of sudio wireless earbuds prior to purchasing these and was very disappointed with the price and the fact that they kept falling out of my ears. I like to run and they have worked decent enough while working out at the gym. I would recommend these for the price, they have been much better overall. I have been impressed, better than expected. 👍🏼<br />Only things I didn't like were the bulky feeling sticking out of ear eventhougn, they have stayed in the ear for the most part. The color selection of only one to choose from. It would be nice to have something a little more of girly to choose from. The last thing is connectivity. Gotta keep your phone close. The connection is slightly choppy when leaving the phone in another room. I don't have a problem with that but if you wanna leave your phone in locker at the gym, these may not suit you. B+ 👍🏼"
1,Exactly the kind of Bluetooth ear buds I needed
1,"Not gonna lie this headset is outstanding, sound quality is crisp with a good amout of base. The pieces thay wrap aroubd the ear alittle yo big sl they dont hug the ear  that well.other than that use for the gym perfect and i really enjoy them. Oh and they come witb. Charging cord, more earbuds,dual car charging port, and also a carrying case."
1,Sound and fit are great.Battery life is a full work day for me.I am in construction and the length of the cord from ear to ear is a bit too long and gets stuck on my kneck and pull the ear buds out...I tried taping them up a bit to shorten but that didnt help....I just where the cable in front of me instead of on the back of the neck...
1,Gift for my son-he says great sound and noise blocking
1,I received your product along with 3 of your competitors and tried them all and found that your product was a clear winner in sound quality and comfort for my application.<br />Battery life was also a factor.......<br />I needed an ear bud that would be great in a wind situation that would allow me to hear and not lose them while in movement.<br />The assortment of buds for the ear was crucial in this working and you folks have shown me that quality is not always dictated by price.<br />Other more pricey products were returned and you folks came out the clear winner.<br />Keep doing what you are doing and the consumers will recommend you as I will to others.<br />I will be a return customer as well!<br />Regards William Bell
1,"The headphones seem to work fine. My biggest gripe is that they come with the round inserts which bother my ears. I'd prefer the flatter ones with the slight hook to ensure they stay in and don't irritate me. The sound seems okay and they were easy to sync with my phone. I have yet to try to sync them with a 2nd device, I'll try that and will update my review."
1,"So, I've tried a number of Bluetooth Headphones. I have one pair I have kept, but it's one of them around the neck loops with earbuds on wires. Those work fine, but they only work with my phone. They do not pair with my PC nor do they pair with my laptop nor do they pair with my iPod.<br /><br />I had tried (and returned) two other headphones, one of which was another model with ears loops (very uncomfortable) and one was a cuffed pair (awful sound).<br /><br />I tried the SENSO because they were on a Flash sale (their regular price is higher than I wanted to risk on seeing if I could get something that works). I had little hope for them and figured I would eat the cost (Amazon offers returns, but then I'm out $12+ and I have nothing to show for it).<br /><br />I wish I had bought two pairs of these. They are well-constructed, have great sound, are comfortable to wear and easy to work. I've only had them a few days, but - again - I wish I had bought two pairs.<br /><br />I am not paid for this review, nor did I receive one of them complimentary products in exchange for a review. I bought these, paid for them with my own money, and I kept them. They have paired and connected with everything I own (Windows 10 PC, Chromebook, iPod Touch, Samsung Note). I wear them at the gym and unlike my regular earbuds, I don't have to keep adjusting them and pushing them back on my ear. I wear them at home so I can listen to music without disturbing the neighbors.<br /><br />I like them. I would buy them again. Definitively on sale, but if I had to replace mine, I would pay full price for them."
1,These are the Best Buy by far these head phone definitely recommended good buy I love them
0,"The product is clearly becoming more and more cheap. I've bought this product 4 times now as it's either been lost or I've wanted a spare set and as time as progressed, it's clearly become cheaper and more chinese. At this point, I wish I went with a competitor rather than this brand, the product should IMPROVE over time, not degrade, what a waste."
1,"We have had several sets of these, and just worn them out. We always replace them with the same ones!"
1,sound is decent & i did not have any trouble connecting to bluetooth switching from device to device. i would buy again
1,These earbuds work very well. comfortable.
1,"Let me just say a few things, so I bought these because I've always wanted a pair of bluetooth earphones, and my wired beats earphones stopped working which didn't have a warranty on it so I was a little bummed. I found these earphones for a good price, and I got them in such a quick manner with the free shipping option. Customer service was incredible and they wouldn't stop bothering me asking me if I was satisfied.<br /><br />1. Quality of Earphones: Great quality. Is more accented on the bass side, but doesn't take away from treble and other parts of the music so I can listen to just about anything with amazing quality. I usually listen to a lot of hip-hop while working out so this works out for me perfectly. If you like any other kind of music, it's still great because it also lets you hear some of the background sounds in your music for the full effect.They also stay in my ear very well. Any kind of earphones typically have a problem staying in my ear with the way it is shaped, but these make sure that they don't fall off no matter how you treat them. Pairing is really easy and the earphones are portable.<br /><br />2. Service: Just amazing. They were so friendly, and they included these bonus items with the earphones. If you were to buy all of these items separately plus the earphones, it would probably add up to about $70. They make sure that you have the best experience possible with these things."
1,solid pair of headphones and they stay in your ear very well
1,Running and for kids.
1,"Really good pair. The only thing is look online to get extra fome buds, since these can deteriorate a bit quick."
1,I ordered these for myself.  Old school I guess but tired of having to charge it and just bought a different connection to hook up earphones to my iPhone.  No need to charge anything.  So I gave these away as a gift to a friend.  He loves them but when I talk to him while he is on them I hear myself 'repeating'  through the phone which is annoying.  Maybe he has his volume up to loud.  But he likes them!
1,"Great packaging, comes with car charging port, which is a plus. I have small ears, so I usually have a problem with headphones staying in my ears. These fit nice and snug! Came fully charged, too. Easy setup. Have not gone on a long jog with them yet, but they are warranted so I am confident they will hold up. Definitely recommend to anyone who listens to music while they run."
0,They were great at the beginning but stopped charging after 1yr.
1,"I really like the design and feel of the headphones. They work well for my job as I'm outside quite a bit. I do wish the sound was less bassy from the factory, but it's mostly fixable by adjusting the EQ on whatever device and app you're using. Overall, I like and would recommend them."
1,"I am in love with my new hands-free solution. I am a realtor and on the go constantly. I need my hands free. Past headsets have made hearing difficult. Not the case with these!!! I can hear clearly and feel like I have so much more control over the volume settings than with other wireless headsets. I need to hear directions my mapping is feeding me, so clarity is important. Having a super solution for listening to music at the same time has been an extra added value to me. Great product worth every dime of the purchase price!!! I would guess this would be an excellent set for working out, but haven't used them for that yet....going to though!!!! ** This product was received at no cost for review and inspection purposes. No compensation for a positive review was provided. All of my reviews are based 100% off of my experience with the product and I never guarantee a positive review."
1,"The sound is perfect, light, easy to load, very useful for exercise"
1,"Pros: Comfortable, decent sound production, stay in place during vigorous exercise. Good for running, lifting, hiking, or any other outdoor activity. Very much sweat proof.<br /><br />Cons: Battery life is short to the point of annoyance. The controls are not very receptive. The microphone is completely useless outdoors; any minimal amount of wind will lead to interference.<br /><br />Final: You get what you pay for. These are okay for gym headphones, and worth the price if you want cordless headphones for working out."
1,Tried another pair that did not have the hooks for over my ears and they were a total annoyance when I ran.  These ones have gone out on a couple runs already and the sound is good and they stay secure!
1,these work well.
1,"Great! Good fit, good sound quality. Great customer Service!!"
1,headphones arrived when they were supposed to and are very comfortable to wear.
1,Excellent deal on these headphones. Great sound and a small carry case included. I would definitely recommend these headphones.
1,Sound is good. Lots of accessories. Great value
1,"Some pros and cons with this item.  I bought these headphones because I like to run 5-8 miles several times a week and workout at the gym.  I was tired of dealing with the headphone cable getting tangled in machines at the gym, and having to hold my phone while I ran.  Here's the PROS:, the headphones are GREAT for the gym and they are great for doing hands free stuff like talking on the phone while folding laundry or driving, I could not be happier with their performance, they sound great, and are easy to use.  CONS::: The earbuds do not stay in very well while I run, which is SUPER frustrating, I will note that the right side ear bud stays in fine, so I don't know if this is defect of the product I received or a problem with my ear or what, but either way, its not good for doing anything like running, basketball, crossfit, anything with a lot of movement.  THAT BEING SAID: I WOULD BUY THIS AGAIN. If this were at $100+ item, I would not be happy with the item, but as cheap as this is, I LOVE them for the gym and driving and such and plan on buying another pair as a gift for a friend.<br />******* UPDATE ******** 5/21<br />It's been a little over a month since I've purchased these headphones.  I am not pleased with this product.  The headphones now lose blue tooth connectivity with almost every use, this is despite my phone either being in my pocket or on an arm band.  Pretty disappointing, I guess you get what you pay for, they worked OK for a few weeks, but they are as good as trash now, I 'm glad I didn't throw out my old wire headphones."
1,"TL;DR: These earbuds are very much worth the money!! Thank you!<br /><br />Long: I'm a college student who, after using a pair given to me by another, bought my own pair of these Bluetooth earbuds (using my own money--my opinions are uninfluenced and my own) to accompany me to the gym and on walks/runs. Since my laptop is also Bluetooth-capable, I also use these to listen to lecture podcasts and music if my phone is unavailable. These earbuds work great and hold up to all the claims listed on Amazon! Let me tackle them in order:<br /><br />HD Sound: I'm no audiophile, but these are definitely much richer in sound! I can hear another level of music that I couldn't hear on my wired or wireless Yurbuds--not sure if it's &#34;bass&#34; per se because I listen to a lot of classical, orchestral, and videogame music in addition to lyric-ed and electronic music. Be aware that the earbuds and/or device may default to a near ear-breaking level the first time you use 'em--when connecting these to my computer, the computer decided to go straight to maximum volume. Ouch.<br /><br />Comfortable Fit/IPX7: These fit very well, feel light enough to forget about, and don't tangle, and the cord is plenty long enough to go in front of or behind your neck and not snag. (If you wear the cord in front of your chin, though, you may hear your own movements much more than if you wear the cord behind you.) As shown in the listing picture, these earbuds put a box over the front of your ears and a loop behind them. The loops are soft and flexible and long enough to curl all the way around the backs of my ears. They also stay in very well--head movement and light running don't even shake 'em, though I have yet to take these through a hard run or a heavy sweat. My secondhand pair didn't bother me at all, but my Amazon pair makes the back of my right ear ache a bit if I wear 'em too long. I do wear glasses, though; and the ache is relieved if I untuck the loop from behind my ear. The eartip alone is enough to keep the earbud in even when I shake my head and jump around a bit. Not sure why there'd be a difference in comfort, but it could just be these pairs and/or a glasses issue. Your mileage may vary. Also, IPX7 means you should be able to splash these things with water without (serious) damage, but not wear them to the pool. I wore these into the shower, and they held up just fine! (That said, you shouldn't be testing them too much like this if you want them to last.)<br /><br />Longest Battery: Both my secondhand and brand-new pair came with a full charge right out of the box. The secondhand one lasted for the full 8 hours and even better, the brand-new one lasted for over 9 hours!! If you exercise an hour a day, they'll last you longer than a week! For comparison, the Bluetooth Yurbuds I had only lasted about 6-7 hours. These Senso earbuds are definitely the longest-lasting ones I've tried, and they seem to retain their charge capacity even as they age. They don't take very long to charge either; and once you hear the Battery Low notification, you have roughly another 10-15 minutes before they power off (they may also power off automatically when disconnected from your devices). The only annoying thing (in my opinion) is that the Battery Low notification is startlingly loud and repeats itself a bit too frequently, but that's just me.<br /><br />Bluetooth 4.1, Noise Suppression: Pairing was a breeze for my phone (Samsung GS4) and my laptop (Lenovo Flex 2). I do get the occasional skip or fizz-out when using these with my phone, but so far, the issue resolves itself pretty quickly. Range is excellent: I could go roughly 25-26 feet away from my laptop on the secondhand pair before they cut out completely (they started skipping roughly 18 feet away), and that was through a number of walls too. Regarding noise suppression, remember that suppression =/= total cancellation. Predictably, these don't block external noise 100% (maybe the eartips I'm using (the defaults) are too big for a perfect seal?), but total noise blockage isn't something I'm looking for. As it is, a lot of external noise is blocked out (for instance, I can't hear my own footsteps, but I can hear conversations right next to me--they're usually quieter than my music though), so you can focus on your music or the task at hand. As for call quality, I've only taken one call with these so far, but I was told I sounded slightly muffled. I wasn't expecting a top-tier microphone in this price range ($20-50), but I've also only tried once. I may update this later once I get more data.<br /><br />Bonus Items/Warranty: I received all the bonus items listed (clamshell case, 6 spare eartips, 2 charging cables, car charger) as well as the 'buds, instructions, and 1-year warranty. Many Bluetooth earbuds will come with a short charging cord, a case, and spare eartips, but the long charging cord and car charger are an awesome bonus! Senso also provides a no-questions 30-day return policy (which I don't anticipate needing to use). Be aware that you must buy from Amazon to claim the warranty--Ebay/etc. purchases don't qualify.<br /><br />Misc.: Senso has one of the best customer services I've worked with, by response time and hospitality. I first contacted them about an issue with the secondhand pair, and even though it wasn't under warranty due to its secondhand nature, they helped me try to solve the issue. It's easy to contact them from their website, and they respond pretty quickly. After buying a new pair from them directly on Amazon, I received two follow-up messages from them (customer service and the president) asking me if I was happy with my purchase and to notify them of any issues.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very happy with these earbuds! They work great, sound great, feel great, and stay in my ear despite motion! If they continue  to work this well after 1-2 months, even better! (I'll update around then.) Thank you, Senso!"
1,"I have had these for less than a week. So far, they work just fine. The accessories and carry/storage case are a great value. Paired with my phone and iPad in less than three minutes."
0,even overnight charging did not fill the battery
0,This senso Bluetooth headphones before I order just look about the reviews first and see lot of good comments. But when I get it and try it that totally different with good comments. It makes loud sound only. But hard to identify the details form instrument. Also if talk on phone the people hear very noisy that cover my voice.
1,"Love the headset. Got a card with it for 10% next purchase with the product registration.  I'd like to order another one, but didn't receive the 10% code to purchase the second set. Headphone have a great sound, and easy to figure out."
1,"So far headphones are best ive used to date. Great price, great fitment and loud! Only been a week but one of the best deals out there right now. Comes with a really nice case and iphone/headphone charger.<br /><br />update. going to buy few more pair. these are great."
1,"These headphones are great! The variety of earpieces add a customizable feel to them and provide a wide range of sizes for comfort. However, I have noticed that when first connecting to my phone for music or videos, the sound tends to break for a few seconds before fully connecting.<br />I don't know what causes this as the headphones are within 1 foot of any Bluetooth device I use.<br /><br />Other than that, I like them for the price!"
1,great sound and Bluetooth connectivity
1,Fast shipping and a great quality product!
1,"I wear these while rehearsing aerial circus acts.  They stay in well even when hanging upside down. Occasionally they slide off while doing flips, but i think that is because i have small ears and its out of the range of intended use. Being able to adjust the size of the ear hooks would be a nice addition."
1,These are awesome
1,"Love this, nice quality sound"
1,Just got these head phones and they are extremely comfortable.  And the sound quality is above whatbi expected for what i paid. I used to have Beats and the quality of these match up with them.  But obviously these Senso take it with the price. I highly recommend these if your looking for a great headphone set.
1,"love these! To be honest, this is the 3rd set of this model i've owned. first one died on me, the second a stepped on, but overall they are great. Real good sound quality and you can still hear people around you. I've owned other BT headphones like these and you can't workout in them because of cord rubbing against everything...not these. A+"
1,Arrived fast and worked like a champ!  Love the fact it came with multiple size ear pieces for an exact fit.
1,"*Update* 1 year and 2 days into owning these and they no longer charge.  These were greelat while they lasted, but zero physical damage, they just quit on me. Time for some new ones, don't know if I'll buy the same model.<br /><br />Near indistinguishable from the similar models sold in Amazon and I'd give the 2 I own the same exact review except for 1 point and these Senso brand get the 5 star review because this one came with a very nice dual port USB car charger.<br /><br />These pair easy, have a nice case, look and sound good. I'm as happy with these as the other ones I own."
1,Easy to use. Sound quality is great for music and phone calls. Charges quickly.
1,only used them twice so far but they sound great at a great price
1,"I reviewed wireless headphones ad nauseam. Looked at all the options at Best Buy, including Bose. Read numerous blogs and Amazon reviews.<br /><br />In the end, I chose the Senso Bluetooth headphones, based on the reviews.<br /><br />I use them primarily for jogging. So far, the sound quality and the fit are both excellent. I had a minor customer service issue (that I think turned out to be my fault), and expected to hear back from Senso in 2-3 days. Instead, I received a complete reply within a couple HOURS. I couldn't believe it!<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and purchase these. You have nothing to lose and everything to gain."
0,These are garbage. Didn’t even last a year. No charge. Won’t turn on. Avoid.
1,"Fantastic. Super easy to connect, long lasting. Can wear when I run, lift, jump rope... You name it. Great purchase"
1,Overall a very good product for the price you pay. I have been using it now for 2 months without any problem during my workouts.<br /><br />Sound quality and noise cancellations are not great but still a good bargain product.
1,"Pretty good sound quality and battery life, but after only a few uses the matte coating on these bubbled up and is flaking off everywhere. Seems like that part is at least poorly done or cheaply sourced, which leads you to wonder what else could be as well."
1,"This pair of head phones cannot get an better for the price.<br /><br />Battery life: ~8 Hours<br /><br />Charge time: Less than 2 hours (I use a portable charger)<br /><br />Sound Quality: these headphones are extremely heavy on the bass, and weak on the treble. I own four audiophile quality headphones, in ear and over ear - after doing some serious EQ modifications this sounds like it's 75$. I've posted my EQ settings in case anyone is interested.<br /><br />Comfort: I use these in the gym and works perfectly, I would prefer these over my over ear Momentums on a hot day where I may get sweaty."
1,Excellent quality.  Fits well and the USB charger cable with Apple adapter was a big bonus.
1,They are easy to use. I only have a couple of issues. I like to watch my iPad at night in bed with earphones. The sound is great but I have to lay on my back the whole time. I cannot lay on my ear due to the buds sticking out too far. Also I have small ear holes and they can be a little uncomfortable. The hooks that go around the ears aren't really useful.
1,"Received them real fast, excellent sound, comfortable. SENSO reached out to back their product... Thanks"
0,"While running, I find myself sometimes struggling to keep it in place.  The worst part is when I am running and making a phone call.  The person on the other end has a hard time with the loud wind noise. It's worthless for runners."
1,"For the money they really work well, literally hour of use.  I use them at work maybe 4-5 hours per day and they keep the charge."
1,"Very good product. Lightweight, no pressure, very good sound quality. Not the greatest noise cancelation but good for the price."
1,Great representation of the product.  You get exactly what is pictured and the quality is fantastic for the price point.  Highly recommend.
0,"The sound quality is good, but I can’t get the headphones to stay in my ears. The band that goes around the ear is too big and keeps slipping off. If you’re a smaller person probably not the headphones for you. Too bad I spent money on these. Totally useless for me."
1,So far so good really comfortable to wear
1,"I am truly blown away at how good these sound. The bass is very full. The packaging comes with extras which are nice. Also the case it comes in is great. I also have a pair of Powerbeats and these hold their own against them. If I had to make one complaint, it’s that the ear piece that goes over the back of your ear seems a little too soft. However, for the price this is easy to live with.  Connected great with my iPhone XS Max."
1,"I wear these headphones a the office and to the gym. This product impressed me since it arrived in my mail. It came with a dual car USB charging adapter with a long charging cord which was compatible with iphone 6 and samsung charging ports. The headphones themselves came with a sturdy case, charging cord, and three different sizes of ear plugs. On the headphones themselves were foam ear plugs that mold really well to the ear. I ended up not using the foam plugs because I find it easier to sanitize the other plastic plugs. However, if I were to strictly use these for walking my dog or listening to music in the office, I would stick with the foam. They're excellent.<br /><br />The battery life is very long. I haven't timed exactly how long my usage is, because I turn them off and on in between uses. But I am able to use them through a work shift and then use them for 2 hours straight afterwords while I am at the gym. I have never been worried about these headphone dying on me during the day. I also am able to charge the quickly in my car if every other day during my commute to work."
1,Perfect for gym
1,These headphones are a steal! Why buy the name brand &#34;Bose&#34; when you can get an equal quality + style pair for a portion of the price? It's just not economical. I use them regularly and am very pleased! Excellent for exercise (lifting/running). The ear piece is sillicon so it doesn't dig into your ear. They fit comfortably :)
1,These senso earbuds are fantastic! No problems connecting to my Android and the sound quality is Crystal clear.
1,So far so good.  Noise cancelation not as good as anticipated.  Very comfortable and lightweight.
1,Works and sounds great
1,"Great sound, easy to connect, good price"
1,"I'm really impressed with the quality of these headphones. I purchased them for working out and they work very well. I'm also impressed with the value. I looked in some electronics stores and departments and couldn't find anything decent for less than a hundred dollars. I looked on Amazon and saw these with the great reviews and thought I'd give them a try. So far, I'm 100% satisfied. They have good sound quality and stay in your ear. Well worth the money."
1,Great! Short and long charging cable. Ear phone changable sizes. Casing. Friendly.
1,"Like many headphones, you can change the part that goes into the ear. Most are normal rubber like. One is softer, more like foam ear plugs. It doesn't make my ears sore after using it for long periods of time."
1,Great earbuds for the price
0,"I just received these headphones.  It says plug into until light is solid blue for full charge.  They came fully charged because it turned blue right away.  Unplugged and held multifunction button to turn on...and nothing.  Headset is dead once unplugged, cant turn on, cant pair with a device, nothing.  Tried charging for 2 hours, still doesn't work.  Looking at the 1 star reviews this seems to be a common issue..  Severely disappointed in this product and obviously can't recommend as this issue persists."
1,It is Very Nice and Good I While I listen to music or a video I can't here any outside noise (Which is good) since it's for my daughter she says it's a little bit but she can wear it and it takes her a little while to put on and stay may I suggest making them for little ones too
0,"Thus product leaves a lot to be desired. Has no rang on the blue tooth have to carry phone with me oh and don't open the refrigeratordoor orbit discountif you don't have a line of sight, battery life sucks, wire between ear buds it way to thick, stiff and just uncomfortable. Lost my others replaced with this. Wow big waste."
1,nice and soft on the ear but the base is too much to lack in the the sound quality. Rest all is great.
1,"The best earbuds I have owned, which have been Bose and Monster.<br />I was sitting next to a guy on a Southwest flight, who had just ordered his and ordered 2 sets for my wife and I.<br />So far they have been everything they claim to be. Bravo SENSO!"
1,Comfortable and they don't fall off my ears. I love them.
1,"Comfortable, quick connect, reasonably sweat-proof, good battery life, and good sound. Good for all activity, including running."
1,"I was very pleased to find bluetooth headphones that are so lightweight they are a joy to wear. Ive been using them with you tube and enjoying my music and videos. Your product exceeded my expectations in sound quality and ease of use. I do not like to wear headphones ,but these are wonderful.<br />I have already recommended to my family.  I love them."
1,Great sound! Great price! Love these! So far so good!
1,"Can't beat the price they are perfect back-up pair of wireless sport headphones.  The fit is nice, the materials used to make the product are good (not great). Mic on the headset is good.  Sound Quality - You get what you pay for - If you used to other headphones around $150 or higher you'll definitely notice as the sound quality is not the best.<br /><br />Again - GREAT PRICE good headphone."
1,"I can't believe the sound and how laud they can be. I have to put a slash down or two to control the volume. Very good and they stay on my ears. Love them . Very practical and super strong. Love this product.<br />I had a problem with the cord of the headphones, the cord was peeling off and the wires were showing, I called the company and w/o asking any questions they compromised to replace the Senso Bluetooth immediately at no cost. I am very satisfied with the services I received. Thanks again."
0,Sound quality is poor all bass and no treble but look at the price
1,Excellent product
1,"I really liked the headphones.  It was a surprisingly good value, and the little extras they threw in really made a great impression.  While I'm typically listen to Bose headphones, I needed something that I could take to the gym.  The sound quality is good for what I paid for and worked exactly as I expected out of the box.  Really appreciated the follow up from the company and they conveyed their commitment to make sure that if something was wrong it would be made right.  I coudln't ask for more from a vendor.  Keep up the good work!"
1,"Way much better than the beats when it comes to quality of the sound, features and most of all the price. My son’s Beats which looks like this headset sounds terrible compared to Senso, and the mic is no longer working. When he speaks through the headset you can not even hear his voice. Great job SENSO!"
1,Very good ear buds. Fit good and sound good.
0,After using it for two days the charger will not fit in the port it will Jesus not connect as if it does not for anymore
1,Bought as a gift....receiver says they love them. Best Bluetooth headset she has ever had.
1,"I am not savvy with electronics. I just needed comfortable bluetooth headphones.  These are perfect for me. They sound great, feel good in my ears, and seem like they will stay in. Totally recommend them."
1,Works great!
1,I love these headphones!  Great sound.  Soft material is comfortable.
1,Wow and wow. These Bluetooth headphones are fantastic - they come with all the accessories you need and the sound is the best sound I've ever heard in in-ear headphones. Blows Beats away. And the nice personalized touch by this company to make sure I'm satisfied is delightful. Very happy customer.
1,"I absolutely adore them. Sound quality is fantastic, and they are surprisingly comfortable."
1,"These headphones are simply terrific, they are so small but the sound they produce is so big it feels like one is in a recording studio or in a high end club. They are also very practical for jogging or any outdoor activities  plus the charge lasts for hours. Highly recommended!"
1,"I purchased these to replace another pair (different brand) that was just getting old and cutting out frequently.  I received these quickly (thank you Amazon PRIME) and have used them a few times with no issue.  I easily paired them with my iPhone 6+ and can also pair it with my iPad.  Sound quality is good, stays in my ears and is easy to charge.  Overall, very pleased with this product."
1,Outstanding set of headphones! Sound quality and level will blow your mind. I own $100 headphones that are now in the junk door.
0,"The S-250 Senso ActiveBuds work great for indoor use, but fail miserably when they are used outside in any light wind. After pairing the headphones to my phone all was great as I was listening to music while I prepared to go for a bicycle ride.  As soon as I started to move with a very light breeze the wind noise in my ears was most uncomfortable to the point where I could not hear the music.  If I shielded the ear pod with my hand the wind noise would subside in the shielded ear while continuing to roar in the unshielded ear. This issue is no doubt a design problem that must be addressed before anyone should consider purchasing this product if you have any intention of ever using these headphones outside.  I purchased two sets of these headphones, one for my wife and the other for myself and I will be returning them both for a full refund of my money so I can purchase a brand that can be used outdoors."
1,"I've had these for a month now and they are definitely worth the money.  Fit is good and the hooks keep them on my ears where other buds fall out.  The sound is very good, also.  I'd buy another set without a second thought"
1,Best  headphones I have used. Easy to use.  Love them!
1,"Great gym headphones at a great price. I researched bluetooth in-ear headphones extensively and decided on these for the price.  The other reviewers are spot on.  They are light, stay in the ears, have really good battery performance.  They pair quickly and without much effort.  Operation is a no-brainer and they keep me in the zone during long sweaty workouts.  The only disadvantages I see are that the rubber plug that covers the charging port is having a hard time staying in after numerous charges and a couple months of daily use.  They are not the most low-profile ear buds, but they are what you should expect for this style of bluetooth headphones.  I've deducted a full star for one reason... Wind noise. I can't tell if it is due to the larger profile of the headphones, or if it is the microphone input but if you are walking fast / running especially into a slight head wind you will hear the rustling loudly.  Like I mentioned, i'm not sure of the exact cause, but it's really distracting, so much so, I'd recommend these only for indoor use.  If you are a runner, you might want to look another direction."
1,"So far so good. I got them in two days and immediately started charging them. They were super easy to pair and sound great. I was really surprised by the noise canceling. Also, very happy with the different sizes for the inserts because I couldn’t fit the medium or large in my ears. The features are very easy to use. It comes with a 30 day return policy and you can register for a one year warranty. I will say it will be hard to get used to having something shoved in my ear but I will find out."
1,Work's great and fits perfectly! I recommend.
1,"I have looked for wireless headphones for a long time. I have gone through a lot but these senso r worth the price. They fit perfect, comfortable, won't fall off, and there noise canceling also. I am on my second pair, gave my first one to my wife and she is also happy. The Mic picks up everything and I like the last call feature.  Look no further."
1,"They stay in ear and the sound is good, but there is no way of knowing the battery level. So, all of the sudden you hear battery level low and 2 minutes later the headphones shut off. It seems pretty basic that there should be an indication of the battery level."
1,"I'm a dog walker and needed reliable and durable wireless headphones to take phone calls, listen to music and audiobooks.  These work really well.  The set-up was easy, the earbuds are comfortable, as is the clip behind the ear.  I haven't tested the battery length yet, but will update my review when I do.  After going through a ridiculous number of wired headphones, I'm glad I took the leap to Bluetooth headphones."
1,"Been using these for the past week and they are so much more comfortable than my other bluetooth headphones.  Love the sound, noise cancelling works great.  These are very light and portable and will really be great for airplanes (babies and restless kids)."
1,"Sound quality has sufficient bass, the over hear hangars were soft and comfortable, they were easy put on and all the extra charging cables and car dual charger make this purchase an incredible value.  Hopefully they don't break as I have only had them a week."
0,They sound great but when riding my mountain bike I get a lot of wind noise and that's what I got them for so they kind of sucks
1,Sound is awesome!  However for me  they don't fit right  I'm using them upside down I'm getting ready cut off the part that clings to your ear  upside down they enter the ear what &#34;feels &#34; appropriate also SOUND I'd do much better  I like it !!!!
1,"I bought these headphones after my disappointment with a previous pair. I run whole listening to music. My old pair didn't fit right and I would keep having to adjust them while I ran. Also, the volume control was located on the cord  just under the left ear bud, causing it to move unnecessarily. When I went looking for a new pair, I knew what I wanted; good fit, good quality, ease of use, and value. That's what I now have in my Senso headphones! The buttons are on the earpiece itself, causing even weight distribution between the two headphones when running. Even sweat doesn't loosen the fit on my ears. They are easy to use and pair up easily via Bluetooth. I have only used them a few times, but I can tell that the quality is good. Lastly, they didn't break my wallet. These are everything I was looking for and I'm happy to own them!"
1,This product is awesome! I listen to music and audible books while running. They stay on without any issues. The wire in the back is light and doesn't get in the way. Buttons on the right bud for turning on and off and managing volume are easy to use and feel while running.<br />The very expensive Bragi The Headphone I bought was clunky and the buttons were difficult to use. L ear stopped working.<br />So far very happy with these earphones!
1,"I'm updating this review to say that the initial pair I bought had bad reception problems, even at short distances. Figured it was a lost cause, but reached out to their customer service, who responded immediately, gave me some tips to try (which didn't work) and then very promptly sent out a replacement pair  -- which seem to work great."
1,"Awesome wireless earbuds for the price. They feel uncomfortable after about 1 1/2 hours but other than that, they're great!"
0,I have had this headset for a few months with light use (I haven't sweated in them) and it won't stay connected to my phone even though other devices do. I only needed a headset for hands-free driving. I could have gotten an $80-100 set for the price I will have spent after replacing these.
1,"I love these earbuds, especially the quality of their sound. they also fit well. the only drawback is that I find they charge slowly."
1,As expected they work perfectly anda easy to sync. For sure a good buy.
1,These are good. Love the adjustable ear piceses. They do sound great when you get them comfortable in your ear. Over all great product for a great price!
1,"3 and half stars for this product:<br /><br />PROS: 1st star - easy paring and 8 hrs battery life (tested on lowest level of volume it goes), 2nd star - great quality, 3rd star - great sound, and half star for like these qualities<br />CONS: 1 star off - little bulky and not able to play on the lowest volume from IPHONE/MAC, half star off for NOT like that quality."
1,I love these headphones so far. They are easy to use and have good sound quality. I cannot speak to their durability because I've only had them for 5 days. Battery life seems to be good and they recharge quickly. I would recommend them at the price I bought them for ($35).
1,"Bought 2 pair of bluetooth headphones, one treblab and one of these, construction wise they are exactly the same, however these are slightly lighter than the others and the sound look and feel is A1"
1,"I had a slight issue with pairing it in the beginning, but customer service was fabulous and was able to help me resolve it quickly.<br />The biggest problem is that I can’t use them outside. They CONSTANTLY disconnect from my phone, even if my phone is near my face. They end up reconnecting on their own, but not practical for when you are talking on the phone. There are definitely better options. I use these at work now only which they work fine, but shouldn’t need two different pairs for when I go outside."
1,Great product but the sound quality can be better for the price; hopefully these last me more than a few months.  I have been using it for the past 2 days and I'm not really satisfied.  I know they are not anything like sennheisers.  I know it's less than 40 bucks and what can one really expect for 40 bucks? - at least decent sound quality without static and scratching/crackling.
1,"I was disappointed that the mic isn't good enough to use for business conference calls, but the sound output is incredible, they're comfortable, they came with lots of little value-added add-ons and the seller was plainly eager to make me happy, thus my 5-star rating."
0,Very large and goofy looking.
1,"Great bluetooth earphones, battery life is good and the support team has been great so far. No complaints here."
1,"Just got them and I love them.  They fit well, and the sound is awesome.  Controls are easy to use.  They stay put during workouts at the gym, even during high-motion ab work."
1,"The sound quality is good, they’re comfortable, but they Will. Not. Stay. Paired. It’s so frustrating to be on a run and having sound cutting in and out constantly. I’m switching brands to something more reliable."
1,Sounds is great and stays put throughout my workouts
0,"Stopped working after a month.  Now they will not power on, even the charging light turns off a after a few seconds, but they still do not power on.  Trying to figure out how to return them since they say they have a warranty."
1,For the price this headphone are the best. Quality good... I mean if you want best Quality invest in something more expensive $100 above. For less than $100 i would not buy other headphone than this ones. Thank you.
1,I was amazed at how well they were packaged in how much came with the headphones themselves I'm quite pleased especially with the charging cord they could charge both I phones and android phones. It appears they went out of their way to make people happy with this product. I normally feel like breaking the headphones in with sound quality like using a white-noise for an hour but these were not necessary for that. That means the sound was perfect from the word go. The only downside I saw was the lack of flexibility with the piece that goes over your ear other than that they're perfect.
1,The sound is good and the ear buds are comfortable but I was under the impression that the strap above/over the ear was to hold them on while working out. The strap is really flimsy and almost pointless. While I am running the right one especially will not stay in.
1,The ear holders to soft never stays on place
1,"I enjoy the headphones, very comfortable and they sound great."
1,really good and noise cancelling
1,Good quality for the price.  Wish it had more range but still worth the money
1,Surprising sound from these headphones and easy pairing. Terrific value.
1,Got these a few days ago for work. Work great! Definitely worth the price!
1,"Comfortable fit, minimal slip even after I'm drenched post run. The only negative is they have to be put in the ear just right for them to work properly. I occasionally get skipping but this could also be my heart rate monitor interfering with the Bluetooth signal."
1,awesome product
1,So far so good. I've only had them for 2 days but they seem very solid. Only complaint I have thus far is they really pick up  the sound of any wind when outside. Not practical for jogging outside but I work out mainly indoors so they work for me.
1,"Recommend purchasing, made of quality material."
1,"These earphones have a good sound quality and good bass for its price! I can't believe I got them for only $36. The battery life is excellent, it is very easy to use and to pair with my devices. It feels comfortable in the ears and doesn't sleep, and it's really convenient that SENSO gives a hard-shell carrying case along with it. I've used many headphones/earphones my whole life, and I can say that this pair is definitely worth more than what you're paying for. I'm so glad I bought them, I've already highly recommended them to my friends and family."
1,"Sounds ok not the best, but none the less good. Battery last for me tops 4 days maybe I only use for working out, for about 1 hour and 30 mins."
1,This headphone produce sound in high quality. Comfortable to wear in a long time. Very recommended.
0,too big for women ears
1,"I absolutely love the headphones!<br />I brought these as a replacement for a different brand because they broke.<br /><br />Right after opening the package it was obvious how much great care Senso took to ensure their product is easy to use.  They generously included even a car charger fitting, and two high quality charging cords, and a very nice container for the headphones!<br /><br />The headphones themselves appear to be of superior quality and have excellent design.  They are far more comfortable than my previous brand, and are very painless and easy to wear.  The buttons aee also very conveniently sized and located.  Then came the usage.  Tbe sound quality is excellent, I was in  awe actually.<br />And they stay very securely in the ear, without discomfort.<br /><br />This is one of those products when the manufacturer far exceeds one's expectation.  Superb, thank you."
1,"Great for the gym, I've ordered 6 different headphones on Amazon and so far this is the best. Fits great, does not fall out when I do box jumps!!!"
0,Used it twice for 40 min in two sessions. Battery expired 20 minutes into second session. Attempted to charge and would not take it. Wanted to return on the sixth of February and the window had closed on the second.....total trash!
1,Great sound. The base is better than I expected. Nice carrying case included. I like the big button on the ear piece for pausing/starting music.
0,Very uncomfortable. The loops are way too big!!
1,"We just received them, and so far we have been really pleased.  Everything has exceeded expectations- the accessories that come with the product are much more than they even advertise.  The buds themselves are extremely high quality.  For the price, as compared with other market offerings, they are an incredible value.  I guess you never know how well a product will hold up until you've had it a while.  But these seem to be everything that is promised, and much more.  I'm going to buy another pair.  And maybe another- as a Christmas gift."
1,"I have used these headphones only a handful of times. At first, they started disconnecting every few seconds. Then, stopped working for no apparent reason. I have contacted manufacturer regarding the 1 year warranty, since it is past the 30 days allotted through Amazon. Still waiting to see if they respond.<br /><br />Update: They responded right away and sent a 2nd pair in two days.  Now enjoying new headphones which are working really well."
1,"bought in April and just stopped working, didn't even last a year."
1,Great ear buds for the money. My second pair. 1st lasted about a year with tons of use in the gym and at work.
1,Love them easy to charge and pair with phone and my iPad. Appreciate the 3 different size ear pieces which fit and feel great. Nice carry case which wasn't shown in the add. Only negative is no explanation on how to turn them off completley when not in use for several days<br />Overall I am pleased with my purchase<br />Hope to update in 30 days
1,I bought these because I needed to have headphones to not fall off out of my ear which was annoying once in a while. These did the job and are much louder than my bose soundlink Bluetooth headphones but I wouldn't say the quality of the sound is better. Thanks to senso for making really good headphones.
1,Love these earbuds!  This is my second pair since I lost my first pair.  They stay in my ears and they have really good sound quality.
1,Quality sound. Quality construction. Great price.
1,"Good sound,nice accessories."
1,Purchased as a gift. So far...works well.
1,The headphones fit very good and will stay in while exercising.  Connecting is easy and sound is good.  We have several pair.  Had problems with one and Senso honoring the warranty and replaced.
1,Early use of this item are rave reviews. Sound quality and fit is excellent
1,"They work well. We've had several pairs before that would skip as my husband ran, but these hold well. He was able to answer a phone call while running the other morning with no issues. Overall happy with them."
1,"I was happily surprised by these headphones. Given the price, I admit I was a bit skeptical. I had purchased the Plantronics Backbeat Fit and was extremely disappointed in those. They were an expensive lesson in unmet promises.<br /><br />However, the Senso headphones were a different story entirely. They fit perfectly, and they really do cancel out ambient noise. That's important for me because my gym tends to blare music that really isn't my taste. These really blocked out that music and let me listen to what I love. But the feature of these I really appreciate is the volume. I listen to a lot of classical and musicals while I work out. (Some people think it's weird, I know.) I love that even my older music that was transferred from analog is completely clear, and at only half the volume. Older music may have to be turned up a little over that, but not much.<br /><br />The phone part works, too, extremely well.<br /><br />One thing you'll want to note is that when it says the battery is low, it will warn you three times before it shuts off, so they mean it. These are easy enough to charge, however. Just check them before an extended workout, and you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />I was impressed by the amount of stuff in the box--cables, plug for charging, etc.<br /><br />Bluetooth connection was about as easy as it gets. And the one time I had a problem, it was with my iPhone. Turning that off and back on again solved it in a moment.<br /><br />Truly an excellent choice for working out, which is what I bought them for. Sorry I didn't find these sooner!"
1,"Love these headphones! I do water aerobics in my local high school pool and no boom boxes are allowed.  So I set my playlist and go to town listening to all my motivational music.  Easy to use, fantastic sound, and fit in my ear perfectly. Thank you so much for the phenomenal sound and portability."
1,Sounds quality could be just a little better but hey bluetooth is great... no chords! long lasting and work great. Happy with the purchase.
1,Hubby loves it! Better than beats and can't beat the price.
1,first run they dont fall out of my ear.  4 starts easy!
0,Not as good sound as I expected
1,"After about 6 months of using the product on and off while running, the ear Senso buds would simply turn off on it's own. I contacted Senso, and they asked me to try resetting. That worked, but the ear buds still shutdown while I was running. I am a fairly patient person, so I kept resetting my ear buds, until I finally got tired of it and contacted Senso again (after the 1 year warranty period was over) to request for a replacement. Senso admitted that sometimes they have defective products that allow moisture to enter the electronics, causing performance problems, but they would not replace the ear buds because the warranty period was over. They knew I contacted them after about 6 months of use for the exact same problem. So here's my suggestion to you. NEVER try to be nice to Senso by trying out their suggestions to fix problems. ALWAYS request for a replacement the first time you experience a problem with the ear buds."
0,"Good initially and met all expectations at first.  BUT, battery is dead after only 3+ months of use and will no longer keep a charge.  I only used 4-6 hours per week at most and charged once per week, but after light use, the battery is done.  Maybe this is how long it is designed to last but I had higher hopes and thought I would be able to use these headphones for longer than 3 months.  Disappointed."
1,"I've waited a year before posting a review. I've bought the same headphones 2 times and each time they stopped working before the year ended. The headphones pair easily and fit great but they just dont last. They work great at first but then the ears start to go out. I really liked them so I tried to buy the same ones a second time but ended up with the same issue 11 months later. For the money they are fine, just dont plan on them lasting a long time."
1,"Headphones fit and sound great. Easy set up instructions. Good price, prompt delivery and packaging."
1,"They work great, they sound great!<br />Comfortable!"
0,Stopped working after a month
1,"The earphones worked perfectly the first day, and then we had an issue getting the bluetooth to stay paired to the iPhone. The service help and responses were quick and very helpful. Following their simple re-set instructions, we got them paired again and they've been great ever since.  I can highly recommend this product and the company behind it."
1,Good fit. Back of ear has pain after long use. Sound is good. Charge in an hour. Battery lifelast up to 5 hours.
1,The headphones came on time and were what was expected. Have used the headphones a few times so far and find the sound quality to be good and the headphones stay in through vigorous workout activity. Pairing with my iPhone was easy. Would recommend these headphones.
1,They are comfortable in my ear canal.  The cord does not bother me when I run.  They are very stylish and I get lots of comments from people especially hot girls.
0,"I really liked this at first, but after only a few weeks of using them the earbud broke off.  Just regular wear of the product."
1,These were awesome
1,Great and affordable Bluetooth headphones. Pairing us very easy and long battery life. Comes with cute carrying case and smaller inserts. Highly recommend!
0,The box arrived opened. No seal whatsoever. The earbuds look old/worn. Poor sound quality. Doesn't even fit properly inside my ears and keep falling. Ignore the positive reviews.
1,"This is the first pair of bluetooth ear buds that I've owned and for the price, they're pretty nice."
1,Oh I really like these headphones. They pair really easily and the sound is quite good. Sometimes the wire sticks to the back of my neck and when I turn my head one way or another it kind of pulls the earpiece out a little. I feel like that maybe if the wire was round it might not do that.
1,Very happy with product so far.  Also impressed that the manufacturer (not the seller) contacted me twice to confirm my satisfaction.  I don't believe I've ever receive an inquiry from the product manufacturer like this before related to an Amazon purchase.
1,excellent product
1,Perfect and outstanding performance
1,Everything was received exactly as stated in the description. Very cool case. I like the options of both charging cables and the car charger. Music and bass quality are great. Best headphones I've ever bought. Does not fall off my head running or in the gym
1,Great sound and battery life.  Auto-connects to Bluetooth when turned on.
0,"Earbuds work well if you're inside only.  If you're outside the wind will overpower your listening.  At a stand still, walk, or especially a run/bike pace the wind is too much to hear your audio."
1,"Never did I think I could find a decent pair of headphones for under $100. I believe I paid maybe $25 no more than $30 for these headphones. Sound proof, great fit and I have tiny ears."
1,These ear buds sound excellent. Good highs and deep bass. Very pleased with the sound. But don't go swimming with them as they are not water proof in the sense that you can listen to them underwater. They'll  stop playing underwater but will start playing again once back on dry land. I was going to return them because I wanted to listen to music while snorkeling. But they do sound good so I kept them. You can listen to them in the shower or steam room tho.
0,Of course these headphones stopped working exactly 2 days after the return window closed :-(
1,"Very well built,great sound and long battery life.Just as good as the big name brands without the ridiculous price tag.I bought my Senso Bluetooth headphones for use at the gym and I can’t be more happy with them,great product will be sure to let friends and family know about them as well.Thank you."
0,They do not stay in your ears and the loops are to big and not supportive.  Do not try to run with these in your ears.  They will not stay put.  They keep cutting in and out and the company has instructed me to reboot the headphones and forget the device on my phone and reinstall.  I was really looking forward to these and I am greatly disappointed.
1,"I've only worn the buds a couple of times, but so far so good. The sound is really good. I do wish there was a way to adjust the fit of the ear loop. They hang a little loose on my ears and the strap does not help."
1,I use them while lying in bed to not disturb my wife while she goes to sleep I need to know if you have smaller ear pieces?
1,"The BEST sound I have EVER experienced with headphones!!! Super easy to pair too. I have small ears and all buds hurt my ears like crazy after about an hour, but these are a tad awkward at first since the over the ear piece is flexible rather than hard like most, but it actually makes it extremely comfortable. The only complaint I have is that the flexible &#34;hooks&#34; are too large for my ears it would be nice if they could be adjusted..."
1,"These are the best headphones I have ever had! Sound quality is Amazing. They are comfortable to wear,outside noise cancels out,volume on headphones are great.I take them everywhere with me.This item is a Must Buy!!! I use these with my Samsung S7 edge"
0,"First set lasted only 3 months. Manufacturer replaced these. Second set lasted almost 9 months. Manufacturer refused to replace unit or help fix the issue due to the fact that I contacted them 10 days past original purchase date warranty period. The issues with the second pair started before the warranty ended, I just never had the time to message them. Figured since it was just a few days past, they would still help me out. Guess not. They offered me a 5% coupon instead which I felt like a slap in the face since it would only save me about a $1.25. They also take long to respond back to messages. Save yourself some time and buy a high quality pair like I am going to do now."
1,"I bought these just to use while I am working out, but they are great to use any time.  The sound quality is great and the operations is very intuitive and easy to figure out.  They connect very quickly and I haven't had to recharge them yet. Great purchase, especially for the price!"
1,The over-the-ear clips are too flexible. I was thinking they were a bit more stiff.  The sound is very good though!
1,"These are awesome. I use them while running and exercising. They don't slip. My only grip is that I think the cord should be shorter. While I'm running half the cord will fly over one shoulder and then begin pulling the opposite ear. If the cord was shorter, long enough to just go around the back of my head it would be perfect. For the price you can't beat these."
1,LOVE these Bluetooth headphones.  Sound is great and very comfortable to wear.
1,"So far, excellent battery life, ok sound quality (they are still bluetooth earbuds) and simple instructions. They seem to be pretty sturdy and they have a nice carrying case for protection. I would recommend them to anyone else."
1,"I've only used the headphones a few times but am happy with my purchase. My only complaint is wind noise while running. I need to switch out the earbuds to the other sizes provided to see if that helps. Overall, great recommendation by a friend to try these. Thanks Senso!"
0,Would not stay in ears at all no matter the size cover.  Ear hooks were way too large for my ears and didn't even touch them.  Volume down button would not work.
1,My dad loves them!! They work great for running and working outside! Great headphones!!!
1,"Feels cheaper than previous versions of this product.<br />I have had these headphones for years and the quality of the product for the price is great. I feel let down this time around, my old ones had the cord between the headphones crushed, my fault. This version is made of very light plastic, the outside sound echos more when you are wearing them, and the behind the ear part doesn't feel as natural to put on as before.  Might look elsewhere when these go bad."
1,"RETURNED BUT STILL RATED 4*. HERE'S WHY:<br /><br />Headphones were comfortable and stayed in the ear. They offered many different size ear buds to fit your ear canal. I ran 4 miles in them and they stayed in my ear. They came fully charged; which is an underrated positive for many electronic devices. They were delivered with many different ways to charge them. The case is awesome. Not too hard, but small with plenty of room to hold smaller cords and the headphones.<br /><br />Here is why I returned:<br /><br />The sound. Now for less than $40 headphones, they sound great. The bass is heavy at only 1/2 volume on my iPhone 7+. I don't think I ever went over 1/2 volume when playing with these headphones. On my previously stated run, the headphones did a great job at blocking out outside noise (some runners don't like that, but I do). But where these headphones got me were the mids/highs. The bass is super powerful and it drowns out everything else (not in a terrible way). I own a pair of on-the-ear Beats headphones and you can tell a noticeable different in the range. But that is what you get when you pay $200 vs $40. I wanted to try and find a pair of budget-friendly in-ear headphones, but I have been spoiled by higher-end headphones and I needed to keep that quality.<br /><br />Now as stated, these headphones are not bad by any means. I still rated a 4*. If you are looking for a budget-friendly pair of Bluetooth in-ear headphones, definitely go with these. The seller was fast, e-mailed to ensure satisfaction, and the headphones are higher quality than $40. But if you already own an expensive headset and will be bothered by the &#34;lower quality&#34; sound, then these may not be for you.<br /><br />Hope this helps."
1,"They've been great so far.  I use them mainly while running and have no issue with them moving around.  They sound good, feel good and were a great price!"
1,I was impressed. I spent $100 dollars on a beats set and these sound just as good if not better. It's a very good deal for the price.
1,"The depth of sound is tremendous. Along with the lightness and comfort, they are amazing for the money. I bought 4 more pair😃"
0,"The sound of these is great. The problem is, they're completely unusable for what half of you are buying it for - exercising outdoors. This is because the wind noise is just awful. And I'm not talking, actual breeze or wind, either - I'm talking about, even on the most still day, the air you run against as you move through space. I can't even imagine what it must be like for cyclists. Microphone makers easily make mics that cut wind noise, so I don't know why they can't do this for these headphones. So, please only buy this if you are exercising only indoors, or for an airplane or some other stationary use.<br />Another thing: they un-pair too quickly. Let me select when they automatically un-pair; say, not for ten minutes, the same way you select how long you want your computer to wait before requiring a password re-entry. I'll handle the power draining issues resulting from this myself, thanks, guys. But, you leave these alone for 60 seconds while you talk to someone or fiddle with your MP3 player, and they un-pair. Totally annoying.<br />Also, it would be nice to be able to fast-forward and rewind within tracks, not just to move from track to track."
1,great headphones so far sound is great and 8 hours of battery life compared to my old dr dre beats that broke after only a year only had 6 hours of battery life and couldn't beat the price for only $15 when they had a flash sale on it compared to my dr dre beats they were $149
1,Love my Senso headphones.  They come with great instructions and were easy to pair with my iPod.  The sound is good and there are several accessories included.  I am so impressed with their customer service.  I would highly recommend.
1,These Bluetooth headphones are incredible. They sound great and block out all the unwanted noise. They have replacement ear pieces for small and big ears.
1,"Outstanding customer support,warranty, and product, Would definitely buy these from this seller again."
0,"Was looking forward to these!! But alas, won't stay in right ear no matter the ear piece size! 🙁 Must return."
1,"I am a woman with relatively small ears. I was skeptical that these earbuds would fit my ears and stay in place while I was running, partly due to their size and partly because the wrap around pieces are floppy. But they stayed in very nicely. The noise cancelling feature was a nice unexpected bonus for me (not something I was specifically looking for as a feature), and it works pretty well. I have not gotten them wet to &#34;test&#34; the waterproof capability. The buttons are easy to use, my only complaint is actually it's too easy to turn them on and off, if I'm adjusting my right ear bud I sometimes accidentally will press the on/off button because it is so sensitive."
1,Sound quality is excellent.  Love the freedom of a cordless device with excellent sound.
1,"I chose an over the ear design just for extra caution so they don't fall off as I'm moving around. But I have to adjust occasionally as it starts to pinch that one spot on my ear. I guess I will find just an in-ear next... also the range is pretty low, barely can move around a 1 bedroom apartment without having to move my phone with me.."
1,"for 30$, i didnt expect them to be as good as they are. nice n loud and battery is decent"
1,"These headphones are wonderful. The sound quality is excellent. They are very comfortable on my ears for an extended time and are feathery light. The battery holds a long lasting charge and I am continuously impressed at how easy and quick they pair with my phone. Not sure why anyone would pay exorbitant money when these are better and less expensive. Well done, Senso!!"
1,"The wire is longer than expected. The sound quality is not great, but it will do."
1,"I've been struggling with ear-buds for such a long time, and it hadn't occurred to me to get myself a set of Bluetooth buds.  I'm so glad I got this set! Set up was super easy, and the sound quality was phenomenal. Completely cut out all extraneous sound.  Super comfy in my ears, and they do not fall out when sweating (which was a huge deal with previous ear pieces).<br />Great product! Thank you!!"
0,Already broken
1,Love the fit. They’re so comfortable
0,They broke within two weeks of using them. One side doesn’t even work.
1,"Easy to connect, sound is loud and clear,but the base is lacking."
1,Love them. Although someone stole the case with everything but the ear buds. Still having a hard time  finding finding replacement parts for that short of buying a whole new set.
0,"I really wanted to like these headphones. The sound quality is great, but they just are not comfortable. I sit at a computer most of the time and like to listen to music while I type away so I need to have comfortable headphones. These just were not them for me in spite of the fact that they do come with multiple silicon ear pieces."
1,"I've only had these for a couple of days, but so far I am very impressed.  I was concerned that the silicon pieces that slip over the ear would be uncomfortable, but they have exactly the opposite.  In fact, a couple of times I stopped noticing them at all.<br /><br />Good sound.  Some reviews have said they are a bit heavy on the bass, but I use them mostly for listening to podcasts and they sound pretty balanced.  Some good jams from Tiesto while out running today.<br /><br />Speaking of running, they performed exceptionally well.  I did not experience any slippage nor did the flat cord along the back of my neck tug or pull.<br /><br />I believe these to be a great value for the investment level."
0,Left side had buzzing sound so the set was returned.  Replacement set had the same issue. Super disappointed!!! I've had at least 5 pair over the years and never had an issue before now.
0,"Volume cuts in and out.<br />Wish I could return em, but apparently I took to long to figure out that they don’t work as advertised.<br />Do NOT buy these."
0,I don't know where all these high ratings are coming from this item is garbage. The charger does not fit the receptor and I could not even charge it.<br />Waste of time.
1,"Big, awkward headphones. They are so heavy you can’t wear just one without the other one weighing down and pulling it out. Don’t reliably connect to my iPhone, and sometimes my music will play out loud which is my WORST FEAR. Other than this, the sound quality is fine"
1,"Good quality headphones with great sound! After a few months I got a short in the cable that made the left earbud cut in and out, contacted the company and they sent a free replacement immediately. Great customer service. A+"
1,Loop for ear is way too big and the build feels cheap...but for 10 bucks who can complain.....the sound is great btw.....
1,The music sounds phenomenal.
1,"I've had these headphones a couple of months, I'm noticing that they disconnect from the Ipad without reason.  I'm still trying to troubleshoot."
0,"The sounds quality was pretty good, especially with my line of work where I am surrounded by constant shouting and heavy machinery. The battery life isn't the greatest but I was okay with it. Right after work I charge the headphones  but it seems that the headphones port wasn't fused in properly because when I took it out to go about my day to use it, it came loss and made my headphones useless."
1,"Two days later, my Bluetooth earphones delivered. Nice package. In the box- Extra car plug, android micro and lightning  cable. The sound-  so big, solid, no static, easy to use. Me and wife enjoying it! Bought two more. However, it went $5 more. No regret. Gave it to my retired friend. Wow, he says. Getting my friends to notice it. More buying to come.<br />Shout out to Kenneth Backstroms-President/Senso.<br />Great product. Great  advertising on amazon."
1,Hey I bought a second pair of these now. They work well and I would recommend them to anyone who exercises or drives or flies. I recommended this product to a colleague and she also bought them.
1,"Comfortable,good quality sound. Love it."
1,"It works great except for it having difficulty to connect sometimes, normally if it runs out of battery. I have to forget it on my phone amd have it relearn it once again for it to connect. The sound is great and the customer service is spectacular as well thanks!"
1,"So for 10 weeks these worked great, sounds great, and awesome price. . Tonight at the gym they stopped working. Took home and charged them. They didn't come on. Looking at the manual it say master reset hold multi function button for 3-5 second... so I did it... still nothing. I just sent an inquiry about the one year warranty and will update the review once I get their response."
1,"These sound great and I bought 2 because I thought battery might die out quickly. They lasted almost 8 hours everyday. I like the smaller ear inserts than the ones they had on them already. It really comes with a lot of stuff. A cigarette charger, 2 extra wires an an apple charger and a case. It came with a lot for the price."
1,"purchased for my son for xmas, an athlete and avid work out fanatic. He loves these, he said way better than his beats."
1,"Everything about this earphones is wonderful, from the sound quality to the design and even its price. Customer service is great as well - the first one I got had some issue after a few days, contacted them and they sent me a replacement right away. Super convenient to use and great coverage! :)"
1,"Really good for 40 bucks. I've only used them once but was pretty pleased. The only complaint is that the over-the-ear style is hard to make work comfortably. Still trying to figure out a good, comfortable way to get them in place and to stay in place"
0,The product cancels out noise pretty good but the intermittent connection while listening to music or watching a video always cuts out.  That feature I do not like and will be looking for new headphones.
1,"Great product. Only one problem with the design, when you put them in your ears, you can help hitting the on/off switch and that disconnects the earbuds from the phone... Other then that, I like them very much."
1,They are great earphones they charge fast and last a while
0,It worked well for couple of months. Then the sound quality changed and it’s hard to listen to.
0,"This products works terrible, the first time that i used it, failed all the time. The music cuts all the time, and after one or two hours at the gym is worst!! I tried to give it a second chance, and I used it for a run, worst decision ever! at the first mile started to fail and I lost too much energy trying to make it work, for me is really important to listen music when I run, and this ruined my pace."
1,"Really like the headphones, better than what I expected."
1,the order came in super fast!  and the senso headphones are just as great!
1,Love them. Great price and sound quality is excellent.
0,Had them about a week and one earbud is already starting to get staticky. Not very happy.
1,Best Bluetooth earphones I have ever had.
1,"This was an excellent buy, the range is decent even through walls and the sound clarity for audio video and calls are excellent, the tips are comfortable and sit well on the ear with no discomfort whatsoever from prolonged use (over 6 hours continuous usage) and battery life is excellent. The mic is so sensitive however that you have to be mindful of wind direction as it is picked up  by the mic and distorts your voice<br />Feb 20th 2018...update...seems the headphone developed a short somewhere...contacted the seller and they issued a replacement at no extra charge as it was within the warranty period with no hassle...will maintain the 5 star review due to an excellent product combined with stellar after sales service and warranty support"
0,Junk. cant be more than 2 ft away from iphone  without sound issues.
1,Love them and they last a long time
1,Great products
1,Excellent product!
1,Very happy with these!
1,lost them
1,They re-connect so fast that is crazy... Sound quality is good for the money and comfortable to wear. Would buy again.
1,"What a tremendous package and product for the price.  I had PowerBeats and paid much, much more.  I wish I had bought these in the first place.  The company is to be commended."
1,Great sound quality but the adjustable ear line that goes around this ear is not firm enough.  It hard to keep earphones around the ear when you are running or working out.  I will continue searching for the perfect headphones
1,"I am very impressed my new Senso Bluetooth headset! It has great sound including volume and bass! The buttons are very easy to use and so easy to navigate. The phone even sounds clear and clear conversation! I haven't used them as much as I'd like, but they are fantastic! Even at long distances they didn't fade out or drop of. I'm very impressed!! Definitely recommend this headset!!!"
1,A great sport headphone 🎧 works very well and blocks out quite a bit of ambient noise. Great value for the price.
1,They are great! Well worth the money.
1,Loved them and the ease of use
1,I have purchased so many Bluetooth devices that I almost gave up on getting one that worked well for a reasonable price. I decided to try one more time and I'm glad I did. This is exactly what I have wanted all along. Great value.
1,I like them.  I have purchased them more than once since i lost them
1,&#34; Just ran with them today and they stayed in place very well for a two mile run. Great sound quality and easy to set up with your smart phone. Make sure you fit the buds that are right for you! &#34;
1,Sound is great! I have very small ears... so the clip that goes over my ears is to big. It would be nice to have it adjustable or extras with different sizes.
1,These earphones exceeded my expectations.
0,"Flimsy rubber earpiece that refuses to stay on my ear. I put it on and standing still, the rubber piece (especially on my left ear) slowly slides off and drops, rendering these useless. In conversation with a  former client of mine of my frustration in finding quality sport headphones for training, he actually pulled out this product commending it. I'm only 5'8'' 180. My client is about 5'5' 140 and in his late 60's. The difference between us? His ears were like dumbo's on his head. He had large ears. I don't. So I sold him my headphones since he wanted an extra pair."
1,"The Senso Activebuds 250 earphones are really comfortable. I don't feel like I have anything in my ears because they fit so well. I haven't had any trouble with them slipping or falling out while I am active. Although I do find that if I only have one ear piece in, the other tends to try to slip around behind my back. So I just tuck it inside my shirt neck to hold it in place. So far I haven't had any trouble with the unit running dead on me during an 8 hr shift. Super clear sound. I would buy this again!"
1,"Great service, great product! Thank you 😊"
1,Fit very well<br />Easy to setup
1,kind communication and effective headphone.<br />my Senso did not working after used about 5 month. Senso's  customer service is very fast to help and replacement headphone.
1,I love these things.
1,These are really good headphones for a great price! My ears are small and headphones tend to fall out but these come with different sizes that allow you to change them. Overall really great quality and super loud.
1,Great headphones this is the second pair I bought to give to a friend
1,"Lightweight and work well, I have cut the cord on my old ear buds"
1,Great sound and amazing bass. I wear these to the gym everyday. They have a very long battery life. I listen to music for several hours a day and never get a low battery.
1,"If you're an audiophile, or just really care about sound quality, don't get these. The sound is veiled and muddy. My guess would be the huge amounts of bass do this, but there may be other reasons. There are better options for this price."
1,"The ear loops could be a bit stiffer, but still nice"
1,"Base is great, sound quality is phenomenal. I was debating between these headphones and Beats, way glad I chose these, virtually same quality and a fraction of the price. I can leave my phone on a bench and walk around the length of the weight room and talk to someone on the phone with no issues. Definitely recommend them."
1,Work great. Great battery life. Great sound quality. Cheap!
1,They are discreet in the sense that you can’t hear the outside world and they aren’t bothered by your listening pleasure.
1,"Just got them last week and have used the 3 times at the gym . So far they are great ! Sound was good , easy way to charge and connect . I love the little pouch that comes with it ."
1,So Far so good<br />Great Price
1,"SOUND QUALITY:<br />First thing I have to do when I use this headphones is use an equalizer/bass reduction. Okay, I'm someone who goes to raves and concerts a lot. I definitely go hard and can headbang to Skrillex, dubstep, trap or whatever bass you can throw in my face BUT THIS IS NOT THE BASS YOU'RE LOOKING FOR. At least for me. When you're not trying to listen to songs that people break their necks to, the bass still muffles out the highs in other audio/songs. It's like you wanting to see the main stage but there's a tall person blocking the view in front of you, and that tall person is the bass. If you can't see past the tall person to hear/see the other noises you're trying to listen for then it kinda ruins the experience. Setting up and turning on an equalizer is like me digging a hole for that guy to stand on so I can see but it's annoying to have to do that every time.<br /><br />However, once the equalizer is set to my liking, the sound quality is decent, somewhat on par with a standard $5-$10 wired headphone as an Android user (OnePlus 3T) I am not aware of an equalizer that runs across all apps. Mind you, this is not the setting within the headphone itself so for every device you connect to, you'd have to turn on an equalizer if you do not like the bass quality.<br /><br />BATTERY:<br />I only use these for the gym, my time there typically ranges anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour, 6 days a week and the least to say I don't have to charge my headphones frequently and that's a good thing. I'd say I have to charge them every week or week and a half and I'll be set. A good review would go out there and get the exact numbers but sadly this isn't one... :( but search for keywords in other reviews, and you may find a good/more accurate estimate there.<br /><br />DESIGN/FEATURES:<br />As someone who works out frequently with these headphones, it's hard for me to remember a time when these fell out of my ears. I'm someone who's moving from workout to workout and sometimes I run here and there at the beach, so I'd say it does a good job of securing the headphones into your ear while keeping the sound connectivity consistent. You also don't have to deal with wires getting tangled with weights/barbells/etc and it's a reason I keep using them.<br /><br />They also give you multiple earbuds so if one size doesn't fit, try another. Not completely wireless but with the wires that connect the headphones together I find that a good thing because you can hang it around your neck while not in use. Along with that they're easier to keep track of and find which was a concern I had with buying wireless headphones because have you seen those AirPods? For something that's tiny and over $100, that is not something I want to lose on accident so for this design choice, that's something I do like.<br /><br />It has a button on the right headphone used for powering on, pairing, play and pause along with two small square volume +/- buttons, but habit and preference has me adjusting the volume on my phone. Nothing wrong with the buttons that's just me. Bluetooth does take some time to pair and actually hear the audio at least with my experience using it. The delay between the headphones being connected/paired to my device is something that doesn't bother me too much (maybe 10 seconds?) but it does make me wonder is this thing actually connected even though it literally says, on both my phone and through a voice on the headphones, that the headphones have been connected.<br /><br />As for range, I can have my phone in my pants pocket or on the floor/table next to me while I'm at the gym or home and the sound does not cut off. I'd say once you start hitting maybe the 15 or 20 feet range that's when it may cut off here and there. This is probably due to interference with other signals from other electronics along with the signal strength weakening from distance so it's to be expected.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br />While I do like the convenience of wireless headphones, the bass is what turns me off. It muffles out the other sounds and in terms of overall sound quality, I prefer and think a cheaper $5-10 wired headphones do a better job in terms of balancing everything from the bass to highs and lows. Using an equalizer will compensate for the bass and make it sound okay but you have to do that every time for every device, since those settings do not carry across different devices. However, I still use these every day for the gym because they're convenient. These headphones aren't awful. But for $40, maybe you can find something else. But also, maybe this is something you can try and be satisfied with. There is a 30-day return policy (which I missed), but using them for the past 2 months I've actually been okay with it. It's hard for me to recommend them, but I'm saying it won't hurt to give them a try because who knows you may like the bass/sound quality that I do not like. You might find that for this price point or less if it goes on sale, this is what you're looking for to enhance something like a wire free gym experience."
1,"I have sennhieser, bose Phillip you name it for gamming.  I pay premium for audio....  this one is just for cheap work out purchase.  Holy smoke the audio is so good, it gonna be my everything headphone now.  Amazing base, full rumble...to a point 😀"
1,"Okay, so I ordered these as my birthday present from my wife.  WOW! I absolutely love these earbuds.  They linked up via BluTooth right away easy-breezy.  The sound is crystal clear as is the telephone call sound.  My wife came through in HD voice it was wonderful.  Hands-free voice calling: I will be using this feature a lot.  Have only charged once and I'm on like the 5th or 6th day.  I am in love with these earbuds!"
1,""" The ear buds are much better than we expected! The sound is loud and clear and we are both pleasantly surprised at how well the mic works. I haven't yet used mine all day, but my boyfriend has and the battery lasted throughout his whole work day and was still going strong. We both keep our phones in our pockets while using, so I can't comment on the Bluetooth range. We love them!"""
1,"I love them so far ! I've only used them twice, but they are great!"
1,To listen to my music
1,It works really good. Good connection when running did not feel it was my ear.
0,I've had these headphones for less than two months and they already will not hold a charge.
1,I live these headphones!! I have for a few years and use daily! Even bought a second pair to keep in my gym bag. Word of advice... store in the case or the cord will become damaged and the sound will start to cut in and out.
0,Not good returned
0,Only use it 3 times and then it stop charging. But the sound quality was great if that helps but I wouldn’t waist my money again on these.
1,"Good quality, relatively reliable, last long. Bought second set."
1,Good value. Bass is a little intense.
1,I work in an office that is noisy I love these to listen to music and love that they will play all day at least 8 hours on a charge.  Best headphones for this price.
1,Love them
1,"I love the product, its heavy on sound but light on the ears."
0,I’ve had the headphones for a month and now I can’t get the red and blue blinking lights to stop and it won’t pair with my iPhone. Will be returning them. Only put a star because the App requires it to submit.
1,"This is not my first attempt to get a bluetooth headset, and fit and quality have always been subpar. This set fits nicely, and the sound is surprisingly full and bassy. The little gimmick of a car adapter and iphone charging cord (I checked, it works) makes this purchase an awesome bargain."
1,Product is wonderful. It was a present for my husband and he was happier than ever. He tried them at the gym and the headphones worked perfectly. I might get one for myself too :-)
0,These did not work.  They would not charge up.  No LED light.  Defective.  A great brick though!
1,These a very nice workout headphones. The mic for calling works surprisingly well. I like the over ear feature for running as they never fall out of the ears.<br />The only drawbacks are: 1. They are slightly more bulky than plain ear buds (not as stylish). 2. Because they don't jam snugly in the ear you lose quite a bit of the bass punch.
1,"I love these headphones.  I would recommend them to everyone. I use them when I workout, run, and bike. You also get a one-year warranty with great customer service in case there is an issue."
1,"Noise cancelling, great bass, and easy to set up and use, is there anything else required for Bluetooth headphone? A resounding NO!!! Awesome sound, comfortable to wear the whole day, and I can shut the world out if I want so I can focus on my work. I love SENSO's Bluetooth headphones. I will be getting an additional pair to leave at work while I groove on the original pair at home. LOVE 'EM!!!"
1,Have had for 3 days and they are working great.
1,"I bought these for my son and it's been several months and they still work well and hold their charge. We aren't music quality experts but they seem to have good tone and you can walk away from your phone across the room and they still work. While I did buy for a discounted price, they were definitely worth it!"
0,"Very happy with this purchase so far, will see how this holds up.....update<br />I bought this August 22 nd 2017 they arrived fine for about a month or so then it won’t pair anymore, I bought another lasted about 2 months now it won’t turn on, either I am not lucky or they are hit or miss, I’m changing brands."
1,"Great quality, easy to pair, and fit me perfect for my small ears"
0,Other brands have the exact same head set and case just with different labels. Don't be fooled by a false 80% discount
1,Good product – great warranty....One of the earpiece is broke and they immediately replaced it within a few days
1,"I ordered these about six months ago because of the great reviews.  The charging port went bad recently and they would no longer charge, so I opened a support case.  To my surprise they responded very quickly with some troubleshooting tips which unfortunately did not solve the problem.  This happened over a period of only 2-3 days, after which they agreed to replace the unit.  I received the new headphones quickly, and they work perfectly.  Very satisfied"
0,"They work for a year and a half and then die.  After buying this product twice I wouldn't do it again.  I know we live in a throw-away society, but I expect better from my electronics than these."
1,"These headphones are really great.  I do all kinds of exercises including jumping rope, sprinting and weightlifting and these headphones are very secure and don't slip out of my ears.  I've tried many brands of wireless headphones and these are the best I've experienced."
1,I am very impressed and over satisfied with my purchase. For this price the ear buds work fantastic. I recommend them for anyone who needs a wireless headset. Use them to listen to my music or pod casts while working out.
1,Excellent quality
1,Pleased
1,"I just ordered and received these in mail 2 days ago.  I decided on these particular ear buds based on other reveiws, and for the time being im thoroughly impressed!!!! I did have a slight issue with registering my product, but when i sent an email regarding this issue they promplty registered it for me.  It pairs seamlessly with my samsung galaxy 7.  I haven't had a chance to run with it or do yard work yet ( still winter here in wisconsin!!!), and these are the main reasons I decided to go with Bluetooth earbuds, hence my reveiw title &#34;5 stars so far&#34;.  They fit great, but I haven't worn them long enough to determine how they feel after a few hours.  Ill do a future update, once I've had enough time to use them,  but so far im very very happt with them......p.s. they have high quality sound and thumping base for the price."
1,They fit. Really small ears and so many earbuds don’t stay in when exercising but these are great. Finally something that works for me!
1,I love the good sound that the Headphones provide!<br />The Bluetooth connect right away..<br />The only &#34;negative&#34; I have to say is the  base of the headphone were you<br />turn it on.. That needs to be a little less Bulky on the sides.
1,The SENSO HEADPHONES are the best earphones I have ever owned and their customer service was outstanding.<br /> I lost my first pair and ordered another pair. Anxious to get them.
1,Hey guys I received my headset today and they are working great. I would highly recommend you guys to my friends.
1,I really love them. The sound is awesome and noise cancellation is excellent.<br />Thank you<br />Albert
1,"I love them! The sound is super. I've had problems with music not loud enough, but with the Senso wireless, I actually have to turn volume down. I've only had them a few days, but I'm so pleased with them. I would definitely recommend<br />these."
1,"These work really well for me when I'm excersizing. The earbuds fit well, and the over the ear piece works well for keeping them in place."
1,"I was pleasantly surprised that they have wonderful sound. Love the wrap around ear feature, they stay put while I run."
1,Excellent headphones!  Comfortable and great sound!
1,"These headphones are awesome! Granted, I've only had them about a week, but the sound is fantastic and they stay put in my ears. I use them mainly for running and I couldn't be happier!"
1,Good headphones for the money hold a really good charge
1,"For the past two years these earbuds have been pretty good. However, after some solid use, 1-2 hr workouts about 5-6 times a week, the right ear bud had been cutting in and out and most of the time just won’t work period.  It’s disappointing for sure.<br /><br />The only other problem I’ve had is that sometimes it would be difficult to pair the earbuds with my phone.  Most of the time I would have to turn off-on 4 or 5 times in order to get it to work."
1,Excellent Products! Shipped fast too! The Best Deal I found anywhere else! Thanks!
1,Every time I pair this product with my android phone I have static for about 20 seconds before making a clear connection. This happens EVERY time!
1,"Pros:<br />-Good volume<br />-Adjustable earhooks, three different size eartips<br />-Easy setup<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Clarity leaves something to be desired<br />-Buttons are pretty loud when they're next to your ears.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting a whole lot from these headphones; they're $30 after all.<br /><br />The sound quality is... acceptable. Nothing more, nothing less. The clarity leaves something to be desired, but it's good enough for the gym. The volume is much louder than you'd think, so unless you're already hard of hearing, I'd recommend keeping it pretty low to start out with. I'm pretty sure they don't have an active noise cancelling function, but the volume takes care of that on its own.<br /><br />They stay in my ears well enough, and the earhooks are adjustable, which is a nice feature. They also come with three different size eartips, so they should fit most people without an issue. I will say that the buttons are extremely loud/clicky when they're in your ears, so beware of that.<br /><br />Overall, for $30 headphones, the sound quality is about what you'd expect, maybe a little better. The fit and adjustability is clearly better, though."
0,"ionly lasted 4 months<br />bought this may 6 to 2018harris september and it don't how to charge.still can't figure out how to return this,the warte says click here had take you to Amazon's return for 30 days but it says a year warrantyso i guess i'm screwed on the 1 year warranty"
1,"Easy to set up, sound quality is good. Can't see wanting anything else out of them"
1,"I so rarely rave about a product I thought perhaps I was incapable of doing so. No longer! These SENSO headphones are incredible. Mine arrived charged, so pairing took all of 15 seconds. At the end, the headphones announced &#34;Connected,&#34; and I was off. It comes with small, medium and large earbuds, a mini-to-USB cable, a dual cigarette lighter charge for the car, and a very cool cable with a mini plug that fits into a Lightning  plug, giving it dual charging capabilities. And to top it off, there is a hard case for storing these tiny wonders.<br />The sound is crisp and clear, and for $30 I can't imagine a better deal anywhere."
1,They are excellent!
1,Finally a sweat proof headphone.
1,Far exceeded my expectations.  Highly recommended.
1,"These Bluetooth headphones are great. They have good quality sound, have longer lasting battery and are comfortable to wear."
0,They seemed fine right out the box but I hear a very loud buzzing in the left ear. Not happy with the purchase I’d suggest paying a little more for a product that doesn’t sound like a June bug in your ear.
0,These things were terrible. Battery life was mediocre. The problem was connecting. It would say “paired”. It would not be paired... I would have to turn off then on to get it to work.more than once.  Recently it wouldn’t connect at all. 6 months old. Connected my old speaker to test. No problem. Sound is decent if you can get them to sit in your ears correctly while doing an intensive workout. Also very finicky about charge cables.
1,"These headphones are great! Especially for the low price! I've had them for a couple years now, still on my first pair. I've gotten them wet and they still work. I wear them at the gym, at home, on walks, everywhere.<br /><br />These are the best headphones I've ever had. It's lasted longer than any headphones I've ever owned.<br /><br />Sound quality is great for the price. No complaints."
1,"These Headphones are good and check all the boxes I was looking for. Sound wise they are little muddy, but no Bluetooth headphones are as good sound wise as wired, but good enough for my use."
1,Love them. Had them for a month and have found zero problems.
1,These are great! Such a good price and great performance that I'm going to order another pair.
1,They are a nice setup for the price but have a little bit of a loss when device that is streaming is in you pocket but overall very reliable and good on charge.
1,"So far so good!  Inexpensive, yet comfortable and easy to operate.  Sound is not too bad. Great for workouts and commuting on the train."
1,"I wear them when I run and they fit great. Never slip out, they are comfortable, durable. Love the easy way I can pause, skip and control the volume with the three little tabs on the right ear bud. Great product, especially for the price."
1,"I have had these headphones for almost a year. These are not the audiophile sound quality, but they do serve their purpose - they are great for working out, running, cycling, watching a movie; and I am not willing to spend $100+ for a pair of workout headphones.<br />I only had a connection issue once; I contacted customer service and they took me through troubleshooting process, fixed the issue,  and followed up on it - absolutely no complaints there.<br />all in all - .a very good product for the price.  I am happy with it."
1,"Work good, as advertised. I recommend them."
0,This would be great buy they don’t last long
1,"These work great; however if you have small ears the clips won’t stay around them, which makes the headphones pop out when moving."
1,Great headphones. Perfect for using at a job that requires water at times. My husband loves them.
1,"All of the reviews are based on the design of the headset itself however no real mention of the clear flaw, the speaker placement. You voice will be muffled and hard to hear because the microphone is not on the cord, near your mouth."
1,"Good sound quality, easy to pair. Wish the charge lasted longer."
1,"The bluetooth connection was so easy and the sound quality and bass is pretty awesome. Remember, this isn't Bose so after considering the price this product is impressive. You can still vaguely hear surrounding noises so it isn't noise cancelling. There are different sizes for the ear piece and the part that goes around the ear is flexible and soft. I've jump roped, ran, jogged, and sweated a lot with these on and they've stayed in so I am a satisfied customer! Warning! Once you hit max volume, there is a single loud screeching chime to let you know! It may not bother some people but I was shook when it hit my ear drums for the first time so heads up!"
1,I absolutely love the fit of the head phones. I love to run and have had a hard time finding a pair of headphones that stay in place throughout the run. These are absolutely great. The only improvement I could suggest is a louder sound capacity for us who love to jam out during our workouts!
0,Totally hard to use and stay on ear junk junk junk wouldn’t even donate them
1,"The ear buds feel like they are made of very good quality material and fit comfortably in my ears out of the case. The provided hard case is small and feels like it will protect the ear buds from damage.  Sound quality is really good for what I was looking for.  I use them to study and also listen to classical music so I wanted clear and soft which these provided.  For the support of hip hop and rock songs they are really good but won't compete with a beats or bose type headset.  They are in a great price range for what they provide.  The look is okay as they are big on the ears.  You won't go unnoticed with these on, but that wasn't a criteria for me so it was okay.  The drop from 5 stars to 4 stars is due to the range of the ear buds.  I don't expect them to go for a super long distance but I lost connection after only walking to the next room 15 feet away and didn't reconnect until I was within 10 feet again.  I think the benefit of having these ear buds is to be able to walk away from the phone in places like your house so losing this option was a little disappointing.  So far I have used for 1 day and am satisfied with the purchase.  I will update if I have issues with battery life or quality.<br /><br />Update 5/4/2017:  I have used for about 3 months and some of the issues I had early on haven't been as bad.  At first I couldn't keep a good connection with my phone even though it was in my pocket only 2 feet away.  After the first day of having this problem it hasn't returned which is a good thing.  The distance you are allowed to walk away from this headset is still a problem as it's not even 15 feet without any walls.  All in all a great purchase and happy with them."
1,"I’ve used them once so far but what struck me is how much this company takes the time to do the details.<br />-Packaging was a little tough to open but it is very clean and professional unlike some others.<br />-Earbuds are in a very durable case and clean with extra buds<br />-package contains goodies such as a car phone holder and a phone card wallet as well as a very helpful instruction booklet that is 100% English, not broken translated English, and a charging cord.<br />-******This is what caught my attention, the president of the company sent me a personal email regarding my satisfaction of the order.  That shows passion for a company to strive and that bought me into this 5 star rating.  Yes, everything else is fine but when an owner takes time out of his busy schedule to make sure you, the customer, are satisfied, that speaks volumes to me.  Awesome product and an awesome company."
1,I just got these. They sound phenomenal (I am not a sound geek so YMMV) for music and darn good phone call quality as well. Comfortable and had earbud tips that actually fit my tiny ear canals. I'm very excited about this purchase - the only thing that remains to be seen is longevity.
1,Good Bluetooth headphones they work great!
1,"It's wonderful !! Noise cancelling works perfect , very functional and  Love the color as well ."
1,The over the ear and bendable structure make them perfect for anyone that hates those insert earbuds that constantly fall out!
1,The best workout headphones I’ve ever used.
1,Great sound.<br />Changed my mowing experience.
1,"They arrived quickly when ordered and the instructions included were easy to read.  The buds were easy to sync with my phone, very comfortable and the sound is great.  Would definitely purchase again."
1,"I do a lot of running and a lot of traveling and I've tried now over 7 different pairs of Bluetooth headsets and these are by far the best in sound quality comfort and longevity. My only gripe is I wish there was a way to tell how much battery was left as one of the units I purchased would give you an hourly countdown. Other than that, I absolutely love these headsets and have purchased three of them. Two for me ( one that I use only for working out and then another one for daily use), and now one for my daughter. With other kids, I'm sure I will be buying more soon. Thank you for making such a good product Senso!"
0,They suck tthey worked one time and now won't pair with my iPhone I have had different people try it. Everybody says something is wrong with the buds
0,"If you are buying this headset to swim, please be aware that customer service advises only to use in the rain or shower, not underwater. I had to return. They shut down within 5 minutes of first swim."
1,Nice
1,I have only had them for a few day but they seem great. They were fully charged and I have been trying to drain the battery but it still halfway charged. I am exited to put these to the test on my next vacation. I would defiantly buy theses again.
0,"I originally had the Cheetah wireless headphones and they were good, the problem was I lost them. When I was ready to purchase another pair of wireless headphones I decided to spend a little more money hoping for better sound quality but instead I got a product that was worse than the cheaper ones I previously had. Sound quality was average, the cord connecting the two headphones is too long in my opinion, but the worst part is that I used them about 5 times after owning them for almost 6 months because they were always dead when I needed them and I had always charged them ahead of time. I later found out that they are charged and have 90% but they turn off on their own after being connected to my iPhone for not even 60 seconds. I would not recommend these headphones because they don't work anymore after minimal use."
0,"I've sworn by these over the years. Convinced my friends and family to buy them because they were fabulous. Well...I had to replace my pair after one of my pups decided to make them a chew toy. The new ones arrived today, and they are not the same as they once were. Absolute garbage. Sound is terrible, material is cheap. Something happened to this company. After singing their praises for so long, I am truly disappointed. 😢"
0,"The battery life is nowhere near what the product claims it to be, and there's no way to know the status of the battery before it reaches &#34;low battery&#34;. The sound quality isn't even up to par with $15-20 ear buds you can find at Target. These headphones are reasonably comfortable to wear, and not at all intrusive. Yet, for the ubiquity of wireless bluetooth headphones these days, the price of these are not at all worth it."
1,Battery life was 6 hours by my usage (intermittent at gym for a 5 day/week 1-2 hrs/ session gym week).<br />Don't stay put and constantly pushing them back in my ears
1,Good sound quality. Snug fit during workouts. Good value
1,"It does the job. Bluetooth connection is quick. Value of the price is decent.<br /><br />Challenges: when connected, sometimes the sounds break in and out or static noises for a second or two."
1,"My first set of wireless headphones; I had been hesitating to take the plunge. No regrets at all. It took less than a minute to pair with my iPhone 7S and my iPod. Sound is terrific, and buds fit well in my ears. I ran yesterday and the buds stayed on. Highly recommended!"
1,Its nice. Has a really good sound for its price. Works with my iphone and apple watch 3 which is great.
1,"Beautiful headphones, connect quickly to your device, aren't hard on the ears yet with amazing sound quality."
1,I have only had them for a few days but they are working great.
1,I really like the headset. I use it everyday. The sound is great and it is very light weight and handy. My husband and friends test it out and they want to get one too.
1,Bought these for my stepdad. He loves them and says they fit his ears very well. The sound quality is also great
1,"Good sound, light on the ears, good Bluetooth connection distance.<br />Excellent price!"
1,So far I am pleasantly pleased with my purchase of the senso wireless headset.  The true test came when talking to my wife while I was driving in miata and she thought I was in my company car.
1,They work as expected but one keeps falling out of my right ear. It is annoying. I considered returning them but I may just keep them.
1,"Has a really good sound quality, well built, and feels comfortable around you ears. Deep bass and clear sound. Pretty good headphones for the price."
0,"I have had these headphones for just over two months.<br /><br />Last night they were working fine. This morning, dead as a doornail, except less useful.<br /><br />Save your money, or spring for something better quality.<br /><br />You get what you pay for folks. These are obviously crap."
1,"Excellent packaging, great quality, aesthetically pleasing, work very well and by far the best fitting headphones I have ever worn."
1,Gets the job done for the price
1,"A great product and fantastic idea however it doesn't really stay in your ears. Wife tried it several times on a run, and returned carrying them in her hand. They kind of stay in for light gym workouts. The design needs to be refined so that it remains in your ear."
0,These were awesome for about 3 weeks and then died. Stay away
1,"I use the headphones at work for conference calls, when I'm working out, and when I'm doing chores around the house. I'm impressed with the sound and how comfortable they are."
1,Stayed powered on and placed on my ears throughout an entire Marathon. Great purchase for Runners.
1,"I needed a replacement for my Jaybirds that stopped working and I decided to give Senso a chance.  The price and style attracted me to this pair of headphones and after just a couple experiences I would say they work well.  They paired quickly with my apple watch and most importantly fit securely while running or making quick movements.  I was pleasantly surprised to see they came with one set up foam ear buds since I can't use the silicone (always pop out 3/4 through a work out)  The sound is good and well but I'd say the base is a little dominant.  I was not very happy with the blue tooth range as the signal become interrupted easily.  I like to where my apple watch on my left wrist and in doing so the signal was choppy since the controls on the headphones are on the right ear.  Simple fix - just moved my watch over but I'm use to several other brands of wireless and even wired having the controls over the left ear  (Jaybirds, Jabra).  Overall, good headphones for the price, music sounds good and can get loud but most importantly for me was a secure fit.  They stay in place!"
1,The cord was longer than expected but otherwise they work great for what we wanted. The zippered case is great
0,"Here's the deal...these headphones don't sound horrible and the battery life is pretty good.  They just don't stay connected.  I'm a distance runner and I bought these to use on 3-4 hour runs and within 15-20 minutes the headphones disconnect from my device and I'm left listening to my feet for the rest of the time.  I've tried everything I can think of: I've charged them right before a run, I've tried putting the device on a different arm, I've tried running when it's dry, I've tried running in the rain, I even tried just setting it on the device and home and seeing what would happen and they still disconnect.<br /><br />Look, I'd love to give these things a good review because I really do like the battery life but at the end of the day no matter how good the things sound or how long they last if they don't connect and stay connected they're completely worthless<br /><br />Don't buy them.  Spring for a more expensive name brand pair that'll keep working."
0,It does not stay on.  I just purchased this and it shuts off.
1,These are better than my Beats!
0,"There's no way to keep them on even for walking. They wiggle out of the ear within 20 seconds (I tried all plugs). But the design flaw is the silicon hook as it runs 0.5-1in above the ear, thus actually just makes things worse. And they can't be adjusted. Bought 3 pairs for my family, non of us could make them stay on."
1,Easy to use and comfortable. Sound quality is better than expected!
1,They are worth what they're being sold for
1,"I used to own a pair of $90ish bluetooth headphones, and I loved everything about them with the one exception of the troubles with talking to people over the phone. One day they broke and I couldn't afford new ones, so I looked for cheaper ones and these were the best rated for the best price. They absolutely live up. It's easy to talk over the phone which is a fantastic addition to my life, the range they have from my phone is really really good (10 or 20 feet maybe?), and the sound quality is prestine. I did add little plastic things to fit them inside my ear to keep it from moving around (I have no idea what that thing would be called), but these things are fantastic and very affordable. The battery life is pretty good, I'm not sure exactly how long it lasts but it gets me through a couple days generally. I wish that it was easier to find out how much battery was left before the annoying ""BATTERY LOW""  constantly going off in my ear, but I've more or less figured that out."
1,"Music is very clear, loved it so much I bought one for my wife"
1,They work great and comfortable
0,I purchased these in February ..used them for a few months then they broke about a month ago( the sound button stopped working)....just getting around to write the review.
1,"We bought a pair for my son after he lost his wireless beats.  He didn't notice a difference, so I recently bought a pair for myself.  We both love them!!!"
1,"Not bad at all. Stays in ears pretty well even on runs over an hour.<br />For the price, the sound is great also!"
1,"I own a JBL headset but they are a lot to carry around when traveling or at work. So I wanted Bluetooth earbuds to wear at work, home and travel. After looking and reading what's on the market as well as many reviews, I chose Senso earbuds.<br />Received them as promised ando gave them a test, and two hours later I was certain they were Amazing.<br />Great sound, clear and crisp. Great base and treble and everything going in between. And yhey are comfortable as well.<br />Received an email from the company asking how I liked my purchase. Now this is impressive.<br />So the bottom line is that I Highly Recommend this product."
1,"These buds are so cool , sound fantastic, feel comfortable, stay put and cost was ridiculously reasonable ! I've had custom earbuds fitted an molded to my ears for hundreds of dollars and they couldn't compare to these ! The accessories and packaging are way cool also ! Thanks I voted !"
0,Not waterproof.
1,"This product stopped working after only six weeks. I was very disappointed. Why the 5 stars?<br /><br />I contacted the seller. The company responded within 24 hours and sent me a replacement.  The headphones have great audio quality and also allow for easy, hands free communication"
1,Great sound and easy to use.
0,"I liked that it was wireless, and durable. Though it arrived and I charged it for an hour. I attempted to test it using the instructions. The battery only worked while plugged in. Headphones don't work while plugged into a power source. Look and feel cool though. Too bad they arrived defective. Still have them as paperweight, not worth the effort to return."
1,Great product! Customer service is wonderful!
0,The sound quality on these headphones suck. I purchased this brand years ago and after breaking them I thought I stick with it since I didn't haven't issues with the previous pair. I don't know what changes they made or if I just got a bad pair but the volume is SO low and the sound quality isn't good at all. The songs sound flat and I can still hear my TV on level 11 or people talking near me with no problem. Why fix what wasn't broken!?
0,These are not swimming headphones despite appearing under tags for waterproof and swimming. They are decent $20 headphones if you are active but look elsewhere for water proof/swimming head phones
1,"Work fine, I use them 5 days a week for 8 hours straight. They never fall out and last forever. The only thing is half the time I can't walk 5 feet away from my phone and other times I feel like I can be in a current county and the connection is still good."
1,Great!
1,"They work great, only thing is that they don't fit in the case very well with the foam ear pieces, other than that there great."
1,"Use these for running, they work great for music and staying put, while I run."
1,"Seems like a good build, audio software appears to be the same as the ODT chips I have in y snowboard helmet.<br /><br />The good - build quality, extra cables, chargers case etc.  Intuitive button controls.<br />The bad - sound is muddy.  They are plenty loud even on the lowest of settings, but the sounds is muddy, no highs to speak of."
1,Order 2 but one was empty. Their was no headphone in it.
1,"I enjoyed these headphones for about 4 months. Great sound, easy bluetooth connection. But I went to go use them about a month ago and they fell apart at the earbud. Bums me out, I really liked them!"
1,"Cuts out quite often - and will say &#34;disconnected&#34;, then 5 seconds later &#34;Connected&#34;.. wouldn't buy again. Bought two of them, one for me and one for husband.. both have same issues and we tried them on different devices to confirm the problem is with headphones."
1,Great sound quality. You can really rock out at the gym with these
1,Bought these to use when working out.  I can leave my phone in my gym bag and they work just fine with clear quality.
1,"Great bang for your buck, sound qualoty and bass is really good. I'm especially impressed with the battery life, it last around 8 hours with 1 or 2 hor charge time."
1,"Headphones work exactly as expected.  Sound quality is great and they fit perfectly for running or biking.  It took a little bit to figure out how to work the &#34;Universal&#34; button, but with a little practice, I can connect and disconnect with ease.  Added bonus that I can take phone calls too.  Very satified."
1,"The sound quality is amazing! They stay in place when running and are way more comfortable in my ear than the apple earbuds. I mainly bought these for doing yoga, though, and I was leary about whether they would stay put especially with my head upside down doing forward bends and all. And they do!! The case and charging cords are nice extra bonus too!"
1,"Excellent sounding headphones. Easy to pair and for the money, you can't go wrong."
1,Solid headphones. Work good and sync right up. Very good for the price
1,Good produce easy to set up and it came with 3 sets of buds and additional products that I did not expect.
0,"I liked these at first, but now (8 months after I purchased them), they have started malfunctioning. The sound cuts out for several seconds at a time, and they sometimes won't pair with my phone. I'm very disappointed that they have started having issues so soon after I bought them."
1,Excellent headphones. Work well beyond 3 feet of distance and comfortably fit without slipping. Really easy to set up (even for those of us who have never used bluetooth before) and great sound. Highly recommend.
1,"They work flawlessly, both for music and for accepting phone calls on my iphone. Fits snuggly but comfortably around and in the ears.  I've used the smallest ear buds (they provided three sizes) and they fit well."
1,Perfect gift.
1,Best wireless/Bluetooth headphones I've purchased out of five. Soft and comfortable on the ears and the battery doesn't weigh them down. Clear sound both listening and talking. Very happy with this purchase.
0,I was excited about this set because it has the ear hooks and they're wireless. Too bad they didn't work properly. The bluetooth kept disconnecting mid workout. Very frustrating👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
1,"Excellent great sound, easy to pair."
1,So far so good. I really like them.
1,Excellent sound quality.  Easy to set up and use.
1,"Don’t know , was a gift"
1,Very nice in the box pack. And a Top Gun sound and comfort!!!!
1,"Great sound, good battery life, charges quickly. Comes with all the accessories you may ever need. Good buy."
1,"Great headphones for the price. Only issue is, apparently the person I was talking on my phone with could hear himself echoing. I will not be using for phone calls. Just music while at the gym so hopefully this doesn't happen to every call I take. Noise canceling worked. Great volume. I would definitely recommend. Very easy to use."
1,"Hard to keep in ears. Could be a better fit.  Would have returned, but I forgot about them.  Maybe ok for teenagers, but not good if being active."
1,"Work fine, Bluetooth is very clear. Easy to operate especially with the directions. Fit my ear and stay put when active. Looking forward to using them over an extended time. Happy I bought them."
1,Love these earbuds!  They are a great value and work perfectly.
1,Easy to sync with phone. Comfortable to wear. Sound is clear.  Great purchase!
1,So far I love these. They work great and they’re comfortable. The only thing that drives me nuts is when the battery gets low it tells you basically with less than a song left of battery. I wish it let you know sooner. It will literally say “battery low” and then less than 3 mins later die. The icon that shows in the upper right hand of the screen of my iPhone isn’t super accurate I’ve noticed.<br />But they work great. I’ve been told the mic quality is pretty bad but I didn’t buy them for that. If you’re buying them to do conference calls I’d recommend a different pair or external mic.
1,Great product. Good sound quality. Battery lasts all day and it's easy to use.
1,i love the hearing
0,Never kept a charge after only using them a month.  Now they dont work at all!
1,It works fine for three years and now it cannot be charged.
1,"Purchased these for running, I am very happy with the quality sound and fit of these headphones!<br />If you are looking for light weight, high quality sound, at a great price, look no further."
1,Good quality product. I had a few questions about the product and the customer support and service response was excellent.
1,"Pleasantly surprised! They fit well, stay in place while running and moving around. Highly recommended! I’m so happy to found good quality that didn’t break the bank. Woohoo!"
1,"These headphones are a really good buy. They work really well on my commute. The Senso headphones have a really long battery life. It's been 4 days since I got them, and I have yet to recharge the battery."
1,"Great Headphones, work just as advertised. For the price they are loud with bass to me and I usually turn headphones up all the way I only went a little over half with these fully charged."
1,great long lasting charge and sweat proof was a top priority and we love these headphones
1,"The headphones deliver decent sound, but I still haven't found them to be extremely comfortable after an hour or so of use.  Have tried the different ear pieces and sizing seems to work, but not yet 100% convinced.  Don't think it is a problem with the product.... think it is a problem with my ear!  Easy to sync to my phone.  Really purchased to listen to music from my phone and have not had an opportunity to use all the other features.  Very impressed with the case, car charger, etc.. that ships with the product."
1,They have wonderful sound quality! They're also easy to use and shipped insanity fast. I will be ordering a set for my husband and for my mother.
1,"I was pretty impressed by the amount of care and quality of these headphones. They came with a carrying case, three sizes of rubber earpieces and one set of foam earpieces (sort of like disposable earplugs). The phone quality is crystal clear, and I can go upstairs and across my house away from my phone and stay in range. The battery life seems very long, too."
1,The headphones are decent. The over the ear part is flimsy and doesn't help keep the earphone in the ear. They keep fall off even when I'm just sitting down. I don't know how they will hold up in the gym if they can barely hold up in the office.
1,The wife loves these headphones!!!
1,"Pros: the ear pieces are held firmly and comfortably in place. The sound quality is very good. Cons: the &#34;tangle free cable&#34; that connects the ear pieces is by no means sturdy-looking or tangle-free. In fact it is thin, longer than necessary, wraps around itself and tangles, and tends to hang off to one side or the other. I personally would have preferred a more sturdy and shorter cable which would have been more aesthetically pleasing. The second problem is that when my iPhone (that has a case) is touching my skin at the gym, such as when I have it tucked at the inside belt of my yoga pants, the sound cuts off sporadically and quite noticeably. This problem is resolved when I move my iPhone to my pocket."
0,I can't believe how popular these headphones are on amazon. They might stay in my ears properly if I was laying down on my side.
1,"I love these headphones they are super comfortable, they have different size buds, they last a really long time and they turn off whenever your not using them so you reserve its battery life, also the sweatproof thing actually works, it has a high volume range for those that like to blow their eardrums out, or for those that just want to hear something on a low volume, these can do the job, and the sound quality is amazing.<br />$30.00 well spent<br />Great job Invotek"
1,These sound great. I use them when doing lawn work and they stay on when just buds fall out all the time. The rubber that goes around the ear is flimsy but holds them on. Great price
1,Very good for the price.
0,they stopped working after just two weeks
1,Very comfortable I use them while exercising.
1,Great headphones. Work great at the gym
0,The battery doesn’t hold its charge.
1,Awesome ear buds for the price! The loop that goes behind the ear holds it in place perfectly at the gym!
0,I did not get all the items listed in the box. Missing the following items:<br />Bonus Items:<br />• Dual Port USB Car Charger<br />• 3ft. Charging Cable for Apple (Lightening connector) and Android (Mini USB connector) Devices
1,"An exceptional product for my small ears, because they fit me and stay put while moving around.  The sound quality is exceptional and would make a great Valentine's Day present for someone special in your life."
1,"Delivery on time. Very easy to set up with transmitter, even for a low tech guy like me. Sound quality is excellent. Definitely recommend this product."
1,i bought two different bluetooth headphones this week and these are far superior than the other pair in the same price point. The noise reduction is very effective. Also have the new Bose 35 wireless for long flights but may try these next time to avoid bulk in bag. Great work SENSO. Great Product. Thank you
1,"Solid headphones. Would be nice if the ear loops were not as flimsy, but overall a good product."
1,I had a much more expensive pair that died after 1 short year.<br />I like the fit of these way better and the sound is great.
1,I like everything about this product. I would be recommending it  to all my friends and family
1,Poor range. I have a BT 4 set that works better. If you have your phone within 15' then fine and sound good for price.
0,"Unboxed, charged fully, and connected to my iPhone 6s Plus without issue.  Played some tunes and I was really disappointed by the sound quality.  The bass is very distorted, and the highs are nearly tinnitus inducing.  I'm by no means an audiophile, but man, these are terrible.  Everybody else seems to feel that these are fine, but I am not pleased.  Am I expecting too much from them?  I've had better sound quality from a cheap pair of wired buds I got at a dollar store.<br /><br />I also connected these to my laptop with similar results."
0,Wires started falling out of the ear piece after 2 uses.
1,Extremely comfortable and great sound clarity. People cannot tell I am on a wireless headset.
0,Stopped charging after 2 months
1,"Just got these yesterday. I love the packaging - the case is great, the cable is ingenious with the lightning cable and adapter for charging the headphones as well. Pairing with my iPhone 7 was so simple and the controls are easy to get used to. The sound is great. I tested the microphone to make a call and the call went fine. The only problem is that the lowest setting is a tad too robust when listening to music in a quiet environment. However, it seems this is an issue with other bluetooth headphones as well. Don't know if an adjustment needs to be made with the phone of with the headphones themselves."
1,"I ordered a pair of your headphones for my husband and he loves them!  In fact the day they came I tried them on and loved them too and have ordered a pair for me!  My grandsons all own a pair of Beats and id course think they are the best, but I had one of them use my husband's Senso's  and he was really impressed!  He was amazed of the sound quality and and ease of use of the controls.  Was also impressed with all the extras you get with the headphones including the carrying case.  And they you for all the extra's and the very sharp looking case!  We are going to be traveling soon and these will be perfect for us to have!"
1,"Just tried them out last night, awesome sound quality for my music. I don’t know yet how long the battery lasts. And as I use them more I’m sure I’ll be able to get the kinks out of the cord. Love the little carrying case for them."
1,"I think I got very lucky and received a great product. I have been using this for a while. Connected with my Android devices and works wonders, great quality. I used with my iPhone and the bass was too high, but it's due to the iPhone music quality, it's bass it's always boosted. I had to download an app to regulate the bass on my iPhone and it works amazing.<br />Great product, totally worth my money and more.  Also came with it's own extra earbuds, USB cable charger and car USB power adapter. (Does NOT come with wall adapter, it says that) other than that, I definitely recommend it. Of course, I compared the quality to boss headphone and skull Candy headphones audio quality and it's very similar quality to both at a cheaper price."
0,EN EL AUDIFONO DE ENSENDIDO SE LE VA EL SONIDO MUY MAL PRODUCTO
1,"Great for economical set.  I use when walking - normal ear buds don't work, these stay in better.  Sound is alright... like I said, good for price :)"
1,"Better than expected. Decent battery life, easy to use while running. Ear Loops are a little loose and don't help to stabilize much though."
1,"Given what I was looking for, this product deserves 5 stars.  I wasn't looking for top-of-the-line sound or the newest hip name brand product.  I wanted a pair of cordless earbuds I could workout in.  The sound is good.  If you're used to listening to $100+ headphones, you'll notice the difference. That being said, they're the only headphones I use now so I've adjusted and have no complaints.  The sweat proof feature was a perk I hadn't even thought of considering but I'm glad they are. The price is good compared to competitor products.<br /><br />They have the loop around the ear, but with how they fit they're basically there for show.  It doesn't really touch my ear.  Having said that, when the bud pops out of my ear I don't have to worry about it falling and getting damaged.<br /><br />Overall -- would recommend"
1,I bought these as a gift for my son who is a member of his college track team. He spends a lot of time running/training and needed a good pair of wireless earbuds. I was pleased with the price and he says they work well and the sound quality is very good.  I'm thinking of getting a pair for myself!
0,Cuts out every few seconds when outside or certain parts of my house. Cannot use for calls or music.
1,Best wireless headphones I've bought and owned. I've had many headphones prior to these in the same price range and this is superior to them all. I have been using it in the gym for a couple of months and it held up very well. Sound is amazing and holds a charge. I normally use it for about an hr to 2 hrs in the gym and this thing would last about 3 days with 1 charge. Absolutely happy with this purchase. Great bang for the buck.
1,I used them for the first time today and they performed wonderfully.  The instructions on charging and pairing the headphones to my iPhone were very easy to understand and follow.  Everything worked as advertised and I love them.  Thank you.
1,At first I couldn't get them to work. But they work just fine.
0,"Product had issue with the noise cancelling or something. When riding my bike, the audio would constantly cut in and out. I think it had something to do with the microphone, or noise cancelling, as when I stopped or slowed down, the issue would resolve itself. Contacted customer support and they suggested I do a factory reset, but that also didn't work, as I could duplicate problem by simply blowing a hair dryer across the headphones. For me, the earbud for my left ear was uncomfortable  as it didn't fit MY ear. In the car, or in the house, they were fine, but that's not the reason I purchased them. I also wished the over the ear piece was a little more firm, as it would not stay over the top of my ear. These units just didn't work for me, but may work fine for you."
1,Sounds really good but sometimes they cut in and out
1,"So I hardly ever comment about items, however this product warrants one. To begin, I do not know the seller, and I was not paid for my comments. These head phones were bought specifically to use when I cycle. Having a heart rate monitor on, wires, dog repellant, it gets to be a royal pain in the ......... So far, these are incredible. The sound, volume control, fit and the ease of connecting to blue tooth devices have been unreal. Today I was 22 miles out on a ride and caught in a pretty good rain storm. Know to be honest I did take them off so I could here vehicles over the rain, but they did get a good soaking, and so far so good. I cannot comment on the battery life yet but as the cycling season progresses, I will include further updates. I have to say, if you are looking for earbuds give these a try. For my application, so far so good"
0,"both my dad & I bought these.  They were great for several months, and then both stopped pairing with iPhones, Kindle Fires, etc.  I've done all things that the manufacturer advises to troubleshoot, but no good.  Very disappointing."
1,"I will be honest I was apprehensive at the sound when I ordered, but these are amazing!!! I have 2 pair of Beats by Dre and these sound as good and at a fraction of the price!!!!"
1,"I received my headphones about a week or so ago.  So far I have been incredibly happy with them.  My one wish, this is true of all earbuds, is that they had smaller earpieces. I have small ears and the earpieces that come with almost all earbuds are too big causing discomfort after short periods of time. Senso earbuds are slightly uncomfortable for extended periods due to this issue."
1,Awesome ! Just what I was looking for. Great price and sound.
1,"Nicely designed, high quality, feels & looks good in hand. Clear & crisp sound quality."
1,"Quality is so good and so easy to use, I bought a second one for my daughter because she wanted mine."
1,"My recently purchased SENSO Wireless ActivBuds Bluetooth Headphones are exactly what I have been looking for for sometime.  I am fairly active participating in a daily (5-6 times weekly) personal exercise program.  Having wireless bluetooth earbuds allows me to exercise without concern of  the headphones falling out of my ears.  At the same time experiencing excellent sound quality.  I have also recently began using my SENSO Wireless ActivBuds Bluetooth Headphones while watching programs on our Samsung SUHD Smart TV.  This has allowed me to eliminate the wireless headphones which were bulky but provided the sound desired while watching TV.  The SENSO unit is much lighter and, again has excellent sound quality, equal to the wireless headphones.  All in all, I am very appreciative of the quality of the SENSO unit I purchased.  As I've said before when comparing various products for possible purchase,  &#34;Excellence in quality is the competitive edge!&#34;  Thank you SENSO!!"
1,I bought this for my young adult grandson.  So far so good!  He loves it.
0,"ear plug cracked, very fragil plastic. two month after purchase"
1,I like it
1,These are great headphones so far. I received it last week and worn them during my workouts ever since! The sounds is awesome and no more wires to deal with! Thanks for everyone's feedback through amazon I really like these!
1,"They work great!  They synced easily with my iPhone 7.  It's easy to turn on and off, pause and adjust the volume.  Still trying to figure out a good way to wear them so they stay in, so I'm adjusting the size of the part that goes in your ear."
1,My order arrived on time.  I had no problem &#34;pairing&#34; the headphones to my iphone.  It's so much nicer at the gym to not have cords getting in the way or hung up on something and pulling earphones off my ears!  Worth the $$.
1,"Great set of headphones.  Bluetooth pairs up effortlessly.  They sound like much more expensive pairs, great overall sound.  I wish the BT distance was a little longer, but that is a BT issue, not the headphones.  All in all, job well done!"
1,Simple to connect and works perfectly.
1,Best Bluetooth ever
1,Outstanding Performance for a Reasonable Price
1,"These are the best Bluetooth earset I have ever used. They sound great, have very good battery life 8+ hours of continuous use listening to audio books, they pair up instantly with my iPhone, and my Apple TV. The people I talk to on the iPhone tell me I sound great. The fact they are very comfortable for long period of wear is frosting on the cake."
1,the sound is good and they seem to be holding up well
1,"I'm so glad the wireless earbuds I bought at walgreens bit the dust, because these Senso buds blow the cheaper ones through the roof.  These things give a nice deep bass or lows, balanced with clean highs.  It is like wearing mini stereo headphones, because the bass is there.  They appear like quality earbuds, nothing cheap at all.  The earbuds I bought at Walgreens, had a cheapish feel, and they cost me 25 bucks on sale, until I returned them.  These with the case, and extra cable and parts, you won't be able to match the price anywhere in my opinion."
1,"These earbuds work well, but sometimes they slide around your ear and come out just a little bit. Other than that though they are a great product."
0,"Had a pair 2 years ago, they were great, loved them. Just bought a new pair and sound quality was extremely poor. Too bad, these were my favorite."
0,"Update: 2 months later they don't even work anymore.<br /><br />These came in 6 days ago. Took them out, they looked great. Made sure they were fully charged and started using them the next day. First thing I noticed was the sound quality was a little off. Any music with bass sounded awful. Today, 6 days in, I get a “power low” notification. I check and it’s at 30%. A minute later they shut off. I turn them back on, still at 30%. Shortly after get power low notification and they shut off again. Would not recommend these headphones."
1,the amount of sound i get out of these is crazy. i use the foam ear ends- and it blocks out a lot.
1,"Great sound, bass is amazing. Stays put through a whole cardio session."
0,"Sound is ok, but really disappointed in the connecting speaker wires and fit in ears.  They don't fit well, even with several earpieces to use.  The connecting wire is a thin stretchable plastic."
1,I like them
1,"These are a no-brainer, they sound as good/better than the Beats and they're only $30.00"
1,"Batteries last quite a while. They connect easily, good sound. You can wear them for hours. Good for working out, great for Youtube on your phone."
1,"These were purchased as an incentive for our company wellness program.  Most will not get used until fall.  I have tried one set to see how they work and so far, I like them.<br />Thank You"
0,"These are horrible! Super flimsy, looks and feels cheap, and won't even stay in my ear despite how many hooks and buds they have. Save your time and money."
1,"Just what I've been looking for: affordable, comfortable, stay-in-place, easy-to-use-and-adjust earbuds. Wireless, too. The sound is just fine. Not noise cancelling for those who need that but using the best size bud-cover for your ear helps diminish extraneous sound. Easy to pair with devices. Location of sound/track buttons very convenient. A nicely designed item tucked away in  a small but substantial round case."
1,These work great on two devices too.
1,"Amazing wireless headphones!  The sound is great with comfort, too!  They paired right up with my iPhone per instructions with minimal effort.  Although I initially had some difficulty with my iPhone not turning off the headphones when disconnected for the SENSOS, I learned that a longer press on the SENSO button did the trick. The voice alert to charge the SENSOS was very helpful. Also, a voice alert informs when you are connected and ready to go.  I think the SENSOS provide an excellent choice for wireless listening with a cost that is a fraction of others out on the market.  I highly recommend these!"
1,"I am pretty satisfied with the headphones. As others have stated, pairing them can be a little challenging at times but overall I plan on using them with my laptop exclusively. Additionally, I like the sturdy carrying case that comes in the box and I really liked the long charging cable. Since I am a student, having only one cord in my backpack that can charge my micro USB devices and my iPhone is a plus! Overall, the price was right and I haven't had any issues after several days of usage."
1,Cheap wireless inear headphones. However they broke inside my backpack while not in the case....might have been my fault.
1,Great product these headphones are as discribed. One thing I have noticed is that I now hear backround sounds with great clearity which some of my high end headphones do not have. Thanks
1,excellent quality and sound
1,Just started using them.  Sound is great.  Easy to use.  Nice extras.
1,Sound amazing for price
1,I liked the product but the zipper on the case broke immediately and since I use these mainly for the gym I really was disappointed since I wanted to be able to keep them in my gym bag.  I contacted the company and they responded immediately and are sending me a new case.  Great customer service!!!
0,"Disclaimer: I bought these on my account, not my wife's Amazon account that I'm leaving this review on currently before my wife and I got married and since I haven't used my account in 12 or more months I can't leave the review under the correct account I purchased these under.  Still works but the speakers are both blown from listening to the music too loud. These can't handle repeated sweat, use, and loud listening from me at the gym. Lasted about 3 months before they blew out. These would probably work great for most people but if you push products to the limit like I do, these won't cut it for you."
0,Ok
1,"I haven't had these headphones for too long, a few weeks or so. But so far these have been awesome, they connect great most of the time and are great for when I'm running or working out."
1,"Initial review is an excellent sound quality.  Takes some getting used to the controls.  That said, I am wearing them going 50 to 60 miles an hour on a motorcycle and enjoying every song!"
1,I have been really happy with my purchase. Durable and good sound.
1,Good Product
1,"For the price it does what's needed but not very good quality when it comes to the sound, luckily I don't care much for that when doing little workouts lol"
1,Ordered 1 pair and loved them. Ordered a 2nd pair and had problems with them and they sent me out a new pair no questions asked
1,"Good headphones, slightly uncomfortable at first. Stays in ear without that half loop around your ear, bud can hold in place. buds dont fall off. volume is louder then normal which i like. Voice is a bit weird, but music has decent bass. plus they included alot of cables, extra buds, car usb, and case.<br />Doing strength lifts and oly lifts used to shake wireless headphones off my head, wires get pulled from barbell, but these headphones stay in place for squats, full cleans, OHP. easy to put wire in front of you for squats and behind you for cleans and presses. would buy again! Also buds dont fall off and get lost like my wireless samsungs lvl U"
1,"Great fit, good sound. Exactly what I wanted."
0,"I used these for about two weeks and am returning now. The headphones are superb indoors but as soon as I move outside even a gentle breeze (3 mph/5 kph)) gets amplified so that it sounds like a gale or a storm making it very difficult to hold a conversation on the phone, and impairing the quality of sound if listening to music. On SESNO's suggestion, I reset my unit to factory settings but it didn't work. Which is a pity because the headphones are quite comfortable and SENSO was prompt in response to my emails."
0,"Purchased these for running as they were described as waterproof, sweatproof, and specifically for running in the description.<br /><br />Sadly they're hardly usable for running as the wind noise they generate drowns out the music. Even with little to no breeze, and running at a slow pace you hear a ton of wind.<br /><br />They're also super bulky and protrude out of your ear quite a bit giving a goofy look in my opinion. Surprised at the number of positive reviews.<br /><br />I suppose if you're not active these could work out as they sound nice when not moving, but definitely not good for runners."
1,"These were a purchase for my 15 year old son. He goes to the gym, sailing and is very active. He tells me they are super comfortable and have great sound. The fact that they are sweat and waterproof is great. Definitely recommended."
1,"These where a gift, the person said they are awesome and the sound is great"
1,These are great for runners.  And unbeatable for the quality and price.
1,The part that goes around the ears is a little stiff and still hasn't quite broken-in which is why I gave the material 3 stars.  The ear inserts are also not quite the right size for me which makes them a little challenging.  But I do like to hear noises around me when I am walking/running so it actually suites my needs nicely to not be a tight fit.  Overall this is a great product for the price and I would purchase them again!
1,Great sound and build quality and easy set up. I use them when running and they don't jar loose despite the comfortable fit.
1,"Works well as described, used in the hot tub this evening! Joys of Bluetooth and waterproofing! Made a call as well and heard/spoke fine.  Great value for the price!"
1,Great product! Great price! Better than beats for way less!
0,"I set these headphones up a few days ago and they seemed to work fine. As soon as I get outside and try to use them they suddenly won’t connect to my cell phone anymore. I tried rebooting and reinstalling and all of that. Nothing worked, the headphones don’t work. I’m so sad. I hate investing in products that disappoint so damn quickly."
0,"Look for the edit below.<br /><br />My response to 5-star bluetooth headphones working for 20 mins straight, should not be &#34;Wow, they're actually working?&#34;<br /><br />Music and general sound quality: 7/10, pretty decent, although it struggles with cymbals and high-hats.<br />Mic quality during phone calls: 1/10,  Very bad. I made 8 calls, and the people on the other end said they could hear everything around me, and it stifled my voice.<br />Bluetooth stability, the main reason why you buy these: 0/10, these things worked, stably, without the sound dropping in and out, for approximately 20 mins out of the hour I was walking around town. And when they didn't work, I would hear every other syllable, or the sound would just drop out completely.<br /><br />Terrible, terrible headphones. Will be returning.<br /><br />Edit: The customer service and tech support was fantastic for these. I contacted them about the issues and they got back to me in a matter of hours.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Their fix was not enough to save from a very mediocre experience with the headphones. Short version, if you've been using Iphone default line-in headphones and are finally looking for something better, these are perfect for you. If you're an audiophile like myself and are use to line-in bose in-ear headphones, skip these and pay the hundred for top audio and bluetooth connection.<br /><br />IMO, audio 7/10, call quality 2/10, versatility and bluetooth ability 6/10. They're ok."
1,Fantastic product and customer service. One of the earbuds stopped working after a few months so I contacted the company. They sent me a replacement pair for free. Absolutely great product. Sound is great. I will buy again for my other family members! Highly recommend.
1,The bass is great. The charge last forever. The memory foam cushions they include are the most comfortable. The only feature I would add in addition is the ability to activate Siri. Absolutely 100% recommend these headphones
1,"These have been fantastic for over a couple of months now. I have only had them die on me once, and they have been able to hold charge for at least 5 days at the gym @ 2hrs a day. I have also taken them snowboarding and survived an 8 hour day. They have been exposed to hot, cold, sweat, rain, and still keep on kicking.<br /><br />The only thing I do not like is that bluetooth can be a little spotty to connect to if you are using multiple devices. They have been difficult to use between my phone and computer in the sense of getting them to pair correctly."
1,The sound quality is amazing. The user guide is easy to follow and super helpful. And it arrived a day earlier than estimated!! 💜
1,Just got them out of the box and they are fantastic. Great sound quality (and I'm a bit of an audiophile) the little hooks keep them on your ears really nicely and they're made of soft rubber so they aren't going to be irritating like most other hook style headphones. I've been walking around my apartment with no connection issues whatsoever. Super comfortable even with a ski mask on. It even came with 2 USB cords (one had an attached adapter for an iPhone or android charger) and a usb car adapter with a fast charge slot. Way nicer than I was expecting. I would buy it again without hesitaion.
0,Only lasted 11 months before one ear went out
1,Comfortable and nice looking. One side has a hissing sound
1,Very comfortable and don't slip
1,Battery life is great. Sound quality is very good. Fit is very good. Only draw back would be thw cord between the ear jacks. It can get caught on your collar. I definitely recommend purchase.
1,"After reading a number of positive reviews for these headphones I made the switch.  It was one of the best purchases i have made recently.  I have a hard time with earbuds, specifically in one ear.  They always fall out.  Along the same lines I never was a fan of headphones that hooked over the ear because after a lengthy wear my outer ear will get sore. These are the best of both worlds.  Soft outer support and a perfect inner ear shape that stays in through even the toughest workouts.<br /><br />Like a lot of the other reviews here the sound is amazing.  I actually have never turned the volume all the way up as i am sure it would do some damage.  Good bass and great overall sound.  It is funny that I am noticing that some of my favorite songs are sounding different because of the high quality of these headphones.  For the price, you cannot beat it. Don't think just buy."
1,"The Senso package came in a very timely manner with everything promised in the box.  The instructions that came with the package are short and straight to the point, nothing to sift through to get to what you need.  They were simple to connect to my iPhone.  As the package describes, these are sport wireless earbuds.  When I exercise walked this morning I had no issues with them falling out.  I wear glasses and had no interference or discomfort.  Ease of use was great, basically everything I needed while in use was at the tip of my right finger.<br /><br />Now for the sound: When I exercise I want something base-y and loud.  These earbuds were AWESOME!  I am so pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I would definitely buy these again and suggest them to a friend.  For the price and year warranty it's worth it for sure."
1,These earphones are very comfortable while running. They have a very long talk time and are comparable to beats sport earphones but are way cheaper. With all of the pluses about these earphones the customer service is even better. My right earphone starting losing sound then the whole thing fell off. I emailed senso customer service and  they replied within 24 hours and provided some advice. The sent a new pair of earphones soon after. It's good to see such a good product with exemplary customer service.
1,They don't stay in my ears very well and aren't as comfortable as I had hoped.
1,"Best ones yet, great bass and souind"
1,"The high stars is because it totally serves the purpose I need: wireless, stable, comfortable headphones for working out.<br />But the sound quality is not great; you basically loose most to all bass section so it really changes the dynamic of the song. And the terrible section can be a little too tiny/bright.<br />If aren’t using these for professional sound you’re fine. It’s nice enough to work but not so expensive I feel like I can’t throw them in my gym bag and forget about them."
1,"Very nice ear buds and at a great value, can't believe I found a pair like these at this price"
1,I use these headphones for running and lifting at the gym and they work great.For the price I would highly recommend them. There is no need to go spend 100+ bucks on other &#34;beats&#34; headphones.
1,Very Happy
1,"Really good  sound, 8 hrs of battery life, fits securely, built very well. Three earbuds sizes included"
1,"Nice packaging, inlcudes: car charger, case and two charging cords (1 for home or office/1 for car).  Used them at the gym this morning and sound quality is good."
1,Great sound! The fit is much better on the ears over other models I have purchased in the past.
0,Has terrible buzzing noise and phone calls sound like you're on speaker phone.
1,"For the money, these are by far the best bluetooth headphones I've ever had. Clear crisp sound, they sit solid in your ears during a run, comfortable. Just ordered a second pair for my wife!"
1,Headphones arrived on time.  The sound quality is better than I expected.
0,This is a really bad product !!  When did after a month !!
0,"Both sets of these stopped charging after limited use. Sadly, it is too late to return or exchange them. We tried a third pair and had the same issue--they are being returned today."
0,"Before I go into my review, I'm going to clarify something: These are listed as being on sale for $37 when they are supposedly $170 headphones. These aren't even worth $80, and I'm not a fan of the &#34;look how great of a deal you're getting these are normally SO expensive.&#34; I figured the original price would be inflamed a little bit, but not by $130. I would have considered something else had I realized this.<br /><br />For the actual review part; I'd consider it about a 3.5 star bundle FOR $37. It comes with a car charger, a nice case, an adapter, different buds for your ears, and the actual headphones. The wireless connection is stable, the battery life is pretty long, and they fit comfortably in your ears.<br /><br />But the most important part of my review is about the poor sound quality. Most of the music I listen to has a fair amount of bass, and it can be completely overpowering to the rest of the song with these headphones. The highs are not very sharp, and generally the sound is muffled. I can't comment on the mic but it doesn't really matter, I got these for running and will be getting a different pair for general use. These are nothing special for $37 (and it's extremely distasteful to market them as an ex-$170 pair imo). Even my $20 skullcandy wired headphones produced much better sound quality surprisingly (and I never considered them good). Also, it might just be my pair, but they need to be positioned correctly to charge. However the battery life is long enough that it doesn't bother me.<br /><br />Finally, connecting them to a different device is a hassle. I have other bluetooth devices and the only way to pair them to something else is by disabling bluetooth on the device they're currently connected to.<br /><br />These could be great for you and the sound quality might not bother you. I make music as a hobby and have sort of developed an ear for equalizing songs, so it's possible I'm just noticing what others don't. But it's extremely noticeable to me. And just to reiterate, I'm not grading these as $37 headphones, I'm grading these as $170 headphones on sale for $37, because that's what it's listed as at the time of this review."
1,They stay on my ears without pain.  I sew for hours and listen to audiobooks.  These keep me listening in comfort.
1,Theses wireles ear buds charge up quickly and the sound is amazing. Used them on a plane trip on chrstmas day and they worked like a charm.
1,"There's not much to be said that's not already been said with over 23,000 reviews...These only fit my ears with the foam inserts.  Your mileage may vary but with the other inserts, the headphones fell out of my ears.  That doesn't take any value away from the headphones for me however since they work great with the red foam inserts.  I'm not an audiophile so as long as they sound &#34;good&#34; then it's OK with me and these fit in that category just fine.  My only complaint is the wind noise and it's minimal while running.  I've never listened to the name brand to which this model competes but for the price I think this model certainly &#34;beats&#34; the rest."
1,Good
1,"Quality sound, easy to use and well worth the cost.  Worked out with them and nice to not have to worry about hanging wire. Comes with charger wires and car charger, plus carrier case. Very pleased good product!"
1,These headphones are great! They make my life a lot easier. I don't feel like I'm tethered to my devices. The sound quality is really great for phone calls. I really like that the headphones don't fall off of my ears.
0,"Very disappointed.  The packaging and instructions were very nice, but the Bluetooth and sound quality were just plain awful.  The connection cut out constantly.  I suppose you get what you pay for, guess I have to spend the money to stick with the Bose quality I'm used to."
1,Awesome price. Outstanding charger for home and car. Live the package.
1,"This is my first purchase of Bluetooth headphones.  I was looking for something that was light weight, deliver good sound quality, and wouldn't break the bank.  These work just fine for all three categories.  They fit snugly and don't fall out, and the carrying case is great.  The sound quality is not the greatest, could be clearer.  I tried to look at how to adjust the EQ level but it appears to just have one type.  Perhaps someone who reads this can help me out.  There have been several times where the connection cuts out, but it is not a recurrent problem and usually goes away within one minute.  Overall I am happy with the purchase, and would definitely recommend for the price."
1,Great sound and fits well! Long battery life.
1,at first they were great comfortable easy to use sound great but now they are beeping only after a few minuites as if the battery is dead and the beeping keeps up until they die in about 20 min I would like to have them replaced.
1,Excellent sound and the microphone is clear.
1,"Impressive quality, excellent sound and thoughtful, comprehensive packaging. A home run!"
0,"Bought these in the end of April 2017, and now they have completely stopped working. Only 4 and a half months later. They first started skipping in one ear and then just stopped working all together. Prior to them malfunctioning they were awesome. So  dissappointed.<br />I received a replacement pair and now 14 months later this pair has completely stopped working. Even though the warranty is two months over they will not replace them!<br />If you want earbuds that last less than a year then get these it’s planned obsolescence in my opinion and throwing good money away!"
1,"Love them, easy to use, nice design, the battery lasted the whole day!"
1,These are the best Bluetooth headphones I've used in a long time. Plus the price is fantastic! Definitely recommend.
1,Sound quality is great.  Design could be better for fitting into ears.<br /><br />I wish they'd make the over-ear pieces bendable to fit to individual ears.  These were too big & thus superfluous so I had to cut them off.
1,I love the product. I'm glad I tried this one first than buying an expensive one.
1,"Extraordinarily pleased, great sound and battery life is awesome. I thought that I was not going to be pleased since I use Bose wired headset and bought these for working out. Sound is close to my Bose as far as I am concerned and would recommend to everyone. My son is now wanting a pair for himself too now."
0,I like the way that they fit. The sound was good  I purchased three pair of these and hardly worn them five or ten times. One pair will light up like they are charging with the red light. But when I go to turn them on nothing happens.  I feel like taking a hammer 🔨 to them. Instead I just tossed them. I have two pair left. We will see what happens.
1,Work great
1,my 14 year old loves these and I love that I did not spend a ton since he tends to lose things...so good price decent quality
1,"I received my first set as a gift and loved them.  When those went belly up I purchased these.  Identical item by part and model number however, definitely NOT tye same quality. These feel cheaply made.  Material is different.  I'll be surprised if they last as long as my first set did."
0,"I bought these headphones because they had good reviews, specially for the fact that reviews said they were good for fitting small ears and great for working out.<br /><br />I have very small ears and these headphones fit very uncomfortably, despite there being three different sizes to choose from.<br /><br />Also, when working out, specifically running the cord in the back is very long so it bounces up and down which is really annoying.<br /><br />Overall, I would not purchase again."
1,"Very comfortable, great sound. Almost forget I'm wearing them. Very good product!"
1,they were ok. didn't stay in my ear as good as I would have liked
1,A little large so they don't fit as well as beats earphones but you can't beat the price...
1,"I needed a good, reliable set of wireless headphones to wear while working out. I've had a couple failures from other manufacturers and thought I would try one more time. This set arrived on time with a full array of accessories. Very easy to set up and use. Comfortable and they stay in place while I'm running or jumping around. Very happy with my purchase and customer service!"
0,This product is absolute crap.  They broke after having them for a little over two months.  Also my first time wearing the over the ear with glasses.  The ear piece and my glassed kept hitting each other and making a knocking sound.  Very annoying too.
1,Amazing sound quality! Fast shipping! It even came with an iPhone 5 charger and car charger that I was not expecting! Thinking about ordering a second pair!
1,So far everything I expected and more. They sound great and the fit is great thanks
1,"To update my initial review, I started hearing out of only one earbud, so i emailed for support. The same day I had a reply with a detailed process to troubleshoot by reverting to factory settings, then reconnect with my iPhone. Withing 10 minutes the problem was reolved, and i didn't even have to wait for a new set to come by mail. More great service!<br /><br />I love these earbuds; they not only solved my problem with the iPhone 7's new headphone input, so I can charge it while listening, but also allow me to control audiobooks and music I listen to without having to fiddle with the phone at all. Just touch a control button on the right earpiece to change volume, move forward or back, power on and off. The sound quality is excellent for the price and I was able to stay connected to my iPhone 7+ while walking the length of the house and several walls away. The package with a free car charger and carrying case make these buds an insane value for $37. About four months in, they just stopped working inexplicably. I emailed the company on a Sunday and got a response within minutes! When their troubleshoot couldn't fix them, they sent out a replacement product the same day. So as much as I like the product and was disappointed that they stopped working, I give them an A+ for customer service."
1,Sound quality<br /><br />one star<br /><br />two stars<br /><br />three stars<br /><br />four stars<br /><br />five stars<br /><br />Battery life
1,"Great sound, battery has a decent life too."
1,"My wife says they fall out of her ears sometimes, but other than that, the sound is great."
1,"Easy to use right out of the box, easy pairing. Sound was better than I thought for the cost.  I haven’t had a chance to really put them through a hard run of exercise, but so far so good"
1,This is my second pair.  They are great and the company is fantastic!!!
1,"for the price, you can't beat the quality!"
1,The sound is great
1,Better than expected! Down side I have small ears it keeps falling off.  Best is the dual purpose charger for iPhone and android
1,"I bought these headphones because I was tired of the cords on my wired headphones being in the way during my workouts. After reviewing articles on wireless headphones and reviewing Amazon reviews, I chose these. I've had them for four weeks and have been very happy.<br /><br />Ease of pairing -- Excellent. I had no trouble pairing these with my iPhone.<br />Noise reduction/cancelation -- Excellent. I find that these greatly reduce background in the gym and at home. I can set the volume at a much lower level than I was able to with other headphones that promised noise reduction. I do not recommend them if you're looking for noise reduction/cancelation on an airplane.<br />Ease of use -- Excellent. Pressing on a large button on the right headphone turns the unit on and off. The volume on and off button are on the top of the right headphone.<br />Sound -- Excellent, although I'm not an audiophile and generally listening to podcasts rather than music.<br />Battery life/charging.-- The battery life is very good. I've averaged about 7 hours of use per charge and charging generally takes about an hour and a half. My one complaint and the reason I took away a star is that the headphones don't give you much warning that the battery is low. The two times it's happened to me, I've gotten about 5 minute audible warning before it powers off. If you're working out, it's probably just an inconvenience, not a problem.  If you're just starting out a long call, it could be a problem. An audible warning at 50%, 25% and 5% battery life left would be very helpful.<br />Phone reception -- Excellent. I could hear without any problems and people had no problem hearing me.<br /><br />Overall, these are very solid headphones and a great value."
0,"I purchased these to use with my Apple Watch when working out and I don’t know if I got a defective pair or what but they were terrible on so many levels. They’re awkward to put on, didn’t pair easily, and wouldn’t maintain a bluetooth connection longer than 2 seconds (and I really mean 2 seconds) unless I LITERALLY held my wrist up next to my ear... again, not sure if they were defective or if they just don’t have a bluetooth range greater than 6 inches but I ended up carrying them in my hand the rest of my run home because they were that bad. They were fully charged but not overcharged. And I so wanted to like these - extremely disappointed."
1,"Loves these headphone, work great"
1,Love them
1,"&#34; I made sure that the reviews are true, kind a hesitant to buy this at first but i was just stunt with all the reviews i had read. I could really tell that it's worth the penny!... can't wait to use mine for my workout. thank you for all the reviews it helps a lot! &#34;"
1,"11/22 - Updating my review - I loved the headphones, they worked just perfect. But they have been acting very weird the last few days, sound goes on and off, seems like is not connecting very well to any of my devices.<br />Previous Review - They work really good, battery last a long time. I've worked out three times (1h30m) and they still have a lot of battery left. Sound is really good"
1,I will never buy beats headphones again. This does the same thing and I wont ferl bad if I lose them or they stop working.
1,"I use these to work out 5 days a week. They have done well so far. They have about 7 hours of use and charge fast, but the sound is deep. Like they wanted extra base but also added in a cavern. Changing the settings on your phone didn’t add to the quality to me. If you can get past that the case, variety of ear pieces, malleability of the behind the ear parts, and the easy functions make this a good buy."
0,Update. They just quit. They will not charge and I'm having a hard time returning them. They are supposed to have a 1 year warranty. Very nice. Battery seems to last forever. Replaced my Bose Bluetooth headphones with these. The Bose didn't last a year
0,"I bought 2 pairs. One for myself and one as a gift. I found them to be very uncomfortable after more than 30-45 minutes. The sound is great. When they work. One pair, the volume button stopped working after a month. The second pair completely died in 2 months. Very unhappy."
1,"These are by far the best headphones I have ever purchased--great sound, comfortable fit, and exceptional battery life."
0,"These headphone are not made to last , I bought about 3 pairs and was gifted two. I assumed it was my fault because i wore them to the gym and they would get sweaty but now that I haven't been working out and they still keep breaking I know that these are not made to last and their cheaply made"
1,Incredible bang for your buck. I absolutely love these headphones. With so many Bluetooth devices connecting and pairing with a device can be a pain...this has been a breeze with everything so far. Good sound quality and comfortable.
0,"Cut out if my phones in my pocket in the city. Sound is terrible. Says battery is at 70% until all of a sudden it's dead (though does last 3 or 4 hours). Would not buy again.<br /><br />***** UPDATE, FAILED ENTIRELY AFTER 5 MONTHS *****"
1,"A while back i bought the Jabra pulse earbuds - bluetooth @ $199  The battery only lasted the max 3 hours and when i tried to turn the Jabra earbuds off i didn't receive an acknowledgement so maybe that was the cause of the battery life.  The SENSO bluetooth headphones are quality headphones.  They wrapped around my ears securing so they will not fall out; sound quality was equal to the Jabra earbuds; and the ackownledgement turning the on and off was absolutely clear and to the point.  Unlike the Jabra set the multifunctional button was useful.  The only reason i bought the SENSO is because the Jabra battery died and I couldn't afford to buy another set for $100-200.  Don't be judgemental on the price tag of the SENSO headphones @ $19.94 from amazon, they're quality.  Since I've received my SENSO I've used them for a short time (2 weeks) - used them on 3 run and my 2 bike rides while listening to music.  However, I have not used them for my calls as of yet.  I totally recommend anyone to buy them for under $20."
1,Buenos . Un poco pegajosos
1,"Excellent fit, connects in less than a second, sounds great."
1,"I needed a set of bluetooth headphones for work, got tired of being tangled up in a wired model. These hold a good 8+ hours every day, sound pretty decent for streaming audio and have an amazing range, a couple hundred feet easily before the signal drops. It usually reconnects once back in range, but occasionally I have to &#34;force&#34; connect it back at the computer. Good fit and have several tips for different earhole sizes, nice carrying case also. Just get used to charging every night, you can't use them while charging even with a long enough cable.<br /><br />Update: After almost a year of use, the battery life of 8 hours held strong, but the physical connection on the left earpiece from the cord  became loose causing a horrible crackling, intermittent connection. Customer service was fantastic, had me try a few things and when the problem persisted, they sent out a brand new set (with all the accessories!) right away. The 2nd pair is a little &#34;stiffer&#34; and oddly don't fit as well as the originals but sounds just as great."
0,Stopped working with in 3 days.
1,The sound quality of these headphones are comparable to my husbands Beats by Dre. I love them and use them daily on my grueling hour long workouts.<br /><br />My on off button broke after four months.  I could no longer use them.<br />I contacted customer care for SENSO and It was covered under the year warranty.<br />They are replacing the headphones.<br />Great customer service!!!
1,"Extremely impressed with Senso customer service. Got my ActivBuds S-250 about a month ago. Worked great. I used it mostly for running. Very convenient and comfortable, w/o having the wire dangling between phone and ear. I am not very particular about sound quality but headphone does sound good. Because of IPX7 rating, I freely wash it after every workout. OK, don’t do this. After a couple washes, headphone failed to work. But this is where I was extremely impressed with Senso customer service. I sent them an email. Next day, got a reply from Senso (Kimberly), asking me to send her the invoice. Subsequently, I received a new replacement a week later. Truly no question ask (unless I count the time where she asked for the invoice ). Can’t say enough good things about how they stand behind their product."
1,Work great and are durable. They are also more comfortable than I expected.
1,"I ordered these to replace a set from mpow jaws.  It is advertised as light weight and comfortable.  I am glad the parts that go over each ear are flexible and comfortable.  I usually use them  with only one ear bud in, they often fall off because the weight of the other ear bud pulls the one inserted out.  I have found that sticking the unused earbud in my shirt over my shoulder will hold it in place better, but I think there should be a better solution."
1,"I recently purchased the SENSO Bluetooth headphones after my $200 dollar power beats broke and the company would not replace them. I use these headphones on a constant basis and after a week of use I am more happy with these than my power beets and wish I would have bought these first, would have saved myself a lot of money. If you want to buy a low cost great pair of headphones I suggest buying these and I have been telling all my friends at the gym that they needed these.<br />Thank you SENSO for putting out a low cost great pair of headphones in a world of highly expensive products that make you have to refinance your home too afford."
1,"So I have been searching for a good set of headphones, earbuds, whatever you want to call them for some time now. I wanted bluetooth, wireless, whatever you kids are calling it these days because I'm tired of pulling out the plugin all the time, especially when mowing and exercising. I have found the solution, and not just a good set but a great set. These earbuds stay secured in my ear, even when I'm stumbling and bumbling around. I'm not tangling myself up in the cord and best of all the charge lasts forever or close to it. I have now went through 4 workout sessions over 6 days without plugging them in. Awesome. Now Spring just needs to get here so I can test them out on the mower. Oh and the sound quality is great, my kids have Beats by old what's his name and they sound great also but with my ears I can't tell the difference, Howard Stern sounds great on both. However, my wallet can tell the difference, if you know what I mean. One other thing, they came with a charging cord for my iPhone, not sure why, but it's the most durable charging cord made, what an added bonus. Thanks SENSO, keep up the 5 star work! You kick arse!"
1,I bought these headphones and I like them. I didn't know that they have 1-year warranty. When they didn't work I contacted SENSO and their customer service was great. They reply quickly & I received the new headphones in 2 days.
1,"Light, comfortable, good sound and long lasting battery for a very good price.  The warranty coverage is excellent. When I had a channel go out and Invotek (the seller) answered my email quickly, sent me clear troubleshooting instructions and when that failed sent a replacement.."
1,Good sound and very comfortable. Had these about 8 months and they stopped working. Contacted SENSO about the problem and they very quickly covered these under the warranty and are sending out a replacement. Glad to get a new pair and wonderful customer service.
0,Doesn't work with my Vizio TV but will work with my android phone.
0,"I got these headphones as a gift, and they work perfectly apart from the issues with the bass. If any song has too much bass in it, the entire song seems to turn into background static with some lyrics (even within a foot of my phone). I have to listen to podcasts or youtube videos to actually be 100% satisfied with this product. It could be much improved."
0,"The one good thing I liked was the sound could be turned much louder than many others. This is the only ""noise cancelation"" it actually has.<br />And now for the bad.<br />Terrible longevity. My first one quit after a couple months. Left ear went out. Common for cheap headphones. My 2nd the ear hook broke at the base in 3 weeks.<br />Speaking of the ear hook, they're flexible which seems great, but the move too much. I wear glasses and the hook will bend out and does not hold the buds in my ear. In addition, ANY movement will cause the hooks to bend, allowing the buds to move out of the ear canal. I work out a lot, and this is obviously the reason for buying this type of headphone. Disappointed."
1,"I usually can't stand ear buds, but these Senso bluetooth headphones are comfortable and the range is unexpected. I can leave my phone in my purse at the gym and pretty much work out with no wires or devices. The sound is fantastic. Great value!!"
1,The sound quality on these ear buds is phenomenal.  I was thoroughly impressed.
1,"I love this headphone,it does everything i want in a bluetooth headphone.no issues at all"
1,The senso headphones I bought work great . I got them to use when riding the Harley not much  wind noise and they fit with a half helmet.
1,"Great product, nice that they come with several buds."
1,"Pretty comfortable and seems to work decently well. However, if working out or using for an extended period of time starts to irritate my ears slightly (comfortability wise).<br />Also, I have noticed that if I have my phone in my waist band it has skipped a couple seconds of muscc from time to time while I am moving around. Haven't had a problem when my phone has been next to me."
1,Bluetooth range is pretty bad; definitely can't  go more than 20 feet without them cutting out and have owned them since 2018 Jan.  Neither my husband or I would not recommend these at all.
1,"Excellent quality headphones. Great sound, stay in my ears (which is a rarity for me), and are comfortable to wear throughout entire workouts. Definitely recommend these, great product!"
1,Bought these for my girl for the gym. She loves them. Says they sound great.
1,Bought these for my bro. He absolutely loves them. Compared them to high end headphones that people pay $100+  For. Would recommend
1,spectacular the best I recommend
1,"I’m giving this company 5 stars for their exceptional customer service. They were prompt, courteous and professional.  The product is great when it’s working and if it hadn’t stopped working suddenly I would’ve given it a 5 for the comfort, the range, the sound, and the price!<br />Five months after receiving my headphones, I started having issues—they stopped working suddenly. Had a crackling noise from one ear bud, then it would fade out completely until one day later they stopped working. I<br />Immediately  contacted customer service. They were prompt in responding (under 2 hours of sending my email) and provided the necessary instructions to attempt to reset my headphones. Sadly that didn’t work and my headphones still did not work. Since my headphones came with a 1 year warranty the company is sending me new headphones! Not only am I receiving new headphones but the company was very apologetic and had a very customer-oriented mentality which I appreciated.  The email was kind, professional and focused on making sure the customer was happily satisfied. I am! Thank you for your help! I look forward to receiving my new headphones in the next few days."
1,"These headphones are brilliant, offer great sound, have great battery life, and are perfect for rainy days or intense workout sessions, highly recommend."
1,"I just received these headphones so have used them on a limited basis.  So far, I love them!  This is a great price, the ability to switch ear buds for a small size was really important to me as I have trouble keeping normal size ones in my ears.  If further use changes my opinion, I'll come back and add/edit this review, but so far I'm a fan!"
1,"Great product--easy to sync and so far, it seems to be worked ng!"
1,They sent me a replacement. They were a little better. The piece that goes around your ear lobe is still to big. I am 5'0 110lbs. I would say I have normal size ear lobes I used them for running. I like the fact that I can still hear my sorroundings. :)
1,Love these and all the extras that come<br />With them. Sound is rich and beautiful. Noise canceling works well. Wire takes some getting used to but these are worth it. After trying 3 other kinds these win.  They stay out in your ears too<br />Very happy with them
1,"Love the headphones. Light, hardly notice I’m wearing them. Others have bothered my ears which are on the small side.<br />Use them when working out.<br />Great product for the price!<br />A little more base sound than I am used to."
1,Order arrived quickly and on-time. Just went for my first run with them and it's a great improvement over my last pair of Bluetooth headphones which wouldn't stay in my ears. The over the ear hooks are the key. Sound is good for the type of headphones.
1,"I love these headphones!  They sound and work much better than my Jabra headphones.  I use them for running and they are easy to operate, sound great thru the city and quickly charge.  Customer Service is also great.  My 1st pair quit working shortly after purchase and Senso sent me a new pair immediately."
1,Hurt my ears after a while. Pretty heavy and uncomfortable
1,"I'll admit I haven't watched the video on these but here's my review so far. The pair easily and the sound is really good. I like the cord instead of the headband style I had previously. They stay on my head with a lot of movement. No problem listening to music but the main complaint I have is that when I'm on a call, hang up from that call, then get another call they don't automatically come through the headphone. I have to go to my settings and click the headphones then there's the transfer to the headphones and the caller often here's that and will day what was that noise. In addition I've missed information during the transfer."
1,I really love these headphones. I have too admit when i bought them i didn't realize it but I was pleasantly surprised when I realized that I could use them to speak through while using my phone.
1,"Not the best for sound, I love great sounding music and these didn't help the sound it hurt it."
1,Really great well priced Headphones.Easy set up and they sound really good. I'm no pro but I do know quality and SENSO you got this. Thanks
1,Use the headphones at the gym.  They are great!!
1,I love these!!!
1,"Many features, great sound."
0,They didn't stay in my ears. And the sound quality was pretty bad. I'm not sure why these got such great reviews.
0,They were great for a about month and then they stop working..they connect and like 10 second later disconnect... I'm just disappointed it. And now I can even return them..
1,"I read several reviews on many different sites and they are all pretty accurate. These truly are the best Bluetooth headphones you can buy for under $50 if not the best under $100. These are crazy loud and have extreme bass. However, the only negative I can offer is that it does distort at max volume and there is almost too much bass. That being said, these headphones are much better all around when compared to my $100 LG headphones. The accessories you receive are just a huge bonus. I own a pressure washing business ( RinsePRO.com ) and I purchased these to use while working. I'm eager to see how they hold up to the water."
1,"I’ve only had them a week but so far so good. Good sound, decent battery life and good construction. Overall I’m pleased for this price point."
1,"Work awesome, clarity leaves a little to be desired but good enough for this guy."
0,"The sound quality is very bad.<br />The instruments are all smashing along in the same bass range, meaning the music sounds dull and muffled. There is so much difference in sound quality compared to another Bluetooth headphone I use. I am considering sending these back.<br /><br />Edit: To clarify; I would say the audio is slightly better than that heard from earbuds you'd purchase at Five Below. There seems to be slight distortion in much of the audio (presumably from the &#34;deep bass&#34; advertised). There also seems to be lack of &#34;crystal clear treble&#34;. In fact, I would not call anything about them &#34;crystal clear&#34; as they sound slightly muffled, like they are being played into a pillow. I tried pairing them with multiple devices (in case it was the device and not the product itself), but the audio was the same across different songs of different genres. I'd say these are barely worth $15, let alone the &#34;on sale&#34; $36.97 or the &#34;original&#34; $169.99. (Star deducted for asking price). Please note that I also attempted the &#34;factory reset&#34; with little to no improvement in audio quality."
1,"Bought these headphones for my husband who's a truck driver. He really likes them. They're loud, clear and noise cancelling. Great product for the price. One of the owners contacted me after the purchase to make sure I was completely satisfied with the purchase. I can tell that the company really cares about the products that are selling and customer satisfaction!"
1,They work better than any of the others that I have purchased.
1,"They're okay. Connection was not a problem however, the most important feature doesn't work. Yea, answering the phone is great and all but I don't care about that. What I care about, and the soul purpose for me purchasing these headphones, was to control my phone's music settings. Well, that's a bust. Save for the pause/play I can't do anything else. Can't skip to the next or previous tracks. The point of purchasing this it's to be predominately hands free. Especially when working out. I'll keep them because I can sell them  for more than I purchased them for. I'll be continuing my search for truly hands free Bluetooth headphones because these aren't it. They get a 2 for connecting seamlessly and being loud.<br /><br />However, word to the wise, if you connect these to more than one device, be sure to turn off the Bluetooth on the devices you're not using else you will get the most annoying beeping when you are to far from the other devices. Learned the hard way. Left my house for a run and didn't start my music until I had left the house and started running. Couldn't figure out why they were beeping as I had charged them. Then it dawned on me that I might have left my Bluetooth on, on my other devices. Needless to say I ran back home disconnected the Bluetooth and that fixed the problem but by that time I was irritated and just decided to use my other headphones.<br /><br />ETA: I have these paired to 4 Android devices and the only music function you can control on all devices is pause/play.<br /><br />Devices:<br />G6<br />Pixel XL<br />Note 3<br />12&#34; Note Tablet<br /><br />UPDATE: 10/27/17<br /><br />So, it took some doing but I pulled them out to give them another go. I had to delete them from my devices and reset the headset a few times but I was finally able to get the &#34;Skip/Next Track&#34; to work. Not entirely certain why they wouldn't work to begin with but they do now."
1,These are great wireless headphones for the price. The battery life hasn't been great but long enough.
0,Worked pretty well for a few months. Developed a high-pitched whine in the left earbud making it unusable. Pretty good battery life though.
1,Purchased lots of bluetooth headphones  but this one is completely different...I mean is awesome and I really love it. Guess I'm gonna buy two more. I use it for running
0,"I really wanted to like these - when I first took them out of the package maybe every 30 minutes or so the sound would cut out. No matter I thought maybe I just need to break them in. I usually run outside and connect these to my iphone without any other electronics on me. Initially there would just be small blips in which the sound cut out but over the last few weeks they have become every few minutes and it's impossible to concentrate on running since the sound keeps cutting out. I had bought these in hopes that I would be able to use them in a race a week and a half from now. However with the sound cutting out so much and being such a distraction I honestly cannot recommend these to any distance runners or anyone who wants a solid pair a headphones for a multi hour run.<br /><br />I had tried multiple things to remedy the headphones such as keeping them fully charged, reconnecting to my phone's bluetooth multiple times, restarting my phone, restarting the headphones, and nothing worked. I'm not sure if this pair is defective or what but the 30 day return period is now over and I'm pretty bummed out that I don't have a good pair of headphones for my race in two weeks and that I had spent quite a bit of money on a defective product. The sound quality however was good while it lasted, and it did stay in my ears pretty comfortably. I have only used these maybe 15-20 times exclusively for running and other gym activities."
1,"I bought these for myself back in August because I really wanted a pair of Bluetooth headphones but refused to pay Beats prices. They are fantastic! Way better than I expected for the price. The sound quality is great and they are comfortable in my ears for long periods of time. I was surprised to learn that I could also answer calls on them. The sound was great and they could hear me well. My only complaint is this: the time from the first low battery audio warning until they turn off is like 5 minutes. I feel like there should be more of a warming. Still, these are fantastic and I highly recommend them."
1,They are almost the same quality and for way less. Great purchase.
1,I love my SENSO Bluetooth Headphones.  The sound quality is wonderful and it easily paired with all of my devices.
1,"Not only are these great sounding headphones and easy to set up, but the Senso customer service was outstanding. The head set was around 6 months old when the left channel volume dropped and I could not fix it. I contacted Senso through Amazon and they immediately send a replacement pair out. Great product support!"
1,Great sound and very comfortable.  Great value.
0,cheap and will break/ deteriorate fast
0,"These will not work if your paired device is out of line of sight (e.g. in your pocket, in an armband, around a corner, behind your monitor, etc.).<br /><br />I just don't get all of the positive reviews on this product. I returned this right away."
1,My husband love it!
1,"For $35 these buds are worth it.  First the likes.  The one thing that I like the most is that they fit on my ears well.  I bought them to use mainly at the gym but used them in the car today for a biz call and my rep on the other end said that the quality was good.  Second like is the sound.  I'm mainly listening to 80/90's rock so I sort of want it louder but they are pretty loud and descent quality.  I really like the volume, pause and skip controls on the right bud.  Convenient. Now to the one or two negatives.  The cable that connects the two buds I assume is supposed to go around the back of your neck.  When your neck sweats (at the gym) the cable sticks to your neck so when you turn your head it sort of tugs the buds out of your ears.  This is not a deal breaker because it's manageable plus you can put it in the front.  The other problem so far I was able to fix.  When I originally started using them they wouldn't hookup to the Bluetooth very well.  I used 3 different Samsung S6 and S7 models and both had probs.  After reading some of the questions on Amazon, I found a reset fix and they've worked fine since.  Very satisfied."
0,"Sound quality is crystal clear when headphones are near the phone. However as soon as i put my phone in my pocket it becomes staticy and will randomly disconnect, which defeats the main purpose of Bluetooth headsets."
1,Easy to set up and so comfortable! Love
1,"Great headphones. I think I have a larger than normal inner ear, and these headphones stay in, which is usually a problem especially for running. They do a great job at cancelling outside noise and are very comfortable. I forget they are on when they are in."
1,Hello. The headphones are working great so far. I've used them maybe 10 times between running and the gym and they are working great. The sound is good and they connect to Bluetooth with ease. My comparison is to Beats headphones which stop working for me after a year. So I am really looking at the longevity of these headphones. So far so good. Thank you.
1,I love this head set theyre jusr as good as a pair of powerbeats that my wife took from me
1,"Not liking at all how they fit. I have tried 3 different size ear cushions and they do not stay in. It may be because the ear loops are not stable, too maleable(?) And they run up against my glasses. Just not digging them."
0,"These earphones sound fantastic, but are borderline unusable. The Bluetooth connectivity is very poor.  These headphones require a connection to be within about 2 feet. So if you put them in your ears, and put your phone in your pants pocket, the connection breaks up so much the headphones become completely useless. The only way I have been able to use these is keeping my phone in a front shirt pocket. Even arm length away the connection breaks up.<br /><br />Don't buy."
1,"Good product, even better customer service. Had a small glitch show up with connectivity, and they took care of it really quickly and thoroughly. For the price, the quality and customer service cannot be beat."
1,"easy to use, fit is nice and sound is great"
0,"Despite the good reviews, I cannot endorse these headphones. Mainly because mine will no fully charge. They charge to about 50% and no more which obviously limits the time available to use them.<br />As for comfort, let's just say they are always there. I don't forget there is something in my ear.<br />Sound quality is fine. I've had them about two weeks."
1,So far they work well and have more features than I originally anticipated. They also stay on well.
1,"These are perfect for active use on a budget. They sound great, fit comfortably, the controls are intuitive, and the battery seems to last forever. I have had mine for several weeks now and haven't charged them a single time. Amazing value for sure."
1,perfect sound and so comfortable in ears ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
1,Sound quality was good but the car charger was cheap and split into two pieces after first use and people complained about not being able to hear me unless I spoke loudly.
1,I use these every day in my job in construction they get wet they get full of dust and most of the day in direct sunlight and they don't quit they work fine.<br /><br />My only complaint is phone call quality specially if is on 50% or less of batery I will fine myself speaking very loud because the person on the other side tells me they hear me at a very low volume.
1,"I have used this only once so far. I must say I'm pleased with it. It charged quickly, paired easily and sounded great. They were comfortable to wear and did not move. And it fit my budget."
1,"In my search for affordable wireless earbuds, predomonately for use at the gym, I settled in on these.  They are not perfect, but for the price, they are an excellent value, which bumped them from a 3 star to a 4 star.<br /><br />Pros:  Outstanding value.  Tons of cool stuff in the package.  Two charging cords, case, USB car outlet.  Very nice.<br /><br />Cons: Sound is mediocre.  I really wish they were crisper and cleaner, but mostly just muffled.  For $35 though, I'm keeping them.  To a lesser degree, I wish they had made the connecting cord out of something other than rubber, as the rubber sticks to your sweaty neck.  Again, not a deal breaker at this price point."
1,I bought these for my daughter. She really likes the sound quality! She is very active so we'll see how they hold up.
1,"Great product, good customer service"
1,"Received these two days ago, and so far so good. They sound great, are easy to use, and come with a nice case. Would recommend."
0,Did not pair with my LG G6.
0,Don't buy these. The Bluetooth connection cuts out as soon as I put my device in my pocket. Garbage.
1,Great product at an excellent price. I am very happy with these  Bluetooth ear buds. The carrying case was very sturdy and of unexpected quality. Right out of the box the ear buds fit. The ear pieced that goes over your ear to keep the earbuds in place was very light and comfortable. I am very happy with these and still can't believe the price. It's nice to get more than you paid for. Very satisfied.
1,"Not much different than the other BT Headphones in this category. Nothing stands out that an audiophile would care for at this price range bbuuutttt the most innovating thing I've seen is that the ear cradle part can be bent into any way to fit any ear! This is amazinggggggg!<br /><br />The last ones I bought were Mpow Flame & Merdumia BT Headphones & their ear pieces were just a flexible rubber pre-shaped. They would occasionally fall out of the ear when skating or running, but button design is exactly the same. I've now got about 3 sets of ear cover things.<br /><br />4 stars since it doesn't have aptX or LDAC abilities but at this price I don't expect it to."
0,"for me, these kept either falling out of my ears or felt like they were on the brink of falling out. They also kept cutting out."
1,"Have only used them a couple of times. But they sound very clear, are easy to use and fit comfortably. The Bluetooth sincs quickly. Very happy with the purchase."
1,"Thanks for reaching out to me:<br />Very impressed with the quality and performance of your product , will recommend to my family and peers.<br /><br />Best,<br /><br />Joe"
1,The part that wraps around the ear is a little to big for my ears. Other then that i love them.
1,"Very lightweight, good balance, great sound!"
1,bought March 2018. Last month I noticed the volume down button sticking....last 2 weeks button stuck in down postion no matter what I cant get it unstuck disappointed
0,The shell broke after a week of use
1,Nice sound.  Would work ok for just listening to music.  Do not work well as a phone headset/ear buds.
0,"I would give this a slightly higher review but I can't because the customer service isn't great. The first time I charged the headphones they said to be fully charged, then they wouldn't turn on. So I plugged it back into the charger and the headphones had the red low battery light turn on again and were charging for a couple hours.They wouldn't turn on for a couple of days, and this was after having them for about a week. SENSO claims to have a warranty on them but when I emailed the company, they never contacted me again. The headphones eventually started working again but it was frustrating that they stopped working for a little when they were brand new, and also that the company never got back to me.<br /><br />Also I know there are people saying these fit small ears, but they honestly don't. I'm 21 years old, but I have very small ears. I always have to use the smallest tip sizes and I would not be able to work out in these headphones. They are way too big for my ears and regularly fall out. The foam earbuds were too large too and hurt my ears. I guess they're good when they're working but the size is definitely an issue."
0,"I have had this headphone for more than 3 months now. I have been using it every day. I use it to listen to audiobooks and podcasts. So, I don't really know how well it works for music. But here is my opinion:<br />Pros:<br />* Price<br />* Almost Ok battery life<br /><br />Cons:<br />* It is very uncomfortable on my ears. There is no option to adjust anything, so if it doesn't fit your ears then you are going to have a bad time.<br />* It is useless when riding a bike (or it is windy outside). The wind noise is unbearable.<br />* The on/off button is on the side and it is not easy to press. So, if you need to turn the headphone on/off it is better to remove it from your ears first, otherwise, you will be pushing the earpiece inside your brain."
1,Beyond happy with the product. I’ve been looking for a good pair of headphones for quite a while and these have exceeded my expectations.
1,"Product came fast works great"""
1,The customer service team instructed me on how to resolve my issue.  When that did not fix the problem they asked for my mailing address and now they are sending out a new pair!  I did register my product and it is within the 1year warranty period.  Thanks again for a hassle free resolution.  I love these headphones they sound better than my Beats by Dre  and they are more comfortable.
0,This is my second unit and now I remember why I tossed them in the dead pile. I purchased them on the 6th of April and they died April 13th. They just won’t hold a charge anymore.😡. A shame I love the design.
1,Right off the bat they sound great. I was impressed with the sound of the bass.  Bluetooth connection was quick and painless.  Came with 90% battery life right out of the box.  Good product for such an economical price.
0,So far so good
1,"I love them. They are excellent for phonecalls, music, movies. I like to dance zumba in my room but I usually have time late night and didnt want to disturb the people around me, this is just perfect for it."
1,"The headphones fit well, sound great and they come with a carrying case and 3 sets of ear pieces to fit anyone.  When I first received them, I thought they were great, but experienced some loss of signal that I thought may have due to a defect. I contacted the company and received a reply right away. They explained how to do a factory reset in case there was a calibration problem and pointed out other possible causes for signal problems. It hadn't occurred to me that interference may occur so I checked the frequency that Bluetooth uses and discovered that it shares the band with many other devices. Such as wireless phones, garage door openers, satellite tv boxes, etc. The signal problems I was experiencing fit the pattern of such interference and the headphones sounded so good otherwise that I agree that interference was my problem.  That's something to remember regardless of which wireless device you are using.  Bottom line, great for the price and a company that stands behind their products."
1,"First saw the these headphones on &#34;Today's Deals&#34;. Noticed it had over 21000 reviews with 4.5 stars. Bought them, and they are unbelievable. The sound quality, amazing. Battery life, unbelievable. Does not even take long to fully charge them once the battery is actually low! On top of all this, the noise cancelling is awesome. Overall the best headphones I could have ever purchased. I've had Beats before as well, but these headphones are definitely better! The best part, THEY'RE AFFORDABLE. Why spend hundreds of dollars on headphones when you can just buy these and be amazed. No joke, not even exaggerating."
1,"Great sound quality. Had my doubts about the silicone ear hooks at first, but they hold the headphones in place very well."
1,Excellent product!  Works great!!  Truly a cost benefit to me as the purchaser and listener!!!
1,My brother says these are the best headphones you can get for running. They are great.
1,Works fine to listen to music. I do not recommend it for making phone calls as everyone I talked to on the phone complained that they couldn't hear me with all the noise in the background.
1,"good quality and sound. battery seems to last 7-8 hours. a bit tight around the ears if pushed in too far, but good for active sport."
1,"I have been waiting some time to order a wireless pair of earbuds that didn't cost a fortune!  I read reviews of many over several months.  I was torn between these senso & another brand, but to me, these looked a little lighter & more comfortable.  I am a walker & a bicycle rider & a worker in the yarder (?) & I love my music!  LOVE these buds!  easy, comfortable & clear, true sound!  Highly recommend!  Wonderful customer service ~ received an email from Senso that they had shipped with Amazon & received another email this morning from one of the owners of Senso to see if I was satisfied!  One year warranty & 30 day return (I think) ~ who would return these?!?  As Mikey would say ~ &#34;try em ~ you'll like em&#34;"
0,"I like that these are wireless however, they are big around the ear and don’t sit in well.  Once seated they almost plug my ears allowing muffled sound.  I’m using the smallest ear bud piece available in multi pack that came with headphones."
1,"Ordered on 2/17/2017, and year over of heavy use and workout an hr a day and they still going strong. Battery lasts maybe 88% from the 100% first use but still pretty impressive quality that shits on the $200 pairs. This is perfectly in sync with any audio device and absolutely no issues. The fact about battery life is that all batteries degrade with time and after a daily use to only loose maybe 15% is not bad at all onsidering i use them all the time. Excellent other end audio feedback when calling and comfort on ears. Thank you."
1,Very nice
1,very good headphones
1,excellent
0,Were amazing when they worked. Left headphone stopped working after less than 10 uses. I only got to recharge them once.
1,"Very comfortable, instructions were easy to understand and I'm happy I ordered these!!"
0,The microphone is not of good quality. Callers always asks me to take the them of speaker.
1,"Absolutely love these!! Sound is great and the battery lasts for my entire shift!! They are comfortable, don't make my ears hurt at all. Like them so much, bought them for my son also! Great value for what is received!! Had trouble with my ActiveBuds after 10 months. Best customer care I have ever received!! Would recommend to everyone!!"
1,Great sound for price point. Do not push the volume to high you will over power the drivers. Noise reduction is middle of the road great on walks or around the house. Little over run in very noisy environments... battery life and charge time are great. Have spent almost 6 hours with these in and never ran out of juice. USB charger provided is one of the most rugged I have ever seen.
1,"Nice product. Music quality is excellent, definitively is HD sound. Phone calls are ok, think quality of a phone call could improve a little more. Used them in the pool and all Ok ( of course I did not went under water)"
1,"Good fit, multiple ear piece sizes come with, light weight and non-obtrusive. Sound quality is good but you lose a lot of bass. Clear sound with no static and very good range. Overall an 8/10 and you can't beat the price."
1,"Headphones are great quality!  I'm running a half marathon in two weeks are these are perfect because it may rain.<br />Most of all, I find the follow up email from one of the owners of the company speaks volumes!  It gives you a peace of mind that in case any issues arise during the warranty period, i feel the owners will personally  make sure the issue is resolved.  You just don't find that kind of customer service these days!  Thanks Senso!"
1,"Great headphones. Good sound, dont tangle and do not annoy when running."
1,I bought them for my son for Christmas. He absolutely loved them.  He’s used them for two days now and on his trip back to Maine. Very impressed.
0,They broke after only a few weeks
0,"Was happy with product initially, but in the few months since I purchased ( Feb 2018), it stopped working consistently.  While exercising it would repeatedly disconnect without warning (it had been charged) and then within the last two weeks it just died. There is a warning not to allow it to overcharge, and that could be a source problem since it has no programming to stop accepting a charge."
1,AWESOME headphones!  I am so in love with them!!  One of the best pairs I've ever had.
1,Bought a pair of the beats and they went out within 2 months and always heard static no matter what I did bought these 2 weeks ago and have more bass and sound definition than the beats. Would buy these 10 times before the beats!!
1,Great value for the price. I love running with them!
1,simply beautiful
1,Very easy to figure out and use.  I love them.
1,"Very happy with these.  I usually listen while walking or otherwise exercising, the sound is good, and the controls are easy to reach.  The earhooks are secure without being too rigid.  Their customer service is great.  I had a pair that stopped working after 6 months.  Once the reset instructions were followed and failed, they sent a replacement.  Thank you to Senso!"
1,They are the best
1,"Very happy with these headphones-the sound is great, set up was very simple."
0,"The fit is comfortable, other than that I have nothing positive to say. The sound quality is a complete joke. No treble, distortion after half volume. Just aweful. Obviously the positive reviews were given these headphones for a good review, or America has no idea what sound quality is."
1,"I bought a lot of other companies and a lot of expensive, but I came back from these earphones, thank you"
1,Very good Bluetooth headphones.bsound good. Fit well. Recommended.
1,Incredible sound quality with deep bass and crystal clear treble. Great product.
1,"They are good so far, lets see how they behave in the long run... still are new and sound and battery live are performing very well"
1,"Great headset. Does very well with low bass.  I use an android phone and it could be my phone but, i recommend downloading an equalizer to modify the desired sound.  Overall, worth every penny."
1,Worth every penny
1,Great workout headphones. The charge lasts a long time. I usually workout for an hour four times a week and I usually only have to charge it every two weeks. Sometimes when powering on it will not sync up with my iPhone correctly but simply power cycling it fixes the issues.
1,"I have purchased a total of four pairs now, everyone in the family has one.  They are very comfortable the sound is excellent with good bass.  I use them for an hour a day at the gym six days a week and the charge lasts all week for my usage.  They link up with my phone very easily, I have had no issues at all with them.  I would definitely recommend these as an alternative to more expensive models, they do everything I want and are a great value.  I just have to get used to putting them away because I lost my first pair.  Love having no wires to get in the way when I work out."
1,Good sound and comfortable
1,Soft and nice.
0,Liked the headset and used for a few months.  Now they will not charge at all.  If you need a disposable set then these are ok. If you wanted a product for at least a year...look elsewhere.
1,"Thanks for your attention. Headphone has a good quality when I use with my laptop but the problem is, it is not compatible with my iPhone. I mean for some musics with high bass the quality is not as well as when I use it with my laptop.<br />Best regards<br />Ali"
1,Fully satisfied with this purchase!
1,"These ear buds are perfect! I love the fact<br />That they are so light weight, and sound great,very clear,,, these are the best I've used so far,, comes in a little box to put in,,extra ear buds,, and a extra charger and usb cord for charging in your vehicle! , I'm gonna go back and get one for each of my family members! Update,,,I lost my first pair of these on Friday by leaving them on the hood of my truck,,,I like them so much I went ahead and ordered me another pair,,,best I've ever used"
0,"To be honest I was really happy with these headphones, I used them to workout, run, riding a bikem the only complaint I had was that it has some weird issues of sound going on and off when I had my phone on my left pocket oreven in the left with an armband. But as of now, they just stopped working. I was at the gym when suddenly the voice said (Power Off) and that's it. It didn't want to turn on again. This also happened to me a couple of days ago but I thought I didn't charge them, so I left them at home and when I came back from work and connected them everything was OK. But as of now, I charged them yesterday and there's no response, no turning on, not even ablink onthe LED's. So disappointing, I really like these headphones, thewy ere totally worth it... until today."
1,"I love these headphones. They stay in place no matter the activity (running, biking, lifting weights, etc.,) The sound is very good and the battery life lasts for my longest runs (marathons). Recently the pair I had stopped working and I couldn't get them to turn on. I did a negative review on Amazon, and I was immediately contacted by the company with some suggestions to fix. Unfortunately they didn't work, so they sent me a brand new replacement pair within two days. Now that's great customer service. Prior to these headphones, I had the Beats wireless, which cost five times more, and although the sound was a little better, but not much, those beats came apart on the earpiece and were unusable. I could buy 5 of these headphones for the price of one Beats."
1,"Good fit, ease of use and setup and great sound.Used them while cutting the grass and had to pump up the volume ,but good product for a great price."
1,"Great product!  Very comfortable, quality of sound is incredibly sharp & crisp.  Very impressed with this product. Will definitely recommend to my friends & family."
1,"I love them, plus I can wear them wherever I go."
1,These were really great for almost a year until they wouldn’t charge anymore. Bummer because I used them almost everyday at the gym. I wish I could find a set of headphones that lasted longer.
1,"First things first, let me get the couple of negatives out of the way. These headphones are extremely bass heavy from right out of the box, and make everything sound like the trunk of some teenagers car. This is easily remedied through your device's internal equalizer. I have a Samsung S7, and I just dial down the bass and they are instantly awesome after that. The other complaint that I have is the connection issue. I had my phone in my back pocket and was continually losing connection as I worked outside. This could have been a result of the battery wearing down, but I wasn't receiving any notifications of low battery yet. It has only happened to me once, but it was so annoying that I finally just took them back into the house and did without for the day.<br /><br />Now. on to the good things about them. These headphones feel absolutely amazing in my ears. They fit snugly, and aren't heavy enough to fall out during extreme activities. The soft, wrap around piece is comfortable and doesn't rub against my ear when working out, yet is firm enough to help hold the headphone in. The sound clarity (when adjusted correctly) is crisp and clear, and rivals many of the other pricier options that I've used before. The fact that they are well under $50 is a HUGE plus as well. The headphones alone are easily worth the cost and then some, but with all of the extra accessories that you get, it becomes a remarkable deal. The customer service seems to be rather impressive as well, While I have yet to reach out to them about any issues I have, they were proactive in thanking me for making the purchase, and ensuring that I was enjoying they're product. Customer service is a huge deal to me, and determines a lot of what I choose to buy, so this outreach was very well received.<br /><br />All in all, I would strongly recommend anyone looking for new headphones to just go ahead and purchase these. They won't break the bank, and are easily adjusted to anything that you may want to listen too. I have yet to find a better deal anywhere, and would even consider buying another pair as a backup in case my original pair die on me one day. You will certainly not be disappointed in buying these.AMA"
1,"I've only one issue it seems the right 'foam' ear piece is easy to come off its setting.  Sound is great, I really like the fully adjustable over the ear fasteners."
0,Originally rated this product 4 stars with my only knock being the flimsy over the ear pieces. I am changing my review to a one star because it has been 3 months and the headphones have fallen apart. I looked to see if a return or replacement might be possible but that closed 1 month after i purchased these. It seems they built a product to last you just long enough to where you can't return them. At the end of the day i suppose you get what you pay for. I would appreciate it if someone would reach out to me and make this right.
1,"Purchased these April of 2018 and they died Jan 2020, it stopped charging. Lasted a decent amount of time, hooked up seamlessly and was decently loud."
1,It’s good. Does what it claims to. Didn’t personally notice sound cancellation. But it’s better than some of the others on the market for the same price. Someone else said it best: don’t spend more on another set claiming to do the same things these do. It’s not worth it. Just buy these.
1,"Excellent Product!!! works perfect at the gym, Recommended 100%"
1,"I’m not displeased with this purchase but I am a bit disappointed with the overall quality. Based on more then one review I was expecting a high volume high quality bass with a HD Treble that some reviewers praised highly. That being the bar that was set, here is my take on these buds. Volume . . . What enthusiastic reviews purpose is not what I’m hearing. The volume on a iPhone 6 + is about the same as the earbuds you get with the iPhone, not an immersive experience of having the artist playing beside you but a good overall sound that is about par with buds at this price range. Max volume is clear but bass is at best average. No thumps, bumps or whumpfs to get the heart in sync but bass is noticeable. Treble is high quality but at full tilt can cut like a razor. I purchased these to replace a pair of lost Spigens I really enjoyed. In comparison to those, these are more comfortable and will be great for the high impact work I perform at my job as a green waste manager who is constantly in motion working with heavy equipment and lifting up to 80 lbs on a daily run. My job is hell on electronics and these buds fit and hold their weight. Just wish they played a little louder to drown out the grinding of leaf cutters and wood chippers, but then the last pair was equally challenged. 4 stars is a fair rating considering the price and there are several perks that come with it has far a packaging goes. Most notably the handy and well built carrying case. You get your moneys worth for listening enjoyment but not recommended for critical listening."
1,So much value for your money!! It comes with all the features you could possibly desire!
0,"Had to return these.  The design forced wind into the ear, even when walking."
1,"I love these. I had low expectations, because any other ear buds I've tried fit too tightly or popped out often, or entirely blocked out the outside world noises. I've been wearing these for about 4 hours and frankly forgot about them. I'm listening to music, but don't really know they're in my ears. They're that comfortable. They did come with a variety of ear plug adapters, which was nice, since people's ears are all different. The sound quality is good. I'm no audiophile, but these sound good to me. Also, I can hear my dogs bark in the background, so I'm not shut off. I need to get out and run with these on to see how they fare with that, but so far, I'm super happy with these."
1,They work great when they work. I had mine for 3 months they stopped working. I emailed invotek and they were so kind helpful and tremendously great they sent me a replacement pair had it in 3 days fabulous outfit
1,"I've only had these headphones for a day, but so far, so good.  A little bit on the &#34;bass&#34; side sound-wise.  Looking forward to trying them out on my next long bike ride."
1,I ordered these based on Amazon reviews and I'm satisfied.  The sound is good and the over-ear support keeps them in place. I need to try out some of the various size ear pieces because the default size that came installed on the unit seems to slip out of my right ear.  There are several optional size pieces that came with the unit so one of them should work.
0,"I’ve had these for 3 months, they are no longer pairing up with mu iPod.  I’m not liking them at all."
1,"So far this product works incredibly well, the sound quality for me is absolutely fantastic and customer service satisfaction follow-up is excellent. Will buy another set for my spouse upon return from our current travels. Thanks Senso!"
1,"I've had these only a little over a week but I've still managed to put them through a lot. I almost didn't, these sound fantastic imo. I've had far more expensive earphones/headphones and these have beaten them by far. Paired with my iPhone and turned up a notch below 50% is where I keep these most of the time, at 50% the noise canceling is evident and the sound quality is amazing. I love using these for podcast. But I'm also very active, and these still preformed very well, meaning they stayed in place, played my music, and even told me who was calling me in the middle of a set, which was helpful to me.<br />I cycle a lot though, I figured out pretty quick that these don't work so well in wind. I imagine running would produce the same 'whoosh' sound.<br />I primarily bought these for cycling, but I'm not really mad about it. I genuinely like these earbuds, I'll just try something else for when I shred gnar."
1,"3rd Update: After many months of heavy and hard using I can say these are a great product especially for the price. They still sound like new and still hold a really good charge. I would def buy these again.<br /><br />The only thing i would change is i would probably use a firmer ear wrap substance as it has started to lose its shape. I know its a fine line between firm and comfort so i can understand why they did what they did. But in the active world the softer materials causes me to re-adjust them from time to time.<br /><br />Comfortable,  good construction,  good sound, great battery life,  stay on while active,  not bulk at a great price.  I would absolutely recommend these to friends.  I've had 3 pairs of the moto-10s and another bluetooth headset and these are the ones I'll never go back.<br /><br />Now this is me nit picking but I would love a forward/backward track button.  But for the price I can't complain they are really a great purchase.  I'll chime back in once I've put some more miles on them.<br /><br />First charge lasted over a week of mild use.<br />And I figured out the track skip. Not difficult just different than what I was use to. The secret is hold down the volume button front and back.  I probably should have read the instructions. .."
1,The sound of the earbuds are definatly on par with the Powerbeats (which have a good sound but are made horribly and will fall apart on you). Crisp and clear sound easy to connect. I fealt I got more than what I paid for.
1,Satisfied customer
1,I'm really enjoying this Bluetooth headset.  They fit really well and I'm blown away at how nice the sound quality is for calls as well as music!!
1,Great product.  Wish there was still a plug-in function for non-bluetooth devices.
0,I have a lot of issues with these headphones disconnecting and skipping. I have a Samsung Galaxy S8 and no other bluetooth device has this issue. It doesn't matter how close the phone is to the headphones or what could be blocking the signal.
0,"I only got a couple uses out of these before they no longer worked at all. I used them about three times at the gym and they worked decent if not great. There was some static the first use.<br /><br />I ended up misplacing them for a month and actually replaced them before finding the originals. I recharged the originals and they no longer power on.<br /><br />They claim there is a warranty for these which i would like to use, but I have been unable to find anyplace to submit a claim.<br /><br />Very disappointed."
1,Easy to use and very comfortable.
0,They were great for the first few months but they’ve stopped working and only hard a charge for 30 min now
1,"The car charger that came with the headphones just stopped working, What do I need to do?"
1,"This is my second set as the first set was stolen. As with the last pair, I like the quality for the price. I really have no complaints. Granted I only had the last pair for about a year before they were stolen but up until that I had no issues with them. I sweat a a lot during workouts and I wore them 99% of the time  and never had an issue with sweat. So we will see how long these last."
1,"Great sound.  Syncs easily.  Cord catches on my neck when I turn my head or while I move working out.  If it had a solid band to connect each side, it would get four stars.  Add sturdier ear hooks and it would get five."
1,Well designed and equipped  headset
1,Like them so far.
1,35$  SENSO Headphones are better than 200$ Beats.<br /><br />Source:<br />I own both...
1,Great sound.  Very good inexpensive ear buds.  Love them
1,"Wireless is much better for the gym.  Nice case, good sound. Intelligent voice confirmations when you turn the unit on or off. Human voice also tells you when you need to recharge.  Sound seems excellent and does a wonderful job of minimizing background noise.  Only criticism, it is hard to see the battery status light."
1,Headphones sound incredible but the battery does not last I've had them less than a year and no longer work. I really did like the sound of them. Unfortunately they don't last long.... update due to the fast customer service and giving me a replacement asap I scored them higher hopefully I just got a faulty unit I will keep you posted
0,"I ordered these bc of all the great reviews. So far I have just tried these at home, not while working out yet. I have just been putting them on in the house moving around streaming Pandora on my iPhone. They have been skipping in and out bad. I'm not sure if that is the Bluetooth range? I will update my review after I use them outside running....I don't think it will make a difference though.<br /><br />5/24-  ok I used them while running and they sounded great when they weren't skipping. The range is terrible and they skip like crazy with pandora. They were on my head and my phone was a foot away on my bob. I'm sure they're different with everyone . Did not work for me and my pandora/iPhone 6"
1,"Great while they worked, but mine stopped working without reason. I contacted customer support and they got back to me (within minutes) and offered to send a replacement set.  Hopefully these ones work well. Will update if not."
1,Not good outdoors.  Sound ok when indoors but outside if there is any wind it sounds like a wind tunnel.  Basically unusable.
1,"I've been using these headphones for a few months now.  I bought these specifically for working out.  The features I was looking for was Bluetooth, ear hooks, sweat proof, a low price point, and I wanted a cord between the ear buds, so that they could hang around my neck if I took them out of my ears.  This set was one of the few good reviewed headsets that met the criteria that I was looking for.<br /><br />The sound quality is surprisingly good.  The key to the sound quality is making sure you use the right ear buds to fit snugly in your ears.  The sound is quite balance between the highs and the lows.  The sound is very clear, and there is good bass and mid-bass.  The comfort is good too.  The picture shows three sets of different sized earbuds, but there is a fourth set that are memory foam earbuds that come with.  The case is nice too.  It's a very convenient way to store the headphones and its accessories.<br /><br />The battery life is very good too.  I've only gotten to low battery once, so the claims of eight hours of listening time seems accurate.  I charge the headphones just once a week.  The only thing that would be more convenient would be if the charging port was USB Type-C.  I can't comment on the microphone or call quality, as I've only used them for playing music while working out.  Overall, I can't believe how good these are for the price point, and I am very happy with my purchase."
1,Great head phones for the piece. BT stays connected a good distance.
1,Great job! Ran a 5k Saturday and had no issues with buds falling out :)
1,"These wireless headphones met my expectations for a rather inexpensive set.  I was sick of wearing headphones with a wire at work. I would forget to take them off before I got up and I would rip them out of my ears by standing.  If I dropped something and tried to pick it up I would forget the cord wasn't long enough and would rip them out of my ears... so I did an Amazon search for wireless headphones.  What a difference! The sound quality is very good, bass is great, the battery lasts about 6 or 7 hours.  They came with different size ear attachments (whatever you call them) which was nice.  The only real downfall I have found is if you have smaller ears like I do, after a few hours of use, my ear starts to hurt because the outer edge of the earphone is a bit large and it hits a spot on my ear and I have to take them off for a while.  Other than that I think they are great earphones for the price."
1,They work better than expected and i am very happy with them.
1,"Comfortable, stay in place, easy to use.  Very happy with my purchase and the price is great!"
1,Who needs Beats by Dre!? Save hundreds and get terrific quality and ease of use! I love to lift weights and run so these are perfect for that because I don't have an extra piece on the strap to change songs or change the volume that dangles while I workout. Great bluetooth range and comfortable to wear.
1,I am very pleased with my purchase. I was able to use the headphones right out of the box. The delivery was fast and all items in the box work as expected. The headphones are a great value for the price.
1,"For the price, these are outstanding.  Disregarding $$, these headphones still provide amazingly good sound.  They work especially well with Apple watch while I'm at the gym.  Stereo sound seems to be coming out of the center of my head!"
0,This product worked perfectly for 3 months. After 3 months it doesn't connect to any device. Wasted money
1,"great headphones, decided to try this since the Beats were out of stock and honestly not disappointed. The quality is a bit lower but at almost a 4th of the cost I dont think many of us can complain."
1,Great earphones. Great sound quality and I don't even know I'm wearing them during my workout.
1,Easy to connect to phones i have.
1,"While the Senso Bluetooth Headphones I purchased were a gift for a friend, I did want to check them out because I am looking to purchase a set of Bluetooth headphones myself. I was able to inspect the headphones and was pleased with the build quality, particularly of the soft rubber ear loops and silicone pads. The headphones also came with a nice set of accessories as described above.<br /><br />My friend reports that they are easy to pair, sound as good as his daughters Beats, and are comfortable.<br /><br />Now all I have to do is wait for Amazon to get more in stock as they were sold out this morning."
1,Bought these for my husband. He sweats A LOT!  He wore these at the gym for almost 2 hrs without fit or functions issues at all. 2 thumbs up!
1,"Exactly as advertised. Very well built and great sound. No complaints at all.<br /><br />I am updating this review.  It is still a 5 star headphone.  About 10 months after purchasing the headphones the left headphone stopped working.  I contacted SENSO and at first they attempted to trouble shoot the issue, but they still did not work.  SENSO then sent me new headphones.  No questions asked.  Excellent Customer service!"
1,"Battery lasts a 10 he shift, loud, I'm a welder and the main button is easy to use with gloves. Best I've ever had."
0,"If I was writing about my first pair, the rating would have been 5 STARS, however that pair got stolen and I reordered only to receive a new pair that sound TINNY and NOTHING like the original purchases.  I suspect they don’t have good quality control or have gone to cheaper components....too bad it WAS a great product, but alas no more :-("
1,great quality for this price.
0,Sound quality is poor. Much cheaper similar ones and also much more basic ones had much better audio quality and range. Very Disappointed. Shocked and in disbelief that these were ever sold for anywhere near the &#34;original&#34; price. These shouldn't be the best seller if so the large markdown must be the only reason.
1,"The Senso S-250 Acive Buds Bluetooth headphones are absolutely amazing. They have a very high-volume, if needed and truly are noise canceling. I read many excellent reviews on these headphones prior to purchasing them so I didn't expect them to be good. Once I receive them, paired them with my iPhone 6 and listened to music through them, I was really blown away. They exceeded my expectations by far. The rechargeable batteries last for 5-6 hours.<br />I have gone out and bought it additional pair for myself and one for my son who also loves them."
1,I love these earbuds. They are comfortable to wear and eady to set up.
0,"It breaks within 3 month, and I don't even use that much."
1,"I have had headphones about three days, seem to be very comfortable and no wires.  The only thing I noticed, on the package  it shows a wire tie, I don't know what that is and was NOT in the package?  I would recommend to friends.  It  is easy to pair with other devices which is great if you are not tech oriented."
1,I was skeptical that they would not live up to the reviews !!! Boy  Was I WRONG! They are actually better ! The rich base sound and the total clarity is fantastic !  They are comfortable and stay in place even with a lot of movement!  They are perfect for any weather !  The volume control is placed well<br />And it is easy to receive calls !  I love them !!!!
1,Using these paired with my fitbit. They are extremely easy to use and fit really well. I like how easy it goes around your ear and bends to keep them tight.  Havent had any issues other than occasional cutting in and out which doesnt usually happen unless they need charged. Like the case thats included to keep everything together.  Very good product for the price.  Couldn't be happier with my life purchase. Good job Senso!
1,I have bought 4 of them. I liked them so well gave them as gifts for Christmas. Everyone else has enjoyed them as well.<br />I like that the “wire” connecting the ear buds does not have the controls attached. This bounces around a lot when running. This keeps it simple and clean.
1,"Love it, great purchase"
1,"I absolutely love this product. I have tried multiple Bluetooth headphones in the last couple of months as I need something that will work well in the gym. These headphones outperform them all. Most notably it outperforms the Jaybird X3 headphones. I bought the Jaybirds which were $130 and I ended up returning them a week later. The Bluetooth connection made the headphones unusable. However, these Senso Bluetooth Headphones which I was able to get for $35 have the best connection from any Bluetooth headphones I have ever used. They do not cut out at all when walking around in the open air like the Jaybirds and the distance needed between the phone and headphones is quite far. I am able to leave my phone down in the gym and do my workout without having to make sure my phone is close by.<br /><br />There is one thing that made me give this product only 4 stars instead of 5. After a couple of days when I turned on the headphones and started listening to the music from my phone, the connection started to drop intermittently. This was easily fixed as I just had to unpair the headphones from my phone completely and then re-pair them. This took a couple of minutes and I was back listening to music. It is a small thing but honestly the only thing I can really come up with that would fault these headphones.<br /><br />Pros: Great Bluetooth connection (apart from small blip noted above). Comfortable when wearing for a long time. Stay in my ear when exercising.<br /><br />Cons: Does not match the sound quality of the Jaybird X3. Connection can drop (Easily fixed)<br /><br />I will be doing a full review on all Bluetooth headphones on my tech blog burritobytes.com once I have finished reconstruction."
1,My husband bought these for me and I really like them and the ease of connecting. They just happen to be slightly to large around the ear for me and I'm constantly adjusting them. They would be amazing if they just clung to the ears a little better.
1,"I really like these as workout headphones, even with intense sprinting. The little over the ear chord does an excellent job of keeping the earbud in place. I would also like to add how great the company is--I didn't receive the wire wrap in my purchase (which I wasn't even aware I would be receiving therefore I wasn't concerned with it, however they still sent me one in the mail! Great product and great customer service! The battery power lasts and lasts too, much longer than my last pair of a different brand :)"
1,Awesome!!!
1,"They don't really fit securely in the ear, the result being wind noise and they always feel like they're going to fall out.  I suggest  looking at the Panasonic ErgoFit design, which is very secure.  Another suggestion is to separate the ear bud from the &#34;brain&#34; of the headphones and put a clip on the &#34;brain&#34; so it can be clipped to your shirt.  This would remove most of the weight that pulls the buds out of you ear."
1,"These Headphones are so Damn cool.  The fact that it comes with many accessories is by far the coolest, especially the car charger.<br />The quality sound is perfect.  I'm loving my Sensor headphones.<br />I recommend them to my friends, co-workers & family.<br /><br />Keep up the great work.<br /><br />Yours truly<br />A very satisfied customer."
0,I bought these earbuds to listen to my music while doing yard work. I found with my phone in my pocket the ear buds did not work efficiently.  They would crackle and break up.  I take my phone out of my pocket and they work fine. Not to happy about that. But if you just want to listen to music quietly at you office or in bed it would work for you. When you receive a call on the other hand it works great. Very clear and easy to use when it is not covered up in your pocket or backpack.
1,I am very pleased with the quality of my SENSO headphones and the reasonable price! They arrived when promised. Their quality has enhanced my video chat sessions with my personal trainer.
1,"The audio quality I quite clear.  The package components were terrific with the charging cable, car adapter, and handy case..  The battery life is great -- as I used them for six hours without recharging.  The only drawback is that they do not feel secure and one side fell out of/off my ear regularly.  For me, they are just too loose."
1,"These headphones are terrific.  For starters, they pair with any device effortlessly.  They fit very comfortably and stay put,even during strenuous (i.e., sweaty) workouts.  One press of the button and the music is paused.  One more press and the phone is answered.  As for the phone feature, this was a nice surprise.  The ability to use these headphones for cell phone calls was not on my mind when I purchased these this set, but now I use them on calls, especially long calls, all the time. The other parties to my calls tell me that I come through crisply and clearly.<br />One caution:  Read the instructions as to charging this device.  Do not over charge them, and do not charge them overnight.  This is my second set of SENSO headphones.  My first set (an earlier model) also worked great but I did, in fact, over charge them and their function now is inconsistent (sometimes they work, sometimes they don't).  I did not let this first experience deter me from buying another set, and I am glad I didn't.  Really a great value.  I could not be happier with my purchase."
1,I use these for eveything when it comes to activities and music. Durable also
0,"The WORST,  In 6 months I've gone through 3 pairs.  Out of nowhere they just stop working .  3 separate times (3 pairs).  Don't waste you money (as I, apparently, have)."
1,"Overall decent for the price, good highs and mids, bass is too high sounds like garbage.  Downloaded an equalizer and adjusted bass, sounds much better.  Definitely not comparable to power beats 3 which i had to send to apple because battery died.  Its worth the price but not  on the same level as beats."
1,"These are amazing, and only had to be replaced after 3 years because TSA lost them at the airport!  Ours even worked after running in the pouring rain multiple times."
1,Not the most secure wireless headphones.  The over the ear piece is too soft and does not hold earbuds in place.  Haven't tried running with them yet but I struggle using them at work and on the elliptical.  Even switched the cushions thinking the size was too large or too small.  this helped some but not enough to keep them in during motion.
0,These are definately not waterproof.. i was running n it suddenly started raining.. within a minute the headphones went off.. now its a peice of crap.. n doesn’t work anymore..
1,"For the price it good, but it has some issues with connectivity it takes about 30 seconds to actually hear the sound even though it shows as connected."
1,This is a good product for its price. The design is cool.
1,absolutely phenomenal sound. Tremendous value for the price.
1,Great sound for the price.  Stays put
0,"the wire that connected the earbuds felt very thin. The left bud was buzzing, and sound was HORRIBLE. I put my iPhone in treble mode, and the bass was still way to high. These headphones sound like someone put a newspaper over the speakers. From what I've read, many people feel the same about the bass. Spend the extra cash for sony, or just buy cheapies and replace them."
0,"These headphones were great while they lasted. Charge light comes on but the headphones won’t connect to any of my devices anymore. The wires look fine, not bent or damaged they just won’t work anymore. Can’t seem to get the company or the Assurant Protection plan to email me back! Otherwise they were comfortable and functional. For the price they were good until they stopped working all together!"
1,"They sound great, comfortable."
1,"awesome headphones, great sound, easy to use."
1,"I love the ease of use, design and utility of the earbuds. This is my third pair, 1 for home, 1 for work, and 1 for my ex partner (his are still going strong after 2 years!).  They are the easy to use (connectivity), great sound quality and button response, light weight, and decent battery life. They are durable and have withstood a lot of abuse and use! I've used them in rainstorms, on the beach/boat, and at amusement parks. Unlike other earbuds, I'm not worried about loosing one or both, as the strap is a life-saver, and the ear holder, helps to keep them in place during activity.  Only downside is the battery life could be better."
1,I've had these before and I just replace the one that I couldn't find I love those  Headphone speakers.
1,"I bought these in March and liked them but here it is July and they have stop working specifically I can't charge them .  Headphones should last for more than 4 months.<br /><br />So far the headphones are very good.  The Mic picks up my voice and the person I’m talking to can hear me fine.  Easy to setup. Nice look good sound quality, reasonably priced.  I ordered a second pair for my wife."
1,"Bought these for myself, then my son's earbuds broke (different brand) so I gave these to him. He loves them, especially the flexible ear pieces. I guess I have to order another pair for myself now!"
0,"I bought these to wear at several running events and they failed on me after the second run. I called to have them replaced and the customer support staff at Senso told me on two occasions that (over 3 months) that the replacement headphones were on their way. When I called again after 5 months to check on my replacement order, they told me I was beyond my warranty and would have to submit my complaint via email with the details that I had already provided via the phone 3 times. Click off of this page now and find more a reliable product with decent customer service."
1,Sound is great and fit on the ear perfectly. Only issue is connectivity. When I turn them on I have to manually connect them instead of them connecting automatically. I can walk ten feet away and it’ll go out also.
1,Great customer services. Great product
0,"these lasted about a year then lost one ear piece, not really impressed."
1,"So far, have used them for a couple of days and they are working great. Connects easily, sound is clear and they are comfortable to wear. Would definitely recommend them."
1,"Great sound quality and very stable when working out or running. Blows Beats out of the water, and less than half the price."
1,great sound! great price!
1,"I like the quality of this product (for its price). It doesn't always connect automatically after being paired though. Also, it would be good if the volume buttons could be switched around in future releases of the product. Other than that, it's great."
1,"I am giving this 5 stars for multiple reasons. First off - I do not want to spend $150+ for wireless earbuds. For this price, I honestly think it's worth giving a shot. It doesn't fall out while I work out which is the main reason I bought it. You also get different sizes of the buds so that helped a lot. The customer service is also great. I would buy from again."
1,They worked great for about a month and got progressively worse until they finally stopped working completely.
1,I am very happy with my headphones.
1,Great sound and fit in my ears pretty good. The price ain't bad either.
1,"Pros:<br />1. Won't fall out of your ear when you're active like Apple Airbuds.<br />2. Sound quality is good, but I'm not an expert audiophile. I use them mostly for audiobooks.<br />3. Easy to pair to iPhone (after paired first time).<br />4. Volume controls work well, as well as on/off.<br />5. Has a case for the buds, although it could have been slightly larger. As it is, it fits into pocket or purse easily.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Sometimes won't cling to the ear right away. The ear-hangers are malleable so you can get a grip.<br />2. Everything is black, so don't think of setting these up in a dark room.<br />3. Will work best line-of-sight. Mine would not work well in another room from source."
1,"LOVE these headphones! I have pretty small ear holes so I was afraid these wouldn't stay in my ears, but they stay in there tightly even while running! Comes with so many useful items. So happy with this purchase!"
1,I love them...they charge up pretty quickly and they last all day!
1,"They arrived on time and are easy to use, no muss, no fuss"
1,I used it everyday for the gym but really hard to pair with iphones. Everyday day i have to try 4 or 5 times turning off the bluethooh in order to pair besides that its great.
0,"I had a friend swear by these and state how great they are, but I found better brands and products that preform far better than this one. The sound quality is fine and the overall build quality isn't bad, but the piece that goes over the ear is super flimsy and cheap. The worst part is the microphone; you are literally unidentifiable by anyone on the other end of a phone call. I even listened to myself in a voice message and holy cow, sounds like I was talking through the lowest quality 1920's radio.<br /><br />If you're just looking for attached, bluetooth headphones for music these will get the job done, but honestly there are far better brands out there for the same price or $5 more!"
1,"So far so good! I usually have the volume all the way up, or close to it, when running outside, but that’s just because I like my music loud to pump me up. No issues yet. Hopefully they don’t start to lose sound quality or volume like others have experienced! My ears are pretty small so the ear hooks are only somewhat effective, but I put a headband over them and they stay perfectly in place! Definitely better than traditional earbuds."
1,"Just what I was looking for. Secure on the ear, comfortable and long battery life. All my other Bluetooth headphones only last 4 hours before need to recharge. This one is good for 8 hours. Recommend this product!<br /><br />Knocked off one star for the inability to connect the 3 feet charging cable (tips anyone?). And the headphones don't fit well in the carrying case."
1,We loved our 1 st pair so much that we purchased 2 more pair!!  They are awesome --great quality and price
1,"These are really great headphones. The sound quality on these rates up there with over the ear headphones and goes way beyond what I'm used to for earbuds. The microphone works okay. I called a couple of people I know specifically to ask them how well it worked. They said it's a bit on the quiet side and needed to turn up there volume. However, the sound quality was clear. I'm still not clear how they do this with no microphone hanging off of it.The noise cancelling seems to work pretty good. I was able to transition from a quiet shop (no equipment running) to a noisy shop (46&#34; wood lathe and Craftsman shop vac running) and only had to turn up the volume &#34;two clicks&#34;.<br /><br />The comfort of these are top notch. Every earbud I've worn in the past after about two hours I'm shifting them around because my ear canal is starting to hurt. I wore these in the shop last night for about three hours with no discomfort. It's also great having the controls on the headphone. When my wife comes into the shop I no longer need to pull the phone out of my pocket and fumble with the controls so I can hear what she is saying; I just click the side button and the music is paused.<br /><br />I'll be honest; when I first ordered these I was concerned about the quality based on the cost (you typically get what you pay for), but these buds punch way above their weight class. I have already recommended these to two of my coworkers and one of them just purchased a set. If you need a set of earbuds, get these; you won't be disappointed!"
1,"Very happy. I just received them, and they seem to work just as advertised. I bought them to wear on my motorcycle, and they block outside noise and sound really great. Customer service is outstanding!"
1,Have had these for a few months. They’re great. I accidentally washed one pair a few weeks after receiving them and I was given a new pair under warranty no problem!! I also like how I can charge them at home or in my car on the way to the gym. I would recommend these for anyone looking to get a decent pair of wireless headphones.
0,"These head phones had great sound as well as packaging but a few problems were so overwhelming that I ended up returning them within a week.<br /><br />1) Would not remain in my ears<br />This was the main problem. For the life of me I could not keep these to remain in my ears during workouts. They remained in walking but any vigorous movements would progressively dislodge them (within minutes) until they eventually would fall out. I tried all the extra ear plug inserts but none worked. If the component that wrapped around the ears was more rigid, it possibly could have prevented this.<br /><br />2) Interference in signal<br />When using these headphones around the gym, I suffered from varying levels of interference where there was quick signal breaks, while the phone remain paired with the headphones. This happened well within the Bluetooth range (under 5ft). I believe this interference was due to other Bluetooth devices because in a room without any other devices would remain connected without problems. I had not experienced these problems as severe before with other blue headphones. If this was the only problem I would still be satisfied with the product.<br /><br />Reading the other reviews it appears that I am an outlier with the fitting problem. As far as I know my ears are normally sized but for some reason these headphones unfortunately would not work for me."
1,Very good headphones for the price!
1,"Surprisingly good sound quality for the price of these things. Noise cancellation is great too, so much I've actually missed important things. Will be my go to headphones for a while"
1,These have been very good.  Love the soft rubber over the ear thing.  Very comfy.  Great sound.
1,"Love these headphones! They are very light weight, good sound and fit securely when i am running on the treadmill."
1,I have a pair of powerbeats 3. I prefer to use these over those because it has such a good user interface. I can actually know when I have a low battery and it's nice to know when It's conected. The ability to hold the volume button to change the song is really nice because I don't need to take my phone out of my pocket. I work outdoors as a grounds keeper. I've warn these in the rain a they work great because they are water proof. The case with new tips and a small power cord is really nice. It also came with a iPhone/micro USB cable and a USB car plug. All for an amazing price. I actually would pay more for it if I ever had to replace them. Daily user
1,"So far these are fantastic headphones! I've been using them for over a week at the gym and generally around the house, and they have performed . extremely well. They ear hooks keep them in place, and work really well with the actual replacement buds. The battery life seems terrific and I haven't had to charge them because of the battery dying. They sync really fast to your device, and so far they work with my iPhone 7 just fine.<br /><br />As for the sound, it's spot on for workout headphones. It doesn't produce much bass, but I usually listen to podcasts and the speaking voices come through very clear. The lack of bass is a little disappointing, but it's not enough to look past these headphones. I've also had a few calls with these, and the other line doesn't seem to have any troubles hearing me.<br /><br />Overall, these are absolutely fantastic headphones and they definitely deserve the 5 star rating! You can't bear the price and the extra accessories you get with it! I would recommend these to anybody looking for bluetooth headphones and especially for working out."
1,Product just started being used but charging is taking effect.
1,"Comfortable, Clean, Rich Wireless audio."
1,awesome no complaints has different sizes for your ear. My only thing is that the loop that goes around your ear very flexible.<br />Also a bit of a pain got stuck inside my collar when working trying to move and the ear piece popped out.<br />Going to buy another pair for the wife.
1,"I like these headphones they work pretty well with my Samsung S7, great for when I use skype or when I make regular phone calls. They're pretty great because i dont have to look at my phone when i hang up or try to re-call a phone number that didn't answer the first time i called. The only reason why it's a 4 star is because the earloops are no adjustable because my ears are really small and the loops goes above the back of my ear, the only thing holding those earloops in place are my piercings but without them the earloops wouldn't even go on my ear because it's too big."
1,"They work great, just what I was looking for. Good fit and good sound. The buds stay in nicely and can hardly tell the ear hooks are there."
1,"Fit and function is nice, sounds great., easy to pair and use daily."
0,"The tech in these headphones deteriorate very, very quickly. I use Them at the gym 3-4 times per week, and the range on the Bluetooth has gotten shorter and shorter. The battery life has gotten shorter as well. I reccomend Buying a mainstream pair of Bluetooth headphones for a little more cash."
1,Great for the price range
1,"works great and are very comfortable. i would give 5 stars but for whatever reason, the right ear piece doesn't stay in my ear as well as the left one. i changed it to the smaller bud but i might have to go back to the larger one to see if that works better. otherwise, 5 stars."
1,"The buttom was broken, hard to use anymore..."
1,"Los he comprado ya dos veces porque perdí los primeros. Definitivamente los amo, cancela el ruido pero no del todo, excelente para salir a correr, si tienes las orejas pequeñas no los recomiendo porque se pueden desajustar. Pero es excelente, para la música"
1,"They work great but my only problem would have be that there's no function to skip music, well at least I haven't figured it out"
1,Fast delivery. Great product
1,"Simple to pair, sounds great and feels great when you put them. Awesome price!!"
1,Very comfortable! Feels great while I run or workout
0,I bought three pairs of these. One pair won’t even hold its charge any more
1,"Solid headphones with decent sound. The bass is great. However, I don’t think these are made for smaller ears. I added the small earpiece but the hooks don’t bend very well to fit my ear. I ended up giving them to my boyfriend because they weren’t comfortable to run in."
0,My earbuds stopped working after only 2 months. Not worth the money
0,"I will be returning these headphones immediately,  as they come promised with features,  namely one specific feature that was integral to my purchase,  that do not work as advertised.  This product is claimed to be waterproof.  I bought them for the purpose of swimming, so this feature was key when I was picking out the correct headphones. They were even the first result when I typed in &#34;swimming headphones&#34; on Amazon. Despite all of this, they stopped working as soon as they went underwater,  and now will not connect to my Bluetooth decides. They have very good sound quality,  but the false advertising is forcing me to give them one star. I'm appalled that a product would be advertised as &#34;water proof&#34; on the listing and on the box, as well as come up when specifically searching for swimming headphones, only to cease function as soon as they hit the water."
1,"At any price these headphones are great.<br /><br />The sound quality is fantastic. Listening to my old Alan Parsons Project albums, reminded me of the sound quality that I've been missing now that I  listen to my music on my phone. The sound quality is comparable to listening to my music on my  stereo, with my Mission 770 speakers. True that the base will never be same as speakers, but the sound reproduction is in the same league.  Other headphones that I've used, wired or Bluetooth aren't.<br /><br /> I've always had trouble getting headphones staying in my ears when I jog. These headphones fit well, although not perfect. No matter what size ear tip I use (there are three sizes) my left earpiece isn't as snug as the right, but it doesn't fall out.  These replaced my Yurbuds Leap 100s which I hated. Unlike my Yurbuds, these don't fall out and sound 100 times better.<br /><br />The minor nit that I have with these headphones is that the buttons are on the earpiece itself, rather than on the wire which connects the two earpieces. I've inadvertently stopped my music adjusting the earpiece in my ear. Also to me the volume buttons seem backwards. For the first few days of using these headphones, I was mixing up high and low volume buttons, because when in my ear the low volume button is higher than the high volume button.<br /><br />Overall I'm very satisfied with these headphones, the sound quality is truly amazing, and because of the price I don't think that you can go wrong buying these."
1,very hi quality wireless headphones. plain and simply
1,"It is okay product for the beginners. I bought it for my Delta flight overseas, but I definitely don't hear HD sound through these Senso headphones. The quality of the sound is good, but on scale from 1 - 5, I'd give it a 3+"
0,"I took good care of them,  never fell or anything like that. It won't turn on. I wouldn't recommend it,  spend a little more money for some headphones that are actually worthy."
1,Good battery life. Not the best sound but decent compared with the price of such a device/ Good buy in the end
1,So far so good
1,"I bought a pair of the Senso bluetooth headphones. After a month, I might've been the only one so far that had a malfunction with them; nevertheless, when I notified Senso of the malfunction I was sent a new pair ASAP. No questions asked! Great customer service. They responded to my email and exchanged the pair of headphones immediately. Almost makes me want to by a second pair now because customer service along with a great product is even better. BTW: I have been using my headphones to sync with my iPhone while running outdoors....very good feel for me."
0,I'm not sure if this product is really as bad as two stars however I bought these because they are rated 4 and 1/2 Stars over so many people and I needed to balance it out because I think the base quality is absolutely terrible if there is anything with a lot of bass it sounds like a bad speaker and I feel it's totally unacceptable if I knew this is how they sounded I would not have ordered them
1,Arrived on time.  Good quality sound.  Well worth the price
1,"After being disappointed with a cheap pair of BT earphones I decided to invest in a quality pair because I was hooked by the convenience of this technology.  This product was well worth the price, I could tell just by the box they came in that was going to be a good choice. I commute daily on the train and not having wires to tangle is amazing and these are great for running. The battery life gets me through even the longest runs and because there is no control box on the wires connecting them I don't have to secure them tight to avoid the irritation of something bouncing up and down on the back of my neck. With the controls on the ear piece there is complete symatry. The sound is also great and have a healthy and enjoyable bass which I enjoy.  I've already reccommended them to friends."
1,Great sound and easy to wear!
1,"These earbuds are of a very good quality for the price, and pairing them with my phone was painless.  I would recommend them."
1,"great wireless ear buds, these work good.  and they keep a charge forever."
1,"Love these. Quality is almost as. Good as BEATS, for a fraction of the cost."
1,These are the best headphones I own...
1,"I have only used it 2 times so far. It’s worked fine, stays in the ear. Will write back after a few more uses."
1,"I bought these when I was training for my half marathon.  They stayed in my ear pretty well for the most part (excess sweat made them wiggle a little but that’s normal). Had them over a year now and have run hundreds of miles with them.  Still going strong.  Sound quality is average, no complaints."
1,"*update nov 15, 2018 - below I wrote a 5 star review because I thought these were comparable to my beats. After 14 months, these will no longer charge. For the price, a year isn’t bad, wearing them for workouts nearly everyday, but I don’t think they deserve 5 stars any more<br /><br />I've only had these for about a week, but they're great so far. I got them as a back-up for my Beats wireless, and they are very comparable for less than a quarter of the price. The headphones stay in while I'm running and the sound is clear and loud for my workouts Lo ke I want. These are a great buy!"
1,"Even though the left earbud stopped working, the costumer support was very nice in trying to help fix the issue and gave me new earbuds when it did not work right away. Overall good earbuds and great costumer support"
1,I use the headphones while at the gym and I love them. They are easy to use and stay perfect in place.
1,The clarity of these headphones is exceptional.  My buying experience was great.
1,I bought the senso 300 activBuds and was blown away by the quality of these buds sound was great and clean<br />after about six wks they stopped working while i was using them at first i thought the battery had ran down but then i thought i've only been listening for about three hrs and they always are good for at least six hrs so i emailed senso and with in an hour they responded and had me do a reset on them and they work great again.  (the support that i got from senso was fantastic just like the products they sell) thanks from a happy customer.
1,"DO NOT BUY THESE IS YOU LIKE CLEAN SOUND! (KIND OF... SEE UPDATE BELOW)<br />I am returning these, which is unfortunate because I really like their feel.<br /><br />(Updated from 1 star to 3 stars after some adjustments. See update)<br /><br />Pros: Good feel, fit well.<br />Cons: Mid and high range are horribly distorted and muffled due to what seems to be some kind of built in EQ that amplifies the bass. That is all you can hear is the bass. It isn't even a nice rich deep base, it sounds like bass being played through a small sized speaker. I couldn't even fix it with setting the EQ to vocals inside of the unit. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I was going back and forth between the wired $5 headphones, and these and the $5 pair was 100% clearer.<br /><br />If you like quality sound, you won't like these. If you don't care and just want to listen to bass all day without being able to hear anything else... then you will like these.<br /><br />UPDATE (Up to 3 stars): Ok, after I wrote this I did a little more research. I found that about 90% of the sport earphones have this issue. I believe it has to do with the design. If I removed the rubber ear part, I could hear the sound clear without the bass being overpowering. So I kept digging. I am using an iPod Nano 7th Gen, and I found that if I changed the EQ to &#34;Bass Reduction&#34; it really improved the sound. The bass seemed to stop overpowering the highs and mids. Also, the highs and mids seem to come in better. Trust me, there is STILL plenty of bass, but it just isn't as overpowering. It is more level. But without the EQ the bass would be way too much on these."
1,"Good sound, a bit heavy and not a good fit for running.  They would pop out of my ears after a short time running."
0,I ordered these for my wife to go with her new Pixel and unfortunately the plastic part that wraps around your ear is giant and does not adjust. She wasn't able to keep them on her ears. For the price I figured I would try them out and she could get a different pair. They fit on my ear good enough and came with different bud sizes for inside your ear. They synced up to my S8 easily and sounded good when I turned them on with my phone in my hand. I got out of the car to play basketball and put the phone in my pocket and heard a scratchy noise like the bluetooth signal was weak. I started warming up with my phone in my hoodie pocket thinking it was a bit closer and may fix the issue but it did not. The connection was terrible. I had to take them out completely because they couldn't even make it through a full song with out cutting out. I have a pair of LG bluetooth headphones I have been using for years that have never had this problem so I know it isn't my phone. I was surprised with all of the high star reviews and appearance of quality manufacturing that the functionality of the &#34;Active&#34; earbuds really don't work while active. I just dropped them off at the post office for a return. The return process seems easy enough so far and they give you a full refund so it is worth a try- maybe I just got a bunk pair.
1,"I bought these as dedicated audible book headphones for my Kindle PaperWhite. The idea was to have a ready device for middle of the night listening on a budget, so I wasn't expecting audiophile quality and to be sure they aren't that, but I have since connected them to my laptop and smartphone with surprising results! The sound quality rivals a pair of Samsung Level-U for which I spent several times more. Battery life could be better, my experience being between 5 and 6 hours depending on volume level. The upside is that recharge occurs in about an hour and a half. Overall I am very pleased with this purchase because of the relative value."
1,Very nice quality and sound for the price.. I use them at the gym everyday and they stay in my ears when I'm working out.
1,"I was tired of catching the cord of my headphones and ripping them out of my ears. So after much research it came down to 3 Bluetooth headphones, so i went with these. The product came fast and came with lots of accessories including 2 charging cables, a case, a car charging adapter, and 3 different sized ear pieces. Have had one week. charging only took about an hour and ive done three 2 hour gym sessions with no charge in between. The sound quality is great. Pairing and button use is easy. Overall very happy with my purchase."
1,Headphone audio quality is very good.
1,Good product.WAS well packaged.WOULD purchase again.
1,"These are exactly what I hoped they would be. High quality, good for jogging or long commutes. I am really pleased with this product."
1,This is perfect for workout and outdoor activities. Its very easy to connect and controls are easily accessible. Perfect product for the price.
1,"My first Bluetooth set. Wore them the entire time on a roundtrip from NYC to Boston, couldn't be happier. Charged quickly the night before (I totally geeked out over the microUSB/lightning port design!). My phone's navigation directions were crystal clear, the set was comfortable to wear, and the buttons were easy to use. Literally my only improvement would be to tether the charging cord endcaps to cord so the caps don't get lost."
0,These particular ear phones don't even stay on your ears when running.
1,Absolutely love this - great sound and comfortable!
1,"I have gone through so many Bluetooth headphones; I seriously have a collection. I'm very specific with how the headphones fit into my ears (I've got pretty small ears) and I've found that most headphones tend to fall out super easily. This especially gets annoying when my primary use of these is for the gym. So I was on the lookout for a new pair of Bluetooth headphones after I lost my other favorite pair. I took a chance with these and I'm so glad I did! Not only are the default &#34;gummies&#34; on these fit perfectly, but the sound is superb for its price. I usually spend 1.5 hours at 4 days a week, and I usually only have to charge them by the 4th day. Also, the extra accessories are just a steal for the price.<br /><br />If you don't want to shell out too much money for a pair of headphones, then grab these as they are definitely worth it."
1,I just got them and they work great! Good quality for the price...
1,I really enjoyed these headphones. They were not uncomfortable in my ears and held charge almost all of the working day. They recently shorted and I was worried about having to buy another pair. The company  was very very prompt addressing my customer service needs and are sending me a new pair to replace my current ones! Highly impressed! Let's hope these last longer!
1,Great product at a great price!  You'll be happy with them.
1,Great product!!
1,"I had a little trouble with fit at first but once I got the proper silicone earpieces on it was fine.  Sound quality and volume are fantastic for this type of device. I can testify to 8.5 hrs run time on battery at TV volume, at very low level I think I got nine to ten hours a couple of times.  Range is excellent, I've been as far as 55' in my garage through 3 walls. (It depends on your transmitter of coarse.)  Customer service is top of the line!  I had a little problem with my first pair (micro usb the most likely culprit, can't blame manufacturer for that). Loved them so much I bought a second pair and customer service is sending replacement for defective one."
1,"Really satisfied with this purchase. I've only had the headphones for about a week but they perform really well. I have no problems with them staying in my ears as I'm working out. Their sound is clear and powerful. The range of the Bluetooth connection is good. They were fairly priced and came with a bunch of extra stuff (replacement earbuds, mobile charger and extra charging wire). No complaints."
0,This is my second pair of these. The first one never worked. They constantly would get staticy. My second pair stopped working the first week. DO NOT BUY
1,Having difficulty with the buds staying in my ears<br />Good sound and battery is good. If you have any suggestions with the buds please let me know<br />emclean@comcast.net
1,Fabulous purchase sound is better than much higher priced earphones
1,Pretty good.
1,"it was a gift, but he said he's enjoying them"
1,So worth the money! Could not have made a better choice.
0,"Did not last over a year. Sound quality was poor. Only knew how bad it was after trying another brand once it started breaking (static, sound started coming out of only one bud, etc). Would not purchase again, nor recommend."
1,"I'm very pleased with the earbuds. They're all around great: sound quality, build quality and battery life. As for durability, I'll know in a few months as my earbuds typically last that long. They're fantastic for exercise and stayed put through constant movement."
0,No need buying 200 beats. These do the job for a fraction of the money. UPDATED: Rhey work best as headphones. Don't count on the mic working well for phone calls.
1,"Although only recently received, I love them! I have high hopes they will last me a long time. I like the design. They are comfortable. The sound is great considering they are earbuds! I had them connected to my phone in a matter of seconds! Easy and no hassle what-so-ever."
1,"I'm hearing impaired,they are good quality sound and loud enough for me to be able to hear well. Still getting used to them as far as fit goes. Best blue tooth ear buds that I have tried so far. Especially for the price. Now if I can just remember where I put them."
1,Working Great still use on my commutes. Decent range<br />Good battery
1,Extremely pleased with it
1,"Great headphones.  Stays in place when running and doesnt slip out for me.  First headphones that do this for me, love it!"
1,"Good audio quality, great base. Good fit and finish. The included memory foam inserts really block out sound. Recommend whether or not you are on a budget. Much better sound than the Beats that I had before."
1,Love these light weight wireless ear buds. The price is fantastic!
1,"Wonderful product, works as expected"
1,My headphones had broke after 7 months of use but the warranty worked just as promised. Customer service was quick to process my request and I should receive a new pair in a few days. Very professional!
0,"When i first got this i really liked it. the only problem i had with it is if you answered a call i had to go back to the phone to restart the music player. HOWEVER, since then, play time has shortened considerably. I was able to get 3 trips to the gym, about 6 hours, now it is no more than maybe 3 hours, quits on the second trip, if that long. The other problem, and i am sure related to the short play time, if i dont use it or recharge it for 3 or 4 days, (without use from the last charge) it goes dead in just a few minutes.This is used in the gym only, never been wet or even damp, maybe some sweat, never dropped, always kept in the case sooo. I really wish i had sent it back when i first noticed, now it been too long since purchase in February."
1,Arrived on time. Was ready to go right out the box. It fits well and sound great for the price.
1,These are great Bluetooth headphones for a really good price. I already have a pair that I use at work all the time so I got another pair for home. They are easy to put on and noise cancel at open office. The charge really fast and stay in use for more than full work day. Connect really easy to iPhone every time. Using these as cellphone headset the person on other end can hear themselves so the mic is really sensitive.  Sensor also sends very cool case and car cig lighter charger and a VERY COOL charge cord that does both iPhone and micro USB!!!!
1,"They stay in the ears.<br />The sound is good, not great.<br />There is some noise from the wind if you're going the wrong direction.<br />Overall good value"
1,Awesome headphones!
1,Good bluetooth headphones. Good for exercising. Decent sound.
1,Nice head phones
1,Excelentes .. buena conexión  sonido y nitidez
0,"Stopped working a month later... Tried all sorts of troubleshooting, but they did not work."
1,"Sound really good but product was defected and I got it replaced, thanks for the support team."
1,"Nice looking but only able to pair it once on my Galaxy Note 8. Will not pair on my laptop which is an HP with window 10. Well, stupid me, it was already paired on my phone and once I disconnected it, it paired perfectly.  Fits nice on ears, sounds good and love the little case"
1,These headphones work pretty well and the Senso team were really receptive to addressing some of the issues that I had with them. Senso is a great brand and product!
1,Impressed with  the  performance of this product .
0,"I was able to use them literally one time. Call their cs & you get a middle eastern guy that you can't understand who doesn't comprehend anything you're saying. Explained that they were once paired & worked great & now nothing. He asked if I'd like to reorder, I declined & told him I felt it was a waste of money as they're junk. They fit perfectly in my ears unlike the others I've tried so I'm very disappointed. Don't waste your money. You'll get Habib who doesn't think you know how to charge or turn on electronics."
1,"Fit is awesome, sounds is great unless its a Bass heavy hip Hop song, hint- turn on bass reducer on iphone.  Bass in electronic type music fine.  Good sound, good deal."
0,The cord that comes with it is much too large and need a tie to make it shorter. Also often get stutters when playing audio through them
1,"comfortable, great design, great sound quality. the only thing I would change is to have a shorter chord between the earbuds"
1,These earphones are amazing for the price. The sound is great and the battery is great. The comfort is also great.
1,A++
0,Worst headphones ever they won't pair and when they did finally pay her after about two hours of trying to pay are it was so low I could barely hear anyone talking the music wouldn't go loud and then the ear part was so loose. Will also be returning
1,Awesome product! Even more than expected
0,Horrible. The range on these is barely Timmy phone being in my pocket. The slightest bass note causes horrible distortion. I missed the return window by 8 days.
1,Nice headset. Wireless works great. Noise cancellation works great too.
1,"My son & grandson work in a loud warehouse, they are allowed to use earphones and these have worked out perfectly. Great product,  keep up the good work."
1,They are Great with listening to music but for phone calls ahh not so good.
1,Too much bass. Work great otherwise.
1,:)
1,Great quality for the price.  Stays in my ears during hard work-outs - battery good for at least three to four good workouts before needing to be recharged.
1,these are sensation.  comfortable and sound is clear and pure.  just bought a second set for a Christmas gift.
1,"I tried these right out of the box and was instantly happy.  They fit my ear well, which is not always the case with ear buds.  I purchased them to be able to listen to books on tape or podcasts while I'm exercising.  I think they will work out great!<br /><br />And, like other reviewers, I'm very happy with the accessories that came with them."
0,"One side just stopped working. I used them for 4 ~ 6 hours a day for a month. No idea why, but one side just stopped outputting sound."
1,This product works exactly as advertised. For the price it was a great deal.  They don't have BEATS quality but are not far of and way less expensive. Great Value!
0,"It's too big.  Doesn't fit.  Do I have tiny ears???  I didn't think so, but these just pop out...or hurt."
1,"I was surprised with the sound quality, it’s realky good , battery life is decent but over time it deacreased as expected, overall great for the price"
1,I bought these for my very active son and he absolutely loves them. I have put them in myself and the quality is great. Would definitely recommend.
1,I purchased these earbuds as a gift. I don't know how well they perform however after much research felt these were the best
0,"These headphones were fabulous for 7 months. At that point the power button broke. Supposedly they have a 1 year warranty, but I tried calling the manufacturer using the number on the website that is not valid. Additionally, I have sent several message on the senso Facebook site. No response. I really wish they would at least acknowledge that I am a customer having questions about the warranty. I expected these earbuds to last longer than 7 months!"
1,Sound quality is decent not stellar like I was expecting from all the reviews. Also the phone calls are crap the person on the other end says they can hear an echo. I wouldn't recommend buying these but I'm not gonna waste my time and money sending them back.
1,Great at first I had them for 3 months now and today they broke down. Item of working anymore
1,Great product!
1,great product for an unbeatable price.
0,"These are enormous! I don't know what size ear these are made for, but they hit so far above my ear that it totally defeats the purpose. I can't speak to the quality otherwise, as I did not try them out."
1,"Love em, work great!"
1,I've only had them about a week so far but I'm very impressed they are so comfortable they fit my ears great and they don't slide around and I think the sound is awesome. They seem really easy to use and are great quality. So right now thumbs up.👍👍👍 they got here quickly and not bad price. I will reprieve and add more to my review after I've had and used them longer but right now I'm really happy.!!!!! Thanks
1,"Great for walks, exercise and tuning out the kids....lol<br />Second pair.....dog ate the first."
1,"So far impressed, I can't seem to use a head phone jack, and these have the best reviews out there and seem to work the best!  I love them so far!"
1,I don't usually write reviews but I gotta say I like this one.
0,Poor Bluetooth signal between headphones and iPhone 8. Sound skips and drops out within a few feet (ex. device in pocket). Had to switch back to previous BT headphones.
1,Love them.very comfortable and the sound is awesome
1,"Easy to get started: Excellent<br />I was able to use them after charging them for a couple of hours.  Easy to sync to my cell and tablet. Tested out the buttons and had my coworker call me to test clarity. Took two days of using them and still to test their hardiness when I exercise.<br /><br />My work needs: Company has us using our personal cell phones for all calls. And in between, I listen to music. So far, noise cancelling and music playing is excellent. Haven't used yet for calls, but I have paused the music with the multifunction button on the headphone when I've had to talk to co-workers. I also walked far to get office supplies and could still hear my music. I was impressed by the reach.<br /><br />At home: I watch movies on my tablet after kids have gone to bed. Worked great. Sound is amazing. Only have right headphone in so I can hear my kids if they call out, so again, impressed with the quality of sound. I love SciFi, so space flight and gunfire and dialogue all sounds crisp and big."
1,"Amazing sound quality considering the price. Easy to use and charge. Perfect for running and weight training, doesn’t slip. Cord is quite long and looks a bit bulky but that is a very minor complaint. I also appreciate the zippered case it came with."
1,"Nice headphones!  Comfortable to wear, no conflict with my glasses, easy to sync to my phone, and good controls.  Nothing more I need.  I bought a second pair for my husband,"
1,Really good battery 🔋 life... At least 8 hours of continuos use... Sound is good.... Comes with good accessories... Everything you need.... Sound is really good but doesn't handle deep base but you would not buy these if that's all you listen too.... I highly recommend these well worth the price
0,"I liked the sound and hold to the ear, but i use it every now and then and now it will not charge. Worked for almost a year."
1,"An excellent wireless earbud set that worked as advertised. Noise reduction is not as good as my wired noise cancelling earbuds but it comes very close and the hi-fi sound is superior. The battery life is as advertised and rechargeable, but I wish that the charge indicator light was easier to see and examine. Bluetooth connection is very easy and all vocal prompts and verbal confirmations were loud and understandable. The earbuds are so light that you hardly will notice that you are wearing them and the buds fit vert nicely in the ear canal. Overall this is a very good set and I will now buy another for my other devices and discard my other wired earbuds that unfortunately have proven to have a limited life. Recommended."
1,The sound is good and the distance is great. I do have a problem with the ear buds. If I have them in my ear for over a half hour they start to hurt and that is also with trying the difference sizes. No matter the size there is still pain
1,Does not sit well on the ears. Feels wierd. Am not using this anymore.
1,"Was very happy with the product. Yes you maybe able to get better sounding headphones for 150, but not for the price of the Senso brand ones. Even with a 30 dollar price point the perform great and would recommend them to people."
0,"One Word - Highly Over Rated<br /><br />I brought this set and as soon as I touched it, it felt soft and flimsy, not sturdy at all. After using it for 3 months, it broke. It doesn't start any more.<br /><br />It is VERY FLIMSY product. Don't buy this product from Amazon reviews. Waste of time, money which leaves you frustrated."
0,"Ear pieces were two different sizes, specifically the silicon loop that is not adjustable which is supposed to fit around your ear. The right one was too large for any person to wear. I doubt Jim Carey would have even been able to fit the loop around his ear and the ear bud in it."
0,"After using the headphones for 5 months, they broke. They repeatedly turn themselves off even when fully charged, only the right side works, and only sometimes connects to my phone. Even begore this, my headphones would need to be completely reset in the middle of listening. They would just shut off with no warning, even when fully or mostly charged. Honestly just spend the extra and get Beats or AirPods. These are great until their trash."
0,"Nice Sound - Big Bang for your Buck - to Self- destruct<br />I was in love with this Bluetooth Headset having has the Dre Powerbeats prior.<br />The sound Quality was stellar for the price of the device.<br />The battery life was decent, however this device only lasted for 1 month with it being IPX Certified I was highly disappointed.<br />I did all of my Cardio with these headphones and they couldn't last over 30 days.<br /><br />SENSO does have a 1 year hassle free warranty so I will see how they handle this situation.<br />Maybe I just received a defective set, I will update my Review accordingly."
1,Works great!
1,"The headphones worked perfectly and the sound quality is excellent.  Also, their customer service is second to none.  I reached out Tekatron and they immediately helped me with my problem."
0,"I was very excited about these headphones. I hate working out with headphones connected to my phone. I hit the wire when running on the treadmill and make my phone go flying all the time. First time I used these I was amazed. So happy to not have my headphones connected to my phone. But now I’ve realized I need AirPods. I bought these because the hype around AirPods seemed ridiculous. But after using these headphone through multiple workouts they don’t stay in my ears. The wire gets stuck to the back of my neck when I sweat and ends up pulling my headphone loose on one side, then the sound isn’t right because one side is in tight and the other is loose so it’s not noise cancelling anymore just on one side. I’ve tried tightening the wire in the back, I’ve tried all four earbud sizes and types it comes with but I still find myself pushing them back in my ears constantly. And the pause button is on the side so when I push it back in my ear I end up pausing my music. I tired putting the wire in the front and it doesn’t pull out of my ears as much but it’s annoying to run with the wire hitting my chin and my chest. I’m bummed. I’ll keep them for flying or listening to music on the train. But I’m gonna need AirPods for working out."
1,Sound keeps cutting out when running unless phone is not in pocket.  Phone has to be near headphones.
1,These are AWESOME. I wasn’t familiar with the company and just ordered based off the reviews and I’m so glad I did. These are so great for the price and I’ve used them consistently with zero problems.
1,"The box says &#34;CVC 6.0 Noise Cancellation&#34; but I can't really tell that it's cancelling anything, which is the main reason I am deducting a star. Apparently, this kind of noise cancellation is optimized for phone calls in noisy locations, not music listening.<br />As earbuds go, they do an adequate job of reproducing sound, but my cheapy wired Sony earbuds sound better (in my opinion). My BOSE over the ear headphones still set the standard for noise reduction. I guess the real test will happen when I put these on and mow the grass, like I do with the BOSE! One does get an astonishing number of goodies in the box with these earbuds, making them a great value. Battery life is as advertised. I used these for about a day and a half at work, listening to music most of the time. Charging is quick: less than 2 hours."
1,"Great sound, battery life and I love the sweat/waterproof feature. It’s very easy to use. The only design thing I would improve is the easy/durability of the charging port. I loved it so much I ordered another pair for my daughter"
1,"Most of the time its true to what they have mentioned in description, but sometime the sound is not very clear. I would say 5% of the time it does not perform as it mentioned in the description."
0,Headphones keep cutting in and out. Only working on one side and that is while sitting down.  Did not try them on a run/walk.
1,I got this product for my SO based on recommendations on this app and she says it really great
1,"I do love the sound, however the ear bud base is large.  The adjustable ear bud cushions are good but the base is to large. I have trouble keeping the ear buds in my ear.  They are working great in the sauna, steamroom, and during my sweaty workouts.  I enjoy them. Would like the ear bud base to be small."
0,"Stopped working.  I've had this with other not so expensive bluetooth headphones.  Not sure if it's a battery issue or just not made well or what.  But this one did not last very long at all.  After charging overnight to make sure it's not a low battery, the earphones are non-responsive.  I just tossed them away."
1,"This is the first impression review for the Senso ActivBuds S-250  *I have not been paid for this review, I did not receive any product including the one I am reviewing, and I am not a professional reviewer (well not at this point in time)&#34;<br /><br />Packaging 9/10<br />There is a real weight to the packaging that gives at the very least the impression of high quality.  When I say weight to the packaging I actually mean the box it comes in.  The empty box itself is equal or superior in weight to the rest of the contents that come inside.  This is all fine since I doubt anyone wants heavy earbuds/carrying case/cables/charger, and the extra strength the box presents might be of some comfort to those who do not trust the shipping choices of some vendors.<br /><br />Contents 9/10<br />If you happen to need a car charger, a lightning/micro b charging cable, make that 2 micro b charging cables, a carrying case that looks like carbon fiber (but is most likely not), and the standard ear tips (i got an extra foam set with mine, more on that later) and other thingies you get with earbuds, then rejoice Senso has your rather diverse and interesting needs covered.  Lets be clear I will not recommend buying these earbuds in order to get any of the things that it ships with since you can get higher quality versions of any of these items pretty cheap.  Are any of them bad items... No.  Are any of them worth paying extra for if there was a basic version for even $10 less.... Unless you actually need all of the things then I would say save the $10.  Why the high rating then?  Well basically I see them as free items and for free items they are of fine quality and a very nice gesture, just not worth going out to buy separately.<br /><br />That leads nicely into the earbuds themselves.<br />This review and score is based on paying $36.97 (or just call it $37) US.  At a different price point the views expressed will likely be different.<br /><br />Audio Quality 10/10<br />These earbuds punch way above their price point.  These earbuds can favorably be compared against Powerbeats² (Beats by Dre $99.99 aprox), AirPods (Apple $159.00 aprox) and many others in that price space.  Then why am I saying that these earbuds need to be at the price point they are at?  Well that is because they also lose to earbuds in that range too.  Almost any Jaybird set will be better in the audio department (and most other comparison points too) but also sit in that $100-150 range price as well.  So the suggested price of $169.99 is out of the question.<br /><br />Build quality 6/10<br />For the price it is fine, but the press-fit plastic housing does not inspire any confidence in the &#34;IPX-7&#34; rating (which should mean water ingress from submersion of 1 meter for up to 30 mins).  Is it probably safe from sweat... yes.  Would I run with them in in light rain.... if I got caught in it maybe.  Would I trust in it in heavy rain or any situation like that or worse .... NO.  While we are on build quality who ever decided that the volume up/next track should be towards the back of the head and the vol down/ previous track should be towards the front has a very differently wired brain from myself (and I suspect many many others).  Also I would prefer for skip track to be a short press and volume changes to be the long press, but that is not the way it is set up here.  I do not have any issues with the multi-function button though and even like how it is incorporated in the design.<br /><br />Comfort 9/10 or 7.5/10<br />The weight is nice and light and the ear hook design and execution is amazing, I really can not complain about this at all.  Well as long as you are like me and got a mysterious (not in any paperwork or mentioned anywhere) pair of foam ear tips.  If you did not get them then the silicone ones are only passable and wear on my ears for anything longer then an average workout and you will want to more carefully place the earphones on to get the best fit.  Other then that I put them in and for a good five minuets I did my best impression of a heavy metal fan head banging and not only did the earbuds not fall out they didn't even budge.  So if you are a happy bouncy person I doubt they will give you issues.<br /><br />Battery Life and Longevity (unknown)<br />Well I can at least say that they match (well beat) their 8 hour claim when new and fully charged.  How this will hold up over time will have to be answered later since this is a first impression after a full weekend of switching to using only these (even in situations where i might have used wired or full headphones) to test them out and get used to them.  I will say that if Senso stands behind their 1 year warranty then I can accept paying $37 for these earphones, even if they break sometime after that time frame is up."
1,"I wrote the message below and within a day was contacted by SENSO via email. The technician wanted to address the problem. We attempted a reboot of the headphones. It didn't work. But SENSO acknowledged my warranty and followed with a replacement SENSO. I am delighted with the response and quick attempt to solve my problem. Better yet - I am getting a replacement. Great service.<br /><br />I purchased these SENSO Bluetooth Headphones in June 2017. I was very pleased with the fit and sound. It connected easily to my IPhone and iPad mini four. Within 6 months the headphones would warn me within a half hour BATTERY LOW. I would re-charge and hear BATTERY LOW with 15 minutes. I didn’t do anything at the time because I ordered MPOW Bluetooth headphones that looked and felt the same as my SENSO. My MPOW has worked well. The two headphones look the same, feel the same, operate the same. BUT - I am sorry to say that the SENSO is not reliable."
1,these work great.  I wear them in the sauna.
1,"I'm impressed with this headset. Bass and sound are great plus it has a one year warranty. Seller will email you with information regarding your warranty and where to contact them, if there's anything wrong with their product. I appreciate when sellers go their way to contact their customers. The product is of good quality. I can definitely see myself buying from them again"
1,I purchased the Senso Bluetooth Headphones for my son.. He is very active and loves his headphones. They are very durable and very well made. I have used these headphones on occasion and I am very pleased with my purchase
1,"Good sound, great feel & easy to use.  The batteries charge is starting to weaken but I also use them daily when exercising.  Take it for what you will but I’d say after using over 300 times we’ll worthht the $. Probably gonna but again when they finally die."
1,"These are amazing! They are a gift for my husband for Christmas, but I wanted to try them out first. They are beyond comfortable for my ears. I have tiny ears and struggle with finding ear buds that don't hurt my ears. These are the perfect fit! The sound is amazing too. I had the TV on (fairly loud too) and I couldn't hear it over the headphones (even at a lower volumn). I'm contemplating getting another pair for myself (or stealing his lol)"
1,Works great.
1,"These are by far the best earphones/headphones/earbuds I’ve owned. I’ve never shelled out on Bose or Beats so I can’t tell you if these are better than those high end brands. But compared to the other earphones in the same price range, these take the cake. I bought these because my old earphones gave up on me because I use them to the gym and sweat on it a lot. I will probably add on to this review after a few weeks at the gym to see if anything changes. So far, at home, it’s been holding up well.<br /><br />I have small ears so the silicone ear hook doesn’t really hook on my ear but I haven’t had an issue with the earphones falling off.<br /><br />Functions are super simple/user friendly. There’s only three buttons. A volume up button, a volume down button, and a multifunction button. I find this great because as a gym goer, I hate accidentally pressing the wrong button and changing a song by accident while I’m in my zone. The volume buttons are at reach. Other Bluetooth earphones have their volume buttons and power on/off button on the wire, and a lot of people let the wire hang behind their neck rather than in front of them, having to put the volume up and down with those types is a hassle because you’d have to feel around for the buttons or take your earphones on and pull the controls in front of you. I’m glad these have the controls right on the ear part. Super convenient.<br /><br />The box includes three different silicone ear-tip sizes, 1 pair of foam ear tips (good for noise cancelling + conforms & fits many sizes), USB Cable, carrying case, wire ties, and additional things like a cellphone card wallet & car mount. I don’t have these pictures because I already used them."
1,Exceeded expectations!.. 100% worth purchasing
0,Worked wonderfully for several months then just quit.  They appear to charge and seem normal but it will not connect to any of my devices.
1,"The headphones are light and comfortable and fit pretty well. My biggest complaint with these types of headphone is usually the volume but these Senso headphones have a good sound output level and choosing the right tips helps too. When the earpieces are properly seated and sealed in the ear canal, they actually have really good sound quality with rich bass, solid midrange and good highs."
1,"Good sound, fits ok not great. Will stay in place when working just feel like the could slip off."
1,Sound quality I give 5 stars.<br />Comfortabilty I give 4 stars.<br />The only reason I gave a total of 4 stars is because when I ride my bicycle I get loud noise from the wind in my ear.
1,"These are great. I bought them for running. I love the freedom that they provide from cord connections to my phone. I can now stow my phone where convenient. As it turns out, I use them quite often when talking on my phone for the same reason."
0,These failed to stay in my ears. No-go.
1,"I run with these and love them. I've had them since 2017 and have trained for two half marathons with them. They're simple, the battery lasts forever, and they wrap around your ear securely. I love them so much that even though I  lost a pair and my dog chewed up a second pair, so I'm on my third pair. I would never use other headphones."
1,"I have been using these for the past two weeks and so far I feel they're great. Sometimes I lose one of them because my piercings keep pushing them out of my ear, but I don't feel like it's the headphones' fault."
1,Just what I was looking for!  Good directions/easy to understand.  3 sizes of buds so they don't fall out of my ears.  Super satisfied!
1,Great headphones for price. Awesome sound. Stay in place. Would buy again if needed.
1,Wonderful value!  The sound is fantastic!!
1,"great sound, long battery life, connects to phone easily and several size ear buds included that stay on"
1,LOVE these headphones!!
0,I had high hopes for these headphones.  I wanted to use them while road biking and found there to be<br />considerable wind noise.  Overall the fit was comfortable but they did not seem like they were noise<br />canceling.
1,I use these5 days a week in pool. Works great<br /> Holds a charge.
1,Works great and love the Bluetooth wireless function!! The black cord can be mildly irritating (wrap it behind your head or drop to your neck) but they work great and all functions are useful!
1,Sound quality is good. Distance reception is over 40 ft. Microphone works great. Overall a really good product.
1,"This is a great product and I will recommend it to my friends.<br /><br />The sound is great, the soft ear loops and earbuds are very comfortable after hours of listening to music (walked and ran with my dogs) and the price is reasonable. Answering the phone is also great, the conversation was clear on both sides.<br /><br />I initially had challenge pairing it to my cell phone and tablet but after following the instruction on restoring to factory setting, I did re-scan and all is good."
1,Excellent quality and price. Very easy to use and sinc with my iPhone 7 plus. All the cables and packaging is of very good quality. I couldn't be happier.
0,"I will be returning these, even though the bluetooth worked great and the quality of sound was amazing.  But, they keep falling off my ears.  I can't seem to get them to stay inside my ear, even though I changed the little ear tabs.  The connectors that go around the ear are so flimsy, that the buds just fall off.  Very irritating."
0,I used it for few days. Battery life is good. Sound quality is not that good. I feel right earbud has better sound than left.  Very delicate...ear piece broke after using few times
1,These are really great headphones for a really low price.
1,"I purchased 5 pairs for Christmas gifts for teenagers and young adults.  All of them love these headphones.  They have all used other wireless headphones prior to these.  All of them have said they are comfy, fit well, sound good and nicer than the ones they had used previously.<br />The first 5 I bought were so well liked I bought 3 more for birthday gifts in January!"
1,Sound better than lg hsb1100 I bought for $128 I love it
1,"This is a good product, not too much bass but if you are just using it for the gym should be sufficient sound.  For the price I believe is a good product, will recommend this product."
0,"Great sound when NOT beeping. Fully charged, paired easy to my phone, but the beep drives me crazy."
1,"Quick kind customer service, good warranty. AAA+++ Sound REALLY good."
1,I used these for just a few minutes today. I was very anxious to get these because I wanted to listen to my music while I swam in the pool. They have great sound and they are comfortable. But they don't work when swimming. They constantly loose signal. Even if the phone is on your person. I was so disappointed. I thought this is gonna be cool to listen to my music while I'm getting exercise and enjoying my time in the pool.<br />:-|  it's a no go. Other than that. There good.
0,"Listen, I don’t write reviews, but I feel compelled to give you guys a warning before purchasing these.  I give the product 2 stars because the case, the chargers, and the cables are all top notch!  But, the reason we buy these things, the sound-is awful.  I mean AWFUL.  Flat and tinny, I don’t even want to listen to podcasts with these.  Super disappointed, I so wanted to love them.  If you like to run with hip hop or bass heavy songs, these are not the headphones for you."
1,Really fast delivery! Really good fit. Very good sound. Great for activities(mowing the lawn......)!
1,"I have used them for 1.5 years almost every day (during work, working out, etc) and they are amazing. Long lasting battery and good sound."
1,"So far, so good - excellent step-by-step instructions have provided a smooth process. I am new to Bluetooth headphones and I am very satisfies with the product afetr 1 week of purcahes/use."
1,"Pros:<br />1. Sound quality for bluetooth headphones is fantastic especially at the given price.<br />2. Easy connection and no troubles when re-connecting<br />3. Battery life is outstanding, the batteries will last longer than you should have earbuds in for any single session.<br />4. Secure fit and multiple silicone pieces as well as a set of foam pieces to fit different ear canals.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Volume up and down buttons are small<br />2. The strain relief for the wire going into each earbud is not sufficient<br /><br />Summary:<br />Loved the headphones and got some really good use out of them but recently the right side is cutting in and out but not entirely, if the wire is moved slightly the sound volume and tone change is noted, there is clearly a loose or intermittent connection going on there and for that reason the headphones are unusable.  If the strain relief was better or the internal connections were better I think this problem could be mitigated.  They were always carefully put back in the case and never abuse or had the cord pull or jolt significantly to either earbud.  I am a little disappointed that they are inoperative, but would consider purchasing again, perhaps a solder joint was just a little loose on my set."
1,"I've bought 3 pairs of these headphone already and I'm about to buy the fourth for another friend. All-around great headphones with a super battery life. The friends that I gifted this to love it and say its better than the more expensive, branded bluetooth headphones they've bought in the past."
1,Lots of clear bass. Especially if your phone has an EQ which will make this headset sound even better. I worked out in them  every day and have had no problems. Not the best for phone calls but it will work. The microphone picks up all the background noise.
1,The bass is fantastic. Sounds exceptionally full. Only issue it can cut out at times when moving quickly.
1,Great product so far. Love the sound for the price. Don’t think you can beat it. They stay in well no problems what so ever! Prob purchase a few more for family. Taking a call is great while playing music and keeping your hands free. Got my vote 5 stars!
1,I love these ear buds this is my second pair. I only brought the second pair so I could switch them out. I sound is clear music is outstanding and audio books are crisp.
1,"Love these, the sound is amazing & they stay in place!"
1,"I could not get this things to stay in my ears no matter how hard I tried to jam them in and twist them. I kid you not I spent probably 5 minutes trying to get them to stay in, and when I'd finally get them to sort of stay in, they'd pop out if I moved my head slightly. They come with different size removable ear buds, but even with the smallest ones attached, these things still wouldn't stay in my ears. I guess I have super small ears??? (I have no problem with iPhone ear buds staying in though). Also, in the process of trying to get them to stay in, I kept accidentally pushing the buttons, one of which causes the iPhone to call the last number that was dialed. Super annoying. The hooks that go over the ears didn't fit me either. Way too big.<br /><br />EDIT: Bumping these up from 1 star to 4. If you're having trouble getting these to stay in, see fit adjustment suggestion from the manufacturer in the comments section below! I tried what they suggested and now I can get these in my ears and it didn't take 5 minutes of struggling to get them in, either."
1,Lose my Bluetooth every now and then or it would be 5 stars.
1,I just received these a few days ago.  I ordered them because when I am doing my workouts my others would fall out.  I did lots of jump roping and running and these stayed in place beautifully.  They also have great sound.
1,"Was a christmas gift for the spouse. Paired easy with iPhone, sound is great. Perfect for exercise."
1,"My husband love it. He said he love the long battery life but the best feature is the ease of the Bluetooth connectivity to his iPhone 8, he said it connects instantly!"
0,These head phones are awful!  As soon as you start moving the music cuts in and out.<br /><br />These headphones are so bad they shouldnt be able to be sold on Amazon.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY!
0,The headphones worked great and were definitely a great buy for the first three weeks.  Week four however not so much.  They no longer will power up.  I am quite disappointed with this development.
1,Easy to use and set up. Sound good and comfortable. Battery lasts A long time
1,Like it very much. Use every time I go walking. It just a tad bigger than my ear to hold. Gotta push in few times as I walk.
1,The sound quality needs to improve a little more. The rest is very good.
1,"Great sound quality, perfect fit..best pair of workout headphones purchased thus far!"
1,These work great! Great volume! Distance away from I phone is good. Only thing I don't like is when you use one ear piece the other one pulls on the one you have in your ear. Other then that theses are great!
1,So At first I was thinking for the price there's no way these are all that...I WAS WRONG audiophiles these things are LOUD I love it not as much bass as the beats or anything but freakin good like very good! stays on during runs and everything I'm very happy with this product
1,For the price excellent sound I have no complaints holds charge sounds good easy to link
1,EDITED!!!!!?Don’t get the three stars wrong. The buds are comfortable and a great sound with music and listening to others on a call. People find it hard to hear me tho. They say it’s like I’m in a cave with static. Hopefully it’s just a problem with mine. I do love them. They attach to Bluetooth in less than a sec.<br />Update. These are the best I’ve ever had. The glitch with the sound went away. I’m guessing it was my fault. I’m changing to 5 stars.<br />The battery life is loooong. Lasts more than a work day.
1,Love them so much we have purchased additional pairs for other family members. Work great. Great sound. Long battery life.
1,Amazing product
1,"I bought these out of desperation looking for a functional wireless Bluetooth in ear headset to work out with. I have had the skull candy  and JVC wireless version and they both have major flaws. JVC will power off, pause or skip to the next song while working out if you have the slightest moisture touching it. I bought 2 skull candy because the first one only powered on one time and didn’t work afterwards. Won’t even charge really big disappointment. So I bought these and I’m impressed! Reason I always fall back to the skullcandy brand is the bass and these are louder and have more bass then skullcandy! Oh and I didn’t even want to comment of beats as I feel they are the most mediocre of all brands. I dare anyone to go into Best Buy and just compare all brands before purchasing any headset. Skull candy always blows the competition away except the wireless version has a lot of issues:("
1,Washer and dryer tested!!  Pulled them out of the dryer after accidentally washing and drying them. Synced right up without any distortion. Long lasting battery on these things too!
1,"So far I like them a lot, and it seems to be a very good product at a very reasonable price.  They are my first set of wireless headphones, and I'm not yet thrilled with the idea of having to re-charge them, but it sure is nice not to have to deal with long wires.  For me, I'd say that the fit is descent.  They do tend to rotate forward in my ear a bit an loosen up, but that may just be my ears.  I wish that the cord was a bit shorter.  It does come with a little wire tie to shorten it up, but it keeps falling out.  The package comes with a quite a lot of other extras, including a case, two additional different size in-ear pieces ear pieces, a short charger, and then a car charger and longer charger.  I honestly haven't been able to figure out how you would use the longer charger with the headphones.  All in all, though, they seem like a very good buy."
1,"working well, connected beautifully both to my Samsung S5 & my Asus laptop. Thanks"
1,Awesome headphones. These come with a nice carry case for travel. I use them for running and they are great. They are lite and you almost forget you have them on. Great sound quality and volume.
1,I bought these as a gift for someone and wasn't sure how they would be.  She absolutely loves them and said they exceeded her expectations.  I will probably be purchasing another pair for myself really soon.
1,Great headphones. Long lasting battery and charge.
1,"super bueno para hacer ejercicios y la bateria dura bastante, aparte nomas que el volumen es demasiado alto aunque lo tienes en 1."
1,Great sound and ergonomic design. It also comes with various ear buds. I love it!
0,Sound breaks up when you exceed three feet of the paired device.  I've got a $19US pair of wireless that make these look like something that you find at the bottom of a toy box.  You would be best to find some other way to spend your fitness money.
1,High quality for the price.  Comes with assortment of ear pieces ensuring a good fit.  Easy to setup and use.  Sound quality is good but I primarily listen to audio books.
0,"I’ve had other senso headsets, these hurt my ears and had zero fidelity.  Don’t buy"
1,Been using these for workouts and yard maintenance.
1,Love this Bluetooth headphone! Very comfortable. Feels very secure and stays in place. Sound is great. Easy pairing with my laptop and Droid Maxx 2. Folks I talked to on phone say my voice is clear.  Very glad I bought it. Would buy again for self and consider it as a gift for friends
1,The music sounds perfect thru these headphones. The bass is rich and the higher tones meld well and do not sound tinny. They fit securely in the ear and the soft earbuds make for a comfortable fit. I would highly recommend these headphones .
1,"These Red tip Senso earbuds are the best to choose. I lost my first pair and ordered the Blue Tip style and was terribly disappointed as the ear band was very flimsy and kept on going out of your setting. It is an adjustable one, and doesn't stay put. Buy Red"
1,I charged and set my bluetooth headphones up as soon as I got them. My workouts have been awesome since! Thank you Invotek for such a great product!
1,"I've had my Senso Bluetooth Headphones for several months and I'm very pleased! I like to listen to music when I'm outside doing tedious chores in the yard but I didn't want to invest a fortune in a set of headphones. These are perfect! The sound quality is very good, the range is more than adequate and the price is excellent!"
0,Buyer beware!!
0,Headphones stopped charging after a few months (purchased in April and currently October). Unfortunately now need to buy a new pair as I'm training for a marathon.
1,"Works great with the blue tooth transmitter I bought for my digital cable box paired with Bluetooth 4.1 Transmitter and Receiver, Rockrok 3.5mm Wireless Audio Adapter/Kit for Headphone Speakers TV PC MP3/MP4 Car Stereos System-APTX Low Latency"
1,"Arrived quickly, and the headphones sound amazing! Worked for 8hrs right out of the box! 10/10 would recommend!"
1,Nice sound<br />Little iffy on fit for running or jumping exercises but I am trying different size buds
1,"Great product for the $, service was excellent, and sound is amazing for their size & price. Battery life is long, and all packaged in a hard shell case. Would buy again."
1,"I love these headphones and the price is unbelievable. The sound quality is amazing and they do a great job at blocking sound.  I mainly use them while on the train and without turning the volume too high,  I'm never disturbed by my surroundings.  They charge quickly.  My trip is abiut 50 minutes eachway and they only need to be charged once a week."
1,"arrived earlier than anticipated and sound quality is good.  Some issues with connecting device to phone - seems to crackle a bit and hesitate, but then starts up fine and work well."
1,Good quality headphones. 100% satisfied. Great sound. Great battery life.
0,Worked for about two weeks then broke. Put them on charger and their charged but they won’t turn on or connect with phone or anything.
1,I bought these for a friend. Have not tried myself. My friend Loves the product. Says the sound is excellent and easy to use. She also says the fit is quite good. I’m thinking of buying a set of these for myself because she says these are so good.
1,"So far, I love them. They are comfortable and loud enough to play my drums. I was tired of a cord head set, so these are working great so far.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Will Dillard"
1,"I have been pleasantly surprised by these headphones. The sound is great. The volume range is way better than my previous bluetooth headphones. I need to try wearing them while I mow the lawn. The fit is snug and they do not move while running, which is also a pleasant surprise. So far so good - let's see if they last!"
1,"Very, very good for the price. I had accidentally ran my Beats Powerbeats 2 through the washing machine, and didn't want to shell out the money again for an expensive pair of Bluetooth headphones. Based on the high rating and low price on the Senso headphones, I'd figured I give them a shot. I am not disappointed and in many ways, they beat out the Powerbeats 2 headphones I used to have.<br /><br />The pros:<br />1) Terrific value<br />2) Sound/Music is plenty loud to over come gym and treadmill noise. Seem to be louder than the PowerBeats2<br />3) I experienced issues with the Powerbeats not connecting the first time when I would power them on. My phone would say 'connected', but, play some music, and it would play out the phones speakers. I would have to disconnect and reconnect the Powerbeats2 to have my phone actually connect and play music from the head phones. The Senso BT Headphones don't have that issue, which is 1 less annoyance in my life.<br />4) My Powerbeats would stutter and cut out if I turned my head a certain way, or if I went on a long run. I was chalking it up to possibly sweat or clothing interfering with the Bluetooth signal from my phone as its usually in my pocket. The Senso BT headphones seem to be doing considerably better than the Powerbeats.<br /><br />The only real 'cons' I can list are:<br />1) The over-the-ear rubber piece is a bit flimsy and awkward to put on. Once you have them looped over your ear, the buds don't move, so it doesn't take away from the purpose.<br />2) The body of the buds themselves are a little bit larger when compared to the Powerbeats2. By no means does it impact the performance of the ear buds, just something I noticed.<br /><br />Do not be afraid to purchase these headphones. I only have had them for a week, so I can't speak to their longevity. However, as of right now, they are a great set of headphones."
1,They sound great.
1,Love these headphones. Delivered quickly. Work as advertised. Good sound for the price and comfortable in the ear. I would highly recommend
1,"I hate writing reviews, but these headphones are amazing.  Sound stellar<br />Great battery too"
1,Distinct and crisp sound.  Very comfortable to wear and simple to operate.  A great buy.
1,Low price for an excellent device. The Bluetooth unit in this is more reliable then my red beats. I had 3 pairs of beats and got tired of paying for a logo. Works well and sounds fine!
1,"If this is your price range, look no further. Fantastic product."
0,Mediocre at best.
1,"I got these wireless headphones primarily for use at the gym, where I use them paired either with my iphone or, when I'm on the gym's cardio equipment, with a bluetooth transmitter (TaoTronics Transmitter TT-BA01U)  plugged in to the equipment's 3.5mm jack for tv viewing.  So far they work flawlessly...easy pairing, easy switching from one paired device to another, and very good sound, with easy to use control of volume, pause and skip functions.  I haven't used it for phone calls yet, so I can't comment on that aspect.  Earbuds are a reasonable fit and the headset feels secure, even when running.  In sum, they are everything I was hoping for and at a very reasonable price-point."
0,Always fall out of my ears. Useless!
0,"I liked these at first, but now (8 months after I purchased them), they have started malfunctioning. The sound cuts out for several seconds at a time, and they sometimes won't pair with my phone. I'm very disappointed that they have started having issues so soon after I bought them."
1,"This product is exactly what I was hoping for,  I am very happy to have made this purchase. The clarity that comes from this tiny ear buds is awesome, I forget that I am wearing them because of the comfortable fit."
0,These lasted about 8 months then said “powering off” and wouldn’t charge again. They’re done. 20 bucks is cheap so you get what you pay for.
1,I took some time to provide feedback so that I could use the headset for a while. My need is simpler that most. I use the headset for the music while on air flights and to talk to my wife while she is driving home at night.  I have not used them during exercise.  The sound quality is quite good.  I can hear nice lows and good highs.  Since I am not as active as many users I don't have any issues with the unit breaking.  It fits my ears well and sound good.  When I am on the phone people on the other end say I am very clear.  The wireless connection to my iPhone 7 plus phone was simple.
1,"I was skeptical that these headphones would deliver, but goodness! The comfort and sound quality is exceptional for the price.  Best purchase that I've made in a while. Step aside DreBeats!"
1,"Good earphones, quality sound, not too great on the bass side, and the plastic pieces before the buds seem to cause a bit of discomfort, but that's my personal opinion<br />All in all a great sports earphone for the price."
0,"I really liked these, but it’s been a year now & it keeps dropping the connection. Disappointed."
1,"If you are looking for a cheap pair of Bluetooth earbuds to get the job done then these will work. They are not high quality in sound by any means so if you are an audiophile move along but I would imagine you wouldn't be looking here anyways. For me, there is way too much bass and not enough clarity. They do however get very loud and block out exterior noise. For the price, they are worth it but I already have a pair of Jaybirds that I will stick with for now."
1,"I purchased these to replace a near identical set that had a different name, but they are all China made so no big surprise. Tried them for the first time yesterday and they worked the same as well. They shipped fast in a fancy box with a few extra free items I don't know if I will use. The last ones lasted almost 2 years, hopefully these will do at least that well. They sound good and are comfortable to wear. I will report back if any issues develop."
1,Great sound. Easy to adjust.  Paired immediately with my phone. These headphones are comfortable and stay put in your ears when you run.  They're the best wireless headphones for running I've had yet.
1,Great headphones! Quality sound and easy to operate...
1,Sound quality isn’t great
1,These have been working great and they really hold to my ears well during very physically active workouts or runs.
1,Great product and customer service!
1,I got these for Christmas and I've spent countless hours doing yard work and working out with them on. I have my phone in a waist pack and these are constantly dropping the sound. I've tried with content that is directly off the phone and it still cuts out. I don't have this problem with the Letscom headphones I purchased a few months ago.
1,Love the sound and the comfort I have small ears and it works well for me.
1,"Good, and fast shipping"
1,"Can't complain at all about these amazing headphones. I run a lot and these stay put, no matter what. I am very impressed with their sound quality, the overall quality of the product itself and the ease of use! Straight out of the box they connected immediately to my phone and I was off. Not once have they fallen out of my ears or failed to work. All the buttons for FF, volume, RW and ON/OFF are all located on one side and all you have to do is press and hold to FF/RW or press once to turn the Volume Up or Down.....SIMPLE! The overall sound is perfect and these things get Loud!! I only ever use them on less than half volume. They are extremely &#34;sound proof&#34; as you hear virtually nothing other than the music playing, however, I would recommend if you are in a busy public area that you are aware of your surroundings i.e. Traffic and it's dangers or on a secluded trail i.e. Stranger Danger as you will not hear anything.....personally I take one ear bud out to allow for other surrounding sounds to be more audible when in either of the aforementioned situations. Another plus: you can have a perfectly clear phone conversation on these.....it will pause your music and continue playing once you hang up the call. I would highly recommend these to anyone wanting a decent sound with out paying a fortune to enjoy. Worth every penny, win win!!!"
1,"Comes with a nice carry case, and fits comfortably in ear. Great for exercise!"
1,"I've got original Beats solos.  These beat the Beats with a bass beat that kills.  No, Im not paid to five this review. Got them with apeed.  Packaging is premium.  The earbuds themselves have a weight sturdiness to them that says quality.  My little nephew has powerbeats. These beat those beats in power. Crisp connection, steady feel on the ears.  We'll see how they handle sweat over the long run as I typically do to 5k's a week.  Let's see what happens.  Ilove the charge cable, and they provide a car charger with dual usb ports. They have their own zip case.  I'm ordering my wofe and my daughter their own pair.  These babies rock.  I find no fault yet."
1,I have been using these headphones for 2 weeks and I love the product. The Bluetooth connection is quick and smooth with great sound quality. Much better than my experience with my previous headphones. One minor gripe is that henever I get the &#34;battery low&#34; message it is already too late. It gives you about 10 minutes before switching off which isn't enough time if you are in the middle of your exercise. I wish the &#34;battery low&#34; message is given 1 hour in advance (which was the case with my previous headphones). with 1 hour notice I will be able to finish my exercise and then immediately charge the headphones for my next use.
0,Real bummer. Wanted these for running but they don't pair with iPhone 7. Now I need to drive to repackage and then drive to a return location to ship back and find another device that does work as advertised. Very disappointed.
1,I wanted loud and I got it.  Way better than my expensive beats.  Thank you for the loudness!!
1,"Amazing sound quality, easy to set up, I definitely recommend these."
1,"I love these headphones! The sound is excellent and they're super easy to use. The Bluetooth works great. I didn't test the limits but I was across the room from my iPod and they worked perfectly. It has a volume control which is easy to access.  I'm very satisfied! (Shipping was super fast, too!)"
1,These earphones are an outstanding value! Great sound for the money!
1,These are working great!  Quick to charge and synced easily! Sound is great!
1,I have just received my headphones and must say I'm very happy with them they are all that I believed they would be.
1,I love the sound quality of these earbuds but I can barely get them to last past 3 hours of continuous use. The description says that these can stand 8 hours of use but that is incorrect. I would love to see that this issue is addressed
1,"I wasn't expecting much, but I'm actually very happy with these. They fit snugly as I work out, even while walking and running. The sound is clear and solid. Bass is very nice. These fit better and sound better than a $100 pair of Samsung ear buds I bought at the same time. I ended up giving those to my son. I wear these 4 or five times a week at the gym. So far, no problems."
1,Excellent quality/price.
0,There are horrible.
1,"OH MY GOSH, I've had so many pairs of wireless headphones.  While this pair doesn't pick up in long distances, can't even go to the other end of my house, I've not found a pair yet that I could, I think these are the best earbuds I've owned.  Like I said...I've tried many brands, from top of the line to bottom of the line and these are the best I've found.  ENJOY THE MUSIC!"
0,"It's a junk. Bass is not as good as they claim it to be. The cord is too long and hang on the back. not good for working out or jogging.<br />After 3 month of use, stopped working and now it's not even charging"
0,Comfortable easy to wear; great for listening to music or ebooks...absolute DUDS if you’re looking to talk on the cell phone.
1,Really great headphones for the gym! Good sound quality and they don't budge while I hop all around lol.
1,"I recently purchased the headphone after trying two other products Mpow and  Anker in the same price range. I'll keep senso definitely at a higher side from sound quality wise but you pay an additional $10.<br />I definitely agree that the bass quality of this headphone is superb no other brand in the same range can match it. I had two objective before I buy this headphone. One was sound quality which I'm very much satisfied and another one is fitting, and I'm ok whatever I got. But I felt a major concern that sometime the sound is cutting, sometime after connecting with the phone I'm not immediately not able to hear any sound, not sure what's the problem though this is not consistent. But I fear after few months it recurs I wont be in a situation to replace or whether Senso will fix the problem or not. Another thing I noticed that the pictures in AMAZON website is WRONG, it's showing car mount and a mobile bag as a bonus item but it actually comes with car charger and phone cable, this is misleading.<br />Anyway overall it's good with this price range so even if with this problem I wanted to try my luck and keep the headset as there is no better option."
1,"Edit after 5 years of use: it finally gave up and actually broke into two in my backpack, very happy with it until it’s last day. Totally worth the investment.<br /><br />I've always had issues with bluetooth headphones while working out, either they weren't comfortable, or they wouldn't stay in my ears. These are very comfortable, and stays in place during any workout. Sound quality is amazing considering the price, usually you have to boost bass to get balanced audio, but with these I had to reduce bass for the first time ever and audio quality is just great. Battery life also seems in line with what is claimed. Extra accessories that came with the headphones, lightning cable and car charger also work great and is also a huge plus!"
1,"So far so good. Not my favorite type of headphones but for the price and the recommendation I decided to give them a go. I'm really liking them so far, no problems pairing and they actually can noise pretty well. I especially like the follow up email I got from the seller. I definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a cheaper pair of Bluetooth headphones"
1,Works great!
1,Happy :)
1,"I've been using the Senso ear buds headphones, since July of last year.  But about August of 2018, the left ear stopped working.<br /><br />I often use this talking to the phone, than listening to music.<br /><br />Battery last more than I expected."
0,These are terrible.  Bass is ridiculously heavy.  I have an iphone and adjusted the EQ to every &#34;lighter bass&#34; option and they still suck.  Guess you get what you pay for.  At least they stay in my ears.
0,Always has BT connection issues which makes them not useable.  They do have a little bit of wind noise and are slightly bulkier than expected.  This happens with both of my phones.  I like the peripherals that come with them.  I will change my rating if i can get the warranty honored.
1,"Perfect !  Great sound, great fit!  I'd buy them again"
1,"Work great, good fit, they actually stay in my ears, they were easy to configure with my phone and blue tooth radio<br />Good value for the price"
1,"I've only had for a few days, but they are nice quality, fit well, and sound good so far.  Easy to use.  I would recommend to others."
1,These headphone are just ok.  Sound is average with way too much base.  Ear clips are too flimsy.
1,Amazing Headphones. Highly recommended! I have now purchased 2 pair. Outstanding customer service!
0,"They are pretty awesome for the price. They are easy to pair, good Bluetooth connection, small, comfortable, lightweight. I pair it with my iPhone and it's working perfectly, however, I pair it with my laptop and every time I'm listening to an audio (from a video or from iTunes) there is a buzzing behind the music. If I pause the song or video it will become louder. I will only stop when I close the app or change the video web page. I don't know if this has to do with my laptop settings or the headphones but it's driving me crazy. That's the only reason I gave it 3/5 stars.<br /><br />--------UPDATE ------<br /><br />I'm starting to hate this buzzing noise behind the music, I need to have the music very loud for not noticing the buzz. Next step is to return them. I have another Premium quality headphones and I don't get this buzzing, maybe this one is way too cheap for my taste."
0,"Depends on your expectations, I own some LG tones and some Jay birds but I was looking for an over the ear set to use strictly for running. I am by no means an audio snob, I find the headphones that come with the Galaxy line on phones to be a decent product.  For the price and given the reviews I thought, I can't go wrong.<br /><br />The came in today and quickly hooked them up to my phone, put them on an hit play. Wow these are awful. Sound is extremely distorted and there is no clarity. I immediately though ok, it must have some setting for a built in equalizer, wrong.<br /><br />If you have zero expectations and looking for a basic set of headphones then you are probably ok. However if you enjoy your music and have some sense of quality, or expect your headphones to perform better than the free pair that come with your phone,  look the other way.<br /><br />They do give you some awesome accessories, however if the headphones are only $40, I wonder how much have true cost of them are once they factor in all the goodies they give you.<br /><br />Some will argue the costs are totally different and they are, but for $$60 more you can get a premium sounding set that you will be far more happy with. Or just buy some Samsung ear buds and keep them wired and save yourself a lot of money.<br /><br />These were delivered today and were immediately boxed up for return."
1,Great product! I bought a pair for my son after I bought some for myself. Love them!
1,"They work far better than I expected. Sound is good even in a noisy gym or with the wind blowing while you run. Battery lasts at least 5-7 hours before needing charged. Only problem I have found is the ear buds that came on it are a little smaller than I like and can from time to time feel like they might fall out. I would buy again and would recommend to friends and family, especially for the price."
0,"Had purchased to pairs of these previously they worked well. But the last pair I bought within two days it started malfunctioning disconnecting from bluetooth, spotty service, specially when on the phone and losing a call bc it transferred back to the phone."
1,Good Product. No complaints
1,"Sounded great with rich bass and decent noise cancellation, a good, working product, but is terribly brittle and made of very low quality plastic."
0,"The first time I ordered these headphones. They worked fine, just got another pair. And it's worse, doesn't do anything that it did before. Like noise cancellation, etc. Now it's cutting on and off of the sound. Save your money."
1,Well worth the money.  Good sound quality and the headphones don't slip out of my ear when I'm running.
1,"Sound is great! Also, the company is very responsive  when contacted.  Happy"
1,"I like these headphones, great for workout, the price cannot be beat."
1,"My biggest problem with these headphones is that if you're walking or running outdoors into even a little bit of wind, then the noise of the wind in the headphones is louder than the music - almost like the wind is getting amplified by the built-in microphone.  Is there any way to mute this during regular playback when not on a phone call?"
1,"Pretty good. No problems so far, after a month of use. Could be a little more comfortable I guess, but they're buds, not phones or muffs. Battery charge lasts pretty long."
1,"Buen producto, aún estando sin uso se le acaba la batería en menos de un mes."
1,"The quality is very good. However, I do not  recommend this for women, it does not fit comfortably in your ear, too big. I couldn't keep them on for more than 10 seconds,  they came off because of the weight"
0,Awful - supposed to be sweatproof but they're definitely not. Shorted and died on the same day that the 30 day return window expired.
0,"I usually use these headphones at the gym and while running, like majority of my headphones, and these headphones work horribly in both of those environments. I've had mine now for over a year and it is just not consistent in performance. Majority of the time whenever I bend, squat, or just sit while my phone is in my pocket the music drops out. And I can't walk more than 5ft away from my phone without the bluetooth losing reception. I would not buy this product again, and I would recommend you not to. The only good thing I can say about this product is that it came with extra ear buds."
0,These fell apart after three days.  I did not like them before that as they kept getting in my way.  Annoying to wear.
1,Ear hooks are very flimsy.  I have small ears and would have prefered a wire to make it adjustable.
1,"I bought these as my first foray into wireless headphones. These are very light weight and despite the piece that wraps around your ear seeming flimsy, it stays in while running. But these are not for running at all. I wanted to test these outside to see how they performed. Inside they were just fine. Outside they were useless. I ignored another review about wind noise, but they were not kidding. Running in a gentle 5 mile an hour breeze sounds like you're in a wind tunnel, so I took them out immediately and went back to my wired pair. Additionally, the placement of the buttons on the earpiece itself makes changing settings mid-run a bit more awkward than the buttons being on the cord. They do tend to stick out pretty far but if you're at your desk at work, these are perfectly fine for music. Songs get choppy when the battery is low but recharging is easy and the buttons work great overall. The TLDR, good indoors, bad outdoors."
1,Just wore them for the first time to the gym great noise cancellation and the sound is awesome. Stop annoying me with email now you went from a good thing to pain in the a-- Know when to stop!!!!
1,Great sound and WONDERFUL price.  Customer service was wonderful quick to answer
1,these headphones are great for what I needed.  They stay in place and paired very easily with my phone.  Very comfortable to wear and they don't bother my ears...can't even tell I am wearing them.
1,"Finally found some wireless earbuds that fit a small ear canal, stay in and are comfortable!<br />Company stands behind their product which is reassuring ."
1,"Am very happy with this product. This is my first set of bluetooth earbuds and I'm very impressed with the quality of the materials and the quality of sound. Was very easy to set up and use. Comfortable earhooks. Am looking forward to being cut free from cords!<br /><br />Seller interaction was awesome as well.  I received updates from the seller as to the status of my order, as well as followup to ensure I was happy with the product.  I would definitely order this product again."
1,Great headphone!! I bought beats for my son a year ago and your buds are as good if not better then there's
1,"I am a bit of a headphone snob, find the tinny cheap headphones to be irritating and unusable. Thus these Senso's exceeded my wildest expectations in terms of the sound quality.Been testing them  out on various Spotify playlists like &#34;songs to test your headphones&#34; and these are right up there with my audiotechnia cans. And much lighter, portable, and feel very comfortable for long periods on my ears.  I don't  get much noise<br /> cancelling, at least not for ambient street noise,do have to stop them or remove to have a conversation. Great for walking jogging exercise etc. ."
1,great sound quality and stays in ear during my runs
1,Great product and great customer service! I use these headphones almost daily while at the gym and they work great. Even while running they have never fallen off and the earbud design keeps sweat out of my ear. I've been roughly 50 feet away from my phone and still had a crystal clear signal.<br />When my first pair of headphones stopped working I contacted Senso and asked if any additional troubleshooting could be performed. The battery would charge although the headphones wouldn't turn on. Customer service got back to me within a couple of hours and instead of providing tips on how to fix they sent me a new pair of headphones!<br />Overall a great product with top notch customer service. Will certainly buy another product of theirs!
1,I love these headphones. Second one I've bought. This one was for my wife. My wife uses this on an exercise machine while watching a TV which is connected to a bluetooth transmitter. I don't have to listen to her listening to TV.
1,Decent headphones. This one has better connections than the other ones I've tried. Sound is lacking though.
0,Worked good for a week and then they stopped pairing with my iPhone. Complete garbage. Just bite the bullet and go with a more expensive pair. Will be returning these.
0,"Lost my Powerbeats 3 and was looking for a temporary replacement. For $100 less seemed like a good dead. MIGHT be worth $15 at most. Extremely flimsly ear hooks. Terribly mixed, the bass is in crazy high. Short battery life. Super long string between the two pieces. Just spend the extra money to get something better."
1,Great use everyday. Simple to operate. Operates as stated.
1,So far so good. My this will be the third pair of wireless headphones purchased for my 16 year old son who listens to music all of the time. The previous 2 pairs purchased by different companies didn't last long. So fingers crossed these will be better. He loves them so far!
1,The sound quality is great!! The headphones didn't fall out while I was I was benching.
1,"Very nice headphones at a decent price. Great sound for this price and they appear to be rugged.  The controls are easy to use and for a blue tooth, very responsive."
1,"We have had several sets of these, and just worn them out. We always replace them with the same ones!"
1,"Sound quality, battery life, and Bluetooth range are all decent. The only problem I have is the bad phone call quality; voices over the earphones sound extremely muffled."
1,Ok I wrote an awful 1 star review....<br /><br />Then I figured out how to connect them. Sound is good and they are pretty comfortable. Good product for the amount I paid. However the battery life isn’t great. Just ok.
1,Fits great and stays in while running.
1,I love them. They have a nice long life. Well long enough for me.
0,"give tons of accessories with but the main thing is the headphones, bluetooth dead after 1 week! Too lazy to return but learn a lesson I guess"
1,Got on sale for $25. Worth it for that price. Full price definitely not. Sound quality is muddy and the bluetooth pairing on/off button doesn't want to work most of the time.
0,Too big for my ears.
1,So far so good. Its got good sound to me... but my ears aren't what they used to be anyways. They arrived a day early. Have not used them on of my activities yet just mowing the lawn and yard work. Will update
1,"I have had my Senso headphones for over well over a week or two and love them.  Very light and stay in place while exercising or whatever you are doing.  They have great noise canceling ability as well.  I use them when commuting back and forth between islands on a small, loud turboprop plane.  The Customer Service as is second to none."
1,Very Nice Indeed
1,"I bought these 2 years ago and still use them to this day, Quality sound for earbuds this cheap and quality bass but most importantly the noise canceling is fantastic and even superior compared to others twice as expensive."
1,"Pros: Fits well and stays put through workouts and sound is great for the price range.<br /><br />Cons: Constant disconnects, like record/ cd skipping about once a minute. Did test with different phones (Apple and Droid) and issue was consistent regardless if phone was 1 foot away or 10 feet.  More testing found just tilting my head in certain positions would cause this to the point of full disconnect. Not sure if the Bluetooth receiver is in the ear buds or the connecting strap but definitely an issue that at times will have you wanting to just drop them in the trash."
1,"These things are awesome. I know there are a lot of cheap bluetooth headphones out here but these are great quality. The sound quality is about what you expect for the price, it's good, not great. I would definitely buy another pair for using them at the gym."
1,Great product for the price
1,Great earphones very happy. Just like beats but much cheaper
0,"I returned them.  If you are looking for a budget pair of wireless earbuds, these will suffice.  If you are particular about the quality (sound and fit) you may be disappointed.  My dislike was largely from the wind noise that was constant as I wore them running.  Also, the sound quality was ok.. but not spectacular.  Lastly, I did not really care for the fit. They seemed to hurt my ears some.  I returned them and spent the extra money for PowerBeats and am much happier.  These are NOT a bad product... especially if you are looking for a basic pair of wireless earbuds and don't care too much about the the things I mentioned.  Admittedly, I am very particular, so your mileage may vary."
1,Great product. They paired with my phone no problem.
1,Great headphones! I accidentally lost mine and plan to order another pair to replace them!
1,"I read at least 50 reviews for six different Bluetooth headphones before choosing these.  Three requirements were tops on my list - comfort during treadmill running, great bass, and a solid value. These headphones delivered on all three! I was also impressed with the “little extras” — the carrying case and magnetic cell phone car holder were nice touches. Overall, buy these for the quality of the sound and ease of use. For me, five stars would mean Bose-quality sound, but for under $30 the solid audio and overall quality can’t be beat."
1,"I use them on my commute to work, the gym, with my playstation vita, and other times. They are great."
1,"Excellent sound, comfortable and stable in ears and easy setup!  What more could you want?"
0,Not working after 1 week. I had the headphones and used for 4 workouts on my bike and they will not charge. I have tried to contact the company 2 times and there was no reply.
1,Fit well and comfortable.  Easy to set up and use.  Very good sound.
0,"I have used these about three times a week or so at the gym, light use, but after having them only three weeks the sound went out on the right side. Not good quality"
1,"I'm very happy with everything. If you're looking at beats or BOSE ear buds but don't have the money too get them, get these. Literally the same quality, feels great on ear. Has same sound quality as my on ear beats. The case it comes in has everything you need to use it. Really nice 12volt charger included and the case for the headphones themselves is like pho-carbon fiber. Overall extremely happy with these."
1,"I have used these everyday the last two weeks, for about 40min at a time and still on a single charge."
1,Lasted a while and the left headphone went out. They were cheap so it didn’t matter all that much. Quality is decent but didn’t last
1,The headphones are very comfortable to walk or work out in. They pick up the quietest sounds in videos and songs. I love that they don't have to be plugged in to my phone so it gives me more freedom to do as I please. The life span is wonderful on them I just wish they lasted longer but thats unrealistic for 30 dollar headphones. They are also incredibly bulky ear buds that hurt my head if I lean on them while laying down or leaning against the window on the bus. Extremely uncomfortable for lazier settings. Otherwise I give them a 10/10 will buy again.. Probably. Unless I find ones exactly like these with smaller buds (mind you i have super small ears) Thank you for the wonderful service and speedy delivery! 💙
1,"I have used these daily for almost a month now. Main use is for working out and running. Great sound, they stay in my ears, and are as comfortable as could be. I lost one of the small cord keepers by mistake and when I contacted the company they were very responsive and have sent me a replacement."
1,"I paired these with my fitbit ionic and it works perfectly. Good sound. Had a small problem when first paired. The music was cutting in and out. I simply paused it for a while, and then when I resumed playing, it worked well. Haven't had a problem since."
1,"I gotta say, these perform far better than my expectations. They paired with my iPhone no problem, they are comfortable, and they sound FAR better than I guessed. I reality, they sound pretty darned good. Now, take the price into consideration and these are fantastic.<br /><br />If you're a hard core audiophile who insists on only the absolute best balance and clarity for the gym, these may not be for you. But in the end, I was very surprised how nice these sound and work. You can't go wrong."
1,Great headphones for a great price.
1,"My primary use is for these headphones is listening at work. I generally get 6-7 hours' listening time out of them, when using them constantly. Not much of an issue for me, as I always have a pair of wired earbuds with me and probably use them more than I do these, and I'm usually not getting a full 6-7 hours' listening time in at work anyway, due to meetings, etc.<br /><br />Sound quality is good, but difficult to adjust to a comfortable volume; I feel a little like Goldilocks--volume is either &#34;too loud,&#34; &#34;too soft,&#34; but never quite &#34;just right.&#34;<br /><br />My initial review stated that they had failed after being in storage. I've since removed that comment: There was an audio issue with the podcasts I was listening to."
1,"I bought these because I no longer wanted to be tethered to my phone. I was ever so slightly put off by the low low price but...<br /><br />These headphones are a steal at the current price. The guy that mentioned the bass was to heavy and needed to be reigned in must like his music sans bass. The bass in these headphones is clear and doesn't muddy up the sound. I have tested these with bands from Radiohead, to Rush to Nine Inch Nails and have had no reason to adjust the bass and the music sounds really good, . These things are crisp and clear and I prefer them to my Bose headphones.<br />On another note, I have small ear canals and the smallest earbuds they include fit my ears fine and I don't have any fatigue so far (longest listening sessions was 4 hours or so). I like them so much that I just bought a second pair. I will be sad when, as invariably everything does, they break. I may hold a funeral."
1,Great price and sound!
1,This is a good contender and a much less expensive alternative to other more costly solutions. I originally got these with the intention of avoiding the higher prices of the more established competitors which would also include Apple's twin AirPods set. I loved these SENSO Bluetooth Headphones so much I ordered a second pair. This device connected quickly to my Apple and Android products without breaking the bank and it delivers great sound with only minor performance sacrifices at the same time. I am very pleased with it. I prefer the fact that they come in one piece and not two like Apple's impressive product line. This makes not losing them a much higher possibility in my mind!
1,"First of all, I'm not a headphone connoisseur, I mostly use these for work, making & receiving calls.  I can say that they're comfortable ( I wear glasses - no problem ), it's easy to forget I have them on if I am walking around the house listening to music.  Certainly the price is great!  Very please."
1,Sonido fantastico.  Super comodo.  Suenan mucho mejor y con mejor bateria y calidad que otros que é tenido en el pasado.  Compre dos mas para regalos.
1,Great product. Purchased one for my husband on Cyber Monday. He loved it. So many extras included in the package. AND the sound is AWESOME!!! Noise cancelling full sound. Perfect for exercising. I recently purchased 2 more as Christmas gifts.
1,Bass is a little thuddy but hellava set of headphones for the price! Highly recommend them.
1,Great for running. Easy to use and they stay put well. Great noise and they get pretty loud!
1,"These are possibly the best wireless earphones I have used yet.<br /><br />I have been through quite a few sets of earphones and most don't seem to last long. These seemed to follow that trend, as they stopped charging after the second use.<br /><br />However I replaced the USB cord and it charged again. They fit well, don't fall out and sound pretty good. They connect fast, but the range isn't amazing. They seem pretty sweat resistant which is very important to me. I'd recommend them, especially considering the price."
0,"I recently purchased these headphones expecting some decent sound quality and good bluetooth connectivity. With overblown mids with muddled bass, these buds don't provide &#34;HD&#34; sound at all.<br /><br />I tried walking into another room in my house with my connected phone left behind, and I instantly ran into connection issues.<br /><br />The build quality is totally satisfactory, but performance was far below par in my books.<br /><br />Having owned these and TaoTronics bluetooth ear buds, go for the latter. They're much, much better."
1,They work great.  Battery life seems a little short but overall I am very happy<br /><br />Update. I unfortunately had to purchase again.  They are not puppy proof and apparently an Australian Shepherd finds them tasty.  They are a great deal and I will keep buying them as needed
1,These earbuds are great and have amazing sound quality. Easy to use and I love the tangle free nature of the cord. A must for music lovers that don't like to get tangled up in cords or don't want giant headphones on their head.
1,I have been using them for a week now.  So far so good..my problem with earbuds usually falls into my second or third month of owning them...Hoping these hold up..
1,I like them because they are the loudest Bluetooth ones I have found to go with my IPod. I’m planning on buying a couple more just to have.
1,Love it
0,not waterproof! took them in the pool and started swimming. In about 30 seconds there weren't working anymore. water was coming out from the seams.
1,Well designed. Bought as a gift and my son liked them very much.
0,"I really trusted the positive reviews of this headphones and decided to purchase these, because my old headphones died after using them for 3 years. Well, I made the purchase LESS THAN A MONTH AGO and the left side of the headphones DIED. I am very disappointed with this product and will not recommend. Plus, they do not stay on your ears when you are running. Frustrating."
0,"I don't like these headphones because they don't stay in my ears, and yes I did try all of the inserts including different sizes combination. I thought the over the ear loop would help with that, but they were useless in keeping the headphones in my ear. The other reason I don't like them is the sound quality, they're heavy on the bass and sound muffled even with equalizer adjustment."
1,"I like the sound quality, the ease of connectivity, and the accessories that came with these Bluetooth headphones.  However, none of the provided ear bud cushions are very comfortable for me.  I am a smallish female and have small ears, and after 30-45 minutes of wearing these, my ears hurt.  May try some other cushions that came with my wired earbuds to see if those are softer and more comfortable.<br />The zip case is very handy for throwing in my gym bag."
1,"Nice packaging, good quality of sound, easy to connect. works on iPhone, MacBook Pro"
1,Excellent ear phones so far.
1,"Easy to setup, very good sound, exceeded high expectations."
1,comfortable;great sound
1,I felt the quality was good but had to return them because they wouldn't stay on my ears. I was unable to use them.
1,"Since Apple came out with their Air Pods, I've been looking to cut the chord. Just not interested in $160 to do that. So I took to Amazon and was completely surprised by the number of reviews the Senso Headphones received. So, at a $36 price point, you have to give them a shot.  I must say, like others, I'm surprised by the sound quality. Just enough but not too much bass (unlike Bose) and you don't need the volume cranked to hear. The headphones serve dual purpose, but mostly for calls at the office. I will say, it is nice to take walks around the office without a chord dangling on the phone.<br />After having them a couple of days, the battery life is great and comfort is good. The only &#34;issue&#34; that I have is the strap. I wear collared shirts and a couple of people have asked what the noise was and it's coming from the strap. I'm also not sure that the noise cancelling works well since they can hear back ground noise."
1,I had a similar pair from another company. This pairs smoothly and I live the sound and easy controls. Best pair yet.
1,Very nice and light on the ears thanks
1,"The earloop has been broken, but the headphone still works perfectly after 5 years!!!<br />I rarely write reviews, but I have to for this one.<br /><br />Strongly recommend."
1,"This is the second set I have purchased. I am on airplanes a lot and I use these to listen to music, watch movies and sometimes just to shut off the world so I can relax. These are awesome sounding bluetooth headsets. I get about 6 hours continuous usage between charging. I really did not understand how good these really were until I accidentally left them in a pocket, while machine washing and machine drying my pants, and they still worked afterwards! They have included a nice unexpected bonus in each purchase. My first set included a car power adapter. The latest set included a high quality car vent magnetic phone holder. I paid around $40 for my first set on a lightning deal which was about half off. This latest set was $21.95 list price so the decision was easy."
1,"great headphones for the price, works well with iPhone, no glitches, works from far away"
1,"Nice packaging, extras were a nice surprise!"
0,worked great for 5 months then completely die on me mid workout.
1,Very fast shipping.  And the earbuds are very nice.  I was really impressed by the packaging and the quality of the earbuds.  So much I ordered a second pair.  Thank you very much. Craig
1,"Great headphones.  They are comfortable and easy to use. All my previous headphones, including BOSE, hurt after an hour.  These stay in your ears and don't irritate the delicate tissue.  The sound is great and being able to answer the phone, change tracks and +/- volume control are bonuses.  Don't hesitate with these."
1,Arrived on time and in good working order.  It's taking me a little while to adjust to them - I'm used to my JVC over the ear headphones and ear buds in the summer when it's too warm for the JVCs.  The new iPhone 7 necessitated getting wireless.  Their performance is very good.and the price is reasonable.
1,After testing them out for a few months. Doing some running and weightlifting. I can say they work well they stay in place and the sound is quality is good. Also the Bluetooth range is good. I would buy this again and I would recommend this to anyone.
1,"Still getting used to them> So far, so good, except that the ear hooks could be more adjustable. Working on that. So far: solid product and appears to be great product support!"
1,I have used these for a few workouts and I love how they block out sound and fit on my ears! My ears are small and I have trouble finding headphones that just stay put. I've used them for 2-3 hours without a charge and think they can last even longer.
1,"They came as promised, the directions were simply written and I charged them for 1 hr and hooked it up to the Bluetooth with no problems. Good reception and easy buttons to turn on and adjust volume. So off to gym I went, they were no slip no problems and easy to forget I had on my head. Love them and would buy again! I may have to my husband was eyeballing them!"
1,"Easy to use earbuds.  Good quality for listening to music, podcasts, etc.  Not great for talking to people on the phone.  They have a hard time hearing me."
1,I gave this to my husband for valentines day after seeing other reviews. He loves it! He works in sales so is on the phone quite a bit and says that the quality is great!!
1,"For the price, unbeatable!! Sound is not “Bose” quality, but certainly fine for working out, running or anything active! I leave my iPhone in my gym bag....I can wonder pretty far and still get reception!! They are comfortable, stay in place and the battery lasts a long time. I even left them in my car for 3 weeks in sub zero temps....and Viola...turned right on 😀😀<br />I’ve owned these for about one year, and just bought another for a gift 🎁<br />Highly recommend!!"
1,"Love them, great sound and so much better than my prior headphones that had a cord connected to the source. Bluetooth has long reach!"
1,"I thought with such and inexpensive head phones many problems would arise.Not so. For all the cost, they are amazing efficient. Sound is excellent and they a comfortable. I've only used  them  a  short while, so if performance changes, I'll repost.Right now, they are surprisingly good."
1,Well made and fits perfectly!
1,"These are one of the few earphones that will actually stay on during a workout. The music also sounds really good, and i was also happy with all the little extra things that came in with it. This is a really good product."
0,"The sound quality and comfort is good for the value. The problem I have is the quality of the product. I have purchased multiple of these of these of these over the past few years. They all seem to randomly stop working, won't charge, or won't turn on. Currently, I have 5 pairs in the drawer I throw them in when they stop working."
1,"Great sound quality, easy to sync.....very happy!"
1,"This is a Christmas Gift, not sure how it works yet"
0,Headphones are great but I did not receive either of the bonus items that the description mentioned so I am returning the item and reordering in hopes that everything is delivered the second time around.
0,"So I am at the verge of completing one year with this product and have contacted seller if I can get refund now instead of replacement. This product dies pretty soon!<br /><br />I bought this in August 2017 and it lasted for about 8 months and after that had issues where audio would break if the headphone was kept 2 feet away from iPhone.<br />A replacement was sent in April 2018 and that also had the exact same issue!<br />Another replacement was sent which lasted till 2 days back. And today, it does not even power up and not charging. It was at 70% battery when I used it last!<br /><br />So am not happy with this product :("
1,I've only been able to use once so far.  The set up was easy and so far they seem great
1,I love it.
1,Very nice
1,Nice sound quality. My only issue is that there is nothing in place to hold it around your neck when you take them off.<br /><br />Update: They broke a few weeks ago. I emailed Senso & they sent me a replacement (No questions asked) asap. Great company!
1,"It arrived quickly, and fits my expectations. thanks!"
1,"Great headphones, the hooks keep them in my ears even when I'm working out. Also, noice cancelation is great with the supplied foam buds. Some people may be turned off that they still have a cord connecting them, but this hasn't been an issue and allows you to take one out and let it hang for conversation."
0,Only had little over a month  and they stopped holding a charge.
1,"I bought these headphones to replace another brand (Philips) that I didn't like. These were my first Bluetooth headphones and they were very uncomfortable.  They also kept falling out of my ears.<br />  The SENSO headphones were much better for several reasons.  The latex cups that go into the ears came in three sizes and when wearing the correct size, they were very comfortable and stay in place.  I've worn them for extended periods of time and never had to adjust their position. When turned on, a voice prompts that the power is on and also lets you know when they connect and when the power is turned off.<br />The volume controls and power buttons are very conveniently located.  The sound was also very pleasing.  I highly recommend them; they seem to be a very good value for the price I paid."
1,Don't fit my ears good.  Sounds great if you can get them to stay in your ears.
1,These earbuds have good sound quality! They do wiggle loose during high impact exercise
1,They have been great and the sound is very good
1,I used them twice so far and they work good connect easy sound good.
1,Excellent transaction and excellent product. Nice sound and very convenient. Thank you
1,great for all I need it for
1,"Great sound quality at an incredible price. The only flaw I found was the one size fits all ear hook. However, after some time and effort, I was able to find the perfect fit. Or at least I adapted to them. Not a big deal. Shouldn't deter from you purchasing.<br />But the real reason I'm giving 5-Stars is Senso's customer service. For a reason unbeknownst to me, they stopped working after a few months. However, I contacted Senso, and that day had new headsets mailed out to me that same day. In my opinion, top notch customer service always warrants a 5-Star request. Regardless of any issues with the product. I recommend these to anyone in the market for quality Bluetooth headsets at a great price."
1,My son loves these!  Very happy with this purchase!
1,"Purchased these headphones for my workouts. They are wonderful! Very comfortable and they stay in place. The case, cords and different size ear pieces are a definite plus. They are very easy to use and the sound quality is great. Fast shipping and good customer service as well. I would definitely purchase again."
1,Worth for the price
0,"I don't have freakishly small ears, but for an adult they are on the small side. I was hoping with how flexible the material is maybe the fit would work out, but it doesn't and they look ridiculous. They are not adjustable beyond the ear bud covers they come with. The sound is good, for as long as they stay in my ears.<br /><br />So if you have large or average size ears, these are great! If you have small ears, keep shopping."
1,"Great in ear headphones, i can leave my phone on my desk and walk around the lab with coverage 30 + feet away."
1,"Due to an unfortunate situation with these headphones and my washer/dryer I actually picked up a second pair. I really like these headphones since I travel a lot and on a plane they rock. The bass could be a little better but the noise cancelling, even without the foam ear bud pads, make up for it."
1,Bought multiple pairs for the price these are the best headphones they beat the mpow flame 2 headphones hands down
1,Great product!  Comfortable and great battery.
1,"Very nice! Bought two different brands, one for me and one for a birthday present for my daughter. Since one was a bday present, I let her choose which one she wanted...she chose these. I was sad, I liked these better😏...the ear piece was so much softer!  She says they work great!!"
1,These are amazing headphones.  The sound quality is excellent and they are really comfortable. I've had headphones that are painful after an hour of having them on but I can wear these all day. I definitely recommend these headphones. They are worth every penny.
1,works perfect keeps a charge for a long time
1,I was very happy with the product and the seller.  The headphones were easy to setup and sound great.  The shipping was fast and the seller's communication was excellent.
0,Was very sastisfied until last week when it stopped working.
1,The headphones are great! I use them for my morning workouts.
1,I lost my more expensive bluetooth headphones. So I figured I would replace them with these because I didn't want to spend that much again since I was just using them to run on the treadmill at the gym. Great decision! These are less expensive but plays just as good. They even come with this cute little zip up storage case.
1,I love the earbuds but I wear glasses and they don’t fit quite right around my ears at times. The sound quality is good. I would order again.
1,Simple to use and really good sound quality.  Great value.
1,"These are great headphones. The sound quality is very nice. These headphones get heavy daily use in the gym or out running. After 3 months of use, they wouldn't power on one day before a run. I contacted customer service and they agreed that they should not have failed. They verified my address and in two days, I had a new pair. Responded to my email at 7pm and shipped the product out quickly. Now that's great customer service."
1,"Had a small issue with connection of bluetooth after 2 months and they responded to my email within an hour and fixed it. Awesome support, great product."
1,They are a gift so have to wait until after Christmas but I got them very fast. They look great.
1,Go ahead and get it! It works as advertised. I'm thinking about buying another one.
1,"I love them and the matte finish makes them easy to grip. Premium sound and paired easy to my galaxy phone and watch. Lots of accessories for ears and power. Nice case. Worth every penny. Reordered last night, got them 24 hours later. AWESOME"
1,One of the headphones already broke but we were able to mend it a bit. The side plastic buttons are missing and the headphone is dangling but it still works so that is a plus!
1,The headphones and the customer service are fantastic. I would highly recommend Senso headphones.
1,"I like my earbuds to be glued into my ear canal, I use the foam pieces and during a workout they do start to slip a little. But it’s such a great price that I don’t mind having to adjust them now and then."
0,WARNING: Headphones work fine until they reach 30%. At that point you get a warning every MINUTE that the battery is low. I got 6 warnings and then it turned itself off. These are a week old so this is unacceptable. Considering returning
1,"The headphones work for the most part great.  However, wish the ear buds were a little smaller.  The cordless factor is excellent."
1,"In what way, shape, or form is a &#34;Calling last recent missed call&#34; feature beneficial. Great product for the price except for that one feature. Very annoying!"
1,Great find and great Buy better that my beats 2 and Plantronics
1,"Love these headphones. Sound is great, mic is clear, battery life is great, they don't fall out of my ear...<br />Without a doubt the best blue tooth headphones I've gotten so far. Great value!"
1,Nice 1
0,"It does not fit my ears.  Gave it to my husband, he said sometimes it does not connect to his iPhone.  Then, it disappear from our life...we could care less."
1,Bought my son Beats... Bought me these and absolutely love them! Price is great for how these work. Definitely recommend!!
1,love these wireless headphones. Great value. They are comfortable and sound great.
1,Great bargain! I am using these for HIIT style workouts and they stay in place even when I do handstand push-ups. Sound is fine and they connect easily to my phone or watch.
0,"Much too loud at lowest setting.  Turned volume to lowest on headphone, on Iphone, and on Itunes app.  Still much too loud.  Returning."
1,"These are awesome ,don't let the low price scare you ,they are top notch. I would definitley recommend and will be buying another myself."
1,"I like that it has the same components as AirPods which is why I bought them. I dislike that it sometimes cuts off out of nowhere or I hear a weird beeping noise sometimes while listening to music, but it is not a big deal, especially for the price. I like the bass and how loud and clear the volume is."
1,"Good value for the price, delivered fast, easy to setup, and they work properly.  I would recommend purchasing this item."
1,"I've tested them for a day now and I have to say these are really awesome. They're user-friendly and easy to setup. The battery life is pretty outstanding. I had these in for several hours while at the gym and never once had any issues. On the topic of the gym, these headphones are definitely sweat proof. The sound quality is as everyone else says. It's definitely hard to beat the quality and price of these headphones. Definitely worth a purchase!"
1,Had a slight connection issue after using for one week. I contacted the company by email and they responded immediately and gave me a suggestion which worked. Great customer service. My reason for only 4 stars is the ear fit on the outside loop is very loose and sometimes falls out. Other than that it is a good purchase and I loved the customer service. Would recommend.
1,"Product as describes, fast shipping."
1,"Was immediately impressed by the attention provided by the company from the time I ordered to the time the product arrived and after. They wanted to know my experience and keep me informed about the product delivery. Customer service &#34;old style&#34;! From the arrival of the product in its nicely structured box, its quality-quality-quality. A great customer experience when I opened the box and the visual and feel of the product contents. The headset fit firmly into my ears and its solid build is evident. But when I played my first song I was overwhelmed. Great solid-sound quality! This is what a great product and company should provide. Thanks!"
1,Easy set up and great sound. Good battery life.
0,the battery life is too short.
1,Excellent product
0,"The best headphone for me!<br />I tried different Bluetooth headphones under $100 even those top rated.<br />The last one was taotraonics.<br />While I was thinking to go the most expensive brand like Bose and the like,then I met with this one with good reviews and decided to give it a try.<br /><br />It's the best in every category in my checklist:<br />Sound quality best,<br />Fitting in the ear even for work out,best<br />Phone call quality,better.<br /><br />The downside<br />There is no background noise suppression,during the call in noisy environment it's mic picks up everything and makes phone conversation very disturbing.<br /><br />Music playback control is not friendly especially for skipping songs forward or backwards.Most of the times you end up increasing the volume or reducing it.<br /><br />Though I mention those two downsides I find it is unfair to rate it below five stars as it provides a lot for few bucks.<br />Am ready to buy upgrade version of it!<br /><br />Update:<br />After 3 months of use the headphone suddenly died while I was running.It was fully charged after using just for 40 minutes,it said battery low then switched off and never went back to life!🙈🙈🙈"
1,Great headphones especially for the price and the warrsnty is perfect too when i was hsving issues they sent me a fresh pair no questions asked.
0,"Positives: Comfort-wise, they are a 5 star. They fit the ear canal well. The wire connecting the buds is the perfect length so it doesn't flop around or get in the way during your workout.<br /><br />Sound quality is the reason for my 2 star rating. When I'm working out, I like to have the volume at the highest level. At mid level, on most songs, the sound quality becomes poor and the music sounds staticky."
1,"I've been using my headset for about a week. So far they are great. These replaced a set of Sony headphones I was using. I'm extremely active and sweat excessively. I needed something that was durable, from the reviews these wireless headphones were what I needed. The sound quality is great, the fit takes some getting accustom to if you don't typically wear over the ear earbuds, and I have had no true issues using them to talk while exercising."
0,The sound is pretty good- the phones however are too wide and fall out often- not good for exercise or mowing the grass. Would be great for sitting around not moving.
1,Design and fits well to ears.
1,"Don’t pay for super expensive wireless headphone options. I was skeptical due to the price, and this was my third attempt to try to find the right pair. They really are great and I use them everyday now for work."
1,"I’ve been wearing these for about a month while running and working out. Love them so far, especially for the price!<br /><br />Pros: Stays in your ears even during intense workouts. The sound is pretty good and loud even at a low sound level. Pairs great with Apple Watch! Battery lasts a while.<br /><br />Cons: It REALLY cancels out noise which is a plus but also a minus because you can’t hear your surroundings. I can’t figure out the battery percentage so I never know if they need to be charged or not."
0,"Great sound! The wire attaching the two is light weight, you don't even notice it. The controls are easily accessible. There is a lot of wind noise from the size of the ear piece that has the controls and battery. It is significant over precious sets that I have owned. Block hits corner of my ear and can be quite uncomfortable at times."
1,"Needs more bass, and more noise cancellations."
1,"I don’t do any major workouts with these so I’m not sure how they hold up to more vigorous workouts, but I use these on my walk to work and they are great! The battery lasts a really long time too!"
1,"Good fir the price. Fit, finish, and sound quality are ok. It's to be expected for the price."
1,It is good product
1,"I've only had these headphones for a few weeks, but so far I've really enjoyed them. Bass is good. I use them for weight lifting and have had no issues."
1,"Item arrived very quickly. have only used 1 time, it was easy to bluetooth connect. Sound is fine for me. Besides the headphones, it also came with a phone holder for your car and a credit card holder that you attach to the back of your phone case."""
1,The product worked great. I did have an issue with the left side after about 10 moths.<br />2 quick emails and new set on its way.<br />Can not ask for more!
0,"Seemed good from the reviews, got them and only one ear worked. When I tried them on and tilted my head somehow sound came into the other ear but that didn’t last long. Can’t return them because I gave them to my boyfriend stationed in Germany for Christmas."
1,So I had these for about 2 years before they broke and thats fine as I had accidentally put it through the wash and they still worked that pair I had would be 5 stars but since I bought a new pair I have to degrade them to 4 stars the ear hooks are way too large the original ones (shown in the pictures) were way better and I don't know this for a fact but it seems to me that the Bluetooth range is smaller than my last pair.
1,So far they work great. Nice to be cord free.
1,Really helpful and they replied right away! Thank you!!!
1,Nice so far only used a couple of times . In expensive.
1,The battery life is great! I use them at night and for the gym and they last all day! I highly recommend.
0,"They have good sound when they work. Cut in and out a lot and the battery life is not what they advertise, 3-4 hours. Hard to use because they cut out so much."
1,Works great!!
1,"They keep dropping connection with iphone, can be frustrating"
1,"Crystal clear sound with some nice bass, light weight and stay in the ears"
1,"As depicted, with nice accessory bundle. Using it for my workouts: so far, so good. Comfortable. Quick support from the company when there was a defect (persistent buzzing from one earbud) detected, soon to be resolved."
0,"Great assortment of earcups, great sound, pairs with Iphone 6S+ and my smart TV easily.  All kinds of extras.  Excellent value.<br /><br />Update:  These were great while they lasted but after less than 6 months they don't work anymore.  They were not exposed to weather or temperature extremes.  Their sound only in the right earpiece and that is intermittent."
1,Solid headphones perfect for the gym.  Great cheaper alternative to the designer brands that don't give you much more for the money you spend.<br /><br />Easy to pair and set up with iPhone7+.  Battery life leaves a little to be desired BUT this is my first pair of Bluetooth headphones and from what I've read none of them are particularly remarkable.  Headset recharges quickly.<br /><br />Only con: the headphones will start giving you an audible &#34;Battery Low&#34; message that repeats every one minute until the headphones eventually die.  I get it's purpose (charge now or lose your audio).  But an option to turn that off would be appreciated--no reason to ruin those last five or ten minutes of audio by repeatedly reminding to do something that is probably inconvenient (else why wouldn't the use have charged after the first warning?).
1,"The best earphones , with all the qualities at very reasonable price. Sound quality is just awesome and doesn't even hurt your ear even if you use it for longer time. At full charge can use it continuously for 6 hours."
1,"LOVE these headphones! Nice case, charges easily, GREAT sound, & fit so well they are nearly noise canceling once you put them in!"
1,"Quality sound, great stereo and bass response at a great price"
1,"Awesome headphones! I was able to pair these up to my PC and Cell phone at the same time. I use them for work in my home office and don't have to scramble to mute my music to take a call now. When I go to the gym on my lunch break they just go with me too. This is essentially like hitting 3 birds with 1 stone for me! I did try to pair them to a 3rd device at the same time but it seems like pairing to 2 simultaneously is the limit. On the PC make sure you disable the hands free calling option or the audio quality suffers.<br /><br />They also last 7 hours as advertised because by the end of my shift I get a low power warning (Audio warning no visual indicators about how much charge the battery has). Audio quality is great with no real complaints, they seem to be a bit on the loud side. Better to be too loud and able to turn the volume down than too quiet at maximum volume though.<br /><br />They come with 2 charging cables and 1 car charger and 1 carrying case. Felt like I got a good deal for the price."
1,They work and fit fine. Work on my Apple watch and IPhone with no issues. Took a while to pair but it finally worked. Swapped out the ear bud covers for the smaller size. I have tiny ears. Fits nice and snug now.
1,The SENSO headphones was a great purchase. They sound great and you can’t beat the value for the price!
0,"I bought these headphones to use on the treadmill and connect wirelessly to my TV.  The headphones were fine but I had a bluetooth issue when we got rid of Dish and switched to youtube tv, as we plugged bluetooth receiver into hopper.  4 months later we finally got the bluetooth figured out, but my headphones didn't have a charge.  I tried to plug them in, and the cord would not stay in to the headphones.  I tried to resolve with Senso because out of return window, but we could not get a response.  It clearly says there is a 1 year guarantee in the description.  These headphones were used less than 5 times and I cannot charge them nor get a response from the seller."
1,There headphones are amazing. I bought a second pair because I misplaced my first ones. I prefer these over the beats headphones I had. The sound quality is very good and it holds a charge for a while.
1,"These headphones are great! They have everything you would want:<br />-Great battery life<br />-Amazing waterproofing (I tested)<br />-Cool design<br />-Great customer service (reached out to me to see if I needed anything even when I did not ask them)<br />-Comes with all the accessories you would ever want (Different tip sizes, cable clips, even a wallet and phone mount for your car!)<br />-And last but not least, they have amazing sound quality for their even more amazing price. (Deep, rumbling bass and crisp, clear highs)"
1,Just as good as headphones 3x their price
1,Nice quality for an small price.
0,Mic never works
1,"Excellent product for the price. I've used this for about a month...The battery lasts between two and four hours.. the audio quality is quite good.. But you need to adjust the bass in order to make it sound better (The base is extremely heavy when you first listen). The earbuds seem to fit my ears quite well. All in all, an excellent value."
1,These actually are small enough for my ear canals with the smallest attachments.  The sound quality is great too.  My only problem is they are a bit awkward to put in my ears as I have to manipulate them in a circle to get a good fit.
1,"I've never owned any other pair of Bluetooth headphones, so I have no comparisons. However, I've used them for about 2 weeks, and I am very pleased with their performance.<br />Their battery life is awesome! I usually stay at the gym for an hour and the earbuds are light weight, they do not hurt. I've only had to charge them once since first starting them up. The charging didn't take long either. The phamphlet says not to charge them over night. They charged in less than 2 hours. I also loved the fact that they came fully charged. They also tell you when you have low battery life. Once you hear that warning a minute or two later they completely shut off.<br />They have LED color indicators to tell you when it's pairing, connected/not connected, fully charged, charging or low battery.<br />Connecting to Bluetooth is easy and when I connect the lady tells me I'm connected. It gives me assurance that all is right haha<br />The sound quality is great-it can't handle too much bass. But they're earbuds, not speakers.<br />They are comfortable, and do not hurt my ears. They fit my ears and love the fact you sorta turn them to fit them in and they stay secured onto my ear. I have not tried running with these, but they stay on and I don't have to keep adjusting them to find my perfect fit.<br />I have not answered calls with them. I ordered them to listen to music when I workout, not talk or conduct business.<br />The bonus are all the accessories that came with them. A carrying case, short charging cable, car charger, extra ear tips, 3 ft charging cable and a wire tie.<br />Overall, this was the best ~$37 I've spent. I hope they last..."
1,Best Blue tooth headphones ever. Great sound quality and they stay in place. Impressive value.
1,"Pretty cool, wish the distance you can be away from the Wi-Fi was better. I have to walk around with my phone in my pocket."
1,The headset stays in place while running. Easily connects to my Bluetooth devices.
1,"My son, 13 years old, asked me to buy and he looks really enjoying this every day. He had tried more than five headphones for a couple of years, and said this is the best."
1,Did not like these at first. They did not stay in or cancel the noise the first time I ran on an elliptical.  Switched to the included memory foam inserts  and they stay put and the sound is amazing!
1,sound and work really well
1,"Got these headphones on Amazon Prime Deal Day, I think I paid $25 or $30. What an awesome value. I use these for the gym. I spend about an hour and a half at the gym roughly 4 days a week. I usually charge the headphones once a week, just leaving them plugged into the outlet in my car. I really like these headphones. They are comfortable and natural feeling. I wish the bluetooth range was a little farther. I definitely can't cross the gym without losing connection. Also, when the battery does start to die it happens very fast. The voice will warn &#34;low battery&#34; and the headphones usually die by the next song, about 5 minutes. I wish the warning came when you had more like 30 minutes of use time left. The low battery signal is a little abrupt. All in all, great purchase, would definitely recommend."
1,My friend absolutely loves them!
1,"Love it, best for youtube and Music."
1,Excellent product. Get it before the price goes up again. The sound is almost as good if not better than my daughter's Dr. Dre or as my son call it Dr. Dreadful!
1,"Pretty good product overall. It syncs up with multiple devices such as cell phone and PC while doing an efficient job at toggling when the phone rings. Charges quickly and isn't too heavy in the ear. There is sufficient bass to use these as a computer earphone and watching netflix etc. I have had a couple people complain that it was difficult to hear me speaking during our conversations. They said it sounded like I was on a speaker. Overall, for running and for basic Bluetooth needs it works well."
1,"Great sound quality, battery lasts long, easy to use....for $40 you can't beat it!"
1,it worked great
1,"They work great, Was easy to connect to my Bluetooth on a Samsung S5, The instruction book was not clear enough, Thank god for YouTube, And the printing was very very small. Hard to read with these old eyes. But I would buy again. I will write a update in a few months. I will put them thu hell next few months and I will review them again."
1,Thus is my second set. I lost the charging cord but felt like it would be worthwhile having one set in the gym bag and the other ready to charge. I’ve been very pleased with these.
1,Great for listening to music on my walks.
1,Perfect. Thank you.
1,Very comfortable and great quality for the price. I use them for my morning walks and got them because my AirPods were constantly falling out of my ears.  Easy set-up and comfortable. We’ll worth the money!
1,Awesome headphones for people who workout. Mine just stopped connecting to my phone though and have only had them for a couple months. Anyone know how to fix that?
1,Not bad<br />So far so good
1,"Great Tech support - provided instruction for making outgoing calls from bluetooth (just hold down both volume control buttons)<br />Great sound and volume control. Comfy ear piece that have flexible holders to confirm to your comfort.  Noise cancellation apparently isn't good according to the people I talk with.  Overall, I like it"
1,"Just received my earbuds this week, but are extremely satisfied with my purchase thus far, in fact, I am considering ordering a pair for my wife!"
1,"Awesome! Charge fast, last for hours, stay in place without hurting ears"
1,Great Deal
1,"Great sound and functionality, I love them."
1,I bought these headphones for my wife and she loves them.  She likes the Bluetooth feature to listen to her music when going to sleep without all the cords.  They are comfortable and had good sound quality.  Battery life I cannot measure yet as she just starting using these headphones.
1,"So I recently ordered these because of the amazing reviews I read on here. They far outweighed the negative ones, and I thought I should give them a try. I needed a new pair a headphones anyways. I received the package brand new, like the description. However, the earbuds looked like they were worn out and used. The sound quality is not so great--I would not compared them to Beats by Dre. They also kept falling out of my ears--idk maybe I have small ears? Well for $30, I would just buy some regular headphones that would last the same amount of time and same sound quality."
1,"I bought these because I have 2 other blue tooth headsets that I am not happy with for a lot of reasons.  These are light weight the sound quality is excellent, no one could tell I was using them. It is easy to set them up and they are comfortable.  It is easy to answer a call.  Well worth the money."
1,Bought these after losing my wireless beats headphones. These are honestly just as good. I was impressed with the packaging and accessories it came with. Sound is great. Very comfortable to wear and doesn’t budge while it’s in your ear. Great buy
1,"Really love them. They've been working great for several months with no issues. The bass is a bit strong, but most will like it. Sounds clear and great for working out."
0,NOT GOOD
1,"I should justify my rating, because clearly these aren't the very greatest headphones in the world. But they certainly do stand out from the crowd for these reasons:<br />* Excellent bang for the buck: the audio quality relative to their low price is fantastic.<br />* Exceeded promises in what was delivered. In particular, there was an additional pair of foam tips included. I seem to be a mutant where normal rubber tips of any size don't fit me well, but the foam ones are great.<br />* Really comfortable, irrespective of price.<br /><br />I was afraid that the flat cable would be annoying, but that seems not to be the case, it stays out of the way. The product description cites &#34;passive noise reduction&#34;, which is of course silly: all that means is &#34;you're sticking something in your ears, which tends to block the sound&#34;. And yeah, they do that, but so does any headphone.<br /><br />For those of you that want pumping bass, this might not be the best product for you. For very bassy tracks, I think I'm hearing just a bit of clipping. But that's not the kind of music I normally listen to, so for my purposes there's no problem. And on the other hand, I perceive the sound as being unusually clear. The instruments are standing out from each other, with nothing mushing together, so I'm able to hear subtle aspects of the performance.<br /><br />I have not tested the performance of the microphone - I've got a good Plantronics device for when I need to do that kind of thing. I was only interested in this for music, and I'm happy with it in this role."
1,"So I got these headphones a few days ago and so far they have been pretty good. The sound quality is good, battery life in my opinion is alright. I can get a full days use. The only problem I  have is that sometimes, the over the earpieces comes off if im walking around doing stuff, which causes the earbud to fall out, maybe it's because I wear glasses, I don't know but other than that I like them."
1,Nice product for the price!
1,So far they are working great
1,I love these ear buds they have great sound and perfect fit.
1,"better than expected. only had it for a few days, so far no complaints. customer service responded after purchase which was nice. we'll see long term how they hold up."
1,Our<br /><br />Purchased these and the 270.  These sound great.  I'll probably buy the third model too.
1,"Only had these for a couple days now, but so far so good. Good sound. Will buy again. Stay tuned"
1,I purchased these Bluetooth Headphones as a gift for a teenage grandchild.  The grandchild loves them.  They are comfortable and they stay in place with activity.
1,"These headphones are well worth the buy. They sound clear and crisp. They don't have adjustable ear hooks which would be a big upgrade for the future. They have fantastic battery life and the foam ear tips are great for not only keeping the external sound out, but also, the volume does not have to be as loud due to the noise isolation.<br />Bought as a cheap set to wreck and not feel bad if they get snagged on branches mowing, or ripped out when doing diy projects.<br />They've surpassed every expectation and test.<br />Haven't tested the waterproof functionality, but definitely sweat resistant."
0,Don’t know what I did but it won’t pair with my iPad.  Wasn’t really that rough with them.  Didn’t step on them or anything.  Threw them around a little.  But just lightly.  Tried resetting them but made no difference.  They are fully charged.  Hopefully other people will have better luck.
1,It was a gift
1,I have been using for 7 months. It works perfectly. Just bought another one for my dad.
1,Works as described<br />Easy to pair with my smartphone
1,"I liked these so well that my wife took them for herself<br />So I ordered another for myself<br />I have several different types of headsets but I like these best<br />Very clear music and phone<br />Definitely recommend to anyone who wants good sound<br />Hardly not notice them in ears, not at all like ear buds."
1,Great sounds and quality. Definitely recommend!
1,"Very good audio, long lasting battery."
1,"Its a winner! This is my 2nd set of wireless headfones. First set didnt have volume control and the sound was choppy. I read the ratings on this set and was compared to beats. Well i dont have beats nor can i afford them but this set sounds awesome! I use a few songs to test the sound quality like van halens, right now, rush YYZ, and the temptations papa was a rolling stone because these songs play at varying levels of bass and treble without having to make adjustments. The clarity is also good. They pass the test. In addition the ear hooks are soft and flexible and have gel buds for the ears. .the battery life is great.  I can squeeze 8 plus hours out of them easily. Initially I was gonna return them but decided to give them another shot because of the amazing customer service. I'm glad I didn't. I have 5 sets of buds by different companies. this pair is my most reliable. let me also say I listen to music all day so sound quality and battery life is essential. these are great I suggest you give them a try!"
0,I used these for ONE month before they just completely stopped working.<br />Waste of money.
1,Love!
1,"For less than $40, you really can't go wrong with these headphones.  I use these when I run and work out at the gym, and I sweat like crazy but have never had an issue with sound or malfunctioning.  I've had them for about six months and have just recently had an issue with pairing to my smartphone.  However, I contacted the company and let them know my issue.  They responded within an hour with a step-by-step way to resolve the problem.  It was an easy fix and they're back to working normally.  Great customer service!  Like I said, for a value-based pair of headphones used for when you work out or other activities these are definitely worth it in my opinion."
1,"Good sound quality, perfect in ears. I will recommend this to my friends."
1,Quick charging<br />Sound quality very good
1,"Accurate description, comfortable, durable, long charge, good sound, easy to connect,"
1,Arrived earlier than expected and works great!
1,great product
1,"Decent quality for the price. I'm in the same boat as some others, I did not receive the car charger. That seems to be common."
1,"I really am happy I found these headphones. They come beautifully packaged in a convenient carrying case, they are easy to use, and they work great. I just wish I had found them sooner.  The mic works great too when I get phone calls. I find them very reasonably priced as well"
1,"This purchase replaced an earlier model (purchased Jan2017).  Here are some notes:<br />- earpiece - the current model seems a bit more firm (less squishy) than before.  so far ear comfort after extended wear (>1h) has not been an issues, but i have not yet tested other eartip sized<br />- over the ear tether - the current model is a lot better, feels less flexible, which i think is good as it provides a better anchor around/over the ear during running and other vigorous activities.<br />- sound quality - works well.  i'd say better clarity than previous model i had<br />- connection - seems to have some minor issues with static if my phone is across my body.  Assuming the BT radio is in the right earpiece, I get static and degraded sound quality when the phone is on the left side of my body, whether on an armband, or a waistpack, or in my left hand pocket.<br />- battery - my old one seems to be running out of battery earlier.  not sure if it is the normal degradation of the battery or something else.  With the new one, haven't tested beyond 4h, but have had no issues thus far"
1,"Having read the reviews on these I expected a little more. Even though they are $30, I can't get over certain things. I have a very similar and identical looking product. Silicon Volcanos. Even same black and red color. But there are major differences. I purchased a second pair because my Volcanos hardly last 3 workouts of battery life. Pretty pathetic. BUT, they are much more comfortable than these Senso's. The over ear piece on the SENSO's is not nearly as comfortable or functional. They are a stiffer rubber than you can essentially bend to make them fit tighter. I have mid size ears and they did not hold snug or fit out of box. My Silicone's I didn't have to touch and the over ear piece is a much more ergonomic, flexible rubber that is comfortable and functional. I don't know why, but the chord is also more stiff and thck andlays to the right side. When i turn my head a certain way it pulls on one ear. Its very annoying. Yes, they provide chord ties, but I don't need them for my other pair. Just holding in hand, they are heavier. Once wearing, they aren't comfortable and very noticeable that they are there vs my other pair which you almost forget you are wearing minus the music playing. They really are night and day.<br /><br />Finally, the sound. Its clear. Thats all I'm going to give it. There is zero bass response with these. Better than having bass distortion, but lowish bass notes are non-existent. But, the sound is clear as I said so they perform for a $30 set of headphones.<br /><br />All in all, these will be my backups. If I didn't already have a very similar pair and know how a better pair fits and feels, I wouldn't know better. But I do. I just wish my other pair had a better battery life than 4 hours or so. But it beats dealing with chords. I would choose the Silicone Volcanoes over these just for the comfort factor. Sound is about the same with slight differences."
0,Good sound.. but it broke. Somehow the earbud piece snapped apart from the ear mounting piece.. so long headsets.
1,love these headphones.  Use them all the time
1,Great sound for the price!
1,"For the money, I don't think you can beat these headphones. The sound is decent. Not super rich, but better than I expected it to be. They are light which helps them stay in pretty well. The ear loop is flexible actually kind of floppy which is a little annoying, but at the same time makes them comfortable to wear for long periods of time. They don't skip very much which is a huge plus for Bluetooth headphones. Mine stopped working after about a month of daily use. I emailed Senso and they got right back to me (on a Sunday no less). After trying to trouble shoot the headphones they sent me a new pair. Excellent customer service.<br /><br />*9/20/17<br />I upgraded this review to five stars. I think Senso / Invotek have made me lifelong customers. They replaced my earbuds above and now about nine months later they replaced them again without any trouble. I know a company following through on their warranty shouldn't be a reason for excitement, but I think we all know it is. It's so rare these days to find a company that doesn't find a way to worm their way out of it. especially after they've honored it once already. I emailed them and received replacements literally two days later. The replacement earbuds have a firm ear loop which I think is an improvement. If they fixed the low battery warning, I'll be the creepy guy in the gym because I'll be crying tears of joy."
1,"This may not be a fair review because I have been using the Plantronics Backbeat 903+ for years.<br />The good, they have multiple size earbuds.  They are excellent, stay in the ear and are very comfortable. The sound is good.  They pair with two devices and that is an advantage if you are going to use with a desktop computer.<br />The cons, The strap across the back gets caught on the back of your neck and in your collar which pulls on your ear.  They stay in anyway.  Sound quality is not even close for music playback.  The backbeat are way louder, have considerably more bass, and deliver much greater midrange.  The SENSO has higher quality highs and give more clear sound on phone calls.  the largest complaint is the size.  Looks like a box hanging out each side of your head.  There is an annoying blue light flashing all the time aimed right at the person you are talking too."
1,Good headphones. Fit is a little weird for my ears. But don't think that's necessarily a general problem.
1,"Very well made , packaged well and comes with a great case and heavy duty charging cords. Sound is fantastic!"
1,"I just got these and love them... easy to use, charged quickly, synched easily, are comfortable and the sound is great. Much better than I thought they were going to be for this price. I would order again."
1,"I've had these headphones for a few days now and the only thing I have to say about them is that I LOVE them. I can't tell you how many wireless headphones I've purchased in an attempt to find a pair that is reasonably priced and has impeccable sound. And these are the perfect ones. I'll also throw it out there that I bike every day and these fit right into my morning routine. I've also been using them at work. I haven't had to charge them since Friday (3 days ago).<br /><br />They're easy to pair, stylish, comfortable to wear, and most importantly, sound AMAZING. They sound as great or better than other highly priced competitor products.<br /><br />If you're in the market for the perfect pair of headphones, PLEASE try these out. I promise you won't be disappointed!!!"
1,This is my second pair. Battery lasted through a marathon. I ran in all kinds of weather including rain with the first pair and they lasted for maybe 4 years before the one side shorted out.
0,Mine stopped working after few months. Is there a way I can get it replaced? Since it has 1 year warranty?
1,"Very impressive.  However, my left ear bud is failing after 19 months.  Certainly not bad for a system failure considering the price, but not meriting a 5 star rating with consideration given to durability.  Nevertheless, I'm likely to repeat my purchase...minutes from entering this review, as a matter of fact.  They are that good...at least for a period over a year.  Some relationships fail that test.  Senso is a product that has behind it, people that care about both cost and functionality.  Well played Senso, well played!"
1,"The sound quality was good, I have no problem with it. However, the battery life is a little short, average about 4 hrs of listening time. I used it for like 2 years, and then switched to another product because the battery life is a little short, and most importantly, it is not recording any sounds anymore. I can only use it for listening music, for like 4 hrs. I bought it for 37 dollars, and I was expecting a longer life time and battery, but I might just got a defected product, and I guess the price for this now is much cheaper."
1,Product great but shipping terrible
1,I had an issue with this product breaking early on after I got it. It was dropped and one of the pieces was missing so I thought no big deal I'll keep using it. I put it in my sweater one day and it feel apart. The reason I'm giving this 5 stars you wonder. The customer service shown by the company was amazing. I definitely recommend this company because they stand behind their product.<br /><br />On the actual product. It worked really well to work out with. It cut out a lot of outside noise. Wasn't great for phone calls. It would stay secure when I needed it too.
1,My Senso headphones arrived on time and were packaged in very impressive box.  They sound amazing and the build quality is excellent.  I have only used them twice so far but they have exceeded my expectations.
0,"After about a year and five months of occasional use, the microphone no longer works. All along I was tolerating the 3-4 hour battery life as well as the inability to consistently connect to my phone and tablet but now that the microphone stopped working, the headphones are of no use to me."
1,These headphones work really well. They connect easily and quickly with my iPhone 6 with no issues. They have great sound. They are nice and loud with good bass. They come with multiple ear inserts and even a car charger!
1,These earbuds/headphones work great. I run a lot and these stay in my ears.
1,This is the first pair of Bluetooth headphones that I have been able to work with.
1,Exactly what I was looking for. Stay put nicely for jogging.
1,Total quality! Love the foam plugs because I have sensitive ears.  Great sound. Quick to charge.
0,"I had trouble getting it paired to a ZTE phone that I use only as a mp3 player. If i put the phone on a flat surface and stay within 10 feet it works, it doesn't work much beyond that without breaking up. Also when i take it for my daily walk, i put the phone in my pants pocket and it is stutters..constantly in and out. I bought another headset and it works fine. I should have returned it for a refund"
1,"I bought these with no expectations of them being that great, however these have quickly become my new favorite headphones. The sound quality is perfect and the battery stays charged for quite a while. Would absolutely  recommend."
1,"Nice earbuds ,they have a long range and are very well built."
1,"Good sound, easy to use and connects easily. My ears are small so the hooks don't really help but they manage to stay on place regardless."
1,"Arrived in about two days paired easily I bought to watch ,tv sound is excellent better than I exspected I also use them to listen to music out walking on my iPhone sounds great and very comfortable"
1,My son absolutely loves these earphones. He said they sound really good and he is happy because they were affordable. He purchased these with his own money.
1,It's a great buy for the price and sounds awesome with a good power life that lasts 8 hours of great listening and easy to use. It was such a great device my daughter wanted one so I got her one for her B Day
1,Very good product.
1,The only issue I have is they fall off my ears and there's no way to adjust them
1,"I haven't worn them in the rain or water yet, BUT I have worked out in them and they are comfortable. They also have good sound quality and a range greater than I expected. I can leave my phone in the kitchen and go upstairs to do laundry and still be listening on my SENSO headphones."
1,Wow I am amazed at the quality of sound from these Wireless SENSO Bluetooth Headphones. The HD Sound is off the charts and the ease of setup was great. I linked it to my android phone with no problem. I called my wife to try out the mic and with the noise cancellation it works great in place of my Bluetooth when I am working in loud environments. I have been listening to music all day long and the battery is still going strong. The silicone gel tips make them very comfortable for long term use. There has been no loss of clarity as I walk around my two story home with out having my phone stuck to my side. I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for Wireless Bluetooth Headphones.
1,"Purchased these for my husband, however after a month the battery started to lose charge and within 3 months they quit working. I wish i could return these."
1,"I always enjoy reviewing a product before I get a chance to use it. I have found that a lot of things appear to be good for a week or two then fade fast. This is an early review<br />These headphones feel right, they Mike is sensit I've. They are hard to plug into the ears."
1,"These headphones are an awesome deal ! They have great sound, they stay in my ears even in the rain, when I run 15 miles or 5. I was skeptical because the price is so reasonable. They come with live support 24/7/365 and a 1 year warranty. IMPRESSED! I am running in my 8th marathon soon, and am confident these headphones will be instrumental in the second half of the race."
1,I recently purchased the Senso Bluetooth Headphones S-250. I absolutely love them!  I had a question about one of the components and emailed their support. I received a response right away! I am very impressed with the product as well as the company!
1,This is our third set. One of the first two quit charging after about 14 months. Both my husband and son love them because they fit in their ears comfortable and give great quality hearing and talking to people. Would recommend and like now reorder. Thanks
1,"I love them. When I placed a call, the other person said the background noise was not there. They can hear me!"
0,"The headphones were easy to setup and use with my iPhone 5s. They worked well initially however one annoying fact that remained was the head phones would cut out if I would turn my head especially out doors which was annoying to begin with because it used to happen when crossing roads. Also, the blue tooth wouldn’t work if I put my phone in my pant pockets which means I couldn’t use them if I wore a polo shirt.<br />Recently my phone was replaced by apple. The head phone connect to my new iPhone 5s but when I play music it doesn’t pick up sound immediately. The headphones also makes a shrill noise similar to ringing in ears every time I turn it on. I wish I would have known prior to buying a second pair for my wife’s iPhone 7. I would have chosen better Bluetooth headphones.<br />Battery does not last for 8 hours, when it was working it would last for 6 playing music at the best."
0,I got these as a gift and for about 3 weeks they worked just fine and now they just connect and connect over and over. Tried to turn off and reset them many times to fix it and nothing. I use a wireless speaker on same device and it works just fine (Samsung S2 Tab) so I know it is no the device. I have tried to go to there website to seek some help but get a blank page and no phone number at all. I will be returning these and I recommend you do no buy them what so ever!!
1,Comfortable great for gym and running outdoors.
1,"Great sound quality, fit and comfort, and battery life is great.<br />Would be nice if, when battery life is low, the sound was not so loud, and would be same volume level as current setting."
1,Awesome headphone
1,Amazing! I have tried multiple others and the KEY thing with these is the 100% flexible and moldable silicone ear hooks!! Super important - they are soft and moldable so you can make them fit your ear. Others headphones seem to have mostly non-flexible hooks so they fall out of my ears. These are the best!
1,Only used then one or twice so far but they seem good for the 30 ish bucks or whatever I paid. The design is a little bulky but I guess that extends the battery life
1,"these buds are amazing , they exceed all my expectations.....I  highly recommend these, I don't think it gets any better, I find them the absolutely best buds"
0,Product stopped working after 3 months. Connection issue was there since beginning and now I cannot even return it. Worst Bluetooth.
1,"Awesome earbuds! Finally free from wires. Great sound, great value, comfortable and easy to use. Very happy with this purchase!"
1,I love these.  I tried more expensive ones and came back to these for the comfort and the sound.
1,"My three stars rating is based on the fact they are only $29.97.  Otherwise, I would give 2 stars if they were more.  The sound is adequate but my problems is they always fall out which I really do not like."
1,The headphones are good for running. The sound is good and they stay in while running. I have a problem finding headphones that stay while I run.<br /><br />The only reason I am giving it 3 stars is due to the lightening cord that came with it did not work.
1,I had it for awhile now. long battery life and sounds are clearer than most products Bestbuy sell at there store.  will buy this brand again.
1,"The sound and volume are great for the price. These are the best headphones at this price point (~$35) I've ever heard. If I had to say one criticism, however, it's that they are not really &#34;noise cancelling&#34; as the title claims. There are special foam ear buds included with them that reduce external noise, but it is not comparable to the true &#34;noise cancelling&#34; effect you find with top of the line headphones. All in all, this is a great deal regardless!"
0,"I have gone through 4 of their headsets in only 1 1/2 years. They keep breaking. The longest one lasted was 9 months and the shortest,  2 weeks. It is a garbage product. The only reason I have given it as many chances as I have is that the customer service is top Notch. But the best customer service in the world can't make up for how poor a product it is"
1,"The Senso Bluetooth Headphones are amazing. The sound quality is great, and is compatible to my Samsung phone. I recommend this to anyone that is looking for a good wireless headphone."
1,"The good - they are comfortable and work well. Easy pairing to an iPhone7. Comes with extras like a car charger and Apple lighting cable (which it doesn't need so this is just an extra).<br />The bad - out of the box this is mixed for heavy, heavy bass. Fortunately Spotify has a mixer so I can balance out the sound. If you do not have the ability to adjust the bass, these would not be a good choice. I need to adjust the bass and treble whenever I use these. So it gets 4 stars for the inconvenience."
1,"So the sound quality is real nice. I would probably give 5 stars based solely on sound, but factoring in other issues, I ended with a 3 star review. First, the power/sync button is too easily pressed. I feel like there should be a lock feature or a long first press to start/operate. While wearing, I have to adjust often because the fit isn’t great (issue #2). The flex holders are real nice, but a little too flexible; I can’t wear my glasses with it because they interfere with the flex arms and loosen them. The last issue deals with the soft carry case but is a result of that power button issue. Just banging around in my gym bag causes the power button to switch on and syncs my phone to it. I have missed calls because the power switches on and my phone alerts go to the device, which also kills power. So not huge negatives, now that I’m aware I adjust, but I would just love a device that works without adjustment. I mean, it’s 2017 and A.i. Is about to take over, might as well have BT speakers that work seamlessly! 😂👌🤙"
1,Working good
0,These headphones were great for the short time they actually worked. They stopped  taking charge so I they just became useless. I loved using them in the gym but that too was short lived.  I had high hopes for these.
1,nice sound and fit
1,Absolutely love them!  Great sound with easy to use control buttons.  I've used them when jogging and biking and they stay in place and work/sound great!  These headphones are exactly what I was hoping for when I bought them!  Highly recommended!
1,Great sound for the money.
1,Love these bluetooth headphones . Great for working out. Once you have them on you don't hear anything around you. Works great. Has a great wireless range. Highly recommend
1,"What i really like the most is how part that goes over the ears is bendable to fit your own ear. I had a pair the didnt have anything and they kept falling out of my ears and it was annoying. As far as music, it does have more bass then i would have expected and you cant adjust it, so it your dont like a lot of bass then this isnt for you. Over all i am satisfied with these head sets."
1,"Good product and good service .It is very confortable ,I use it when I on the train and noise cancling works.If you like sport it should be a good one ,listen music as you exercise ."
1,"Very nice, except the over the ear piece is flimpsy"
1,"Exactly what I was looking for! These stay put while I'm running. Flexible, siliconized ear wire is comfortable & adaptive to individual ear shapes and sizes. You might have to spend a few minutes initially getting them adjusted for your anatomy, but then they stay comfortably conformed for repeat use. (I am a woman with very small and closely configured outer ears. Sometimes the ear pieces from sunglasses bother me. However, the ear wires on these headphones are very slender, malleable, and comfortable.) I find the HD foam tips better @ blocking external sounds. Music is crisp with good tonal balance (bass/treble); signal is consistent (no 'skips' in the audio stream) with iphone 10 ft away on my desk. Controls are easy to utilize. Visibly innocuous! These come very well-packaged and include a nicely designed, sturdy soft-sided travel case that holds the headphones and accessories (which includes a car charger).  Because they're tandem, one side won't go missing.  You could pay a lot more, but why???  These really are high quality at a very palatable price point.  They also come with a one year warranty and coupon for 10% off a subsequent purchase...very nice additional incentive. You owe it to yourself to check these out.  Wouldn't surprise me if they become the go-to brand for discerning customers who want affordability as well as quality."
1,"Theses are the best pair of Bluetooth headphones I have ever purchased, I see why the rate is so high love,love,them!!"
0,"These were great and I used them in the gym, out on runs or sometimes while cleaning the house but one day while listening 3 months after I got them they just stopped playing. They will connect and at the end of saying my headset is connected it just cuts off and there is no sound. So for 3 months they were great and then they all of a sudden just won’t work. I mean I know they aren’t expensive and you expect them to work for a long time but I expected them to work longer than 3 months"
0,difficult to power product not sure it is even powered does not fit well on ears  hate it!!
1,"Nice headphones, good sound quality, and great customer support. Responded to my inquiry right away."
1,"Good sounding headphones. Light and comfortable to wear, especially during workouts."
1,Incredible sound....both on the bass side and the treble . Bass is big and doesn't rumble and the treble is good and not overwrought..Really comfortable in the ears especially for ear buds! One of the Best Buy's you will find on Amazon!
1,very good
1,"Very good sound quality, putting the product on is a bit awkward, but overall I'm glad I purchased it. I am on bridge lines at work that sometimes can last a few hours, some participants do not speak good English, the good sound quality makes it easier to understand them."
1,"I was skeptical about buying these $23.97 Bluetooth headphones, but the first day I tried them I have loved them since (a year later)! These are perfect. They're light weight, & fit to my ear (had extra fittings) that don't fall out during intense running.  They have a warranty, and come with a nice case to carry them around (though honestly I just throw them in my bag and they're safe!  I also use them at work, usually just putting one plug in and hanging the other one around my collar.  Great sound, great quality. I love that I can change songs and the volume with a touch or two of a button.  The battery isn't super long, maybe 45 minutes max, but that's really all I need them for.  I can walk across the room without my phone, but can't go too far.  I have only ran out of battery once during a long day at work.  The charge time is fast, so not much of a worry!  I would buy these as a gift and recommend them to family and friends.  I'd pay more money for this quality!"
1,Senso did a great job of standing behind their product.  I had se issues with the battery life.  They quickly responded to my concerns and provided steps to reset the device.  This did improve performance but didn't meet their original estimates so they sent me a new device.  All this transpired over the course of a few days.  Thank You for the great service
0,"The good: audio quality is pretty good. Not to mention audible - which was a problem on another pair of bluetooth headphones I previously owned. The range on these headphones are pretty good too - which is a standout. Battery life is strictly okay &amp; so is 'charge time'.<br /><br />The bad: The earpieces are a bit bulky. Also, unless the buds sit 'cleanly' in your ear (which can vary depending on the shape of your ear, I guess), they can be a bit painful especially if they begin to chafe (which can happen if you use these for jogging or other kinds of physical activity). The 'ear grips' (that go round the ears) are particularly flimsy and *do not* hold the earpieces in place especially if you are running, jogging et al. And given the weight of the pieces/buds/what-have-you, they are not well made enough to keep them 'in-place'/snug around your ear.<br /><br />Verdict: I *would not* recommend these headphones for using at the gym or any kinds of physical activity since they keep popping off the ear. They work just fine if you want a pair of decent-ish bluetooth headphones you plan to use for mostly sedentary activity."
1,Great sound
1,"They fit in my ear perfectly, the sound is great. I've never had a pair of expensive headphones, but these did surpass my expectations."
1,Good sound really nice quality and battery does last a long time I am 100% satisfied with my purchase
0,"They were fantastic earbuds. I love the over ear design for use while exercising. The sound was great and they held a charge.<br /><br />Until they stopped working a week ago. They died faster than usual and won't accept a charge. No red or blue light when plugged in to USB. Tried multiple cables and ports. No damage, no water damage, well taken care of. They just stopped working. Would give them a 5 star if they didn't break.<br /><br />Your mileage may vary, but I guess you get what you pay for."
1,I used them for the first time today and I love the sound quality.
1,"My Senso wireless bluetooth earbuds stopped holding a charge after a few months of use. The amazing thing was how quickly The company responded to my message. They got back to me within hours on a weekend. I tried their suggestions for getting the earbuds to charge but without any luck. Within a day, they had honored their 1-year warranty and are sending me a new pair. This company has a good product and incredible customer service."
1,Headphones are good for listening to music or podcasts while biking.  Phone calls don’t work as well as the person on the other end can hear a lot of background noise.
1,"I feel that i received my moneys worth. The packaging and ease of use is legit.<br />The case and the additional lighting cord is a bonus.<br />The only complaint when trying to change the ear bud size, def not user friendly."
1,"These are good quality headphones and the price was surprisingly affordable. I have another more expensive pair and got these as a second backup, but these are far better than the others. They are very comfortable and have good sound. One of the best things about them is that there is no sound delay when watching videos. My other headphones have a delay, which is annoying when watching videos where people are talking and their words are out of synch with the sound. These synch perfectly. I definitely recommend!"
1,Just started using them but they are really comfortable and the sound quality is very good. Love the case which keeps them from tangling and keep the extra earpieces convenient. Will give them a real test on a long flight next week! Anxious to see how the battery holds up.
0,"I just bought this headphone one week ago and I have used it 2 times and the rewind button does not work. The forward button has no problem but I cannot rewind the song or back to the previous, which make very annoying the use of this headphone.<br />UPDATE: This headphone is very uncomfortable to use, I have to adjust it to my ears all the time. The sound is relatively good but nothing of bass so it is very acute sound.<br />So if you really like good quality sound for your music to motivate you for your workout or running. Do not buy this.<br />Again, The rewind button stop working after the second use."
1,"A solid investment for those looking for wireless headphones. They look good and are light in my ears, terrific for exercising."
0,"This headphone skipped/static a lot, I returned it and bought a old wire headphone that work great"
1,The best head phones I've ever had I get about 10 hrs of straight listening time  sound is good the noise cancellation is good the controls are easy the ear piece is esaly adjustable and for the price and all the extra things you get included you can't beat it  plus they have a 1 year warranty so if something goes wrong between now and then I just send them back and get another pair
1,great earbuds
1,"Decent sound, but having buttons in your ear means you'll really hear the click."
1,"I ordered 2 headsets, yours and another. I think they are great. Good sound and very comfortable. The microphone feature is great too."
1,"It works fine but not as I expected. It's good for the price but the connection is not that good. For example, if you got the phone in your pocket and you're working out that's for sure that you're going to miss the signal. But it's ok."
1,"These earbuds are amazing! I am so happy! They sound like $300 headphones and they were so easy to connect on Bluetooth! The true test for me is In the Air Tonight by Phil Collins......first song I played and they were rocking! Great bass, great sound and no hum!"
1,"I bought these to listen to music while I run. I am very happy, I have even used them for a few phone calls and the other party seemed happy with the audio quality on the receiving end."
1,Very good product. I got one more set for my wife and we both very happy with it.
1,"Started great! Fits ok, sound quality was pretty good and stays in the ear. After a few weeks the left side stopped working properly. You can hear the sound but very low. Can't figure out how to fix it. It started after an intense workout where I was sweating."
0,"After 2 months of use, (and not daily) it stop working, unfortunately, I can not recomend it"
1,"Great earbuds, only need the volume up about half to hear perfectly. Does great canceling out background noise."
1,"Great headphones, especially for the price. I wanted something I could workout in without breaking the bank, I invested in an even cheaper pair prior to purchasing the senso ones and was totally unsattisfied. These headphones have killer sound quality and most of the time I don't even have the sound turned up all the way. Overall they're great, stay in, sound good and the charge last!"
1,Just got my Senso Bluetooth headset. So far so good. It's just day 1 but I really like them. The price caught my attention plus the reviews. Shipping was great also.
1,Good set of headphones for the gym.
1,For the price they are very good<br />The set up was simple
1,"I have always had problems with earbuds staying in place. Imagine Dumbo and Yoda having child, those are my ears.<br />When using the memory foam buds these don't budge, whether I'm lifting, running it doesn't matter they stay in place. And the sound is FANTASTIC. They cancel so much noise I have to warn my spouse I'm wearing them so she doesn't sneak up behind me and give me a heart attack. I like the sound so much I re-watch old action movies I've already seen on my phone with these headphones because the sound is so dynamic it actually makes the movie more enjoyable. Highly recommend."
1,All I can say is Fatastic! The quality and performence of these phones as well as the ease of setup are simply remarkable considering the price
1,So far it has worked pretty well.
0,I bought it for my sister and she used it for 3 months it works well but after that battery problem started and one side of the bluetooth completely stopped working. Not at all worth to buy. I will never recommend this to anyone.
1,"These headphones work great! I've had them for a couple weeks now and the deffenitly stand up to the test. I've worked out wearing them without any problems. I sweat a lot and it's hard to find good Bluetooth headphones that stay in. These come with different ear attachments, your able to find the best one that fits you. The sound quality is really good, with other blue tooth head phones I would get static from time to time but these worked great!"
1,"So, I've taken them running a few times and I've noticed a few things<br /><br />1) the packaging is great. Nice box and carrying case. The charger and cablend are also nice<br /><br />2) very comfortable<br /><br />3) easy to use<br /><br />4) in between songs the wind noise is a little annoying but won't kill you.<br /><br />5) I don't know why but my right ear bud is quite a bit quieter than the left. I wonder if it's a settings thing or just a weak speaker from the factory"
1,Headphones are great. Easy to setup and the sound is amazing. Very pleased with the purchase.
1,Absolute great headphones and customer service is extremely great and efficient. Wouldnt recomend anything else.
1,"For the price these are nice earphones. The bonus carrying case is really handy. One reason I purchased these specific earphones was the red/orange foam earbuds that were highlighted in a couple of the videos. I find the typical earbuds don’t fit well and I like the form-fitting foam buds better. However, no foam earbuds came with my earphones. In addition, the Magnetic car vent cell phone mount and the Mobile phone wallet Bonus Items shown in the product description were not included."
1,Purchased these headphones in May and absolutely loved them. I work outside all day and they help up quite well. At the end of July they all of the sudden stopped charging. I contacted Senso support and within 3 emails (which were responded to immediately at any hour) I have my replacement set in my hands.<br /><br />Great customer support!!
1,I really like the Senso wireless headphones so far.  I have really small ears and at first the headphones seemed like they would not work for me but after putting on the 'small' plugs they seem to work good.  They work well in blocking out other sounds while listening to my music and have stayed in my ears during my workouts (and I do a lot of cardio and sweat quite a bit).  Customer service seems friendly and interested in helping with any concerns I may have.
1,"Extremely nice product loaded with features, accessories and sounds great. Great price compared to similar head phones."
1,"Fits ears well, clear sound and charge lasts a long time."
1,These were much better than I expected. They were easy to pair and have a great sound for working out. Very comfortable. I have not yet made a call to se if there is feedback like some headphones
1,These things have great sound and good battery life; shocked the price is so low. I do get some glitches in the music if the top of my phone is pointed st the headphones... I just keep the phone pointed a different direction and it works great!
1,I use these with my iPhone to listen to Audible books while I take the dog for a walk. I like that they are stereo. I think listening to books or music with these is more enjoyable than using my Bluetooth headset (that fits in only one ear). They work well and it was easy to pair them. They come with a nice case and a few other accessories as well. Recommended.
0,Having trouble keeping on ear when sweating or when moving head. Maybe needs adjustment. New to these things. Maybe I have goofy ears. Will comment later on final thoughts and possible upgrade. I am back and have reduced my rating.  1..Mistake Bought two sets without trying. 2.. microphone horrible. Must change to phone when on call 3.. WILL NOT remain in place. Wire connecting the two speaker devices drags on neck and speakers continually come off ears<br />Sound quality tolerable. Battery Life outstanding.
1,This is the third pair I have bought so the family all has there own!
1,"First off this kit comes very complete with a nice usable case, extra bud cushions in a few sizes, cords, 12V car plug.  It is a good value and hold a charge well.  It connects easily and controls are logical.<br /><br />Why three stars then?  1) sound is not nearly as loud or sharp as standard (wired) Apple ear buds.  Part of that has to do with fit and we all have different ear shapes but no size cushion improved this too well.<br /><br />2) too bulky to fit under a ski helmet, bicycle helmet. I wouldn’t even try a motorcycle helmet, though fortunately I have an expensive Sena intercoms/speaker for motorcycle.  I love skiing with music but these are way to thick for even a minute under a helmet.  Not even close.<br /><br />For gym use or general use these are good."
1,Very comfortable. Only took seconds to pair the Bluetooth.
1,When it pocket the Bluetooth connection is lost
1,"Great for the price, come with several different ear bud sizes.  Would definitely purchase again.  Good battery life, also."
1,Easy and comfortable. Connects in seconds and have reasonable sound quality. I Recommend.
1,"Arrived  promptly. Well packaged. Very satisfied w/ the  sound.  Nice range from highs, midtones and bass.<br />The are also very light and comfortable."
1,"These buds are incredible!  They stay put during vigorous workouts and the sound is crystal clear.  The only negative is that the wire tie wasn’t included in the box; however, with one call to SENSO, I was assured that they would be in the mail to me soon. I will definitely be referring this company to friends/family!"
1,The ear pieces on the headphones are super comfortable. They look sharp and work great!
1,"Good headphone, poor microphone"
1,"Quality product, great sound and works great for phone calls when driving. Very pleased"
0,This product is not very good.  The headphones don’t even last through my time at the gym and are really hard to find my iphone.  I don’t recommend them.  Went in to return them as they are brand new but the window is closed to return them.
1,"Fine for the price, but they have alot of interference, and when you're running you can really hear the wind as it goes past your ears.  Also even though it says it can pair to two devices, that makes it short out and have worse audio quality -- I would only pair one."
0,"Work well for the price, far better than the ear buds purchased in the past.  Would give 5 stars, but reserve that for items found to be spectacular.<br />Started cutting in and out within 3 weeks of purchase and have become useless. Diffinitly not worth the money"
1,I am really impressed with the Senso Active Buds. Sound quality and noise cancellation is excellent.  These are on par with Beats if not better and much cheaper with the price.  Highly recommend this product.
1,"Great ergonomics, good listening quality. 3 stars because the actual microphone and speaking capabilities on my set are garbage.  People can't hear me speak, sounds like I'm in a tunnel."
1,"Excellent Wireless Headphones, these work great.  I use them while working out! Couldn't be happier with my purchase and the company's follow up after I received my headphones,  would definitely buy from this company again."
1,"They are very comfortable, I have a small head and they fit great, I love the case and extra accessories that come with it. Haven't tried the battery life yet but so far so good"
1,This is a steal. Packed generously with accesories and the sound is LOUD! I couldn't ask for more in a pair of bluetooth headphones. So glad I didn't shell out for Jaybirds. These were perfect for running. Im going to buy for my.whole family.
1,bought these for my husband ... he likes them.
1,"I am very happy with these earbuds...wonderfully priced with clear, powerful sound!  I am also really pleased with the additional items included within this shipment (car charger, additional earbuds, case, etc.)"
1,It's just okay !
1,Great for  6 months;<br />Everything was great for 6 months. Now only getting 2 hours of battery. 1st service support answered in 24 hours then when solution they offered was not working they did not answer emails any more.Not happy.
0,I charge this headphones 100% and when I used them the battery life was low like about 45min of used in almost high volume.<br />Also the Bluetooth distance is very short
0,"Music constantly cuts in and out. Based on the other reviews perhaps this is an issue only with mine. Regardless, Ill be sending mine back"
1,"love these. sound is fantastic, easy to use. stays charged for awhile. just wish that when you change songs, you can double click the button, instead of holding it down."
1,"I think it needs a better microphone so that people on the other end of the line can hear me, clearly.  Otherwise it's a good product."
1,"I really like the headphones so far, pretty good sound and they seem like the best wireless headphones out there. Great  wireless headphones for the price. I just regret not getting a different color, I don't like The red ones that I got. Not sure if I can return them for a different color though :("
1,"These headphone/earbuds are fantastic!  Workout 6x a week and these have been great.  I no longer have those durn long running wires in my way going from my old ear buds to my phone on a holder on a treadmill, bike or dangling on my body.  And the sound??...What wonderful crystal clear sound with awesome deep almost surrounding bass!!!  I could never imagine music ever coming to be sounding like this and so much easier to listen to and enjoy now using Bluetooth.  I can see using these even when mowing, working around my home or walking at the park.  Oh, and the added protective needed case and accessories is such a wonderful added plus!  Thanks so much Invotek!!!"
1,They are very comfortable. The sound is clear and they stay in place while I am working out
1,"Does what it’s supposed to do, but too big to hold on to the ears..."
1,these are hands down the best wireless headphones i have ever used
1,"Hard to find decent Bluetooth behind the head headphones these days. These are loud, easy to wear, and exactly what I was looking for. I am going to buy a couple more."
1,Very happy with not just the sound quality but the ease of use and how comfortable they are.  Also like the design of the charger smart two in one would recommend to anyone whose looking for headphones that not only sound great but stay in your ears.
1,"Arrived timely. Great product. My 14 year son wears them constantly, and the charge holds for<br />Quite some time:"
1,"Great headphones, only complaint is the rubber covering the charger port, hard to get off in order to charge the headphones, maybe that's just me.<br />The accessories that they provide with this are excellent, even comes with a car magnetic vent clip.<br /><br />I'm impressed and you will be also."
1,These work great. Fit well and have great sound. Stay on your ears well when moving.
1,I was blown away with these....and so were my ears. The volume has to be turned WAY down. These are loud. That's a good thing....better too loud than not loud enough. You definitely have enough room for the hard of hearing. They're headphones anyone can use. I would seriously monitor these with a child. They could damage their hearing. The audio quality is great.
0,Constant static in the Bluetooth connection if you touch your earbuds buds to adjust the volume or change song it would break up.<br />Use these on an 8 Mile Run and constantly kept having to put them back in my ear the over-the-ear connection was so weak it would not hold them in place. With the reviews the earbuds received on Amazon I was hoping for a lot more. Return them for a refund.
1,"So far I am very pleased. Had bought some LG headphones paying over $100 dollars and within a year they quit working and I never was really pleased with their sound. Then I found these SENSO blue tooths for around $30 and they have 10 times better sound and fit great in the yea without the bulky retractable thing the LG's had. You hardly know you have this things on , and did I mention they sound great?? Even if they don't last I am only out $30 instead of $100. Very much in my opinion a good buy. You don't have to spend a fortune to get quality."
1,Very good product! Functions as described! Overall functionality of this product performs well. I am greatly appreciative for this product to arrive on-time and without delay. Packaging & overall product presentation is clean and concise. Product arrived new and without any defects. Highly recommend seller!
1,Buen producto
1,"Great headphones...  Using them right now during my workout.  Fit comfortably, great sound, clear, crisp and sharp with excellent bass and treble sound.  Feel like I'm at a symphony."
1,Very nice ear buds. The sound is really good and the battery seems to last a long time. These are perfect for exercising and running
1,Great headphones!  A fantastic price with lots of cool extras.  Great sound and easy to use.
0,They came broken and would not power on.
0,"Pros:<br />-Audio quality is pretty good. Decent bass/mids/highs, but the bass is really only there when the ear buds are in there securely... more on that later.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The over the ear hooks do absolutely nothing. They're way too big so they hover above my ear when the buds are in place.  Also they're made of really floppy rubbery material, so I doubt they'd do much to hold them securely if the were touching my ears.<br />-On a similar note, they don't stay in my ears. I tried all the different tips and they would just slide out after a second even when I was just sitting still at my desk. I returned them before actually using them for running, since they wouldn't stay in my ears while not moving.<br />-So the audio quality is pretty good when listening to music... for the most part. During silence there is a soft hissing sound which is pretty annoying, but becomes super annoying when listening to audiobooks/podcasts since it's always noticeable.  If you're just listening to music the audio sounds pretty good."
1,got it as a gift for my friend and he loved it
1,"I've used these for a while now and can recommend the product.  I've never had a blue tooth device that could hold up the amount of sweat I produce until now.  In fact, they recently went through the washing machine.  My wife brought them to me and said if they still worked to order her a pair.  I charged them up and have been using them for a couple weeks now (since the washing) without a single problem so I just ordered a pair for my wife."
1,"Extremely pleased with this headset. It definitely exceeded my expectations considering the price of the headset. You just can't beat the price in my opinion. Put them in your ear, connect to your phones Bluetooth and just jam away. Whether you're working out or at a construction site, you will not hear anything around you. Leaving you between working out and your music or working and your music. If you keep the volume at its lowest you'll still hear what's going on outside of your headset, otherwise, crank that puppy up and zone out the world. Has some decent bass to it too, not insane bass but enough to get your body moving to the beat. Just love this headset. Did I mention it's water resistant? Don't remember what the description mentions about water but I'm sure you cannot submerge it in water and expect them to work. What I can review is that I've sweated profusely with these on with no issues. I've gotten rained on several times and still going. I purchased these about 6 months ago and waited to write a review as I do with all products to give it time to do its job. Just can't work without these headphones anymore, I got spoiled with these!!"
1,They're easy to use and have so much more bass than others I have purchased. I had no idea how much sound I was missing out on.
0,"I really liked these, brought two.  Yet after a couple of weeks the micro USB socket would no longer charge these headphones.  A close (10X) inspection showed a bent pin, not fixable given no space for access.  I ended up with 4 of this design in total; 3 stopped charging for to micro USB failure, on one the push button mechanism (soldered on the board) had broken. I can only blame the manufacturer so much; micro USB sockets fail all the time, yet those on phones will last 18-24  months so better compoments are available."
1,These headphones are awesome what a deal I love them.  No problems with perspiration sound as good as the day I bought em.
1,If you throw out style then it does what it does but it’s pretty bulky. Try not to lay on you side with the ear phone as it gets really uncomfortable really quick.
1,l like it!
0,"2 months after buying these they gave out on me. I don't do any crazy activities while I listen to my headphones. I showered with them which was the main reason i got them sense they are &quot;waterproof&quot;. Once again a couple months a bam they're completely dead, no charging, nothing. Don't waste your money"
1,Nice to of earphones
1,"I wont leave a lengthy boring review.<br /><br />Short and sweet: These are the best sub 30$ headphones i've tried. Better than many 100$'s like Sony, Koss(these are good too), Skull Candy.<br /><br />After a brief issue with bass distortion, I factory reset the headphones and they were so much better. They have great mid range sound quality, decent to acceptable high's. The base is responsive though not superb. If you set the headpones correctly, you can get respectable base. I listen to all types of music: Rap, Electronica, and yes, even kids bop. Sound reproduction is again, decent. They are loud, which is important to me.<br /><br />As to being noise cancelling, I cant say they are 100% cancelling but they do block a decent amount of ambient sound. Granted I work in an IT customer service environment so I dont get the really loud sounds from a factory, motors, etc.<br /><br />While not an audiophile, I've always prided myself on knowing how to equalize my music for the best output and clarity. If your a true audiophile, you wouldn't even be looking here so I can safely say, for all of you who want a good response BT headphone, this is really a set you should consider. I will update my review when I go biking and expose the headphones to real world scenarios.<br /><br />Happy purchasing."
1,Although they were great at the beginning anfter a few months sound started to get destorted and out of the blue I would drop calls all the time.  Always kept them in the protective pouch and out of the blue the charge does not work and they don’t charge even with a different cable. I guess you get what you pay for
1,It is hard to believe this great deal until you receive it. It is a great bluetooth for the price and it comes with a lot of great accessories. I was going to buy Beats headphone but I did some research and thought it would be waaaay cheaper to buy this and the Sony Headphone Model #MDRXB450AP than buying one very expensive Beats Headphone. So I did that and I am very satisfied with my purchases. I now use this great SENSO Bluetooth Headphones and when it needs to get recharge I use my Sony Headphone. Both great prices and works great. You will not be disappointed if you go with this one. Works just like the expensive headphones and it comes with warranty!<br /><br />7/7/2017 Review: My headphone stopped working yesterday unfortunately and it's probably the result of using it all day everyday. The best thing is I called their customer service and they were very helpful and very willing to send me a replacement because of the one year warranty. Thank you for making great products and for your exceptional customer service!<br /><br />Update July 29 2021: I am still using the replacement I was sent when my first one stopped working on 7/7/2017. I can't believe how it is still working with my 3 years old throwing it around and playing with it all the time. I am here to buy another one. You can't beat this price and how good it works.
1,"Decent sound quality, but the music cuts in and out sometimes, which shouldn't happen when my head is two feet from my phone."
1,These earphones are terrific. I usually don't like earphones with these types of plugs to the ear but this brand is an anomaly. I definitely recommend these!
1,I bought these headphones four years ago when I was training to run a marathon (they did perfectly for it) and I just found them in an old box after not using them since and they are still fully charged!! I’ve never had any kind of electronic device hold a charge without use for that long and will be using these regularly now. I was looking for them because my AirPods Pro keep falling out of my ears and I never had that problem with these headphones. And for only $24! The sound quality obviously isn’t beats but these are workout headphones and it gets the bass through just fine. LOVE THEM SO MUCH
1,"Headphones were great for the first couple of months.  Then I had a problem. My first email to support was returned with troubleshooting instructions in 10 minutes (on a Sunday Evening no less).  The instructions didn't solve the problem, so I sent a follow-up.  That email was returned in 5 minutes with an offer to send a replacement."
1,"Trouble pairing.... its a hit and miss, good sound though"
0,"I received a pair of these as a gift. For about a year, they worked great. I would use them at work to listen to music during the day. They've always had issues staying connected, but sort of expected for a $20 pair of headphones. The sound quality was actually surprisingly good! But now, I can barely get a few minutes out of them before they disconnect and become unresponsive. When they do work, they make a bunch of random beep sounds whenever the volume is low. Not sure if it's a battery issue or outdated technology, but these headphones are now worthless. Glad I didn't pay for them myself!"
1,"The sound is pretty good but there is a constant static sound in the left earpiece. I read in some of the other reviews that this is an issue. The connection is also a little choppy, which is odd when I was holding my phone in my hand while using the earbuds. It seems to work fine with my computer, considering returning if these issues continue. A plus is that they fit small ears. The ear loops don't do much but the earbud still stays in place. The base and sound is good if you drown out the static but I don't like my music that loud."
1,Product received super quick. Directions were easy to follow (and I am not a technical person) so quickly could pair them to my iPhone. Charging was also quick and the clarity was great! I thought they held securely on my ears as well which was my motivation. Comfortable too. Would buy again...although I hope these last a long time:)
1,"I have recently bought my Senso headphone, I like the product quality, plus features are simply awesome!"
1,Awesome!!!!!
0,"You get what you pay for. If you don't mind one earbud not working or just barely working then these are for you. Took them out of the box, charges them and within the first hour of listening to Pandora, the left ear went silent. Not happy"
1,"I love these in every way except one: Range. That could be my expectations, that maybe it's standard. Maybe I'm asking too much. But I would like to be able to walk a few rooms away without losing connection. But they sound great, which is the most important thing. I would definitely buy these again."
1,"Pleased with these. Sound quality is good,The case is nice.Very professional seller,thanks."
1,Came with a USB-C charging cable... Uses a standard micro USB cable to charge. Kind of annoyed.
1,"This is my first of this product and I am loving it. So, far I have no issues and it works like a charm."
1,Excelente product
0,Worked really well for less than 6 months before sounding terrible. Never max out the volume but now they're all static while music is playing. Really disappointed
0,Bought these headphones because my more expensive pair stopped working and didn’t quite want to shell out the money again. The sound quality of the headphones is fantastic and the battery life can last me a couple days of workouts before needing recharged.<br /><br />My biggest complaint about the headphones is the part that hang over top of your ears. The plastic isn’t malleable like the part is with the more expensive headphones. So while I’m running or doing anything with a jumping motion they always fall off my ear. I contacted support and they suggested switching ear plug pieces which I had already done.<br /><br />Overall you pay what you get I guess.
1,"I'm pretty much just repeating what is being said over and over here, these are a great deal and you can't go wrong buying them. I love them, and I bet you will too."
1,"I use this all the time while working out, so far the battery lasts. I've had a problem with a previous one where it died out on me because of the battery.<br />The only thing i'd change with this is the notifications when the battery is low. I'd rather it tell me when I have an hour left than when it's less than 20 min. Usually I just can't get it charged on the fly."
1,Love love love them. They are way worth more than I paid for them. I am a runner and active during the day at work and it all works great. The microphone is clear and music/ audio books are amazing to hear. Only thing I have as a con is the rubbery ear things are a lil big for my ears but hey that could be my fault for having small eats.
1,The quality of the sound is good enough for blue tooth headphones.  My only complaint is that the ear hooks are very soft and really are not substantial or firm enough to keep the buds in your ear if you are exercising.
1,"I have only used the Senso bluetooth headphones twice since I ordered them, but so far I am loving them.  I have used them for running on an indoor track and outside on a windy day.  The headphones are comfortable with the silicone ear pieces.  I have small ear canals, so I have a difficult time finding ear phones/headphones that fit into my ear and stay throughout my entire work up. With the Senso bluetooth headphones, I did not have to readjust the headphones nor did they fall out at any time during my workout. The sound is good quality.  Coincidently, my husband bought the same headphones just a few day before I purchased mine.  We both have had good experiences so far."
1,The sound quality is great.  There is an echo on the mic when talking on the phone.  I'm very happy with the overall performance of the ear buds. I like so much I bought my son a pair of them.
1,They work most of the time good. From time to time you might have connectivity issues.
1,Great for a while then about 6 months into use battery totally died and would never take a charge again
1,"Great fit, easy to pair. Sound quality is really good and outstanding for the price.  Better to best battery life."
1,great product
1,I have used these only a couple of times on my shorter runs (5 miles) but so far they are much more comfortable and stay in compared to my fancy Sony sports Bluetooth pair (which don't stay in at all).  The sound quality is a little less but still very decent and I would rather wear these.
1,"Granddaughter loves these. She can dance like no one is watching and sweat and is no longer tethered to her devices.  Great sound, and holds a decent charge."
1,these are my favorites and will buy again...quality sound and easy to connect!
1,Just received the e-mail from this company (was lost in cyberspace) and they are sending remainder to items even though &#34;bonus&#34; has changed.  Thank you so much for assisting and I am updating my rating to five stars as the earbuds seems to be working great for the person receiving this gift.
1,"The earbuds have great sound and are extremely comfortable to wear with the red tips that are made like an ear plug. They are not noice canceling. The only other issue I have experienced is with skipping. Once I disconnected and reconnected them the issue has not happened again. Over all, I am<br />Very pleased with the earbuds."
1,"I've had them for a few months, mostly used in gym. Quality of the sound, Bluetooth connection and battery are all very good. Price is definitely reasonable for this quality"
1,"Very pleased with delivery turn around and especially pleased with the high quality of the sound. I now hear sounds in music--instruments, notes--that I never heard before. I'm also pleased with the fit."
1,Comfort and use. Thanks.
1,"Easy to Pair, good for workouts. Alot louder than i would expect. i need to turn my phone on mid volume instead of high to listen with these headphones. I like that....then i don't feel so old"
1,"Nice packaging, good fit and good for music.  Not so good when speaking on the phone.  I pair the headset with a new iPhone7, the caller on the other side keeps hearing an echo.  This happened to several callers.  I had to return my headset, but like I said, this headphone WAS good for music.  BTW, the Customer Service team was excellent and helping me with my issues."
1,"I work out for about an hour at the gym  & am soaking wet by the time I'm done, these headphones work great even while getting wet! Also very comfortable!"
1,"These headphones are comfortable and very easily synched with my bluetooth-enabled Kindle Fires.  There is a new kind of fun and freedom in being able to listen to my Audible books, or music, or podcasts, without having to carry the Fire or force others to also listen to what I am hearing while doing so.  I have both hands available to do other things and I do not have to worry about the earbuds falling out of my ears and getting lost."
1,The headphones work great . The sound is clear and vibrant.  I was very surprised by the quality of the sound . I thought because the product is relatively inexpensive that I would not have the range of sound that you get from these headphones. My only complaint is that the microphone is not the best. I was told that my voice sounded like a speaker phone from across the room. I use the headphones for going to the gym or going on walks. If the headphones had a microphone on the wire it would be much stronger. I am going to look into that to see if send so makes this type of product. I highly recommend these headphones because the quality of the sound is excellent and the price is just as good
1,Great headphones especially for running!!
1,Will be getting another for my wife. I wish that there was an app. For them so they can say the name in my contacts not just a number.
0,"When I had them they were good. But they broke after like a month. You can shower with them which is nice and the battery life and the sound quality are both really good. Especially for the price. However, this 1 star review comes because even though I purchased a 3 year warranty on them neither the company or Amazon will give me a replacement for my broken ones.<br /><br />I shouldn't have to be out $30+ (they were more expensive when I bought them compared to what they are now) because they don't want to honor the agreement I paid for. If this wasn't an issue this would be at least 4 stars for the time I had them. But with all the problems I've been having trying to either get my money back or a new replacement pair, 1 star."
1,This is what I have been waiting for. Can exercise and hear what I am playing.
1,Sound great. Exceed expectations.
1,I love these headphones. I work in a very oily environment and ordered these headphones because they are waterproof. I was not expecting the great sound and bass too. The battery life will get me through about 9 hrs of listening to podcasts on mid volume.
1,"Great sound!! A little difficulty pairing at first to IPhone but after a few tries, all is well!!!"
0,"Incredibly bass heavy. I listen to every other type of music genre and i found these headphones to be so bass heavy that it distorts the vocals. I'm not sure if there's a break in period but with songs with a lot of bass, it sounds so bad."
1,Amazing product for the money and a email from an owner if you keep this up you will not be struggling small business people much longer thanks for a great product
1,"Obviously not the sound quality of the Bose I had, but decent!  Great for the gym. Stay in place and sweat doesn't bother them."
1,"This was/is an ok set of headphones. I've owned quite a few pairs of bluetooth headphones. The major drawbacks of these is the crazy amount of EQ required to support these headphones. Bass is WAY overdone and requires you to EQ the bass out, which then sucks for everything else you listen to. When your phone connects to the car and you listen to bluetooth music on your phone, there is no bass because you already toned it out.<br /><br />Once it is EQ'd, the sound quality is just ok. Jaybirds, Bose, etc all have superior sound quality, but this thing is half the price.<br /><br />The mini USB jack is somewhat hard to open, so don't cut your fingernails. The light to tell you whether or not it is charging is basically invisible.<br /><br />They do fatigue your ears (physically) after about 2 hours.<br /><br />Battery life is good and they seem to fit well in the ear. Though they should have done something a little more obvious to show which one goes on what ear. They are new to me, but I'm constantly looking for the one with the tiny buttons to see that it goes in my right ear.<br /><br />The only other thing to note is be careful with what you have paired. This device WILL pair with multiple devices at one time and when it does, the sky will begin to fall. It will have 0 range, cut out a lot, and be pretty much useless."
1,"Great headphones for general purpose news, but if you are an avid runner that does track work or any type of speed interval running ... or if you just go running on a windy day, I would not recommend these have a lot of wind noise. Anything faster than a 6:30 pace for me and I have too much wind noise on even a calm day for it to be enjoyable. Fine for slow runs, otherwise..."
1,For the price these are pretty decent. The bass is almost non existent but otherwise has a good loud sound. Not the most comfortable but still failu comfortable. I only wore them about 30 min but I would say these are the best I've tried in this price range.<br />If they found a way to provide deeper tones I'd give it 5 stars
1,"So I like to throw mine into the washing machine because who takes electronics out of their sweaters before cleaning there clothes?? Anyways, THEY STILL WORK! It’s a miracle! Love these headphones!"
1,The headphones exceeded my expectations as far as the sound quality! Iam very pleased my only complaints is that that fall out of my ears very easily because of soft plastic around the ear buds but other that i would definitely recommend them as a great buy and product
1,I have had three sets of these. The usually last me about a year. But that is using them 12 hours a day in a extremely dirty weld shop!! I like them!
1,"So far they are working great, it sometimes stutters when the headphones are connected via Bluetooth however I turn them on and off again and the problem fixes itself. Overall it's a great product."
1,Works great for the price
1,Great sound and functionality.
0,it's not very comfortable and always came out...like it was too heavy.
1,"Just took them on a trip.  So much better than wired headphones.  Great sound, comfortable, and easy to pair and use."
1,Extremely nice headset.  Fits well with great sound. I am very pleased.  Excellent customer service.
0,They stop functioning in less than three weeks.
1,Great product works as described and complete with all parts was fantastic packaging
1,Clear sound and loud.
1,"To preface, I never write reviews. I wanted to try wireless headphones for my new iPhone.<br />I looked at several wireless headphones and it was a challenging choice because each mfg says what they think you want to hear ( which as we know, is usually far from the truth ).<br />Bottom line, I decided on these because of the reviews and price point.<br />I just received these tonight and followed the simple instructions to pair and WOW!<br />I was expecting to be disappointed but these are bass heavy, sound canceling, fit snug in your ears and stay there, really great wireless headphones!<br />Nice job SENSO! Finally a product that lives up to expectations<br /> Very happy. Would definitely recommend."
1,very happy with them! they cancel all the other noise
1,Quick and easy setup.  Great quality for the price.
1,They fit great with great sound. They stay in place no matter what activities I am doing.
1,Nice product
0,"It only works for a month, and then die!!!!<br />The sound is flat. not bad, but not great."
1,"Very pleased with the performance of these Bluetooth headphones.  The noise cancellation is solidly effective, the Bluetooth range allows me to have my phone in my bag while I'm out walking and there are no audible dropouts, like I experienced with another brand.  Love the small round case too.  A happy customer!"
1,Great sound very good quality.
0,"Will not charge, will not turn on after 2 weeks. I used these a handful of times and now they're duds. Such a shame too because the sound quality was pretty damn good. Too bad I can't review a working product."
1,Love the sound quality and people have no problems hearing me when I call them.  I have had some feature failures on the headphones and called Senso support about it and they did some troubleshooting and then replaced them.  Good customer service!
0,"Had for two months and now getting random ""powering off"" and not turning back on even though my phone is saying they're at half battery or more. Charged overnight and then held the power button while charging to factory reset and got it again."
1,Great product and very good service!
1,"I love them use them all day for work , 10 hour day charge them for at least 30 minute's before going to the gym, they stay in place sound is great!! happy with purchase :)"
1,Using Husband Account: I love these... I could not live without them!!!!!
1,Great sound and long battery life. Fair price. Does not disappoint!
1,Not fit well
1,"For its price, it does the job well."
1,I bought these for my husband and he loves them.They are great quality. the price for the quality was amazing.
1,"Great sound, functionality ++, good battery life, great price and value. Wide variety of ear size adapters. This is the 2nd pair that I have owned. 1st set stopped functioning after about 2 1/2 months. Senso immediately sent me a replacement with no hassle. New set is going on 2 months old now and still love them."
1,THese headphones r legit. No need to spend hundreds of dollars!! However... I got these in July and it's September and they are starting to malfunction.  They are not connecting to Bluetooth every time and seem to be dying!!! I'm going to try and send them back and see if I can get another pair.. they were great for first couple months.
1,"For the price it's amazing. I accidentally threw them in the washer and still worked perfectly fine. You can't play with your equalizer settings or it will sound distorted. I love how quickly it charges, came with its travel pouch.  A complaint I have is when it's about to die, constantly saying battery low. Also how it dies when it's at 20% in battery life but it's worth the price. Better than the earphone an iPhone comes with."
0,"Headphones work great if your mp3 player is six inches away and your not moving. While walking my dog each afternoon I use them, every time I turn my head the sound cuts out.  Haven't used them for phone calls yet?"
0,Uncomfortable in ears. Good sound though
1,"very nice fit, pretty good noise cancelling. Great price!"
1,"I've been looking for wireless headphones for a while and I'm so glad I purchased these! They fit perfectly into my ear and the sound quality is really great!  I also like that the its last about 8 hours before you have to charge it again. I've paired it with over 3 devices already.  If you don't want to deal with a wire attached to your device anymore, then this is the product for you!"
1,"Bought 2 sets and gave them to the kids. Buying 2 more for my wife and me!!! We all love these headphones! Great fit, great sound, all-in-all, a 5 star product at a fair price!"
0,"These worked fine for about two months, then just stopped charging. Very disappointed, given the positive reviews on here."
0,"I might be the case like 1 in 10000. But the sound quality is really bad, like 50% worse than bose noise cancelling headset. And the sound is always too loud, even when you tune it to the lowest possible level, so either no sound or really loud. And the mic doesn't work. Huge huge disappointment, very very sad. So I returned it.<br /><br />The packaging is decent though, and they give you a lot of accessories, so I give it a two stars :)"
1,"Decent headphones for the price, mine work a majority of the time but I'll have some days where the button does not register and I'm left smashing it for several minuted to turn it on or off. I also like to have one on at a time but the weight of the free one pulls the piece you have on."
1,Working great.
1,"I've only had them a few days but they are the best sounding earbuds I've had. They are comfortable in the ear and lightweight. The controls are on the earbuds themselves, not like some that have them on the wire which then pulls on the earbuds. I have no problems with them when walking my dog mowing the lawn so far.  I have not run with them or biked yet with them but I do not see an issue arising doing those activities. Well worth the money."
1,"Pros<br />- battery lasts a while<br />- easy to use, intuitive design<br />- customer service top notch<br />Cons<br />- HQ is exaggerated, feel like I've gotten more power from a cheap pair of Skullcandys<br />- constant static feedback, drives me nuts, tried fixing it as suggested by their CS but still get a lot of buzz connected to any device"
1,Good sound and a quality build. The EQ is a bit bass heavy for my own taste but my wife loves them. The charge holds for a days. These headphones are well worth the money. Would buy again.
1,I'm very happy with my headphones the delivery was very prompt and there every thing they said they would be.  Very satisfied
1,So far they work great. I bought them so I could go fishing in the rivers and creeks without worrying about them getting wet. Everyone I have called using them said I sounded great. Also it was neat that the caller Id worked through the ear buds.
0,I've ordered these earbuds twice and in both case the earpiece fell off and exposed wires.  I could not recommend..
1,Great for the price only gripe is they can be a little cumbersome trying to get them seated in your ear with the little behind the ear plastic piece.
1,Awesome!
1,"***UPDATE 8/5/19***After receiving my refund in a timely manner, I tried several other types and brands of Bluetooth headphones. Then, I bought a second pair of the Sensos. I have since used them in the same conditions as the first pair over a dozen times and they have performed admirably. Had the first pair worked properly I might have considered a slightly higher rating. That said, I'm still enjoying their use after spending over a year with them.****<br /><br />I really like these headphones. They fit well and sound very good for the money. They are not audiophile quality by any means, but for what I paid they have decent bass. Mids and highs are a little better. Very livable and listenable sound. They fit comfortably and stayed on well, even during  strenuous activities. Buuutttt, when moving around they breakup a lot. With the phone in my cargo pocket less than 3 feet from the headphones and walking they are annoying due to the breakup. Same setup, but cutting or weed eating the grass, they are unlistenable for 20-30 second stretches of time. Tried them with phone and tablet. When sitting still, they sound great."
1,Great sound. They stay put while running which is impressive since I have small ears. Comes in a nice case to store and links up with my phone easily.
1,great sound and from a value standpoint fantastic
1,Work great and pretty inexpensive!
1,"These are very nice headphones for the gym and running. S<br />Sound quality is amazing.<br />They also have great customer service in case you need warranty service, as headphones come with warranty."
1,"I was very impressed with the packaging and it even included an extra charger, car port and carrying case! Haven’t used them yet, but will test them out once they are fully charged"
0,Lasted a week. This is my second pair first pair would not pair with my phone and now the second pair of just lasted a whole week so I've ordered I'm a different company will see how that one goes not pleased with this product at all
1,"Came with several different earbud sizes, charger as well as portable charger. Synced easily with multiple devices. Work great!"
1,"Love these headphones! I was looking for some wireless headphones to use while exercising and these work great! These stay in place and the sound is great. I usually do not have the volume turned up even halfway and it is loud and clear. I have used for running, jumping rope, and even while doing burpees and they stayed in place. So far, I have had to charge after using for 3-4 hours. Great buy!"
1,"Well packaged, fits comfortably and the sound is excellent. Very happy with them so far."
1,"First off, if you're buying Jaybirds just for the brand, you're wasting your money. If you're looking for an excellent set of work out headphones, you can't beat these. I used them all the time for running and lifting until one side of the ears stopped working. True to their statement, they have a great warranty and after I contacted them they were extremely helpful and even sent me a new pair after troubleshooting. Highly recommend!"
1,"Great sound, stay on your ears and pair easily with iPhoneX."
1,Great earbuds! They are comfortable and very user friendly. My only problem with them is I wish they had memory foam earbuds and a little better battery life. But nonetheless a great product for the price that I paid for them.
1,"I ordered 2 pair of these for my brother and myself since we needed new earphones. These were great. The sound was a nice deep sound that you could still hear the outside world. Easy to pair up, and fit nicely in the ear. Both my and my brother liked the product, him more since he’s a fitness junkie and they do the job right.<br />My complaint however, would be that the ear hooks were too big for my ear, so I sadly gave them to my dad."
1,"The battery lasts a really long time. It comes with a case, it charges fast and the sound is very clear. I bought two more as gifts.<br />It is worth every penny."
1,"battery doesn't last very long. after a while audio skips and blacks out.  On a full charge it plays very good, but for a short time."
0,"I originally purchased these headphones in April of 2017.  They were around $37 at the time.  Also purchased the Assurant Warranty that Amazon asked about (about $6 for 3 years of coverage).  The headphones worked great for many months.  I sweat a lot and they withstood the copious amount of sweat I generate.  The sound and volume controls were good as well.  (Not great, but heck, I am running in them, not using them to listen to music in the office.)<br /><br />One day in March of 2018 while I was out for a run the headphones just turned off.  I thought it might have been the battery that went out, so I tried charging them.  Nothing.  I contacted Senso support and they sent out a replacement pair under their 1 year manufacturer warranty.  I received the replacements in early April of 2018.<br /><br />Fast forward to June of 2018 and after charging the headphones, I go to use them.  They don't turn on.  I think that maybe the battery didn't charge, so I stick them back on and notice the little red indicator light doesn't come on.  I keep it plugged in and try to reset the headphones.  Again, nothing happens.<br /><br />While the first set of headphones lasted a long time, given the price, I am just disappointed the second set died so quickly.  (Not even 2 months since I received them.)  I wanted to give more stars to this product, but I just can't given that I have two dead pairs in under 14 months.  At least I can make a warranty claim, but I don't have high expectations for the replacements."
1,I love these ear buds.  They stay in and sound great!  Much better in my opinion than the Power Beats II that I paid $179 for and only lasted 9 months!!
1,"Package arrived from seller on time and in perfect condition. Immediately I opened and tried the Senso Bluetooth. First I put them on in did some head banging. To see how well they will hold when I do intensive gym training. They never came off.<br />I then turned them on to see how well they work. Needless to say. I was extremely amazed by the sound quality and volume.<br />Pros: Comfortable, light, loud and easy to connect.<br />Cons: None so far.<br />Still love them"
1,Wonderful product - I now own 2 pair :)
1,Bought these for my dad and he absolutely loves them! He says they're just as good as the more expensive competitors.
1,Excellent price for sound quality of much more expensive brands!
1,"I had bought other brands and seemed to have issues with connectivity and music cutting in and out. This brand headphone is comparable to the beats solo wireless. However, the Senso headphones I purchased have a slight edge up on the beats. The cost on comfortable wearing is great. I would highly recommend anyone who purchase from this company do so. If you are trying to save on cost value well worth it."
1,The sound is really excellent
1,"I've notice some interruptions on the sound, I'm not sure if it is a problem from my phone, but it happens often."
1,"I love these headphones better than my airpods. Battery life, skip and rewind, volume control. All excellent"
0,"• The earbuds are slightly too large (I use the smallest size on the (excellent) [[ASIN:B00K35ZF1Q Symphonized GLXY Premium Genuine Wood In-ear Noise-isolating Headphones with Mic and Nylon Cable (Ebony)]])<br />• The over ear part is too small, or maybe I'm just not using them right – either way they don't reliably keep the headphones on my ears<br />• The audio quality is pretty bad, including a slight high pitched whine, though maybe that's to be expected with bluetooth audio"
1,"Great headphones - three different size options for the earbuds, they stay put, good sound quality at a good price.  I would buy again."
1,"Work surprisingly well. Had them for about a month. Hold a good charge and easily last 7-8 hours. Sound quality is great. Can't beat the price. Love that they are sweat proof and have had no issues with them staying on my ears and I use them when working out, doing yard work, etc."
0,One of the earphones stopped working after a year. Getting sound only from one side. Poor quality. No way to request refund or exchange either.
1,Works and looks great. Very satisfied!!
1,I go through set headphones every three months so I can 100% tell you this is some of the best quality I have had in a while. The battery life and sound quality is awesome.
1,"Very good sound. Must have a fresh charge before I go to the gym though or I run the chance of running out of battery power. Other than that, a SUPERB pair of wireless earphones for a great price!"
1,Sound randomly cuts out.  Followed directions and reconnected pods.  Still occasionally cuts out.
1,I have never had the over the ear things.  Kinda clunky but good sound and they don't fall off.
1,"I am impressed with the sound quality of these headphones, particularly for the price.  Good bass and even sound across high/mid range.  The silicon loops over the ears really work well, keeping them in place when at the gym or jogging.  They replaced a set of wired earbuds because the wires were always in the way and the ear buds would come loose.  Overall very happy with this product."
0,"It took about 5 sec to response after I pressed on/off button. The charger port was broken after 3 month use. I contacted the seller. Although they agreed to send me a replacement, I have not received over one month. Super irresponsible. Never buy this product from this seller again."
0,Good sound. Flimsy ear grips and bad mic. Mic picks up too much background noise.
1,Very good headphones! They work just as well or better then beats headphones at a third the price and they give you a car charger and lightning cable with it. They are definitely worth the money and I highly recommend them!
1,I think the sound is great however the headphones are too big for my ears. Otherwise i loved them
1,My ear canal is too small to keep the headphones.<br />It is not a noise-cancelling headphones
1,Headphones are just ok.  I probably wouldn't buy them again. Curved piece that goes over the ear is flimsey and does not stay on if you have smaller ears. The piece that goes into your ear is fairly large and bulky.  Sound quality is moderate at best. I would have been better to pay more money and purchased the Beats. One aspect I do like is only having a thin cord around my neck.
1,I bought these for my wife and she loves them I thought about getting one for myself. Thanks.
1,Great to use at the gym! Love using them to run also!
1,"I've had these headphones for about 6 months and have certainly put them through their paces. The sound is very good and the fit, even while doing high intensity sprinting, is great. Obviously the value for these is phenomenal. Anyone paying $100 or more for earbuds would benefit from these greatly.<br /><br />Also, I had an issue with my pair in which I had to contact Senso customer support. Not only did they fix my issue immediately, but I had a replacement pair sent out to me within 20 minutes of first contact! Amazing. They absolutely stand behind their warranty."
1,"My better half received a pair of the &#34;beats&#34; for xmas. Wanted a pair, but not for 200$. Saw very high reviews on here and YouTube for this product. They have better bazar than their expensive competition. They are also more comfortable and stay on through workout. :-)"
1,My son has two pairs of these.  He said great headphone for the price.
1,"I have had a pair of these headphones for about a week now and I am pretty impressed. For the price, these things are really fantastic and absolutely worth the purchase. I've had no pairing issues and battery life has been quite a bit longer than expected.<br />For comparison purposes - I have had a few pairs of wireless headphones that ranged in price/quality: Jaybird X3s, Monster iSport Intensity, & Heydey Wireless Earbuds(Target house brand).<br />PROS<br />Sound Volume - Excellent. Way better volume vs Monster & Heydey, comparable to slightly better than Jaybird.<br /><br />Sound Quality - Good. For the price I would say the quality is good to great. I have read some reviews highly critical of the quality and I came up with a couple ideas as to why. 1. They are being compared to a higher quality pair of headphones that more than likely cost a lot more and are an unfair/unrealistic comparison.<br />2. The headphones are not being worn correctly. If you try to just gently put them in your earhole as opposed to wedging them in or I generally pull back the top of my ear with one hand and put the headphones in with the other. There is a HUGE difference in volume & quality if they are in your ear properly.<br />3. They are defective.<br />Quality was significantly better than Heydey, quite a bit better than Monster & a bit less than Jaybird.<br /><br />Product Quality - Excellent. This is the biggest one for me. I like the fact that the part that goes around your ear is not set, it is flexible and you can adjust it each time you put it on your ear. They came with a variety of different sized bud attachments, one even foam(I switched to the smallest buds which were difficult to put on but I like that because they won't fall off, which they haven't).  But what I like even more are the buttons for changing the sounds, power & connecting to other devices. The volume are these square, clicky buttons that seem very durable. The reason this is important to me is because I have found most wireless earphones like these have round button that can and often tend to stick. This happend to my Jaybird X3s which I absolutely loved but the power/call button is partially stuck pushed in and frequently activates Siri or redials. They buds on the Jaybirds would also fall off all the time, not the case with these.<br /><br />TLDR - If you are looking buy these, for the price they have excellent volume, good/great sound, and excellent overall quallity. I have owned a few pair of comparable headphones that ranged in price & quality(Jaybird X3, Monster iSport Intensity, Heydey Wireless). My overall ratings: SENSO - 8/10, Jaybird - 7/10, Monster - 4/10, Heydey - 1/10 (Side speakers broke in 2 weeks). BUY THESE!!!"
0,"I returned these headphones. Sound quality is poor and the ear hooks are too flimsy to be of use. Even at this price, I would not recommend these headphones."
1,I have these hooked up to the Bluetooth on the phone I keep on the motorcycle. They give me 12 hours of music and it's loud enough I can hear over the wind noise. Easy to use simple and basic. Perfect!
1,"Pro: The earbuds sounds good and has a pretty good battery life.<br />Con: bulky, ugly, tends to slip out of ear during intensive workout or run. No noise cancellation at all. &lt;==False claim there."
1,Great headphones! Excellent quality and very durable.
0,stopped working 2 months later. battery won't charge.
1,"Kenneth i purchased your product  as a replacement for a pair of bt head phones i got as a gift this past Christmas the latter was used twice a week at the gym and i shut them off when i was done and would not work again,after reading the reviews on your product i decided to give you a try i did get them set up and liked what i heard i will write a more in depth review once i have the chance to use them more<br />Thanks for reaching out"
0,Does not fit small ears and even with the different ear inserts was unable to get one that fit in my ear. Sound quality is good but not much adjustments available.
1,Good battery life. Great audio quality.
1,"Pretty clear sound, a pretty good deal so far!"
1,"After 3 months, my headphones stopped working without any traumatic damage. I e-mailed the seller and received a whole new set of headphones within 2 days. Although it was inconvenience to have my headphones break down, I am super impressed by the outstanding customer service and I highly recommend this product. I love my headphones and it was a bummer to not have them when going to the gym."
1,Got it fast.  Easy to use and pair. Great sound quality.
1,"These are my best headphones by far. They stay in my ear throughout my whole run, and has a really good sound."
1,Love them
1,"Great product. Very useful but, this is not sweat proof by any means. While km working out, the ear piece keeps sliding away from my ear and yes, I place it tight tight to my ears. Please fix and change the statement in the box until it is actually waterproof. Just saying."
1,Good product for the price
1,"Great product, delivered fast, just as advertised."
0,Overall I love love the headphones . Super comfy. Great price and good sound. I AM SUPER ANNOYED on how the packing was . I didn’t get the 2-in-1 charging cable that’s in the picture. It’s like don’t list a picture with stuff that’s not going to be in the box! Also the headphones charging cover was broken. Like wow. And not just that but I didn’t get the wire tie and the car charging adaptor cover was missing that says senso. Why ship a damaged product to a customer ? Luckily I was able to talk to amazon to help me.
1,Quick delivery. Lots of earbud sizes including foam. Came with a dual USB car charger and circular case. Good fit. Good sound. Stays in my ear.
1,Headphones work great. Great product to use at the gym.
1,Sweet!!!
1,These headphones are a great value for the money I spent. Good sound quality and long battery life. I use these headphones at the gym and they work great.
1,"These headphones are good but not great. When you turn it on there's a robot telling you that it's on and the same when you turn it off.<br /><br />There's a battery indicator that lets you know how much juice is left unlike MANY other products around this price range. I've literally had headphones where I had to guesstimate when to charge them<br /><br />Now on to the negatives which is a huge one. These headphones don't have an individual skip or replay button. You'd have to hold the volume + or - for 2 secs to skip or replay a song.<br />While on a treadmill, this is a disaster, running while have to skip a song is very inconvenient. Sometimes I'm holding the button for what seems like forever just to find a song that I like or one that gets me hyped.<br /><br />The past Bluetooth headphones had a skip/replay button so I could keep skipping songs until I find the &#34;one&#34;. With these, skipping 10 songs will take at least 20 seconds and not instantly like the other ones that I've had.<br /><br />I understand the minimalist/ lightweight approach but the skip and repeat button are vital"
1,"Easy setup, came with a variety of ear buds. Even ones that remind me of my shooting buds. They squish and then form great in my ear for my runs!"
1,"For the price that your paying, this is the best. They do the job and more. I bought four for family and they love it. I workout alot and sweat alot and they still work like if they were brand new!"
1,I’m disappointed that the bonus items were NOT in the box.  I attached the picture from my order.
1,The fit around my ear is a little big but the ear bud part is get. I enjoy them when I am jogging they stay in my ear with no problem
1,"Excellent set of headphones, easy to use and hassle free without cords to get in the way. Sound is very good and the phones are comfortable to wear without irritation to the ears and I found that I did not need the ear clips to hold them in place and so I cut them off - this was not a complaint against the product, but a preference to have no clips. I love the power on and off facility and the fact that you do not have to touch your player and can control volume and pause from the headphones. I am satisfied with this product."
1,Great headphones
1,Great product
1,"SO FAR I ONLY USED THEM ONCE, BUT IT KEPT DISCONNECTING AND MUSIC WOULD STOP, VERY FRUSTRATING.  ON THE OTHER HAND THE SOUND QUALITY WAS GREAT!"
0,"They changed the part that goes over your ears. It used to be flexible and would reatin its shape. Now it seems to have a piece of metal in it so you can customize the fit, but its not as comfortable and quickly gets out of shape."
1,Lawn mowing gear for the ear.
0,After reading all the reviews I really thought these would be good. I am sure they are great if the stay in your ears but my husband and I tried them and they kept falling out while we were running. I ended up having to replace them every minute or two which was really annoying.
0,"These headphones came when promised. I did not use them this weekend - sadly just after the return window closed. The audio quality is absolutely terrible, terrible, terrible. I was not expecting Bose but, music sounds shallow, hollow and has an echo.  No bass whatsoever. I would gladly return these if I could.  They were not soooo inexpensive that this quality is justified."
1,Great product.  Exceptional service.
1,"The phones fit nicely in the ear, better than the Jaybirds I've been using, as is the exclusion of outside noises.<br />However, the sound is light on the treble. The tones in general are not as clear as I the Jaybirds.<br />I can live with it. Any way to beef up the treble?"
1,"For me, it was between these and the Beats X.  I use them in the gym. The Senso Headphones were about $35, meaning I could buy 4 of these for the price of one pair of Beats X.  The only real advantages of Beats X for Apple users are their lightning compatible charging port and proprietary bluetooth system. The Senso's battery lasts several hours, the music sounds clear, and they fit fine.  I haven't had any trouble with the BT connection. I recommend a foam ear tip upgrade available from Comply Foam, size T500."
1,Fantastic. I recommend
1,"Found headsets to be great works with cell phones and tablets, instead  of a car charger it should have come with a charger for the house."
1,The headphones are a 4-star. What brings this over the top is there customer service. Highly recommend this product.
1,Excellent sounds incredible..
1,"Couldn't  be better. Nice performance, easy to use, excellent price plus great service!!"
1,"I tried these out for a month before returning them. Since first turning them on, I've heard this high-pitched whining sound in the left earbud, outside of the normal humming noise it makes when it's on and active. I thought I could ignore it, but it was just too distracting. Every pause in a song or every time they were connected and an app was opened, I would hear the whining in the background.<br /><br />That being said, the pros and cons were as follows:<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Sound quality was actually pretty good when it wasn't too quiet.<br />- The range was quite good, like 10-15 feet in the same room before it started breaking up.<br />- The ambient noise dampening was pretty good, the earbuds did well to seal outside noise from getting in.<br />- The ear-hooks were really convenient if I only wanted to have one side plugged in, I could just wrap the wire around my neck and hook earpiece on the other end. No off-balance feeling, and no bouncing around. The ear-hooks could also hook to one another when not in use.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Design-wise, the power/pause button is in an uncomfortable location, just on the other side of the right earbud. Every time you power it on/off or pause you're essentially pushing the earpiece into your ear if you tend to use one finger to push the button. Otherwise, you're holding the whole right earpiece, which isn't really convenient if you have to turn it off quickly when someone comes up to you at work.<br />- Ear-hooks are terrible for a person with glasses. There just isn't enough room back behind the ears."
1,These headphones did not work for me. They are hard to keep on and the sound is not that great.
1,"I have used them for months and they work great. They hook-up to phone, Chromebook and anything else I use. I really like them."
1,"The headphones worked great right out of the box  charged fine.  Sound was decent,  wasn't the loudest when  the volume on the phone and the headset was turned up all the way.<br />The range worked great,  even in two other room,  the headphones still worked without breaking up the sound.<br /><br />The only downside which resulted in the return of the product is the weight of it and the ear piece that holds it over your ear.<br /><br />The headphones piece that hands on your ear is actually heavy,  I couldn't even manage to keep it comfortably on my ears even walking around."
1,"great item, use it all the time"
1,Easy to set up and use. The extra “bonus” items in the package were a nice little surprise.<br />Three was a missing piece in the “cable roller” that was not in the pacakge and supposed to be according to the manual
1,This is my 3rd pair I love them
1,"I am not the one to leave reviews. However, just received there 3 days after ordering. I am absolutely mindblown. They feel and fit perfectly and  normally I have trouble keeping earbuds in. I have ran with these, workedout with these and havent had one problem. The quality of sound is amazing. I literally have my volume on my phone on the lowest setting before it goes to mute and the sound is perfect. There is absolutely no way you can listen to music with the sound up like with other earbuds. If you are looking for great earbuds then look no further. These are phenomenal."
1,"My first pair of bluetooth headphones... long story short, they perform as advertised, they're very affordable, and they're outstanding for use while exercising, or really any activity that causes you to sweat. These should suit most people (of course there's always going to be fussy exceptions out there!).<br /><br />Simple setup, does what I need, sound quality is decent, and they're reasonably comfortable for extended periods of time. The silicone surface has minimal slippage if you pick the right size (they give you three sizes), clean out any earwax, and twist it as you insert into your canals. The battery life is good so far.<br /><br />I needed an upgrade because I sweat a lot while running on the treadmill, and inevitably sweat will trickle down into my ear canal and block the apple earbuds I used to use for running. Problem solved. Also, these headphones do not wiggle and fall out as I bounce up and down -- a small but not insignificant inconvenience.<br /><br />As a skeptical buyer, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend these to you -- they're cheap but surprisingly they work well."
1,Great fit. Great price. Great sound!
1,Perfect for runners!  I have broken many ear buds because I am a distance runner and the chord of the ear bud will inevitably break due to all the forces associated with running.  The Bluetooth option eliminates this entirely.  They fit pretty securely on the ears and the sound quality is good.  We'll see how long the battery lasts but thus far I have ran 1.5hrs with music.
1,"Good quality sound, easy to set up -- great quality for the price!.  Don't like the flexible ear hooks -- they don't hold that well when I'm running."
1,"All I can say is wow, Dr dree beats eat your heart out...they do not even compare to these senso headphones and the price was out of this world!<br /> Shipped supper fast as well...100%"
0,"These are okay if you don't want to spend much and if you are not planning on making any calls with them. The sound is just okay, the music has static and a little bit of an echo. like you are in a cave. When you make a call, the person on the other end cannot hear you at all!"
1,"I bought these for my husband and he's been enjoying them.  This is his first pair of wireless headphones to use while working out and he seems to really enjoy them.  For the sale price, I couldn't pass them up.  So glad I was able to pick these up for him."
0,I used these headphones 3 times and now they will not charge or turn on.
1,"I couldn't be happier with this purchase, it's amazing.  I've had no issues with the blue tooth connectivity.  The headphones offer great sound quality and outside noise control.  This is my favorite purchase of 2017 so far."
1,Cable is sensitive
1,Excellent product.
1,"These earbuds are awesome! Easy to operate, easy to connect to devices, volume limiting to prevent damage and more. I haven't tried the built in microphone yet but the rest is all good. Battery charge is good...I haven't had them go dead between charges. I primarily use them with my iPod for several hours at a time...earbuds last the whole time. Haven't connected to my phone yet so I don't know about that.<br />  The bottom line is that I use these earbuds a lot and I like them!"
1,These definitely aren't anywhere near the best sounding headphones but for under $20 I can't imagine there is any better in this price range. With memory foam tips the fit is fine. The headphones usually have initial difficulty connecting but always eventually connects. The sound is boomy. But for the price they're more than well worth it.
1,"I went through 5 different sub- $50 blue-tooth headsets before landing on these Senso ones.  There are hundreds of blue-tooth earbuds out there... all  of them I tried had very weak sound, poor bluetooth connectivity, extremely low volumes... just 'sucky' in general.  Even the very expensive ones--Bose, Jabra, etc... had mediocre reviews and seemed to suffer from similar problems.  I was pleasently surprised by these.  Very robust, deep sound and good treble... comfort is good... they don't look terrible. They connect with my iPhone 8 immediately upon powering up.  Battery life is very good... I must have listened at least 3 hours so far with no re-charging...advertised to last a lot longer than that.  I had some disconnection issues where audio was interrupted breifly when I walk in the city (NYC)..but I think this is because of all the competing signals/activity in a congested area.  Normally, they work pretty well. The only thing I don't like is the wire that connects them... but resolved to let it just sit in the front like a necklace instead of behind my head which was annoying as hell. I also like the foam ear-plug style bud attachments which does to some limited sound isolation--I noticed this helped on the train compared to the standard bud attachments.  So... until a better technology comes out for individual wire-less buds that doesn't look like Q-tips hanging from your ears, I will stick with these."
1,I received the order promptly and it was exactly as advertised.  These are great!  Have good sound and come with all needed accessories.
1,"It's a great product, I run with them all the time. Idk how waterproof they are, but I sometimes wear them in the shower and have had no problems with connectivity issues. Will buy again!"
0,It connects and disconnects all the time. I have tried resetting the Bluetooth and the headphones and still does the same. The first pair I had was the best ones. Never had a problem with them.
1,"From the day I charged them up and put them on head, the quality in the sound and the battery life was superb. Delivery was on time so I was able to start enjoying them."
1,"Stay in place and clear sounds, easy to use"
1,These are literally worth your money. The only reason I replaced my last awesome ass pair is because I lost them. These are affordable and pack such a great sound its insane.
1,"Awesome product, great delivery package and really fast, very happy"
1,"Great sound and quality, good battery life, comfortable fit. I only had them for about 3 weeks, however, and they broke. Great earbuds but very fragile."
1,"Bought these headphones after doing fair amount of reviews. Definitely satisfied with them.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Beautiful sound. Clear, with good bass.<br />- Simple to setup and operate.<br />- Fits very well. Use it in the gym or while running. Never slips or creates any obstruction.<br />- Decent range. Can roam about 20-30 meters away from the iphone/laptop while still having clear sound.<br />- The microphones pick up sounds on any call nicely. Have never heard any complaints from the other end.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Single charge life: Works for 3-4 hours at time. While this is not a major drawback, I am of the forgetful kind.<br /> The charge runs out at the most in-opportune moments ... :)<br /><br />All in all, will purchase it again."
1,Great headphones!
1,The blue tooth seems weak. Walk in the other room and it may drop. I'm also not that impressed with the sound either. I thought for sure that they would be much cleaner. The bass seems somewhat muddy and the highs just don't have it! The one thing that does work well is the Mic. I would spend the little extra money on Bose or Beats if the need arises!!
1,Good!
1,"At a quarter the price, better than the Beats Wieless ones which failed after less than two years. Connects to my iPhone each time. Never drops a stream when I am running. Excellent fidelity."
1,"Solid product, using it for weight training, running, biking and general walking the dog type activities. Rock solid. A+ customer service. Replaced a headphone that had a small issue 11 months after purchase with a brand new one, when I contacted them. Buy with confidence. Sounds great, Price is right and Service is Stellar."
1,Good product works perfect I am hearing impaired and these work where the others have failed
1,"Fit very comfortably, easy to connect, stay in place when running, and have decent sound. I’m very impressed with these, especially for the price. I would buy again in a heartbeat."
0,The bass is overwhelming and the sound quality as a whole is very muffled.
1,Great product for my Apple Watch just what I needed for jogging.  I went through several pairs of headphones for jogging none of them would stay on my ear like these do great product.<br /><br />Ok here's my updated review after  multiple  uses.  Very irritating product loses signal  during jog cuts in and out  going to have to buy something little better.

1,"I have purchased several wireless headphones in the last 2 years and this is by far my favorite choice. For starters, they stay in my ears while I lift and/or sprint. The sound quality is clear and loud enough for me to get through my workout with minimal external distractions.<br /><br />I highly recommend these to anyone looking to purchase an affordable, good-quality headset."
1,"Excellent. Set up and connection was easy, they sound great and they have excellent customer service!"
1,Received it last week. Very pleased so far. Good sound quality for the price. Easy to set up/operate.
1,"I'm enjoying my new Senso wireless Headset  , it pairs up with my Galaxy 6 and music sounds and hear it very clear and in coming call have great reception, noise cancellation is perfect, clear and ear loops are flexible and easy to adjust them. Making a stand out headset"
1,Received as a gift.  Couldn’t be happier.  Use them everyday during workout.  Nice price too so I picked up a spare pair for traveling.
1,"Great sound quality. I use these at the gym 5 days a week and I've never had any problems with them. The buttons to skip tracks back and forth seem counter-intuitive to me (e.g., you press the button closer to the back to skip forward and the button near the front to skip back), but otherwise, I like these headphones a lot. Overall, really nice quality product."
1,"The sound is really great, strong base and comfortable to wear. I haven't brought it out for a run but so far seems to stay in place well."
0,"Didn’t work for me. I should have known when the seal was broken, but didn’t need them right away so didn’t open them right away. When I did, the earphones where loose, the case and wire wrapping was missing. They wouldn’t pair with my iPhone, so I quickly sent them back."
1,"I bought these for my son about 6 months ago and he has really enjoyed them.  However, a week or so ago they stopped working.  I contacted SENSO and they shipped out another pair immediately and the new headphones arrived the following day.  The new ones work great.  So pleased that this company backs their product.  Thank you!"
1,"Nice set of bluetooth headphones. Packaging was nice, have used them for 1 day and quality seems pretty good for the price point."
1,"...then after 18 months, they would randomly disconnect and shut off, even with a full battery."
1,"These sound very nice and the noise suppression works well, too well. Tried them for running outdoors and you can't hear the environment around you which is very important. Use them around the house and sound great. Hopefully suppress small power equipment noise while working in the yard."
1,"These are awesome and well worth every penny.  I use them every day at the gym and the sound is exceptional.  Also, I love the rubber ear piece(s).  They do not fall off like my last pair did.  Keeps a charge for very long time too.  Would definitely buy again."
1,Sound quality is fantastic for the price! Cranking some Pearl Jam and am very happy with these.  I also have child-sized ears and they fit nicely with the small plugs. Great purchase.
1,My only negative about this product is that it fits funny in my right ear. People I've lent them to report the same findings. Other than that they are awesome.
1,"Easy setup and pairing.<br />Bit confused about the tie-cord thingamajig, but quick googling showed me what that little bit was for.<br />Sound quality is much better than my previous $19 pair I got as a gift.<br />Strong wind walking home, which snuck in a bit, but I haven't played with the various ear-plug sizes to see if that would limit the outside wind interference.  That said, a little bit of a bump up in volume (I tend to run volume on the low side) and the clarity compensated for the gusts of wind pretty well.<br />No other internal interference -- my old pairs had an annoying sound of rubbing cables or static, but not this pair.<br />I think there were a few bluetooth hiccups/pauses, but I'm thinking that may certainly have been my phone dropping in/out of wi-fi and pausing Spotify."
1,Great headphones. I used them frequently at work and have never had any issues. Sound quality is good.
1,"It's tough to get such buds to fit well and sound great, but these do so. So far, so good. And the controls on them make far more sense than the controls on most exercise earphones."
1,Great for running!  They feel really secure in your ears and the sound is great.
1,"Senso are great wireless speakers.<br />Used them skiing Friday, they stay right in place, perfect song quality. Buying two more sets for my other family members that are in high school and college."
1,Works great. Sounds even better.
1,Just received my new headphones.  I have used them a few times and they sound great.  Very comfortable on my ears too.  Would definitely recommend them.
1,"Terrific headphones for running and working out. Battery is more close to 5 hours, as opposed to 8."
1,Not to long ago I purchased these Bluetooth earbuds. They are great! However I accidentally broke them. I contacted their support and<br />they will replace them even though it's not covered by the warranty!!<br />I'm so thankful.
1,Really love these headphones.  Very pleased that SENSO took the time to follow up with an email to make sure I a satisfied.
1,"Have only used these headphones twice so far, but am delighted with the sound and ease of use.  After jogging with plug in earphones for years using my ipod or iphone, I am happy with the switch to bluetooth.  I also use a exercise logging app, and it works well with the distance and time announcements, too.  Good product."
1,I really like these earbuds. Connects to your phone fast. Good sound quality. A basketball landed on them pretty hard and they stayed working well. Good price as well as good quality.
1,good pair of headphones. .sound better than beats
1,They work better than expected. Obviously only the first day at the gym with them. Noise canceling is great so I can continue ignoring people who try and talk to me here. The flashing Bluetooth light is a great indicator for people to stay clear of you. Remember the more anti social you are in the gym the better the gains.
0,"If you sweat, they stop working."
1,"These started out good but I don't think they are actually waterproof.  I sometimes use them in the shower to keep from disturbing the other troops in the other showers.  Well, after about the 3rd time using them (keeping from getting them soaked) they stopped working properly.  Only one side works fine but the other side has low volume.  Maybe it was my fault, but I have a different brand that I use in the shower almost every day on deployment and currently I have no issues.  Other than that, the sound was very good."
1,I received the item and it was exactly as described. The packaging was really nice along with the little carrying case that came with them. The sound is great and they seem very comfortable. I am not sure yet how long the battery last as I haven't used them until a recharge is needed but so far used them a little over two hours and still no need for a recharge. I am not sure if the car charging adapter and cable were listed as being included but it was a great surprise for me especially since the end of the cable has both usb and iPhone adapter not to mention it is tangle free which was an excellent choice. Would definately recommend these two a friend.
1,"Good sound but improved, as did fit, when I added Far End buds (in picture)."
1,Excellent packaging and accessories. Amazing sound from bass to miss to highs.  I'm a musician and I can appreciate this great sound quality.  I want to buy another pair.
1,"Tried a couple different headphones. For the price, these are the best! Love the adjustable ear piece. Helps with keeping them in the ears. All headphones with the plug in earpiece do come out, especially when you are eating or moving around a lot. But these do stay in really good!"
1,Great headphones for running for people with lose wireless headphones.
1,Work great.  Incredible value vs beats
1,great product
1,"It's good for the price. It has a static noise that randomly buzzes, but definitely for the price, it's a pretty good deal."
1,"I bought these in January 2017 and in October, after modest use and maybe 20 complete charges, they just stopped taking a charge. I have no complaints about the sound or anything else, they just didn't last long. Never abused, never immersed in water, etc."
0,"The charging port came loose inside the device in less than a month.  Amazon told us the manufacturer would get in touch with us, but have not received any contact from manufacturer."
1,Good and professional
1,"You pay for what you get, The ear wrap-around part doesn't really fit that great at all. They are sweatproof though and they have a pretty decent battery life. They can get pretty loud but not ridiculously loud."
0,"Dont sync properly/loose wiring. These come packaged looking amazing, but both times i have tried to use them it sounds like im listening to a CD with scratches over it that skips every 2 seconds. If i could return at this point i would but by time i tried them it was too late."
0,"The head phones are ok. I can get good distance on an open floor plan, but not through walls. Sound is muffled, not enough clarity. After two months of use the battery life started out lasting over 8 hours and then dropped down to 5 hours (rapidly) during my second month of use. I probably used them 40 hours a week. They're rated for 8 hours of battery life.<br /><br />(Edited)......It seems that the headed phone does work for 8 hours, but if you depend on the recharging indicator (blue light) you will be disappointed in how many hours your head phones will last. If you over charge the unit, after the blue light has come on, you can expect longer hours."
0,Over the ear piece is too floppy and won't stay securely over my ears. Similar products such as the Beats over the ear headphones are better designed but also a lot more $. Couldn't walk on treadmill without them falling off. Will be returning.
1,Great sound  ... they stay in place during training...
1,"I've been using this earphone for over a month. Love it. The sound is pretty good. And I would never encounter the problem of dropping from my ears anymore when I worked out. I've tried two earphones before, but they kept dropping from my ears."
1,"I thought for the price it would be just one more run of the mill type of thing. Wrong. Sounds is clear, earbuds cover nicely around, ear holder is soft and it does not interfere with my prescription glasses. With one charge I listened to salsa from 12pm to 4:00pm on my flight to the Caribbean without interrupting sound. However, wish somehow the device can tell me how much juice is still left. But can complaint for the price."
1,"Amazing. Great noise canceling, very comfortable. Easy to setup/use. Quick to charge, lengthy battery life. Very Durable and stylish. Big win for SENSO. Youll have my return business. Thanks!"
0,Only worked three months.
1,they should be built higher quality i would pay more the cord is cheap and the ear part that holds it to your ear. whole thing feel like it can break mine didnt last to long but the sound was awesome could be better A-.MAYBE make something 2x 3x better 70 90
1,"5 stars because you're not going to get more for your money.  I've avoided wireless earbuds for a long time because I like my music loud and clear.  But cords got caught one too many times, so I went shopping and found these.<br /><br />The sound quality of these SENSO Bluetooth buds is just as good as the wired buds that come with the iPhone 7.  Bluetooth pairing was simple.  It comes with 4 earpiece sizes and I found one size that fit just right.  They are comfortable and they keep a charge for hours (they also charge very quickly).  I'd buy them again"
1,Good headphones for the price. Sound is a little bit bass heavy for my tastes but ok.
1,Just received my new headphones.  I have used them a few times and they sound great.  Very comfortable on my ears too.  Would definitely recommend them.
1,Work great! First time in years that I’ve been able to get a Christmas gift that my husband truly enjoys.
0,"Ordered these March 11th. It’s May 23rd, and these headphones are unusable. The breakdown has been progressive. At first it was just a skipping. I thought maybe the battery was low and kept charging them, but the skipping got worse and eventually the sound just started cutting out for several seconds at a time. My set up is an Apple Watch, so if the Bluetooth is in the right ear and my watch is on my left hand perhaps that’s the problem. But, that’s what I want a pair of wireless headphones to do. Disappointed."
1,"I have been so happy with these, for the price point. My first pair has lasted 3 years. I use them in low noise areas, like when mowing or running my shop vac. The noise reduction is not great but they are comfortable, and do offer some protection in a noisy environment."
0,People cannot hear me when I make calls.
1,great product
1,"Great sound,light weight,very comfortable, great price"
0,Broke after 6 months
1,Great product for the price. I have only used them once so far but I’m very pleased with my purchase.
1,"This is my second pair. For the price, they are solid, sound great and I will continue to purchase them."
1,Great deal! Sound quality is great. There are more than enough choices for ear buds to get the best fit. Comfortable to wear and stay in place. Easy controls.
1,"Have not had long but so far they are excellent. I hear others clearly and others hear me which is my main concern. I primarily wanted them for safe cell phone use when driving or hands free talking, although they are probably used more for music.<br /><br />The only addition I would recommend for future iterations is some form of small weight centered on the cord for a more stable and evenly distributed feeling when resting it on the neck between uses when both ear phones are hanging down or when only using one side of earphones and the other is just hanging down.  Outside of that, they are crystal clear earphones without breaking the bank to afford."
1,"Great gym headphones at a great price. I researched bluetooth in-ear headphones extensively and decided on these for the price.  The other reviewers are spot on.  They are light, stay in the ears, have really good battery performance.  They pair quickly and without much effort.  Operation is a no-brainer and they keep me in the zone during long sweaty workouts.  The only disadvantages I see are that the rubber plug that covers the charging port is having a hard time staying in after numerous charges and a couple months of daily use.  They are not the most low-profile ear buds, but they are what you should expect for this style of bluetooth headphones.  I've deducted a full star for one reason... Wind noise. I can't tell if it is due to the larger profile of the headphones, or if it is the microphone input but if you are walking fast / running especially into a slight head wind you will hear the rustling loudly.  Like I mentioned, i'm not sure of the exact cause, but it's really distracting, so much so, I'd recommend these only for indoor use.  If you are a runner, you might want to look another direction."
1,Great headphones for just about anything. Easily synced to my phone and I was off!
1,I can't believe how good these earphones are for the price. As a long distance runner I also appreciate their comfort and the quality is great as well.
1,Great sound. Loud. Comfortable. Good bass. Great battery.
1,Not the best I’ve had but for the money it is I love them for what you pay
1,i have owned 2 pair.<br />first pair (slightly older design) lasted over a year of good service until I stepped on them.<br /><br />immediately ordered another pair.<br />solid. decent battery for size. Fit in ears without discomfort. decent sound.<br /><br />MUCH better than some in terms of keeping connected to bluetooth.
0,The on/off button did not hold up past 8 uses of these headphones.
1,Nice
1,"Comfortable, loud enough, bluetooth sync is easy."
1,"It's critical to play around with the different sizes of the changeable ear cushions to get the right fit. Once you do, you will love these earphones. They give good sound and stay in place no matter how much you move around. I wear them for phone calls, conference calls, and listening to music/books/tv and they work beautifully. I've never had a problem with the mic during calls. When I have them both in my ears the noise cancellation is good. I like the fact that the phones are wired together, so if I only have one in my ear I can hook the other on my shirt or let it hang--so I don't have to worry about it getting lost. I would recommend these for someone listening while on the move."
1,"They are lightweight, great sound, and easy to sync."
1,"This headphone is amazing because its sweat resistance and the music quality. I would recommend this to anyone likes wireless earphone. Buy it with insurance though, it might get overheated."
1,"They fit nicely and the customer service was good. However, they have suddenly stopped working for no reason. I take good care of them and they aren't thrown into bags or anything. I keep them in their case when I travel and often don't travel with them at all. Very frustrating."
1,Husband likes them and uses them while working out
1,great purchase and a 1 year warranty!  perfect!
1,This is my second pair of Senso and they're working great. Love the upgrades.
1,Very good quality with exceptional sound.  I use this for both listening to my music and to answer in-coming call while I am driving.
1,"great product.... I just bought my third pair. And, they honored the warranty on the pair that mysteriously broke."
1,"These sound great and I bought 2 because I thought battery might die out quickly. They lasted almost 8 hours everyday. I like the smaller ear inserts than the ones they had on them already. It really comes with a lot of stuff. A cigarette charger, 2 extra wires an an apple charger and a case. It came with a lot for the price."
1,Great wireless earbuds! I love them.
1,"They're great, I'm glad they have the variety of ear bud sizes so I could go to smaller size that's more comfortable for my ears.  Nice storage case and other great features.  I would buy these again if I should lose mine or as a gift."
1,"These headphones were decent. I really enjoyed the packaging along with the charging wires and such. However, I returned them due to this ringing noise that was constant as soon as they were turned on. I couldn't get over that noise despite the audio of whatever I was listening to."
1,"I like the fact that by just pushing a button on the head phones it turns on, connects, and one more push and I'm on whatever I am listening to."
0,Does not work
1,Super pleased with the quality of these headphones. The battery seems to last forever. Easy to use and nice sound!
1,"I have normally hated earpods, but I really wanted to find a pair to make me like them. I have since loved these even though I have only been using them for about two weeks. Battery life is pretty long, I used them for an 8 hour shift at work and then some the next day before the Low Battery warning came up. I compared them to the beats equivalent and for the price there is just no reason to get the beats.<br /><br />TLDR: If you want a damn good pair of headphones for a damn good price, these are it."
1,Great product with the same value of a $180 similar headphones
1,Great deal
1,"I thought that this headphones were great.  My Jaybirds recently stopped working, and I didn't want to replace them with an expensive option in case they broke again.  I felt that these headphones outperformed the Jaybirds and were more comfortable as well."
0,"Battery life doesn't last a gym workout,  charging ports defective."
1,"Wow, what a great product.  This is a quality pair of headphones with professional packaging and plenty of accessories.  I tried the unit immediately out of the box and it worked without any fuss or hassle.  It's intuitive so I didn't need to read through the laminated instructions provided in the box.  The ear buds fit snug in my ear which is not the case with other products I've used in the past.  The tight but comfortable fit blocks out sound from around you.  It's not noise cancelling, but it definitely dampens the environmental sound.  The sound from the headphones is extraordinary for the price.<br />Usually, headphones in the price range don't fit well and are too quiet.  These fit well and are quite loud.  I find myself backing off the volume instead of wishing for an extra high setting.  The sound and the bass is as good as a pair of wired Beats that these are replacing.  Great job.<br />The headphones feel soft but durable.  We'll see how they work after a few work-outs.  They do appear to have sealed covers for the ports to enhance water proofing.<br />The range is good.  I can walk across the room without any distortion, loss, or quality issues.<br />Skip the Beats and try SENSO.<br />I highly recommend considering these headphones."
1,My boyfriend is very happy with his gift
0,I've had these for a month and the battery life is only an hour after a full charge.  Waste of money.
1,Paired with I Phone instantly. Sound quality great. Lo0ve them.
0,This piece of junk broke after just one month.  It stopped charging and the sound quality was weak.  I will never buy a Senso product again.
1,"Sound quality is decent. It has a hard time being connected to multiple devices at once. I'm typically near my computer and my phone when using them. It will connect to both but regardless of which device I use to output audio from, it will crackle unless I disconnect one of the devices. When using them to talk on the phone, the other person on the end sounds pretty muddy. Battery life is eh. Overall, I probably would spend a little bit more $ in the future to get something over higher quality."
1,I have recently used the senso headphones and was satisfied with the product. The materials it is made of should hold up over time unless abused. With that being said this is my first wireless headphone set so I do not have any others to compare these too.<br />I currently use these headphones with my Samsung 7 Edge and listen to music when working out or running. I use a armstrap that holds my phone in place while working out.. With this being said I have noticed that the connection between the bluetooth and the phone isn't the best when running if phone is placed on my left arm. The right ear bud is where the bluetooth is located. I am going to assume that the bluetooth is meant to be less than 6 foot away from the wireless source although I can get a bad connection from 4 foot.
1,"These are decent headphones for the price. The sound quality is good if you are not that picky. They are easy to control. Best of all, they fit in my tiny ears and don't fall out thanks to the ear wrap. They are comfortable to wear for long periods of time. The battery life is good (4-5 hours).<br /><br />The only thing I dislike is the charging spot is difficult to open if you have short or thick nails. It is a rubbery tab that closes too easily as you are pulling it open."
1,"Expectations are an important part in the satisfaction of any product.  If one is expecting a Bluetooth headphone in this price range to be audiophile quality then disappointment is likely.  If one is expecting value then expectation is much exceeded.  I would give audio quality 3 stars but value a 5 star rating.  That is how I come to 4 stars.  First, audio quality is just fine for casual listening while working out or doing anything.  This is not for siting down and listening to Mozart, Nora Jones, etc.. I have Sennheiser on the ear headphones for anytime I just want to listen. The base is boosted which I think is fine for earbuds.  However it is not real clean and the highs lack some detail.  But even with that, these Senso Bluetooth earbuds exceeded expectations and sound just fine.  For value they are great.  The connection works well and they are easy to use.  Battery seems to last as advertised.  I have been using them when I work out and when I an using my Gear VR headset.  In conclusion, I am a happy camper.<br /><br />6/28 update:  Right earbud stopped working or became very faint.  I am not changing my stars because Invotek does back the product.  Called support which was located in VA.  Since it was in the 30 day return window they told me to return the headphones to Amazon and they gave me a 15% coupon to reorder.  I decided to try something different to see if I could get better audio quality but that was my decision.  They do back the product."
1,Much better than expected for the price point... very easy to use and set up.
1,Excellent pair of wireless headphones.
1,Not to bad i got these for my girlfriend and they came packaged nice with a cute case.Now they are  not for audio enthusiast but they are good for the average listener.
1,"Great sound, quickly connected to my iPhone,  fits the ear very well.  These are helping make my gym workouts go faster. very well designed product."
1,"These are absolutely perfect! I spend anywhere between one to two hours in the gym each day and wear these the whole time comfortably. The sound isnt like the higher end brands but they are loud and sound pretty good. I am extremely happy with them and would recommend anyone to try these out. I promise you won't be dissapointed, and neither will your wallet."
1,ear pads were very hard? but otherwise just fine
1,"Super easy to use, great sound.  The fit well in my ears, didn't fall out or feel weird.  I love them!  My 10 year old daughter did as well....and promptly lost them.  I am so sad now- I need to get another pair but I have to wait until we are caught up after the holidays to buy myself any more treats!  Totally recommend them!"
0,Only was working for 2 month is the second I bought
1,"these Bluetooth headphones are great.  I bought two pairs of them, just in case one dies while in the middle of a workout.  a voice tells you when the batteries are getting low.  it would be better if it was more than about 5 minutes notice.  once she warns the batteries are getting low, you only have minutes until it dies, which is ok.  the sound quality is good and they are loud enough (I have had to return 2 very expensive headphones because they were not loud enough!  what?)  very happy that I purchased these"
1,"2nd time buying these as I loved them the first time around. I bought my first paid July 2017 and they lasted until the end of February 2019 without any issues. I typically would use them EVERY work day for the full 8 hours with no issue. I believe there was a wiring issue in the old pair as I could hear fine out of the right side but not the left. In my eyes, for the price and the amount of time they lasted, I am absolutely thrilled with this product."
1,"So far they perform as expected.  I haven't really kept a close eye on how long that hold a charge but it seems more than adequate.  For the price, it is a great find.  I would definitely recommend them!"
0,Not suitable for running at all. Don’t fit and fall out.
1,"These are a great product. I really like the noise canceling, while using them the only thing I hear is my music. I also found the sound quality to be great too. I like how I can control the volume from the side of the earpiece instead of having to always do it on my phone. All around a 5 star product.<br /><br />** This product was received at no cost for review and inspection purposes. No compensation for a positive review was provided. All of my reviews are based 100% off of my experience with the product and I never guarantee a positive review."
1,The ear loops were uneven. They sounded great but sent them back for a refund d
0,Compré 3 auriculares el 04/02/2020. Los hemos usado diariamente unas 2horas al día solo a la noche sin tenerlos en movimiento. A los 6 meses uno de ellos comenzó con un falso contacto en el cable del lado izquierdo y dejó de emitir sonido de ese lado. Hace unos días volvió a pasar lo mismo con otro auricular. De la tienda me dijeron que estaba en garantía pero aún no me ofrecieron una solución. Ya no estoy ubicado en usa. Espero poder reemplazarlos por otros de mejor calidad ya que la durabilidad de estos fue pésima. ¿Cuál hubiera sido su vida útil si los hubiera utilizado para correr como dice la descripción del artículo?
1,never fall off!
1,"I've been using these for a couple of months now, and I love them.  I was having an incredibly difficult time finding earbuds that actually stayed in my ears after trying quite a few.  I have NO issues whatsoever with these staying put!  They sound great and have a good battery life.  My only complaint is that there isn't nearly enough time between when it first tells you 'battery low' and when the battery actually dies.  I'm not exactly sure how long it takes between first warning and dead battery, but it's fewer than 10 minutes.  Both times it's happened to me (usually I'm good about charging them before it's needed), it's been when I was out on a long walk.  Today, thankfully, it died when I was only a few blocks from getting back home.  The first time, though, I was about 40 minutes into an hour a half long walk, and I had to do the entire rest of it in silence.  I know, third world problem, but the only way I can convince myself to keep active is by making sure I don't get bored, so I listen to audiobooks.  It would be wonderful if there was a warning light or a verbal warning message far earlier than when you get it."
0,"Muffed sound, very cumbersome - a big disappointment. I don't get the good reviews. Fake news...."
0,Piece of crap. Died in 3 months. Never pairs now or pairs to a device for just 2 seconds and dies. Any one having this issue and knows how to repair this?
1,"I did quite a bit of research and settled on these headphones (I had previously purchased another vendor's that did not work out and had to return them). This is a great set of headphones that does the job well. Bluetooth connectivity is quick and calls are crystal clear, I can't think of any cons."
1,Works good for price point
1,Good value for the price point.  Seem to be made well.  Sound is good too considering how much they cost.  Don't expect Beats or Bose quality but suitable for a pair of headphones you could live without if they broke or you lost them.
1,Great Sound
1,"I was skeptical of the quality with such a low price, but am pleased to report that these are the most comfortable, best fitting headphones that I have ever used! Plus, they stay in my ears without hurting! The sound quality is also quite good. I am very pleased with this purchase. My son purchased a pair a few months ago and raved about them so much that I finally decided to give them a try. His experience has been excellent as well."
0,"I returned this model because I could not get the ear buds to seal in either ear, I think because the earpieces are too far away from my ear canal while the support hooks are over my ears.  I cannot make any other judgement of the sound or operation because I could not get it to fit my ears."
1,"I like how these buds stay in your ear even during rigorous activities. The only thing I would change is the ear hook be more rigid instead of soft and rubbery, but still does an adequate job of keeping the buds on your ears.  Sound is very good compared to other cheaper brands where it sounds like you're listening to something inside a cupboard.  So far very satisfied with this purchase."
1,"I’ve only had these for about a week, but so far they’re great. I wear them mainly when I work out, and they fit very nicely- I always have trouble finding earbuds that stay. However, if I get super sweaty they become a little loose, which makes sense (hence one less star). The packaging and accessories are also great!"
1,I have ridden my bicycle three times with these and they have great sound and are easy to operate with gloves on and ear covers. Thanks for great headphones
1,Nice earphones but the Bluetooth connection is very unstable and has a lot of disconnection and static.
1,These work perfectly with my iPhone. I’m no longer sad to not have an aux port. It works well for dancing around the house aka exercising.
1,Good sound. Easy to use. Love it
1,"Great sound, hardly even notice them on, comfortable enough to wear all day, and a battery to match. No wall charger, but it did come with a car charger."
0,"SENSO Bluetooth Headphones, Best Wireless Sports Earphones w/Mic IPX7 Waterproof HD Stereo Sweatproof Earbuds for Gym Running Workout 8 Hour Battery Noise Cancelling Headsets.  I purchased this the end of April, so it is about 4 monthis old.  The earphones feel good in the ear but they cut out as you are listening or talking --at first it was infrequent so I decided to keep them.  But now it is several times in a 10 minute period.  And the cut off of when I can return them or even complain to the company has passed.  Frustrated and can't find reliable bluetooth earphones!!"
1,"I was happily impressed with these. You get a nice package which works well, sounds good and is easy to use. Happy with purchase."
0,"I honestly don't know how people can give 5 stars reviews for this product. Now, I don't know if the item is defective or not but The audio quality is really bad. Basically, you can just hear basses... medium or high frequencies are really low. If you increase the volume over 50 percent, the audio scratches.  In addition, the cap that is covering the micro USB port is pretty lose: this is supposed to be a water proof device, with that cap free to move how can you protect the micro USB?"
0,"I bought this on december 13th, and today its finally died. Very poor quality.I dont want to spend 40 dollar for my headphone in every three months. That totally sucks."
1,"really love it, use it everywhere"
1,Look and feel like a quality product. Packaged nicely with plenty of extra accessories. The ear buds fit nicely and stay in even when very active. Recommended product.
1,"Headphones arrived a couple of days ago.  Instructions were very easy to follow - easy to charge and easy to connect to my phone!  I especially like the volume range from low to high, and the assortment of ear buds makes for a custom fit.  Did not fall out or move during a strenuous workout. A nice carrying case was included so I can keep everything together.  So far, seems like a quality product at a good price."
1,"Use these at the gym and have been really happy with the fit and durability. I even closed one bud in my car door and still haven't had a problem. They sync up easily and have a pretty long battery life, and most importantly, I don't have to mess with them a hundred times while working out. They sound good enough, no issues there either."
1,They often lose connection when my phone is in my pocket.
1,VERY GOOD
1,Bought these for my son that does distance touring on his bike.  Great price.  Noise cancellation is excellent
1,The moment i heard Serbian Traditional Notes i was impressed!<br />Thank you ordering another one right now!
1,Great for use during the day at work or out and about!!
1,I can't say enough good things about these headphones. I wore my first pair on long runs for several months and never had an issue. I even wore them when I was working from home. I left them at the gym and immediately got another pair. You cannot beat the quality of these for the price!
1,Quite impressed for the price!
1,"These headphones are quality and a great value. It is about perfect. I wish the ear hooks were a little more firmer but that is more personal preference as someone else could find it uncomfortable. The audio quality overall  is good but during a phone call the person on the other line may find it a little difficult to hear you if you have a lot of ambient noise. Inside of a car you can be heard clearly, but when I'm in public I take off the right ear piece and hold it in front of my face and can be heard without a problem. Overall, I am very happy with the purchase for the price. For what you get, these headphones could justifiably be priced higher."
1,Sound great just like dre Powerbeats for lot cheaper.
1,nice for every day use.
1,Just returned from my first trip to the gym with these awesome headphones.  Sound quality is killer!  Nice and comfortable too.  These things stack up to much more expensive headphones- I'm very satisfied.
1,"Overall this is a really good product. I sometimes have some issues keeping the earbud portion in my ear but once they’re in, usually I’m good. The sound quality is good and the battery lasts a good while. The only think I don’t like is the the connected cord has a crimp in it from being boxed and tends to crimp up behind my neck while I’m running which is annoying. I’m trying straighten the cord over time by handing from the arm of a chair...we’ll see."
1,"So far I've been very impressed with these earbuds. The package is very nice and catches your eye easily. Just by the packaging alone you can tell this is going to be a nice product. When I opened it up I was thrilled to see that they included a really nice carrying case that isn't bulky. That's real important to me because I'm a software developer so I have to keep them in my computer case so it's a great way to protect the earbuds plus keep it helps keep the charging cable with the device so that's an A+ there. I was also supprised to find a charging cable with a lightening charger and micro usb head and a car charger and very good quality one as well! When I opened that case I was thrilled yet again. The design on this device is gorgeous. They are definitely something you can be proud to wear to your gym. The piece that goes of the ear is made of a really soft rubber which was definitely a very nice surprise.  With rubber ear hooks and the earbuds that fit perfectly in your ear makes these some of the most comfortable earbuds I've ever worn.  I completely understand why the cord needs to be there but in ideal world they wouldn't be, but since they are I have to say it's a really nice length. Not to long to get in the way but not so short that the pull them out of the ear. Just a happy medium.<br /><br />Now that we got first impressions out of the way let's talk about functionality. To pair the device hold the power button until the light flashes blue and red. Then go to your Bluetooth settings on your phone, if you don't see the device on your Bluetooth settings right off just give it a little bit and it will show up. I noticed when I paired mine it did take a little longer for it to show up than others but it eventually got there. Once it's paired the first time it will automatically pair every other time you use it. The first thing I tried was listening to my music and I was amazed at the sound quality. It was beyond better than my last pair. You can turn up the volume and skip tracks straight from the device and never having to touch your phone which is very important when your working out. Next I got some one to call me to test its mic and they said they couldn't even tell there was anything different which is also great!<br /><br />All in all I think you can tell I would recommend this product for anyone looking for a quality device. I always like to point out at least one negative to a device so someone doesn't think it's a fake review and skip over it. I devote a ton of my personal time to review all these items for everyone. I'm talking about hours just for one review, so the last thing I want is for someone to skip over one of my reviews, but in this case I just couldn't come up with a negative.  So I honestly can't fathom someone ever regret purchasing this item! The discount I received for my reviews will never sway my review in any way and I review items based on if they do what the description says it does, quality of the product compared to the retail price, and differences between it and others similar products in its price range."
1,Good price.  Love that the earpiece is bendable.
0,"Good value when they worked, but they only lasted me 6 months"
1,These headphones really came as a surprise! Much better listening quality than the Samsung headphones I ordered. I highly recommend these!
1,"These headphones would have gotten 5 stars, however from time to time they do cut in & out without disconnecting. Other than that issue, they are comfortable, easy to use, light & the noise cancellation does work with our high NM winds. Great value for the money."
1,"Sound is great, comfortable, and stay put."
1,The best cheap headphones you can get. The bass is great and good volume. For the price then do a great job.
1,"Great Bluetooth headphones!  I run commercial mowers and these headphones are perfect!  No cords hanging down, I was worried about how small the volume control and track change buttons are due to my very large hands, but they are easily accessible and easy to control.<br />Definitely recommend!"
1,Love it.
1,Love it!!!
0,"I didn't have high hopes for these to begin with as these sorts of headphones never seem to be spectacular products. However these might be the worst of the bunch I've owned over the years.  The over-ear pieces are way too large and are not adjustable so the fit is awkward.  It doesn't feel secure although in the interest of fairness they did stay in when I tried jumping around or shaking my head.  The fit I could live with however the bluetooth connectivity is also terrible.  For example, the sound drops out or crackles when my phone is in my pocket.  I could understand if it was dropping out because I left my phone in a different room, but from my pocket seems ridiculous."
1,Just as advertised.  Works great with my iPhone.
0,The product is good to have if the customer has large ear holes. I have small ear holes and the buds kept popping out as I was working out. This product did not work at all when I running.
1,"Love these! They work great, actually stay in my ears, and the sound quality is superb!"
1,"Excellent product, it works really good"
1,Great sound quality. Comparable to professional earbuds for a much cheaper price. I would definitely recommend to others.
1,"Very comfortable, great sound, paired to my devices easily. Much better bass response and way more comfortable than my previous BT phones  (JVC F250BT). Love them!"
1,"I turn me up loud and clear.  I also left em in my pocket went through a speed queen washer and dryer.  Pulled em out of my pocket tonight, unraveled em and guess what? Just like new."
1,"Great product, excellent service ,was fast as well ! This is my second set ,it was a gift . Love these headphones they are great!!"
0,these Bluetooth earbuds are ok . they could have been design a little better. not that easy to place in ear and the on off switch is in the wrong place. noticed while walking outside on a windy day you get the wind noise around the earbuds. if you're not careful when you but away the earbuds in their case you turn them on by mistake and run the charge down. have not tried them with the phone yet so can't say how the mic works. I guess you get what you pay for. bluetooth is easy to set up and works well.
1,I have had several issues pairing this device between my iPhone and iPad. Numerous times I have had to erase these head phones from my list of Bluetooth items on the device I am pairing with and re-find the headphones. It ads a level of frustration and time to the process. The quality is what is to be expected of an inexpensive set of headphones.
1,The sound quality and noise cancellation is great.The ear clips are ok i have small ears so i find myself adjusting the ear pieces occasionally
1,"These are amazing. Great quality sound. Very loud and clear sound. Great value. Cord is slightly long for me, so I use a loose knot."
1,"I am not an expert on earbuds, but I have tried quite a few.  None seem to stay in my ears when I run.  These do.  These are also the first blue tooth earbuds I have owned, and I really like the convenience of the wireless connection.  They do not shut out all noise, which makes running with them safer, but they do provide a nice sound."
0,"Don't expect any noise canceling. Otherwise it fits well in your ear and comfortable. Hooks don't hurt your ear over the time. They are pretty comfortable.<br />A lot of external noise gets mixed with your music, you need to turn the volume up but then people around you hear what you are listening."
0,Stopped working and can’t be charged after 7 months of use. Very disappointing.
1,"I had these for over a year and I'm going to make a good salad we feel don't great for pretty much anything Bluetooth connects right another everything works perfect, there's a huge downfall to these earbuds when you run into any kind of wind at all it's like the old can you hear me now commercials. It really is terrible any type of wind or interfere with the use to the point where it makes you just want to hang up"
1,"Great product and great service. I bought these for my son after the dog chewed up his Bose headphones (similar to these). Huge difference in price, but not quality. He was impressed with the sound and the way they fit."
1,"I don’t write many reviews, but this product warrants one. I’ve had 4 of these headsets over the last 3 years and they are hands down the least expensive best option for easy to use good sounding blu tooth ear buds. Sure you can pay $150 for a great pair of brand name, or you can spend less than $30 that will last you about a year."
1,"First the pros: These are great. The sound quality is excellent, they are comfortable with what feels like an ergonomic placement of the multifunction button - it fits your hand perfectly.  The controls are intuitive, packaging, case and accessories are well thought out, stable (these guys are not coming off) and the Bluetooth!!! The bluetooth is the best I've ever experienced. I can leave my phone upstairs, in the house charging and listen to whatever in the backyard. No cutting out and no loss in quality. Day three and I love these head phones.<br /><br />Cons: They are big. You aren't going to be stealthy with these guys."
1,"These headphones are awesome! And the price makes them even better. I must admit that I was skeptical at first and thought to myself, &#34;how good can they be at that price?&#34; But I read some reviews and decided to give them a shot. So far they have done very well. I also love the case that came with them....it looks cool and convenient to throw in my gym bag. The other thing I appreciate is the follow up email from the president of the company to ensure I was satisfied and wanted me to know that they would take care of any issues with the headphones if I needed it. That kind of service is hard to find these days.....nice touch!"
0,"Headphones worked great! Nice cord, charger and case. However it no longer charges after 10 months."
1,as advertised
0,"These headphones have a power button that is easily pressed by mistake, like when you put them in the case or throw them in a bag. For this reason, they are never charged when you want to use them. Bad design."
1,The price is right and so are these headphones. Purchasing another one for my teenage daughter since she's been using it more than me.. Ha!
0,"I was soooo excited when I received these.  The sound is great.  the control is easy to access while working out. there was some skipping but I just adjusted.  my huge disappointment is that the ear hooks or whatever they are called did not hold their shape.  They became really loose so the headphones started slipping out of my ears until it was just pointless to even have them in.  Lord knows, I do not exercise enough to have worn them out as I only got around 15 uses before I started having this problem.  As I said, I REALLY wanted to like them."
1,Prompt delivery; nice packaging. Headphones work well
1,didn't connect easily with all devises; sound good. round the ear mechanism worked fairly well. good price point<br /><br />make L and R larger and easier to see.
1,Charge lasts forever!
1,I’m writing a review today because someone asked me to recommend wireless headphones. I’ve had theses over 2 years and can say they are the best all around quality and comfort you will find.
0,"I have been meticulously researching bluetooth headphones for a solid six months now, and I landed on this pair based on the large number of high reviews. After receiving them and using them a few times, I wonder why the reviews are so high. Here's my take:<br /><br />They Stay In My Ears<br />-These things look incredibly bulky, so I expected to have them fall out of my ears with the first few steps of my run. Surprisingly this was not an issue and they stayed in on all three of the runs I used them on (longest one was only five miles, though).<br /><br />Sound Quality Is Masked and Actually Quite Poor<br />-To someone without much understanding of sound mix, it would seem the quality is good. It does SOUND like it has a strong bass, but what they did to make that illusion was muffled the sound. What you get is more base, but you lose the mid-range and high-end. I am a musician, and I mix my own in-ear monitors for each show. These were sub-par at best. Muted does not equal solid bass. I was willing to deal with this, but...<br /><br />Wind Noise Is TERRIBLE<br />-There is a microphone on the set, which is nice if you take a phone call. However, there's no way to turn that mic off (that I could find), so you hear the wooshing sound of wind over the mic in both ears if running outside, even if you're just listening to music.<br /><br />Battery Life Is Good<br />-After about 2 hours of use, they're still full. I like that it comes with several charging options (car charger, lightning-to-USB, micro USB),<br /><br />Bottom line is: these are pretty bad. If you're looking for TRUE QUALITY sound, skip this set. I had to find that out the hard way."
1,"I have had few wireless head phones; Bose, beats earbuds, beats headphones,  ect. These headphones ridiculously rival my Bose ($170) earbuds. When it comes to these and my beats, I wear these over my beats any day.  Other than run time they're better im every way; comfort,  loudness. Bass. Wind can be a factor with these but not to the point that they're rendered useless.  I've had them for a few years and i don't treat them well at all and they've held up fine.  I was gifted my beats after owning these...i don't use my beats"
1,Sound and battery life are decent.  For the price it is really a good product. The reason I have given 3 stars is for the built quality.  It could have been much better.
1,Love these headphones as they are lightweight and easy to pair.
1,Works great. My wife couldn't believe the price alot less expensive than hers. I've had them four days and used them every day for at least an hour of some sort of exercise.  Comfortable and sound is great.
1,"Wonderful headphones, great fit and great clarity. Shipped fast. Liked them so much we bought another pair so we didn't have to share!"
1,So what's the solution to losing AirPods and various other over-priced BT earphones? These.
1,Great quality and great sound
0,"They sound great but are terribly uncomfortable regardless of the size buds I use. The real problem is battery time, 2 of the 7 days I have used them they died in under 2 hours . Volume and charge time were both about the same on all days so I am a bit puzzled. Will see in another week.<br />About a year later and I threw them in the camp fire, they would not stay connected and cut out numerous times per song. Listened to my play lists over the lousy phone speaker for the rest of the trip without incident.<br />Save your money and don't buy these,they are junk."
1,"Outstanding headphones , I couldn't be happier with this set.  Excellent range sound and quality and I see no reason to go anywhere else.  Works great with my iPhone 7.  There are very well made. Most importantly excellent battery life and battery hold time."
1,love
1,Headphones are really good.<br /><br />My first set of headphones that I received had a buzzing noise on the left earbud (maybe a faulty unit). Contacted customer service and they shipped the replacement right away and were also super friendly. The new headphones sound quality is really good.<br /><br />Worth the price
1,"OK, I bought two of this. The first one was two years ago. Until now that one still works find. I used it literally for every activities, particular gym and exercising. It worked so well that I decided to buy a 2nd one even though the 1st was still working. This is because I don't want to wait for charging (having two to rotate).<br />The 2nd one was bough two months ago. Within one month (under the same usage conditions), its connectivity deteriorated. Its reception is terrible within my house, particular at the spots where the first one still has perfect reception. Its audio completely lost the bass (low frequencies). Not only that, the remaining high pitch sound regularly get distorted (kind of like when you play a cassette tape in fast forward mode). I don't like chances. The first one gets 5 stars. The second one get 1 star. Average 3 stars."
0,"While sound qualify is excellent, callers complain of echo and poor microphone quality.  I followed manufacturer instructions to perform a factory reset on the headset, but it didn't work out.  Also, found them to painful after a while on my left ear.  Another one bites the dust."
1,they work great so far. im very glad i didnt spend alot of money on onether brand before trying this ones
0,decent sound when it worked!  iPhone 7 needed to be within 6-8 inches of headphones for reception.  Blue tooth reception was horrible.  ear plugs kept falling out of ear.  returned item and refund.  very disappointed.  not worth the money.
1,They are extremely comfortable and the bass is incredible.  I have two other comparable headphones and they are not close to the sound quality of these.  Definitely worth the money and more.
1,Enjoy these headphones..... Very loud and durable
1,They sound good. Battery lasts. They hold in my ears when I'm working out. And they came with car charger and extra cord charger for iPhone and android. Worth it to me
1,Great earbuds! Quality sound and a design that stay in your ear.
1,They sound great and feet good around your ears
1,Battery life is good so far and a great sound.
1,"Very comfortable, soft ear buds. Nice clear sound. Love the range. NOTE: Not adjustable around ears."
1,"I haven't had these long, but so far I like them a lot. Very easy set up and comfortable. They come with 3 options of size on the ear buds.<br />Sound is great."
1,GOOD
1,"I love these headphones!! They are the best!! Sound is great and fit is very comfortable, I highly recommend."
1,Comfortable. Silicone earpieces work well. Nice sound. Good deal without all the nice extras. Buy a set you won't be sorry you did!
1,Clear sound quality. Lots of extra goodies come in the box! Great value for price.
1,"Booming Base, I'm around loud noise all the time. Best Bluetooth headset I've ever owned. I've tried many and still have 6 sets. This are the best yet. My money well spent. Gotta get the misses a set now."
1,"I like the different sizes of ear plugs it comes with.  For the price, it has really good sound quality"
1,"First, I didn't want to spend a lot of money again on ear buds and second I wanted them to last more than four hours. So far I really like these, they are comfortable, sound is good, the volume control is better than my last pair and I can listen to music all day. Happy that it came with a case and extras."
1,"I love this headphone, I previously used Motorola ( 3 of them) , the last one only last for 5 month, and I decided to change the brand, so after a few days of research I decided to buy this one. So far so good, the quality of the sound is amazing, So far I am very happy with the change."
0,Bought three pair of these for myself and my two sons to use while biking and working out. They were great for a few months then ALL THREE PAIRS STOPPED CHARGING.  Now they are useless. We followed the directions and didn't overcharge them - but no matter - they all stopped working. WASTE OF MONEY.
1,Broke in 5 months
1,sound good
1,These are very good for the price. They have a good amount of bass and plays well.
1,Works great.  Actually the first one worked for a few weeks and then the on/off button quit.  I let them know and they sent me a new one immediately.  No questions asked and I didn't even have to return the bad one.  I actually received it the very next day.  Hopefully it was a fluke and this one will last longer.
1,"Pretty Awesome, included two charging cable and a car adapter. These are the first I found that actually stay in your ear while your moving around. They are also great sounding, easy to connect to any bluetooth device, phone calls work great I really like them,<br /> I get about 4-5 hours listening time and they charge quite fast. Very nice."
1,These headphones work awesome. Great for the gym. Highly recommend
1,Very pleased with these headphones.  They are easy to use and also extremely comfortable and secure even when working out due to the soft ear clips.  Sound quality is also great even on low end/bass.  Can't go wrong at this price.
0,"Are my ears too little? These don't fit me. If i plug the bud into my ear canal, the hook is way above my ear. If I hang the hooks on my ear, the bud is way below my ear canal. Since I wear glasses, I just put the arm of my glasses over the hook to hold them in place but that wouldn't work if I were running or using them at the gym. Also, there is a lot of interference/choppiness in the playback. At first I thought it was my book (poor audio quality) and then I thought maybe I was bouncing my phone too much - but again, these are supposed to be for sport. And even when my phone is resting someplace, the sound cuts in and out. Battery charge didn't last long either. I might just have to pull out the instructions to see if there are any tips before I pack them up to return."
1,"I use these for working out. Noise cancelling is great and has great sound. Comes with a carrying case, two charging cables, car charger, and resizable ear buds. Easy Bluetooth connection. Charge holds well."
1,"The sound is great. They work wirelessly with my phone. The ear piece that wraps over the ears is not adjustable and fits me a littlw big, but i ran with them on and they stayed in place. The piece that is used to tighten the cables behind the neck comes off easy and it is frustrating to put it back so i threw it out. Good for the price. They come in a nice small case and also comes with chargers."
1,Love the ease and sound quality of these headphones.  It is so nice not to have cords hanging down.
1,"Headphones worked well for a long period of time. Not the most comfortable, but very good buy for the price! I didn't really get a chance to use the mic, but these headphones were mainly used for long distance running/training. They are a good set of headphones to beat up at the gym or during workouts."
1,Great product .  Better connection and sound than my more expensive earbuds
0,"UPDATE***<br />After using for about 3 weeks music cuts off every 10 second or so. I've tried factory resetting as recommended by customer service, but it doesn't fix the problem. It is not a signal issue, I've tried using it at various locations.<br /><br />UPDATE**<br />Great customer service. They sent replacement right away. However, I'm not completely satisfied with the quality of sound. It has hissing noise in background and bass is so deep (and treble so low) that it sounds like I'm listening to music coming from another room.<br /><br />I was really excited for this headphones. Received the package to find out HEADPHONES ARE MISSING. Like the most important content, don't you think?!?"
1,The quality of sound from these headphones are AWESOME!!!
0,"I usually don't write reviews. I felt compelled in this case because of my disappointment in this product. I purchased these based on the reviews of other amazon users, and expected they would be at least ok to use at the gym, but they were frankly pretty terrible. I don't consider myself an 'audiophile', but I do appreciate good sound and these are not good. The headphones are utterly unable to produce any bass notes. This wouldn't be as much of a problem if they were just filtered out entirely, but instead they just distort terribly. The distortion then muddies up the rest of the music and make them almost unlistenable. And no, I was not listening to only bass heavy music nor was the turned all the way up. At only half volume, these headphones were distorting like crazy! the basic headphones that came with my phone sound much better. Without piling on too much, they also hurt my ears while wearing them. The only good thing i can say is they were fairly easy to pair and they don't seem to fall out of the ear. Maybe I got a &#34;bad batch&#34; but I will not be taking any more chances since Amazon charged me $6 to return them. I will be looking elsewhere, and I think you should too."
1,"Even better then my last purchase. Best Bluetooth head phones for the price.<br />Best Bluetooth headphones available on Amazon period!!!!<br />For those skeptical minds, no I don't work for Sensor, nor am I being paid for my review.<br />I work out 3-4 days a week and I need Bluetooth headphones that can keep up. These headphones get the job done."
1,"Sounds great, fits my ear good even while running, very affordable."
0,"The second pair just broke and it's out of the return window, only had it for 2 months.  Don't buy this piece of junk."
1,It works as expected. The cord moves around sometimes and becomes annoying. I also need to constantly push it into my ear or adjust the clips. I just use it in the gym to get some sound and I don't expect an impressive high quality sound.
0,Constantly beeping at twice the volume of what's being heard. Avoid.
0,As a product recommended by Amazon I thought this was a steal.  Turns out it will not turn off and every time you want to use the headphones you need to charge it.  Seems like a waste.  However I called product support and the only thing I did was listen to cable adds.  POS.
1,"I was a little skeptical about these headphones because didn't know much about brand and cost was so inexpensive.  So far really happy that I purchased. The sound just as good and my expensive ones (beats) that broke.  Buds are great and love feature that someone talks to u telling u (not just beep)that headphones are now on and when turning off someone tells u so don't waste battery.  Again, these are just as good as expensive headphones."
1,The sound is incredible on these SENSO headphones. I was able to pair them flawlessly with both my phone and my laptop.
1,Arrived on time. Easy to set up and start listening to music. Have not made a call with them as of yet but otherwise I really like these headphones
1,headphones are covered by our 1 YEAR WARRANTY. This headphone is Up and running fine after 5 years and no issues. never need a chance to buy another headset.
1,My daughter loves them she works out on a regular basis and gets a lot of complements on them. They work great for sit ups and running on the tread mill. So no more wires getting in the way and the sound is great.
1,Im really impressed senso headphones are the best nice cristal sound recommended to anyone the price is really good quality perfect.
1,"Very useful for a service tech’s job.  For the money it is a good deal.  In the field I can take calls and listen to other people talking in front of me. For music quality and comfort, I find headsets are better and more comfortable than earbuds, but these are okay even though they are earbuds.  For listening to music hours on end use a headset.  This is why I gave it four stars instead of five.  This is no black mark, because Apple’s earbuds are similar.<br /><br />However, they have advantages over headsets.  These do the job well for answering short calls in the field without whipping out my iPhone. They are very easy to use and don’t get hot on your ears in the summer like headsets.  Also,  they fit better under a cap during the winter than headsets, because headsets are more bulky.  I recommend them."
0,Used headphones for a week and the right ear went out. They were good until then.
1,To be this cheap these are the best Bluetooth headphones I have ever used. And they look like the beats by Dre
1,"I was a little skeptical about these, but they are great for the price.  Good range, decent sound, and the little extras included are nice.  Used them for jogging the last week and don't know why it took me so long to switch."
1,The sound great and the ear buds are very comfortable. I use them at the gym and prefer them over my Beats.
0,Giving them two stars because they die so freaking fast. Have to charge them almost everyday ...
1,"I love these things. They were just what I was looking for. They fit well, have good sound quality,  give me the freedom to roam the gym with my phone in my locker, and they stay in place during my workout."
0,"These work great for a few months, then quality quickly fades. I used these daily for about 4 months without problem. Now, my bluetooth connection is intermittent, and battery life has been reduced to about 2 hours. Essentially making these worthless. There is some fine print within the instructions that tell you not to use a 'fast charge cable'. My god, what charger out there is not quick charge now? Might be worth another additional $30 investment for an updated bluetooth driver and better overall quality pair of headphones. Disappointed."
1,I tried them and now i want some! Music sounds amazing and they stay in the ear!
0,"Pros<br />- Comfortable to the point that it's not noticeable on your ear.<br />- Sound quality was alright.<br />- Added accessories were nice.<br /><br />Cons<br />- Very low quality accessories. The USB car charger has a low amp and the apple charging cable appears to be already broken even though I just started using it. Should of invested more on the quality of your product, rather than give us irritating and low quality accessories.<br />- Bluetooth 4.1 is outdated. Bluetooth version 4.2 already exists and 5.0 is coming out soon. Higher Bluetooth versions cut back interference, increase range, and even download speeds are faster. Basically this means audio is less likely to be cutoff at a further distance.<br />- Had constant frequency interruptions when I took these to my construction job. Even with a 15 feet radius my audio kept cutting off. Even the slightest movement caused cutoffs.<br />- Calls interrupt audio and don't start it up after a call ends. I didn't have this problem with other earphones.<br />- Low range transmission. Bluetooth 4.0 is supposed to be able to get up to 60 meters maximum. However this product states it only goes as far as 10 meters without interruptions, which I still don't believe is highly accurate. The product should at the very least have 30 meters without interruptions, given there is nothing to interrupt the transmission. However that's not the case.<br /><br />The purpose of me getting a wireless earbuds was for me to be able to move around and do things while my phone is near, but not inside my pocket. If my phone is meant to be inside my pocket to use these earbuds, I rather just get corded earbuds. I just don't quite understand what's the purpose of these. I guess I'll have to wait for Bluetooth 5.0 earbuds to come out which don't have the transmission of 15ft. Understand also that I purchased two of these. Both experienced similar issues."
1,Very good for the price. Has great audio and the buttons work very well.
1,Senso headphone are great! They have a wonderful sound they sound better then beats and they don't cost that much. I encourage anyone to try them you will be satisfy.
1,"I received my headphones several weeks ago and they work very nicely. Its great not to be tethered to my phone while I'm working out and the headset do a good job of reducing the noise around you. My only complaint, and its a minor one, is that the cable that hangs between the ear pieces tend to get caught on my shirts when turning my head and pulling on the ear pieces a bit but they stay in place."
0,"They were amazing for the few uses i got, they stopped taking a charge after about a month maybe 25 days. maybe it was something i did. Not Sure."
1,Everything it is very good
1,"I haven't read any reviews on here, but just wanted to share my opinion on the bluetooth headphones from SENSO. The reason why I am giving it 4 stars is bc they are solid headphones nothing special tho. Music isn't that great on these, but they do give you abunch of tools & additives like a cool charger for an Iphone & the device. Also a car 2 USB charge port. If you really like listening to podcasts or books on audio you'd enjoy this product. If you are all about sound quality with the newest songs I would look elsewhere"
1,The mic is not good... sometimes people tell me I sound like a robot but sometimes ot works
0,"I purchased these headphones about a month and a half ago and they already do not work. I was just listening to them in my home, didnt really start using them to work out and they just stopped connecting to devices... It isn't even discoverable for new devices and when I try to reconnect with my phone, it says it cannot detect the headphones.<br /><br />The sound is decent for what you are paying for... If they functioned properly I would give them 4 stars. It is what it is... Hopefully I get a refund or a replacement... Definitely buy insurance just in case."
1,Good quality and easy to use. They really do last @8 hrs. per charge. I highly recommend these.
1,I love the range they have when working around the house. Great clarity.
1,Good
1,to sleep with and cancel out the ringing in my ear
1,"The fit is great, the sound is good, and so far I am happy. If I get a year out of them I'll be happy."
1,They don't fall out!!! That's all I wanted!
1,"I love these headphones for their comfort and sound quality.  When I am sitting up or lying down on my back they are fantastic and all the buttons work well<br />I just had cervical surgery and cannot move my neck to read so am listening to audio books.  When I turn on my side while in bed, the on/off button turns on and off with the movement of my head/ ear so side listening doesn't work for me.  Wish the buttons were on the wire.<br />But yet again these are very high quality headphones."
1,Headphones are working great.
1,Best value!Great ear buds. Easy to set up.Sound is terrific.Great for working out.I would recommend this product to anyone looking for some awesome wireless ear buds!
1,Some connectivity issues.  Will continue to test.  They are very comfortable.
1,"I have only had these for a couple weeks but have nothing but positive experience so far. Great sound and very comfortable. The flexible over the ear piece is such a great feature. I have not been able to find headphones that fit on/in my small ears but these do. My only complaint is that the volume doesn't go lower. When in a quiet space the volume can be a little loud on the lowest setting. So far, worth every penny. Couldn't ask for something better, especially at this price."
1,"Wow! Great price, great bass, and the ONLY pair of ear buds that fit in and around my fickle ears and don't fall out! Bluetooth connectivity is the best I've experienced so far- MUCH better all the way around than my previous Plantronics Backbeat Fit ear buds. Great product, Senso!"
1,"Love these headphones!! So nice not having a cord when running or lifting. The battery life lasts pretty long, I can go about a week without having to charge them. My brother and friend both got some after me and they both love them too! Definitely a workout essential!"
1,"I have had these a few weeks and have been great for me. Fit is nice, easy to connect and once you get use to the controls a snap to use. I am pleased."
1,UPDATE:  The headphones after 8 months of use decided to die on me.  No worries because they have a one year warranty that customer service was more than happy to replace them at no cost.  The only complaint I have is when changing speeds/direction while running and jumping the last month of use the headphones were starting to cut out and this may have been a precursor them dying on me.  I would highly recommend the 4 year warranty for $9.<br /><br />These headphones for the $36 I paid for them are worth every penny.  The sound is good.  They are comfortable/lightweight and don't move while running or during HIIT workouts.  The accessories are what really got me though.  The package came with two USB chargers one short mini USB and the other is a iPhone/mini USB combo charger and also a car charger.  Would never pay the original $169.99 but would pay $50 or a little more if I could've tested them out first.
1,Great sound and pairs easy.
1,"So far, so good"
1,For the price these headphone are awesome! Great battery life and sound! Plus all the extras that come with them!
1,Great option for the price. They connection well to blue tooth. Good quality sound. Fit comfortably for biking. I have not used them running yet.
1,As advertised
1,"Just got the ear buds, but so far they are as described and sound great. Invotek was easy to work with - package was shipped and received as promised."
1,I bought these Senso bluetooth headphones and am very happy with them.  I wear them at the gym every day and they are very comfortable and stay in my ears.  The battery life is outstanding.  Very happy and highly recommend them.
0,"I just received these this afternoon.  So far I think they are just ok.  The sound is excellent and I love the included accessories.  For me the foam buds work best and fit nice and tight in my ear but the pieces that go around my ear are too large for my ear.  If these were adjustable I would probably give these 5 stars.  As of now I don't think they will stay put when I run.  Also, I was hoping these would fit under my motorcycle helmet but no change of that. They stick off of your ear way too far.  Overall I think they are an excellent value.<br /><br />EDIT: After spending more time with these I am dropping my review down to one star. I hate them. I've tried all of the different ear bud pieces and these just will not stay in my ears no matter what I do."
0,These stopped working after barely a month.
0,"I just received these and I am very disappointed! The rubber backs are made of a very bendable silicon and because of this, they do not stay on my ears while I'm running. I thought the backs would be hard plastic, but apparently not. I expected better quality for the money I spent on these."
1,"A Bluetooth headset for under $40 with a 4.5-star rating with over 12k reviews?  I had to buy and try just to see what all the hype is about...  Only had them for a day so these are initial impressions:<br /><br />- Packaging, accessories and instruction manual are surprisingly good, especially considering the price.<br />- Product fit and finish again, surprisingly good...<br />- Controls are well located, easy to use and functioned as outlined in the user manual.<br />- Pairing was simple with my iPhone 6s.<br />- I was surprised the headset had voice response.  Impressive for the price.<br />- Sound quality is not good.<br /><br />Sound quality is where this product fails.  It's pretty bad.  The tonal balance is bass heavy, made worse because the treble is so recessed.  There is an overall lack of clarity. The sound is muddy and muted in the mid-range and treble.  It's kinda like when someone puts a towel in front of a speaker; all the detail goes away.<br /><br />My 3-star rating is positively impacted by the fact this is a BT wireless headset that actually worked and was purchased for under $40.  It would be 1-star based on sound quality.  I can't comment phone call quality as I haven't used it for this application.  Can't comment on battery life either, Same for reliability or durability, both of which are important in determining a products ultimate value (I'll try to update the review in a few months).  Buy this product if you don't care about sound quality.  If you enjoy music and care about sound, buy a wired earphone.  There are a number of wired earphones that deliver way better performance.<br /><br />5/22 Update - Wanting another opinion on the sound quality of these ear phones I asked my son to have a listen.  He's a music enthusiast who has a variety of ear and headphones.  Once paired to his phone he listened for about 15 minutes before stating, &#34;these don't sound very good.  The sound is like what would happen if you put a wad of tissue paper in your ear, then put in a good set of earbuds.  It's all mushy and bassy.  Do people think these sound good?&#34;  So, my observations were confirmed.  As stated in the original review, these are 1-star on sound quality."
1,"I love these headphones, great sound and bass"
0,"After using the products for about a week now I had to return them. The only reason I purchased these and not the upgraded one is because the amount of positive reviews customers gave it. Here are my pros and cons for this product.<br />Pros:<br />Good (not great) sound, they look and feel like a good quality product, they stay on your ear when running<br />Cons:<br />They're bulky, the ear-hook and ear pieces start hurting my ears after on an hour of use, they start losing connection after 10 feet not 30 feet (as specified), the cord continuously sways side-to-side when running"
1,One of the best pair of wireless headphones I've found. The charge lasts and has great sound quality!
0,It is not good if you wear them and exercise specially for running. You need to adjust them every few seconds.
1,"comfort A+. ive worn these for 8 hours and sometimes forgot there on my ears.  they pair instantly A+.  sound quality?  B-. do not sound as good as the Otiums, or Smartomi era, both low price ear buds and as comfortable.  i had to process the to make them sound as good.  overall very good."
1,"First of all, I would like to thank all of the Amazon users who left feedback on these headphones.  Had I not read their feedback, I would have been too skeptical because of the low price point.  These are perfect and stay in my ear at the gym.  I know some users complained about the telephone static on phone calls but, I don't answer calls while working out so save a few hundred bucks by ordering these headphones."
1,"I was looking for wireless headphones that had a longer battery life, good sound quality, and didn’t cost a fortune. THESE WERE EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. I highly recommend these!"
1,"After a couple a couple of days of use, I am really liking these ear buds. They're light weight and comfortable, and the sound is surprisingly sharp and clear. Even the bass is pretty decent for speakers this size."
1,Really did not get a chance to wear. It would not stay on my ear.
1,They worked well especially for the price.<br />They do just kind of die over time but everything does. We probably got about 8mo worth of average use from them.<br />We bought 3 pairs for our sons and they worked as I would expect for the price I paid.
0,Sound is very tinny not worth it
1,"Works great! Best I've ever had.  They broke in my pocket, the stem for the bud it self is liable to break."
1,Light and easy to pair with my phone
1,"Really liked these earbuds.  Purchased in April 2017.  But now, just after a year, after a full charge immediately after connecting to my phone they start to beep and after 30-40 turn off and disconnect.  I guess the rechargeable battery only lasts so long.  Real shame as they had excellent sound quality.<br /><br />Update - After customer service suggested plugging unit in and holding down power button for seven seconds - Viola!  No more beeping.  Haven't tested them for several hours yet, but looks promising.  Back up to five stars!<br /><br />I ordered a replacement pair from Amazon that were on sale for $18 but they are really mediocre compared to the Senso.  Not even in the same league.  The Senso really have excellent bass."
1,ok product ...
1,My 12 year old son wears these while he shoots hoops and loves them.
1,Excellent product and good sound quality
1,These earbuds/headphones work great. I run a lot and these stay in my ears.
1,"Awesome sound clarity is just like unbelievable, for the price you can't beet it. Loving it"
1,"Received my order extremely fast. Love them they work great. These were for my husband, he's old pair was wearing out so I ordered him a new pair. These are even better than his old ones when they were new. This company and brand is improving from order to order.<br /><br />Having a reliable headset is a must for my husband. He works construction and needs both hands, but also needs to be able to talk to clients when they call."
1,"Mr. MVP got an iPhone 8 plus, which was an upgrade from an iPhone 6s Plus so he lost his headphone jack. He is a runner, so dealing with headphone wires has never been his favorite thing, especially with our Aussie and her ability to get tangled up in anything that comes within 20 feet of her head, but adding a dongle to the equation was just too much. I looked at maybe fifty pairs of bluetooth headphones ranging in price from $200 to $20 and was so overwhelmed I almost just picked the most expensive pair and ended the insanity. These Senso headphones repeatedly showed up on lists from people who wanted a solid pair of bluetooth headphones for running that were both affordable and waterproof. I read through nearly every single review and and decided for $30 I could afford it if they did not work. Right out of the package, Senso proved the lists and reviews correct - $30 is sometimes a really good deal.<br /><br />What Mr. MVP really likes:<br /><br />1. The headphones themselves fit over his ears with the little loop which prevents any slipping while he is running. This is functional in the best way possible because his ears often don't hold on to headphones very well.<br />2. He was able to change the earbud size because there were multiple sizes included in the package. The size that came preloaded was too big, so he popped them off and had a new perfectly fitted pair right there.<br />3. The cord that attaches the two headphones may seem silly, but he actually uses this a lot. When he is getting ready for his run or when he has just returned home he can easily take the earbuds out of his ears and put them around his neck until he has his sneakers (on) off and has our Aussie settled.<br />4. The whole thing was easy to pair to his phone. We have a bluetooth speaker that is an absolute nightmare to pair with our iPhones, but these took less than 30 seconds and I'm even thinking my Mom and Dad could easily do it.<br />5. The headphones last about five days on one charge, which is a fairly long time. He runs one 5k every morning and walks two miles every night while listening to music or podcasts so having headphones that don't need to be charged every night is super convenient.<br />6. They have really nice sound without completely dulling out the sound of the environment around him. He runs in a nature preserve, so hearing cars is not important (there aren't any), but hearing other people and animals is. He can turn his music up but still hear what is going on around him.<br /><br />What Mr. MVP does not like:<br /><br />1. He gets really sweaty - think wet - during his runs and having earbuds that came off that I could wash would be really nice. I know this pair of headphones is water resistant, but I'm thinking a pair of earbuds that I could wash with soap and water. This is more function than form."
1,"Perfect for running or working out, or just chilling, battery lasts a couple days, and it still works after getting sweated on, plus the sound is really loud and clear, with good bass."
1,These are great headphones. The quality is good. They sound good. The accessories that come with them are awesome. I didn’t expect all of that. I recommend these headphones to everyone.
1,"Wore for the first time this morning...these phones stay securely attached to your ear, and the sound is amazing! Highly recommend!"
1,These earbuds are great for playing music while working out or listening to podcasts while walking or commuting to work. The sound quality is super! The bluetooth pairing is simple and does not require re-pairing frequently like with some bluetooth devices. The buds are comfortable and stay on even while working out. These are a great value and have exceeded my expectations.
1,"The sound and comfort on these are good. BUT, only after using four times of very light use, they will no longer charge. Tried all troubleshooting methods and nothing. Attempting to contact Invotek and will update if problem is remedied.<br /><br />Updated: I contacting the company and they were extremely helpful. They shipped out a new pair ASAP and so far the replacement work good. Only time will tell how long they will hold up. Will update further if any problems arise. Otherwise, good sound and easy connectivity."
1,Sounds great. Didn't expect this sound bass and all at this price
1,Pleased with both seller and product.  Teen says they work great!
1,Love the sound but the ear plugs dont fit well on left ear no matter what size I use
1,amazing
1,Easy set up.  I only use them at the gym but they connect right away and stay in place no matter what I’m doing- running on treadmill or working out on a machine.  Comfortable too. I’ve had ones with plastic ear holders but these are soft and comfy. Thanks for a great product that meets my particular needs. Almost forgot to add- great sound too!!
1,Just have to say wow
1,Update on the update I went to senses  and the customer service was awesome.  they sent me a new pair that work great.  I can't say enough good things about this company Update Well I have had these two months and they no longer work.  blue light comes on is if they're charging but don't turn on or pair .  very disappointed will try and send them back I'll let you know how that works out<br /><br />So far so good. Sound is decent. They pair easily. The controls are easy and more intuitive than expected. Range is about 15ft from iPhone. I've had  them a week. If you get out of range the easily re-pair.
0,"Price is good Sound is not.<br /><br />Sound is too flat and there isn't mach of ranges. it's just fine but i wouldn't recommend it for any of my friends. The good thing it comes with so many gadgets for the price. I really hoped that they would be good, But i kinda knew based on the price."
1,"great sound, amazing value. received them fast and exactly as described. they connected easily and I'm very happy. 😊"
1,just what I wanted
1,Thank you for making headphones that actually work .
1,I’v Just used them once so far so good I’m not sure how to use the grey cord and what size buds to use yet do you take off the ones that are on them when they came and put a different size on?
1,"I bought this for my two mile walks that I do 2 or 3 times a week. I was quite impressed with what came in the packaging, especially the compact and nice-looking hard leather case with net. That makes it a breeze to carry along. I can't talk of the battery life because my walks are about an hour and I recharge the headphones every week. No issues there at all. The phones fit snugly and the sound is great. I will admit that I am rather easy to please but this does exactly what I need it to do."
1,I have j birds this is what I was looking for when I bought the birds!!
1,Good sound and loud enough for my Dad to hear without his hearing aids.
1,Sounds good Love it
1,"When I first received these headphones I had an issue with the sound quality. I wrote the distributor and they immediately got back in touch with me to resolve the issue. Apparently there was an issue with the calibration and the distributor walked me through on how to re-calibrate the headphones. After that was done, the music sounded much better / no complaints. The connectivity is great and the battery lasts a long time. The fit is comfy and when the large loop allows you to remove the bud from your ears and let the buds dangle from your ear so you can have a conversation with someone or just have them out temporarily to hear around you. You can also just have the cord around your neck and just let the buds dangle around your neck. The buds fit snug inside the ear and have a noise canceling effect. I’ll often have the buds in my ear with music at a low volume and my wife will come up from behind and start talking and I don’t hear her. She thinks I am just ignoring her but it’s actually I really can’t hear her from the snug fit of the ear bud. For the $, this is a great pair of headphones. Would recommend to a friend to buy, just don’t get in trouble with your significant other."
1,"Worked great and came at a great price. I did wind up having a small issue with them where they wouldn't hold a charge. I sent an email to their  customer service and they're already sending me a brand new pair. Can't beat this kind of service, especially not for this price."
1,Great headphones for a great price
1,"I might have already wrote a review a few years ago, but my pair finally crapped out after constant use. For $20 I will gladly buy a replacement pair. For running or the gym, who wants to be wired to their cell phone? The quality is excellent, they hold a charge for many hours, and stay put in my ears. Don't know why they stopped working; one day they just wouldn't turn on. But after four years? Totally worth it!"
1,Works great. I work out a lot and they are perfect. Sounds quality is really good. The mic works great. Good accessories. I'm just ready to see the longevity of the headphones.
1,"I ordered 2 pairs of wireless headphones from amazon that I sent back before finally ordering these. I love these headphones!! They are comfortable, the sound quality is great, mic quality is good, the range is excellent, & most importantly - they aren't constantly falling out of my ears. This is my 3rd day using these & they still have a pretty full charge. I ove that they came w/ case too. I definitely recommend these"
1,"I loved these for a while, however with a full charge they shutdown after a few minutes.  Still shows full charge when I turn back on.  This would be 5 stars without this problem."
1,Had many expensive buds but these are the best .I run and bike in them they are comfortable and stay on
1,tem arrive on time. Headset works as advertise. Sound is clear and loud. no complaints so far
1,They are really good .worth the money.Great sound. Easy to use
0,The connection with my phone began to get bad after the second months. It couldn't not connected with my phone literally after 4 months.
1,I love these headphones.you can’t go wrong for the price.
1,best bluetooth headphone.
1,I bought this for a Christmas gift for my grandson.  I purchased completely on the feedback from other customers who ordered it.  It looks great but have not opened it because it's a gift.  Three stars based on looks only.
1,"I bought 2 pairs because I had one from a year ago that was stolen from my car. The part that goes over your ear is flexible and you can mold it so the headphones are pretty much guaranteed not to fall off. I work as a housekeeper so this is very important. The old ones ended up in a toilet maybe more than once. Im also very impressed with the battery life,mine usually lasts more like 9-10 hrs. One pair of my headphones didnt work right on arrival, but the replacement works great."
1,I'm very excited to give these as a gift! They seem like they will be perfect for working out in....not all of the wireless ear buds that I checked out were waterproof so that's a huge plus.
1,These are awesome and come with all the options you need!! Good job!
1,Amazing!
0,"There is background noise when the headphones are played at lower volume levels, like listening to music or videos indoors. I sent it back to get a refund. Not worth it."
1,After going through the reviews I had high expectations from this product.  The product was timely delivered and I am satisfied with its sound quality and comfortness. The earphone was upto my expectation. I would definitely recommend this earphone.
0,They will not hold a charge.  Once you charge and put in storage case.  The charge will not last!
0,"nunca imagine que tuviera que se cortara la señal de mi celular al audífono por movimiento en un rango de no más de 1 metro de distancia de uno al otro.<br /><br />El peor articulo que he comprado en Amazon, realmente bote mi dinero."
1,No one can hear me on a phone call.
1,"Since they worked flawlessly, I did not want to part with them and ordered a replacement pair.  I experienced a problem with the new pair and so I contacted product support.  This time they answered my question and I implemented their recommendation. and so far I have not had any more problems with the Headphones.  I will update my review as I evaluate the product.  Update:  I have written to their product support and I described how to make improvements to the product but they have not replied.  They need to improve battery consumption as I don't want to recharge them every day and that is what my recommendations address.<br />I am very disappointed with the lack of response from their support staff.  This product does have consumption mishandling issues that apparently their support staff either cannot work on their own product or do not want to.  The bottom line is that this product does have some issues that should be fixed but as to when they are going to, it's an unknown.  I do not understand their silence.  I do not undestand why they don't make the improvements as I outlined to the manufacturer"
1,good
0,"Although the headset had good sound quality, in nine days time they developed static and within 10 day I noticed one side no longer functioned at all.  Very poor quality product.  I would suggest you pass on this purchase."
1,"LOVE THESE!!!  After contemplating expensive name brand headphones I just couldn't bring myself to paying $150 plus!  I just happened to come across these on Amazon and they had a lot of positive feedback so, I decided to take a chance and I was not sorry! If you're looking for some inexpensive headphones that have quality sound, well look no further! I 100% recommend these! I love them!  If name brands is where its at for you then go pay your $150 plus.  As for me, these guys serve their purpose and then some!"
1,The bass is not very good on these. I broke my last pair which had no issues at all. I actually preferred the old ones to beats. These are not so good
1,"Great for the gym.  I set my phone down and go do my thing.  Don't even need to have the phone in my pocket.  Very comfortable, can't hardly feel them on your ears."
0,"The reason I purchased these was to use them for swimming.  However, if any of the headphone is submerged in water the sound stops in the earphone."
1,"After eye-balling these headphones for a couple months, I finally gave in and just bought them a week ago and they work great so far. I have a Samsung Galaxy phone and the bluetooth connects just fine. I'm not sure about the accuracy of the negative comments but I found these headphones were built pretty well and the sound quality is sufficient to my liking. I set my phone down while playing pandora and walked about 40 feet away and they still were connected. I also like how they came neatly packaged with a carrying case, extra rubber ear buds, and a magnetic car mount for your phone. I'll probably never use it but it's the thought that counts. If anything changes down the road, I will be sure to update my review but so far so good.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B01G8JO5F2 SENSO Bluetooth Headphones, Best Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7 Waterproof HD Stereo Sweatproof Earbuds for Gym Running Workout 8 Hour Battery Noise Cancelling Headsets]]"
0,I notice a Background electrical noise while play musics or sounds.  Can't fix it and it is very unpleasant.
1,They actually have pretty decent range and bass. Very pleased for the price point.
1,"love them, holds a charge for days!"
1,"These are a pretty great product! Comfortable and high quality. The sound is not as great as some other products. It tends to be muffled at times. However, it is still an excellent product and great for working out."
0,"update:  received replacement headphones and have not experienced the same problem.  However, the rating remains the same because 1) the headphones are finicky when more than one bluetooth device is available (e.g., ipad, Amazon Echo, laptop) and 2) short battery life.<br />  Product quality is fine, needs more evolution to work well in common circumstances.  Until then, will be going back to wired headphones.<br /><br />stopped working after 3 months.  excellent 24/7product support troubleshooted and is sending replacement headphones, but cannot give good rating when they stop working after 3 months.  When they do work, sound is fine for listening while exercising.  there is wind noise when running, it is not noticeable when volume is turned up"
1,The ear hooks could be stronger good for sitting at a desk not so much for working out
1,"Was impressed by this pair of earbuds, great sound, good soundproofing, quickly pair/connect and held steady while working out (cardio 2x a week). But 1.5 yrs later now the left one seems to be failing - sounds like a bad connection, very annoying! When I fuss with the cable attaching the earpiece to the cable it seems to be better, thus I conclude the cable is becoming unconnected from the left base when I move. Maybe just my pair and not a huge investment but would have been nice to have lasted longer 2-3 yrs given I used max 3times a week. The other bad thing about these is that people can not really hear you well during a call."
1,Great Sound!
1,"For the price, best wireless headphones available.  A minimal charge for 6+ hours of use.<br /><br />**Update -  Mine somehow developed a slight wear in the rubber on one side & the play quality was affected, even though this pair is surprisingly well-made (in a world of sub-par products)  The company was very graceful and promptly sent me a replacement pair.  The top-tier customer service is much appreciated, and I recommend these to any friends & family looking for bluetooth headphones."
1,Awesome headphones in my opinion
0,"Bluetooth loses connection almost daily.  Purchased twice thinking that the first set was a fluke, but it turns out that it wasn't.  I have reset several times and that only fixes the problem temporarily.  Do not recommend."
1,"Great sound, easy to set up and they don't fall out when running. Highly recommend"
1,"I just received these headphones and have used them at the gym, love them. The sound quality is awesome and they stay in place. I highly recommend these to anyone who works out. I needed a headset that would stay in my ears while weightlifting and running, these are it."
1,"Thank you for your message.  The two sets I purchased came as advertised.<br />We use them while we are biking and I was a little surprised by the excessive amount of wind noise that I was able to hear, but that being said they are comfortable to wear and the sound is great.<br />Again, thank you for your follow up on our purchase..."
1,These are fantastic!!! I am very happy with my purchase. I recommend these headphones and I have told many of my friends about them. &#60;3
1,"So far so good. Easy to pair, nice clear sound--louder compared to the LG Tone I replaced with these."
1,"I wanted to try wireless headphones for the gym and bought these on the strength of their reviews.  Easy to use, lightweight, not the worlds greatest sound but I wasn't expecting too much.<br />The problem I have with them is the fit.  The ear pieces are really flexible, and I wonder if something stiffer and maybe adjustable for shape might be better.  Now here's the weird thing-one ear fits fine, and the other doesn't.  I have never noticed that I have deformed ears, but I'll be darned if I can get the right side to fit as well as the left.<br />All in all, an OK purchase, but I'm not giving it 5 stars....."
1,Very nice and convenient headset ! Easy to use and fast charging.
1,"I use these everyday - very good sound quality, reliable and good battery life.  You cant go wrong with these for the price point!  I would recommend these.  I have used many other wireless earbuds and these stack up well against more expensive options."
1,Its very good for this price looks just like beats head phone.
0,Had it for one week and the multifunction button already didn't work! I guess you get what you pay for... I'm very unhappy with this  purchase . Don't recommend .
0,"Worked fine until it didn't.  I used it to work out, so perhaps the sweat took it toll."
1,"Well designed, comfortable, good sound."
0,"These headphones have great sound quality ... when they connect. My pair seem to have a connection problem, they won't connect when my phone is in my pocket or if I'm holding my phone in the wrong place. Sometimes they will connect but as soon as I walk outside it gets choppy. Other people report being able to go across their house but mine lose connection at about 3 ft. I use them when biking so my phone is in a case on my frame, but I can't use them day to day because the sound cuts out."
1,"Great fit, good sound and fairly priced.  Appreciated the storage case too."
0,I loved them until they refused to turn on a month later
1,The sound is really great. What I really love about it is that it fits my small ears. The charge lasts a long time.  I've gone all day & still have some charge left. The controls are easy to find & use.
1,"Great sound ,decent battery, wish it was a bit smaller"
0,I had these for a month. Used them 3x/week and made sure they were charged. Now they die after 15 minutes after being fully charged. And I do make sure to turn them off when not in use.
1,They are amazing
1,"Just bought these to replace a different brand that I had broken.  Only used them a few times so far, but they are very well made and have excellent sound quality."
0,"Update*** yeah, save your time and $$$, and get a better pair. After sending me a message to find out what the issue was, they copy pasted an irrelevant solution message, which did not work. Since then, crickets— despite their suggestion that the unit was under warranty.<br /><br />I bought my first pair in 2017 and really liked it. The sound quality was fair and Bluetooth connection worked just fine unless it was windy outside. I unfortunately yanked the chord by accident and I had to purchase a new pair in August 2019. By this time Senso replaced the harder plastic that clips on your ears with a more flexible, malleable one. This version was harder to keep on, especially when working out in an interior environment. The sweat made the clips easily slip off. It stayed on much better while running outside. But after less than a year, the unit stopped charging. When I connect the USB chord, the charging light does not turn on anymore. Ultimately, it's a decent, affordable product but it has a short life span."
1,I purchased these headphones recently primarily to use in the gym so that I wouldn't be attached to my iPod. These headphones are great. The sound is loud the bass pump strongly and the over-the-air attachment is flexible so that can be molded to your ear. I have often walked away from my iPod with these in my ear and didn't realize my iPod wasn't with me for 30 or 40 ft. At the low cost of this product I'm confident it will rival many many other Bluetooth headphones that cost a great deal more. I highly doubt you'll go wrong purchasing these. My pair included a charger that work with both Android as well as iPod connections this was just icing on the cake.
1,This company knows how to earn customer loyalty!<br />  I've been happily using my Bluetooth headphones for months but I somehow changed something yesterday and couldn't get the headphones to turn on.  I emailed Senso customer service--and got a reply immediately-and it was on a holiday weekend!<br />  I followed the instructions I was given and the headphones are working well again.<br />  Not only does Senso make a good product but the customer service is top notch.
1,Bluetooth works effortless and I haven’t had any problems with the headphones since I got them. Easy to use and would recommend them. I would only make them a tidy bit smaller though for aesthetic
1,They are great. I use them in my hot tub to listen to music.
1,Great item very good sound very confortable you can use for music or talking and wont be disapointed
0,"I would not recommend this product to anyone, first this product does not connect to more than one device at the same time and the range that the advertised you u do not get, they said that this a sport head set but when you are in motion there is a lot more static you have to stand still. I am very disappointed with this product"
1,Just started using them but I'm already in love with the sound !!!
0,"I was enjoying my headphones. Only 6 weeks into purchasing, as I was using them, they shut off and now do not work and not able to charge. Suprised this happened"
1,"These headphones are nice quality , packaging is great. Comes with a few cool things. The only reason I didn't give a better review is because I feel I was tricked. If this is what I was looking for then GREAT but the biggest reason I bought them was because the false advertisement of cancelling background noise. You can actually hear more background and more vivid than the headphones I had before that DID not say noise canceling , if you don't care about the road or everything else in the background being in your conversation GO FOR IT. Just makes me question if all the other things these claim to be is true."
1,They work great majority of the time. Occasionally the connection is weak and requires turning off and on again. Not a fan of the over the ear piece but I bought it for the price. The sound is nice. The pairing with my device took a while but now syncs pretty quickly. Had difficulty changing out the different size earpieces. It's also a little bulky if you want to wear ear muffs.
1,I love it really good sound
1,"I bought these for bike riding, running & jump roping. While doing these activities, I just need a beat to keep things in rhythm, these do EXACTLY that- without falling out. If your looking for a complete sound experience or complete noise blocking capability, these are not what you're looking for- they are NOT built for that. These are a great product for the outdoors at a great price!"
1,Very happy with the sound and quality of the headphones.  Instructions easy to follow.  Delivered in a very timely manner.
1,Very clear earphones.  Great product.
1,"Loved these for almost 2 years until they fell apart.  Not bad for a $20 item, but trying a different brand for my next ones."
1,They work well doing a job of a Plumbing Contractor.
1,"I ordered these for my 12-year old son for Christmas. Here is his feedback. Pros: Great sound quality, cancels out background noise, they are comfortable, charges quickly, nice color, price is great, and he likes that they come with accessories. Cons: He has small ears so while the ear buds are comfortable, they don't stay on; charging cable is too short. Hence, only 4 stars."
1,"I ordered two of these...note, two of the same thing.  What I got is what appears to be two different versions of the headphones.  One had a car charger in it, one has a car mount.  One of the boxes looked opened, and although it had everything in there, the headphones looked almost stuffed in, not neatly arranged like the other box's contents.  Refurbished or returned?  Both sets work, so I didn't return them, but two stars off for the weird mixup of items.  Not sure if I will buy from this company again."
1,great price and sounds good!
0,Very difficult to get in your ears and kind of painful. Very annoying. Too much of a hassle to use.
1,Good headphones
1,"These are awesome!!!  Easy to set up, sound is great and they look nice too."
1,"So these things, for them to be as inexpensive as they are, they work and they work very well.<br /><br />Some of the Pros:<br />The foam earbuds are super comfortable in your ear and you can leave them in for hours.<br />The sound gets pretty loud and really can drown out anything around.<br />The bass is very present.<br />It also comes with replacement earbuds that are rubber if you want those or a different size.<br />The battery life is pretty long<br />Because of the foam earbuds and them molding to your ear shape, it blocks out a good bit of the outside sound.<br /><br />Some of the Cons:<br />As with all foam earbuds they get dirty and fast. Haven't found a way to clean them as yet, but that's nothing a google search can't remedy.<br />The mic is iffy, some people say they hear me clearly, some people say they can barely hear me, but everyone says that my volume is lower.<br />The actual plastic that wraps around your ear is uncomfortable and it hurts after some time<br />Sometimes the bass can be a little muddy.<br />Sometimes the range is iffy too. At times I can go pretty far, other times I can't go more than 2 ft away before it starts cutting out.<br />I don't remember If you can skip forward and back with these, I'm thinking not unless I just forgot how to do it.<br /><br />All in all they're definitely a good contender for some of the higher end competition. With a few minor updates they could be the best headphones yet I'd buy them again and again."
1,It works really well. But the battery life is short because it only sustains 8 hours.
1,Extremely convenient! I love the multifunction button.
1,"Great, I love them,,, plus I saved over 100 bucks by not buying the Beats by Dre,  these sound Goooooooooood"
1,"I had to figure out how to actually use the headphones but once I did, they work great. I have not had any issues."
1,Wonderful!!!!
1,My headline says it all. I've been using them for more than 4 months with any problem.
1,loud and clear
1,"This is my first pair of wireless earbuds. The sound is better than I expected at this price. The fit is great, they stay on, and they are easy to keep clean. I especially like the on/off button and volume control. My only complaint (mentioned by others) is wind noise while running. I tried switching the tips (included) but it did not fix it. It may be a fluid dynamics design flaw given the shape of the earpiece, but that shape also makes them more comfortable than my old wired set. If you're using these for stationary workouts, work around the house, or walking, you won't hear it. Honestly, after a while I got used to it and it didn't bother me. Overall, an excellent purchase. I'm happy."
0,These worked fine for a couple of weeks. Then they started dropping the Bluetooth connection constantly. I can have the phone right beside these and they will drop the connection. Went back to my old set and have no problem.
1,Not exactly what I wanted. Wish it would speak battery life left when it powers on. Little bulky but sound is good. Sometimes people have trouble hearing me but not often.
1,Honestly it’s amazing for me. It’s my first Bluetooth set of buds but they’re honestly quite amazing and for a good price. I accidentally put them through the wash as well but they survived and work perfectly fine. Won’t do that again.
1,"Great, long lasting battery.<br />I haven't tested how waterproof or sweat proof they are but overall a decent buy."
1,Wow satisfied with the product worth the price m hapy made right decision to buy it
1,"These headphones so far have met my satisfaction. The sound quality is excellent, bluetooth connection is easy, and battery life is good."
1,"What can I say? I'm very impressed and have absolutely nothing negative to say about these Bluetooth headphones. They connected easily on the first try, the volume is very strong and they feel extremely comfortable. I like the warranty and the fact that they are waterproof which means that I can wear these while mowing the lawn and working out and the sweat wont ruin them"
1,"I only removed one star b/c the headphones don't really clip on to my ears. It can be a bit annoying to shove the earbuds in, but the clip doesn't fit at all on my ears. I always have to wiggle the ear pieces around until I can get it just right...but they still fall out here and there. Also the star was removed b/c you don't get text message alerts, only phone calls. Other than that, they work well, calls are clear and haven't had any complaints about people not being able to hear me, even on the busy streets of Brooklyn. Overall, great buy."
1,"I've only used these once so far but they were great.  They linked up with my smart phone in its new pouch (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01NH9XJTZ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and I happily listened to my latest e-book while working out at the gym.  I'd been listening to the book in the car and the switch over to the earbuds was no problem, and again no problem when I got back in the car.  It wasn't automatic--I had to tell the phone what device it should talk to, but that was just a couple of clicks.  The sound quality was great--very clear with no hiss or buzz.  I could still hear loud noises, but not casual conversation.  I'd say that you would not hear traffic sounds and should be careful walking or running outside where you were interacting with traffic.  I'm a medium framed woman and the smallest earbuds fit comfortably.  I find time at the gym boring and this product provides comfortable and convenient access to electronic entertainment which means I go to the gym more.  Win/win."
1,Love them! Holds a good charge
0,The headphones broke after less than two months. Never buying these headphones again.
1,Came fully charged.  Love all the additions that came with them.  Bought this for myself and will be purchasing another pair for my husband.  No complaints about them so far!  Great value!
1,I have five different pairs of wireless headphones and these are way better than ones I paid double for.  Well worth it.
1,Great headphones for the price and great battery life.
1,"Comfort. The fit. The sound. Battery life. These are the four primary reason why I love these headphones.  I have several other bluetooth headphones and this pair is the best. They are very comfortable to wear and fit perfectly. I feel the controls are very intuitively placed and very easily accessible. Most of all, I love the fact that it will last hours and hours on a single charge. This is imperative for me while biking or kayaking. The only minor issue I have at this time is that the cable seems a bit stiff. It is not as soft and flexible as others I have but this could be because they are brand new and haven't had time to lose the memory from being tightly coiled for shipment."
1,Absolutely love them while working in garage or yard. Also nice while driving alone in car.
1,Like the new ear buds.  Easy to pair sounds great. Works good
1,"SENSO headphones + Spotify premium = completely satisfied! I was looking for a great sound when I bought these. The sound, in my opinion, is kind of low in high frequences, but great middle frequencies and juicy low frequencies. If you enjoy this sound setting, you will like it. I do. But, what really surprised me is how great the headphones sound with Spotify Premium account on extreme quality. It's just perfect! Plus the connectivity is so fast and strong! Very rare interruptions. Satisfied with the distance! The battery is 8 hours indeed. Tested in gym and even jacuzzi. Ah, and useful bonus items. Pleasant purchase! I keep it!"
1,So far phenomenal... couldn't ask for anything better .. great for gym and I actually use it for my daily use
1,I had to buy these because I lost my Bose headphones. What a steal and no kidding I am just as pleased with these ones as I am my expensive brand. The noise canceling feature really works!!
1,"The headphones sound great for bluetooth.  Also, the customer service is awesome.  I accidentally tore my earbud tip, and they are sending me a replacement set."
1,They are awsome and clear can't beat the price
1,they fit loose and the sound is okay not great.... I am use to have all Bose devices and ended it up buying a Jabra Elite to test it  and use it at the gym I LOVE IT ...now that's my brand JABRA ELITE  you wont regret it... the only problem is the price...
0,Love the headphones but they don't seem to keep a charge.
1,"These arrived in fast time.  Everything was neatly packaged and it came with all the hardware, and few extras that I liked.  The instruction were easy to follow and the bluetooth easily connect to my android phone...as it they belonged there.  They are very light and comfortable to wear and the line comes with an adjustable wire tie that works well.  I took a chance with these to replace my expensive Jabra Sport blurtooth earbuds, which the battery life gave out after 14 months of use.  As a marathon runner, I need my battery life to last at least 5 hours at minimum and sound halfway decent.  These were rated at around 8 hours play time.  For the price of $29, I felt I may take a hit on sound quality and general quality...I was wrong.  Surprisingly, to me, these sound as equal to my expensive Jabras' and present with decent quality and in looks.  The only negative (is why I gave four instead of five stars) is the bluetooth signal. It rates at 30 feet.  However, I've tested these in non-obstructive pathways outside and indoors at the gym. I averaged out at 10 feet in all areas before gaining signal static and play pauses.  And if you wear a water resistant phone arm sleeve, I noticed the sleeve can obstruct the signal intermittently.  Not a big deal for me, I worked it out by turning the phone in an opposite position.  These earbuds aren't the high-end of the market, but for the price, these give some of the more expensive ones a good challenge,  They do very well in comfort and sound for me, and hoping they live up to the &#34;Almost 8-hour battery play time&#34; as stated.  I'll addendum this review on the battery play time."
0,I use these primarily when I mow my lawn.  I keep my phone in my pocket so that I have ready access to my music or if someone should call.  If I turn my head to the right I lose Bluetooth connection and if I turn my head to the left I lose Bluetooth connection.  So basically the distance from the sending source is critical.  If my phone is right next to the headphones it's flawless.  More than 3 feet away and it disconnects.
1,These earbuds are extremely comfortable and the sound is great
1,Love them...lightweight with good sound
1,"EZ bluetooth setup, like the adjustable ear loops/hooks."
1,Great headphone
1,The only issue I have is the cord that connects the two ear buds is too long for me. For the price the product sounds good.
0,"If you are looking for a pair of headphones with a spotty Bluetooth connection and that crap out in the middle of running a marathon, you’ve come to the right place. When I first received these headphones as a gift, the connection was spotty but I chalked that up to my phone being a little older. When I got a new phone, the connection improved... but not by much.<br /><br />This past April, I ran the Boston Marathon. The night before, I made sure that these were fully charged and ready to go only to have them totally crap out at about mile 10 (about a hour and 20 min into the race). Thankfully, I packed my apple headphones as a backup and was able to switch. If it weren’t for the decent sound quality, I would’ve given these headphones 1 star.<br /><br />Save your money and spend them on higher quality headphones."
0,"Enjoyed the headphones while they lasted, died within 8 months of light use."
1,"Still going strong, unfortunately they're uncomfortable!"
1,Great product but won't stay in my ears!<br />Kind Of frustrating!
0,"I can't explain how disappointed I am in this product, especially after reading so many positive reviews.  First, when I opened the box from Amazon, the package for the headphones was opened.  If I want used earbuds, I'll order used earbuds.  Second, they won't enter pairing mode.  I tried all of the suggestions....turned my Bluetooth off on my phone....turned my phone off....nothing.  They simply will not enter pairing mode.  Useless.  I rarely write reviews, and write negative reviews even less.  This product warrants this review.  Ridiculous.  They're going back, obviously.<br /><br />Edit:  I am coming back and bumping this product up one star simply b/c the company has reached out to me a few times since this review.  I followed their instructions on doing a factory reset and the earbuds did connect to my phone and I was able to get them to play.  However, after about three minutes, the connection dropped and I was not able to re-establish a connection.  The sound I did hear for those 3 minutes was pretty solid....better than the bluetooth JBL headphones I've had.  However, 3 minutes won't cut it."
0,"The Bluetooth connection was terrible. Would start having issues if I moved more than 3 feet from phone, moved too much (exercise) or even when walking if i had the phone in my jacket pocket. Phone had to be unobstructed and within 2 feet and no moving to work perfectly"
0,I had to return them. They were not what we thought. The ear loop part was to flimsy. They would not stay on. May work for someone else but not me. The music worked fine. Just would not stay on my ears.
1,I love them. I'd recommend them to anyone interested.
1,They are a bit bulky but an incredible deal for the price
1,Love it!!!
1,Excellent product - very satisfied - sound great - good bass.
1,Works great with kindle paper white. Easy to us and comfort fit. Quickly charged.
1,Love these. Works great.  Easy to use. I wear them running  seam to be pretty well built
0,The ear hooks are not solid plastic therefore do nothing to help keep the earbuds in place. If you are looking for earbuds with solid plastic ear hooks DO NOT BUY THESE.
1,So far so good.Having large fingers controls are easily managed and sound quality is good.Took a chance based on reviews and very pleased early on.
1,"Absolutely the BEST product I have ever purchased through Amazon!<br />I emailed support once before I purchased to verify that they would pair<br />with my iPhone 7 Plus. Got an immediate response that amazed me, that they would.<br /> And they did perfectly! I LOVE these headphones with my active lifestyle<br />or just driving safely hands free. Don't hesitate to buy a pair!"
0,"I bought these because of high ratings and some reviews that said they fit small ears. I'm not a big person 5feet tall with small ears and was hoping the loop would help the earbuds stay in place comfortably, they do not. The loop don't even fit around my ear. I tried turning them but the buds are stationary pointing in one direction. These do not fit small ears. Cant speak to the sound quality because I didn't even bother to turn them on if they weren't going fit. I'm going to have to return them."
0,stopped pairing with my phone after a few weeks
1,"Absolutely wonderful. I use it when I run, and they stay on my ears VERY well. I used to have these huge bulky head phones, and I looked dumb. But I didn't want to spend over $100 for some fancy Beats. These head phones are just as great! Thank you so much!"
1,Love the bass and clarity of both bass and treble. If you don't like too much bass. You can just switch out the ear gel size for a smaller one and the bass will lessen. The great thing is this is already provided. I personally like alot of bass and I'm a super happy customer. It also fits comfortably. Also pretty cool that it comes with its own case and a key chain. 😊
1,"Headphones are lightweight, and sound quality is decent. Bluetooth pairing is excellent and immediate. I've only run with them once so far. The only issue I noticed was that the volume control is a little loose, and creates a clicking noise while running. I'm hoping that this goes away with further use, and potentially if I swap out the ear pieces. We'll see."
1,"These are better than the $150 Google Pixel Buds I have. Perfect for working out, different size ear buds let you choose the size that fits best for your ears. Great value, can't stress that enough.<br /><br />Worked out with them 8 times in the last couple weeks and haven't had to charge them yet. Def recommend my friends,"
1,Been a fantastic shower listening option. My first pair did stop working at about five months it daily usage but their customer support was the best I've ever worked with and they are sending a replacement set. Definitively recommend for the cost.
1,"This is the second time I have purchased these (the first time I accidentally left them in my pants that I tossed in the wash, and I am once again highly impressed by the quality of the headphones and all the features you get with it. I have tried several new, even more expensive, headphones since accidentally ruining my first pair of SENSOs. Nothing compared to my SENSO pair that I had, so here I am again ... rebuying the same item I bought about a year ago. This is as good as it gets for $20, and I would say it destroys even more expensive competition. High quality in every way."
1,"Great product, especially for the price."
1,So Far So Good !<br />One Week Of Mowing in Texas and these have performed perfectly !<br /><br />Highly Recommenfed!<br /><br />Personal email from owners to make sure I am pleased is an added bonus
0,"It was fine for a month,  than buttons failed"
1,"Best Bluetooth ear buds I've had! used these at the gym with my phone about 10-15 ft away sometimes and I never lost connection, really easy to use as well."
1,Awesome  headphones great speakers and noise cancellation. Don't fall off my ears and are really comfortable. Also comes with a car charger and two charging cords.
0,"Used these for about six months, running every other day.  Stayed in, sounded fine, didn't get disconnected, but they just died.  I expected more!"
0,"Today is Sept. 4, they no longer work."
0,"I have only had these for barely a couple of months and they are no longer connecting to my phone and when they did the blue tooth connection was not the greatest. The sound quality isn't bad, but they are already useless.  I feel like I wasted my money."
1,good headphones
1,"Fast delivery.  Quick and easy pairing.<br /><br />Comfort: flexible rings that sit outside the ear.  The inserts inside the ear are not flexible and are a bit uncomfortable.<br /><br />Sound: listening to podcasts, music, or audiobooks have clear and decent sound levels.  Phone calls are also clear talking or listening.<br /><br />Volume control: seems hit or miss.  It’s worked once.  And not since then.  Will recheck instructions but don’t see how up or down can be this complicated.  I can turn up or down volume on phone for volume preferences but without ability to control via earpiece is frustrating.<br /><br />Battery life: I’ll include recharge cords.  Two are included plus adapter for car. With all the options have yet to run out of battery power.  Longest continuous use 4.5 hours.  And while I can’t see a level of power it was still playin fine.<br /><br />Compact carrier: I bought this version instead of the newer one because of the carrier.  And I do like it.  A firm carrier with space for cords and the earbuds.  Zippers close.  Safely tumbles in my purse or backpack with no problems.<br /><br />Overall- this is a great value for the price.  I’ve had it less than 2 weeks and it does what I need for the most part and it was a great price.  A friend had this version and recommended.  I’ve since recommended it to others."
0,Feels cheep and flimsy.  The right ear hook broke off after a few uses. Battery charge only seems to last a few hours. The sound was good. And the Bluetooth connection was good as well  But the overall build quality was poor. I would not recommend these at all. And the price seems to jump around.  As of 10/06/18 the price is $29.98. But when i bought them they were $19.00.  My advice shop around.
1,"I've been using these Senso earbuds for about a week. I'm very happy with the distance they can cover away from my phone and the excellent sound quality they provide. They are very easy to use when changing the volume, advancing my music and taking a phone call.  Feeling very hopeful that these will last longer than my previous earbuds that failed me after about 9 months and cost me twice the price. I'll let you know how I'm feeling about them in a year."
1,"Wow, these sure have good build quality and sound excellent."
0,Despite the numerous amount of good reviews i recieved a pair of headphones that did not work. The sound contantly cuts in and out. Horribly made product. Please send new one! I would not recommend.
0,I liked these but they would not turn on anymore after a few uses.
1,They were very easy for this non techy grandma to pair with my iPad.  The sound is very clear and they will be very useful when going to the gym.
0,"I purchased these hoping they would provide me a good set of &#34;study&#34; earphones that would block out surrounding sound and not be too bulky. I prefer in ear and not over ear. However, for the life of me these would not stay in my ears. I tried all the attachments. And I was even sitting down. I can't imagine what would have happened if I had used them on a run. I emailed INVOTEK and the response I got was to try all the sizes of ear buds, but that &#34;it is possible that due to anatomical uniqueness the size might not be perfect for everyone.&#34; So yeah. I buy their product, it doesn't work, and they tell me my ears are weird."
1,Amazing sound and very good product for good price.
1,"These headphones are great. Good reception, clear sound. They come with lots of charging devices and different size earbuds, which is helpful as the ones that came pre installed were a bit large for my ears, easy to change. These are great for the money and its nice not having wires in the way at the gym, mowing the lawn, etc. Good Job Senso!"
0,"Poor  Sound is the main issue here. I bought these based on reviews here on amazon, and video reviews on youtube. The video reviews praised the sound and some  said they could not tell the difference between these and Beats. Well I can!<br />They are plain vastly inferior. Yes they are loud, yes there is not much distortion...but there is no quality to the sound and I certainly would not waste my time listening to music with these. They sound like something from a bargain store.<br />I am quickly coming to the conclusion that many are the reviews on here are still fake even though they claim to be verified purchases.<br /><br />I DO NOT recommend!"
1,Very good sound quality.
1,The head phones work great. But I brought them to use with my ipod classic.  I brought a blue tooth receiver from amazon and I thought 8 hours of music would be great. But instead the senso headphones only work with my phone. Which is fine but being in construction I don't always have access to electricity to keep my phone plugged.  Other wise great sound and absolutely wonderful fit which is usually for me.
0,After 3 months of use headphones no longer connects to any device. Spend a few extra dollars and get reliable headphones
0,"These earbuds have no range, only work if your phone is in front pocket, connection is frequently interrupted, have underlying hum while connected, do not stay in ear during running workouts despite multiple sized inserts. In general they do not perform as advertised. Company did their best to resolve issues by replacing with a second pair, but both perform in the same manner."
0,These are not waterproof. False advertising! Completely dissatisfied!
0,"I really wanted to love these especially after the stellar reviews others have left but Mine broke in a day of use. The cord came a loose on one ear bud and now it doesn't work. I probably should have just waited on the airpods I ordered from Apple, I was hoping these would atleast last until then :("
1,Charging port malfunctioned after about 10 charges.
1,works great
1,Great headphones. I lost my first pair after 3 weeks and got a new one. I paid $30 but price went down the next day to $25. Wasn't happy about that. But otherwise a happy camper.
1,I am really impressed and what a great price with coupon.
1,"So far they are awsome,  haven't really got to test the battery life yet, but the sound is great."
0,Worked great as headphones but no one could hear and understand me on calls.
1,"I love these headphones. The range is really good (away from your phone) and I use them every single day. When it comes to the gym, these beat having a cord which can rip the earbuds out of your ear."
1,"It's fine, but I wish the Battery life was longer, I would recommended"
1,"I received the headphones quickly. They were packaged very nicely. Though it has only been a couple days, so far, I love them. They are lightweight, fit well, and the sound is excellent."
1,Got these for my dad for his birthday because he’s always struggling to listen to his YouTube videos. He loves them so I love them! Can also answer via Bluetooth when answering phone calls which is a plus for when he is on the road!
0,"I have purchased 5 of these now over the last 18 months because they seem to just stop working all together after 2-4 months.  I thought for the price, I'll just get another.  Well, I will now look for a more expensive brand assuming they will last longer."
1,"Pretty Stoked...My 1st set of &quot;stereo&quot; blue tooth headphones....Needed am for music &amp; podcast while walking the dogs...<br />I generally dont like &quot;bud style headphones as they hurt my ears....but I like the flimsy strap on these that &quot;gently&quot; holds them<br />on my ears if I dont wanna shove em in all the way....Sound quality is great, comfort, excellent, Packaging is A+ the dual<br />Iphone/Android usb cord is killer... paired easy....great price..Good job Senso. And thanks to the other reviewers for their<br />reviews that helped me make my purchasing decision."
1,Great headphones especially for working out!
1,"These headphones are really great. I'm a runner and these are my first wireless headphones. I've been using these for about a month now and they're perfect for workouts! I haven't had Bluetooth connection problems and the headphones last a day of use after a full charge.<br /><br />In terms of wear, you need to be wearing both ear pieces when you're using them (unless you find a clever a way to fasten the other earpiece.) I'm not quite 100% satisfied with the fit of the ear pieces as well. The wing that goes behind the ears are a little big (and my ears are not on the smaller side.)<br /><br />The headphones are a little old school and the notice sounds for calls is an old chime followed by a female voice calling out the phone number.<br /><br />Overall, the headphones are worth the price! They do the job."
1,"I got so much more than I thought I would. Product came with a high quality case, not one but two USB to micro USB cords, with a cool little apple charging adapter for the 3ft cord and a 2 USB port car charging block, plus foam tips as well as gel ones. Oh, and it comes with a free one year warranty, Senso is legit appearantly."
1,Only issue is ear loops to big and flimsy. Overall good product
1,Sound quality is not great but that's not what I was looking for in these anyway. The around the ear piece is flexible rubber so you can mold it your ear and they don't fall off! Would buy again for $20
1,"Bought for Step Son. So these are quotes from him... &#34;Amazing, louder than my Beats by Dre. Looks to be very durable I have only had them for a week or so. They have been stepped on, knocked the volume button out. I put it back in and it still works perfectly. I wear them at work in a high heat environment so they get really wet for sweat, no problems after several 12 hour shifts. Seems to have good battery life 7-9 hours. I get lunch around 6 hours and put 15-20 minute charge on them and they go to the end of the shift and more.&#34; I am impressed enough by his reaction and every day telling me to get a pair for myself that I'm going to get a set in a different color (man i wanted that red) plus what I heard from his set being held up by my ear, loud with good bass and clear highs."
1,"Great sound and fit. However, the range is very poor, when I place my iPhone in my pants pocket the reception gets disrupted."
0,"The only thing I wanted these for was to try to listen to music for my workout but the 8 hr charge is only 45 minutes with &#34;battery low&#34; going off every few second for 20 of those minutes.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />I charged it again after the blue light came up and it charged for another hour; and when I used it the next day,the charged lasted 54 minutes until it started saying &#34;battery low&#34; and then went dead 17 minutes after.  The battery life is very fickle.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />I had charged the headset for an hour to two hours and when I turned them on after an hour at the gym thinking it'd last an hour, after three minutes, the &#34;battery low&#34; voice started going off again."
1,"Great product, linked right up to my strange little MP3 player, and has great sound quality. Not only that, these guys have awesome support. When I reported an issue getting the devices paired they sent along some instructions that straightened me right out. Definitely a great product from a great company."
1,so far so good.
0,"I owned two pairs of the letsfit version. Of these and the were fine for the price. Well those are broke.and so I bought these. These sensors feel cheap to the touch. The audio quality is noticeable worse than the letsfit and the boot up sample sounds blown out. I returned these, because their a  cheap ripoff of an already budget headphone"
1,I finally decided to try these for my runs.  I am so happy I did.  They probably aren't the most audiophile-friendly.  But I'm not an audiophile.  For listening to NPR podcasts they are perfect.
0,"These absolutely did NOT fit in my ears well at all. They felt loose and like they would fall out at any moment. Yes, I tried every ear bud size option, no, none fit. I'm really picky about in ear headphones, and these felt no better than something you could find at Walgreens for $10."
1,"Well worth the money!  I used Dre Beats for a few years but decided not to buy them again after my most recent pair broke.  I'm very glad I went with the SENSO headphones.  They're loud, reliable and they don't break when you sweat too much."
1,"I've had mine for two years when Amazon had it featured as a ""Lightening Deal"".  There are a lot of cheap AirPod knock-offs and most are not very good.  This isn't trying to be an AirPod, as there is a cable between the left and right earbuds but they are bluetooth (thus wireless) to the device.  But these ARE very good- they are durable, lightweight and sound great.  I am no audiophile but I wear them running, biking, mowing lawn and other physical activities and after two years are as good as knew.  My son was impressed that instead of paying 7x for a pair of AirPods he liked these and is happy with them for his Iphone (I use Android).  Mine came with extra ear tips, micro USB cable and a sturdy but lightweight carrying case.  Now it appears they also add a wire tie, cellphone card wallet and car mount- a nice bonus if you need them.  A great value for sure."
1,More than 5 star!!!!!! EXCELLENT!!!!
0,"The battery won't hold a charge past a day, lots of wind noise when riding a bike and it doesn't fit well."
1,I bought these for use while exercising. 7 months in and they no longer charge or turn on.
1,"Update..these were great but recently broke...they just no longer work. Only had them  about 3 months. :(<br /><br />These are great! The sound is clear and powerful, and they fit comfortably in my ears and most importantly STAY in them. I workout 6 days a week for at least an hour and they seem to keep their charge for all those days before having to recharge. You really can't beat the price either...I am so happy I purchased these. :)"
0,The sound could not be worse - tinny and hollow and horrible. I wish I could return them as I really regret this purchase. The battery life is also a joke.
1,I liked the price and sound
0,"the sound is awesome when you first push them into your ears. moving around loosens them and the sound becomes significantly less, with little bass.  they don't stay in place for long. just walking around one of the buds kept falling out. would not buy again"
1,Received my earbuds and was very pleased for the first week. After the first weeks use they needed a charge and we're unable to hold a charge for more than hour. After discussing this issue with senso they were quick to help. After trying to reset the device and a couple emails they were quick to honor the warranty and send me a new set of earbuds that have worked great since. I've drained and recharged them with no issues. Just be sure to register your device if you want the warranty.
1,"Excellent product, regardless of price (it's just nice how affordable they are!). No tangle, easy and comfortable fit. EXCELLENT for the gym."
0,"I've tried a number of wired headphones before and I decided to give these headphones a try because I needed something for the gym and wired headphones kept getting in the way of activities. Knowing that the product had 10k reviews with 4.5/5 stars, I thought I was getting the wireless headphones for the money.<br /><br />But, when I turned it on, connected to Bluetooth and started playing music from Spotify and immediately noticed that the sound is REALLY low quality and it sounded washed out. I'm like, What? These I spent $40 on headphones and they sound this bad, It can't be...So then I tried bumping up the streaming quality from Normal to Extreme quality on Spotify and the audio still sounded washed out. I tried changing phones, to see if it was my phone's (Nexus 6p) Bluetooth that was broken, but on the other phone, it still sounded bad... I came to the conclusion that the headphones are very very low quality and sound worse than headphones you'd get for free.<br /><br />I honestly think that the Skullcandy Ink'd 2 sounds better than these headphones and I'm going to stick with the Ink'd 2's until I a pair of wireless headphones that sound better than a $12.50 earbud."
1,AWESOME wireless headphones.  Used them at the gym and they didn't move an inch and typically i struggle with headphones that can tolerate the various movements in weight lifting.  Excellent noise cancellation resulting in quality sound.  Paired easily with my IPhone 6S Plus and no interruption to signal even when my phone wasn't immediately next to me.  If you are looking for a good pair of reasonably priced Bluetooth headphones look no further.
1,Great product
1,"good quality for the price with added accessories, the sound could be a little louder but with the cheap price, can't complain"
1,enjoying my iPad more not that I can listen without disturbing anyone.
1,"High quality, great price. Very happy with purchase!"
0,"They stopped working after a week, not recommended!"
1,Light weight and comfortable on your ears
1,Right ear speaker is no longer working only after two weeks of use
1,Wanted to buy an around the ear bluetooth head set. Did some research on amazon on the different pricing and reviews and decided on these. I am not disappointed. Deep rich sound out of box when conected to my galaxy s7 phone. Light and comfortable. A price i can live with.
1,Very happy
1,"First, the headphones arrived earlier than expected. On top of that there was an extra high quality charging cable and a car charger. I don't know if that was part of the deal or is it because I'm special. Anyway these headphones are awesome. The earloops are kind of flimsy so I did not expected them to be stay in place. I love the sound coming out of these things. These are the loudest headphones I've owned (the other pair was the QY7 by soundpeats)"
1,"Love the headphones!! I Usually don't review products, although I do read reviews. I have very sensitive ears and it's hard to find any earphones that work well and don't trigger a migraine. These work great!! I left my phone on my desk at work, was able to get all the way to and in the ladies room before they stopped getting the signal. Much further than 30 feet! Also, they are very comfortable and don't hurt my ears. I wear glasses, so wasn't sure how these would work with them, but no issues. I am very highly satisfied with this product!"
1,"Took a long time today read reviews and tech articles before finding these. Was at first pretty sceptical but was then very delighted to find that these are great fiting, great working, headphones! No problem syncing yet, and no problems making phone calls. Highly recommend"
1,"These headphones were the only wrap around the ear silcone tiped earbuds I could find, and so I'm settling on these. That being said, they aren't the best sports earbuds. I dislike the wrap around the ear piece to secure the ear, the sound quality of the product and product size. I like the wireless component of this, it's convienent. Note that I use these for workouts and I'm also an audio guy, so my expectations are higher.<br /><br />Again, I'm not a fan of the wrap around ear piece to secure the earbud and thats because they are too large for my ears. I had to be creative using super glue and my old wrap around ear buds. the audio quality is not anything to rave about, esspecially compared to my Skull Candy earbuds. I have an older model of Skull candy earbuds that aren't advailible anymore, but I'm sure any of their products would out perform this sound wise, but not by much, just enough to notice. Yeah, my old Skull Candy's are wired and these are wireless, but I've head better wireless sound. My last objection is the size of the unit, they are faily large.<br /><br />The few things I enjoy about this unit is the wireless connection and the ability to control volume, take calls etc.. all form the earbuds. I've found the wireless connection to work well, despite the possible sound quality reduction. You can walk a solid five feet before disconnecting. That works for me. Secondly, I enjoy the ability to control volume and not dig my phone out my pocket everytime."
1,great product. I use them for the gym and I am going to buy a second pare for non gym use.
0,"I'm no audiophile but I'm honestly not sure how these have been rated so high unless the masses don't care about sound quality. I've used Sennheiser (corded) earbuds for quite a few years and also had a set of over the ear ones, and while I wasn't expecting much for the price, these had two issues. The majority of my use lately has been doing yard work, mowing the lawn, etc. but was getting tired of dealing with the cord. After ordering the Senso, I was pleased with the packaging, what they had to offer and got them paired to my phone quickly. Listening to Pandora which is how I use my Sennheisers, the sound was VERY bass heavy and couldn't turn the volume up much. The other problem I had using it for the first time, is that regardless if I had my Samsung S7 in my back pocket, or sitting on the trunk of my car within a 10-20ft line of sight, the sound cut out quite frequently sometimes for seconds at a time. I tried moving the wire around by the ear buds and could replicate the sound cutting out a few times but regardless, they had to go back. Unfortunately due to the sound quality alone I just couldn't see keeping these or using them enough."
1,Battery lasted as promised. They fit well. Absolutely pleased!
1,Great transaction and price!
0,Battery overheated and melted headphones just over 1 month from purchase. Avoid!
0,They lasted a year with very little use.  Off to buy something better.
0,I like the quality of the music but the music keeps on dropping. I have been using it for by outdoor runs and the issue exists in all routes that i take. Issue also exists in the gym where I use wifi. Not a great product returning it.
1,I at first loved the headphones. The fit in my ears were superb. The music tone and quality was outstanding. I had two phone calls with them . I was not satisfied with the clarity of either call. They cut out and calls were dropped. One caller said her phone was needing to be charged and thought that might be the reason. The next call I lost the call in an area where my non blue tooth ear buds never dropped calls.<br />I plan on using them in the car in the next day or so this being New Years eve week end. I can use them tomorrow at home to check them out. I was very disappointed with the cutting out and dropped calls.<br />I will call customer service if the calls don't go well. I will probably keep them because of the music capabilities.
1,Just got them and they work well.  The sound quality is very good.  They are easy to use and friendly.
0,"I bought two of these for me and my wife, but both did not stay in our ear so good when running.  We tried all of the different ear tips but none helped. The sound quality has no base, only mids and highs.  I wouldn't buy or recommend,  spend your money on a different one."
0,Got these back in April and had been really enjoying them. Typical use was listening to podcasts while walking the dog so nothing aggressive or rough. Mid-October they would no longer connect to anything. Still got the power on cue but no longer recognizable by any device.
1,I've never had wireless headphones and I'm VERY impressed with these. Sound quality is great. Bass is fair to good. I would highly recommend to anyone to buy these. My wife will be buying a pair soon!!
1,These are pretty decent headphones for the price! My only issue is the around the ear cushion is tooooo flexible. They bend way too easily so they have to be adjusted too often.  Other than that they would have been perfect.  Decent sound and volume!
1,"I like them. Excellent sound, plenty of volume, easy to pair, and great accessories especially the case"
1,"The sound quality is great, this is my second pair. Recently ordered earbuds and comparitiby disappointing, so i ordered these for the second time. Also recommended for both of parents who ordered and love these too. Recommended !"
1,Nice sound and fit.
1,So i would like to say that these headphones were by far thee best headphones ive ever had. They stayed in when exercising and the sound was so stinking crisp. They were such good headphones that somone stole them recently :/
1,"Still going strong, many others have failed at a much younger age."
1,"I use these while jogging and they are so comfortable. Way better than the earbuds that came with my iphone. I barely notice them and I like that I can skip to the next song with the earpiece. I have not used them while talking on the phone, so I am not sure how they will work for that, but I didn't buy them for that purpose."
1,"These are on Amazon's Best Seller List for a reason. Prime member. Delivery on point. Great support and communication with the company, no issues, connects to my Galaxy S7 in less than a second, avid gym member, usually there for 3 to 4 hours 5 days a week and these keep up! If you're like me and hate spending big money on electronics because in 6 months there'll be something &#34;newer&#34; Pull the trigger on these, you won't be disappointed! Jp."
0,Went through 3 pairs of these in 2 months.  I finally just gave up.
1,"I received my SENSO Bluetooth Headphones right on-time, they were well packaged and all the pieces are included.  The sound of these headphones are remarkably clear considering its size.  I would definitely recommend this product and also this company to my friends. ."
1,"These are great for the average music listener or if you're looking for a set you don't mind getting beat up. For me, they're OK on a job site because I don't mind them getting dirty or scratched up. As a minor audiophile, the sound quality isn't there. But that's not why I bought these. Tinny bass, no noise cancellation (they don't claim to have this feature, though), and they like to not stay in place in the ear. But again, buy a high end set if you need better. These are great for what they are. But the battery life, goes a couple days without needing a recharge! These are perfect for my needs."
1,Excellent Product Thanks to amazon
1,Sound and work great.
0,"I have had 4 of these (bought one for me and my wife, a second for me after the first one broke, and a second for my wife after her first one broke).<br /><br />First one stopped working randomly one day, but I thought it was defective. Second one the volume button fell off. 3rd one, stopped working randomly again.<br /><br />I am not a picky person, but these are not worth the $30 if you use them alot."
1,I love these!!! I use them at the gym and so far sweat hasn’t damaged anything. I love the volume control on the headphones itself so handy!
1,"I love these headphones.  They fit perfectly around my ear and sound awesome.  I especially love how good the Mic is.  I use voice text a lot, and always get frustrated when a Mic cant understand what im trying to say.  I deliver Mail for the Post Office, so these play all day long.  Thank you so much for such a great product."
1,Works for the price.
1,So far so good. They stay in my ears which I have issues with in other ear buds. The controls are a little hard to deal with but more usage should improve that situation and I don't want bigger units so bigger buttons would not be better. I'll know more later.
0,"I am extremely dissapointed in this product. I thought it was so amazing that I bought a pair as a gift for Christmas for a relative. These were given to my husband when I purchased them as a gift, however shortly after he got BEAT headphones and no longer needed them so they have not been used much. He gave them to me to start using at the gym, I've used them ONCE since and now they don't want to charge at all. Now I'm thinking I should return the ones we got my brother in law since he hasn't opened them yet. So disappointing."
1,"I wasn't sure what to expect since they are so cheap, but they're great! I've only had them for a week but they were easy to sync to my phone. They came charged. And they are sturdy. Seem more fitting for a male, but I'm super happy for the price."
0,"Worked great for 3 weeks then completely died. Lost connection with phone, then repeatedly said it was on and could not turn off to reconnect, now totally unresponsive after being plugged in for a day. Very disappointing"
1,"These headphones were OK at best. Lots of bass but the highs & mids suffered to a point that it sounded muddy. Even used an app to boost the lacking frequencies without success. If you don't care to listen to the words or clarity isn't super important, these could work for you. I also couldn't get them to stay in my ears regardless of the size tips that I used. I also had issues with wind noise."
1,Works great for running and gym time.
1,"Only used three times so far but I think they're fantastic. Good sound.  Easy to use/charge. Super comfortable, I hardly know they're on my ears. Very secure while running, I don't think I could intentionally shake these things off my head if I tried.  Definitely recommend.  Hope they hold up, if so, it'll be one of the best purchases I've made on Amazon."
0,Big and clunky design. buy the tao version instead
1,"I'm very satisfied. I love my senso Bluetooth headphones.they sound awesome! when I need new headphones in the future I'm going to buy senso Bluetooth headphones again.they are also water proof.i can use them in bad weather,when it rains.fully charged,they last up to eight hours.they're great."
1,"Wonderful headphones, still work spectacularly after testing them in the shower, fit the ears nicely with exceptional sound quality. Worth the $40 I spent, easily. I've found, however, at least with my Amazon Fire Phone, if I receive a phone call of some kind while listening to music, after having accepted and ended the call, I must go back to my music and press to pause it and pay it again so that my headphones resume control over the music. Excellent call quality, easy to use and learn the controls."
1,"Straight out of the box, these fit perfectly into my small ears, but I still have to have my hooks for security. I like how they come fully equipped with all of these accessories! As far as noise cancellation, you're going to have to turn them up a little bit for outside noise to be completely negated, but even with the volume down, outside noise is very faint. I've had them for a few weeks now, and I love them. You just pop them in and go!"
1,"Even me, a non-tech person, managed to hook these up to my blue tooth devices with ease.  I love these.  I am enjoying my music so much more than before.  I recommend these, however, I will point out I have no other headphones to compare them to."
1,They don’t fit my ears and fall off while doing push-ups and sit-ups. The earpiece around the ear is not adjustable. If they fit they are worth it - but I’m going to return mine.
1,These earphones sound great when the earbud is pushed inside of the ear canal but no matter what I do I cannot get them to stay. Maybe I have very small ear holes because even the small size will not stay inside. Within 10 seconds of walking on the treadmill they have slipped out and no attempts at adjusting them makes them stay in place. At least they do stay on my ears with the over-hear hooks but the sound is nothing like having the buds inside my ears. The bass almost completely disappears. This has been an issue for me with all earbuds but since these were made specifically for use when exercising I thought they would be different.
1,"I've had these for about 14 months and am not the least bit careful with how I use them--I wear them while working out (and get super sweaty), stuff them and rip them out of my bag, and sometimes accidentally leave them on. Considering that, these headphones have held up exceedingly well! I just bought a second pair for my husband to wear running. They DO NOT come off during weightlifting, handstands, gymnastics, etc. The audio quality might not be the same level as bose, but they are crystal clear for bluetooth headphones (and especially for the price). The bluetooth works great within about 25-30 feet, even with a case on my phone or if it's in my pocket/bag. Easy to pair, and holds charge for quite a while (can usually get through a week of workouts, which is about 8 hours). Get these!"
1,Great set of wireless headphones.
1,"The sound quality is good.  Not particularly comfortable, or convenient to wear."
0,I really enjoyed these headphones but they stopped working which was a huge disappointment which is why my rating is 2 stars and not 5
1,"I like these better than my ""Beats"".  The sound quality and volume are much better."
1,"Great product for the price. A little heavy, but sound great"
1,They are great earbuds. I bought them to use when I ride my motorcycle. Awesome sound and easy to use.
1,Good quality
1,"The instructions are well-written, and I was able to pair the headphones with everything I tried to. The sound quality is slightly muffled, but decent. If Sony made bluetooth headsets they might yield clearer sound, but they would also cost two or three times as much. I was looking for something to use for language study whilst working out at the gym without dangling earphone wires, and these do the job well. The only problem I've had with them also applies to many other bluetooth headsets: It isn't always clear what state the headset is in-On, Off, or Pairing. It has indicator lights, but the user has to take the headset off in order to see them, which means you need to learn the audio indicator tones instead. Meanwhile, if one bud or the other pops out in mid-flight, poking it back into the ear canal risks changing the source, or the audio track, or turning everything off completely, because the &#34;multifunction&#34; button is prominent on the outside of the right-hand earpiece. Those hurdles can be overcome with experience."
1,Barely connects to the phone. The phone cannot be in my pocket. Otherwise great.
0,"Broke in two months, which is sadly still better than Apple Powerbeats, which I bought this to replace. Other than that, the sound quality is not great but acceptable and the earpiece feels rather flimsy, flexible and not as solid feeling as the Beats"
1,These are great!
1,"Good sound quality for music. I intended to use the headphones for listening to workout videos. I live with other people so it would have been nice to be able to workout without disturbing others. When connecting the headphones it caused interference with wifi to the point of wifi just stop working. I emailed the company for these were my first set of bluetooth headphones. They said that I need to switch to a more stable network and it was not the headphones interfering with the wifi. I am not well versed in technology so I was not able to change the wifi setting to make it more stable even though I pay for high speed and quality internet. I also noticed that the piece that goes over the ear can be bent out of shape real easily.<br />Best for people who use the headphones for just listening to music. These did not fall out when doing my pilates, did require readustment when doing HIIT workouts."
1,"These are ergonomically designed, sound great, last a long time on a charge, and come with lots of great extras. Well worth the price. In fact, these are a total deal.<br /><br />My only criticism is the wind noise. In the gym, they are silent and fantastic. But get outside on a bike, or catch a light breeze in the face, and these are useless. The wind noise completely drowns out the music.<br /><br />UPDATE: I emailed and called the manufacturer and they were incredibly responsive, offering advice on how to factory reset the headphones. This solved the wind noise problem. Updated my rating to reflect this."
1,"Good basic headphones.  If you are looking to re-create a past experience  from a night at the Metropolitan Opera, these may not be for you.  They work fantastic for me to listen to talk radio or classic rock as I walk my dogs.  The loops around the ears keep them in place far better than the ear buds without the loops.  So far, battery life has been a non-issue.  I have yet to run the batteries down.  They are also nice and light so your ears don't get sore from wearing them.<br />*UPDATE* I've had these a while now and I have to bump up my rating. For he money these are great. As of my prior review I had not changed out the earpieces to the smaller size. Fit is everything with these headphones. Now that they are properly in my ear they sound fantastic.  The battery life has been perfectly acceptable.  I'm sure you could spend a pile of cash and get some that sound better, but for the money these are great."
1,"It feels pretty solid in the ear, I wouldn't worry about these falling out. Subpar sound quality, plenty of bass but the mids and highs sound mufflers. A cheap pair of computer speakers offer comparable sound quality."
1,good phones
1,"So far so good, I've only have used them a couple of times and I have had no problems, they sound good as well."
1,"I purchased these for my 13-year old son. He favors them over many other products he has tried. They are comfortable, well-made, good quality and charge quickly. Overall, an excellent product."
1,"I was extremely excited to try these headphones and when I first used them I was extremely excited. However it all went downhill from there.<br /><br />The first issue is the sound quality, I'm kind of an audiophile but didnt expect much from cheap headphones as I knew they wouldn't be great cause I was just gonna use them for running. Sadly however the bass was extremely muddy especially in much of my edm music I listen to. I had to resort to the 5 dollar walmart headphones in order to run happily lol. (I have separate over the ear headphones I use when at home)<br /><br />The Second issue was the wind. When running you can audibly hear the wind hitting the headphones and polluting your music... Not only that when riding my bike people couldn't even hear me over the phone because the wind would overpower my voice on the mic.<br /><br />I'm giving this three stars because of all the extra stuff it came with and how it came with foam tipped eartips which I enjoy. Also if your just using it in your house and nowhere else it would be great just don't expect to use it outside very much :/"
0,Constant buzzing noise when head phones qre on also sound quality is super tinny.
0,The left bud is so hard to get in my ear. Right goes on easily. The left is annoyingly hard. Pausing/ skipping songs is confusing or syncing back up because if you hold 3 seconds it turns off but syncing is 6. I wish I wouldn’t of got them
1,"Sound clear with good bass response. Comfortable, especially the compressible ear tips (similar to ear plugs)."
0,Very disappointed. These have already broken. They have stopped turning on. I bought these as a father's day gift and I am truly disappointed they no longer work
1,They sound good. Just got them so I can't give them a 5 star until I've had them for awhile.<br />seem like their built good. Second time i used them the zipper on case broke. Cheap case I would like them to send me one that won't break!!<br />Now i have to give them 3 stars.
1,"The quality of sound is great!  They are easy to use and connect to the iPhone.  I wish I could adjust the volume lower.  I have my phone volume on low (per instructions) and the headphones on the lowest setting, but they are still a little loud.  Probably not a problem for most people, I just like to keep the volume low.  I have not used them with a phone call yet, so I can't not speak to how well this function works.  A great set of headphones for the price!!!"
1,They are great for day to day use!
1,"Love these headphones, great sound, easy to use, and great price"
1,"These are excellent buds for working out. I had to replace my first pair I somehow lost and of course bought them a second time. They compete with the way more expensive Beats. For the price, they are outstanding."
1,Great sound and the battery lasts all day.  The only drawback is the earbuds slip out of my ears quite a bit.
1,"extremely lightweight and comfortable.  Excellent sound quality and volume.  Charges up very quickly and has a long battery life,  I highly recommend them, especially for those wishing to use them for a high intensity workout.  Great investment for the price!!!"
0,"Earphone broke shortly.<br />It was not working very well when I received it, it can only receive signal within a very close distance, a lot less than the number states in the listing, but I was okay with it since I alway carry the cellphone with me. But one day, after it turning off automatically, I'm not able to charge the earphone or pair it with devices anymore. Tried all means, but still not working. Contacted the seller since it is still within 1yr warranty, and was promised a replacement will be sent. However, more than two weeks had passed, and I didn't receive anything, not even a word explaining whats going on."
1,"I have been using them to listen to books and podcasts, and they work well, easy to connect with my phone.  No feedback about music, have not used them for that.<br />controls were easy to learn<br />stay on my ears well, comfortable"
1,"I use my Senso bluetooth headphones at least 4-5 times a week at the gym or for running on the trails, and sometimes for long bike rides.  They are fantastic for the price.  Yes, I've listened to much more expensive earphones that had slightly better sound, but honestly, these are among the best-sounding I've experienced in the lower price range (and I've tried quite a few over the years).  Someone left a fancy pair of Bose active earbuds at my house once and I ended up using them one day out of curiosity.  I could hardly tell the difference. Connecting to bluetooth on the Senso is just a matter of holding the button in for a few seconds, and the same goes for turning it off.  As mentioned, I only use these for activities and they never fall out of my ears, even if I get pretty sweaty. The fit quite comfortably. Highly recommended if you're looking for decent workout earphones for exercise and don't want to spend big bucks for a fancier brand that might only be a tad bit better."
1,"So far so good! Made two flights with it, haven't charged it, and still over half! Sound is pretty good and clear too."
1,I originally gave the headphones a 4 as they were good for a great price but I've updated it to a 5 as a result of the great customer service! My original pair died after 6 months of use but the SENSO customer service (Mrs Lewis & Mrs. Pollak) helped me troubleshoot and when that failed shipped me a new pair without any hassles or worry!
1,Great headphones for a great price! Look no further!
1,The headphones paired nicely with my Wife's iphone8 plus.  The fit is fantastic!  Keep up the good work!
1,"I have to admit this is one of my fewest reviews I've posted on Amazon. Last week I had my JayBirdx2 earbuds go through a laundry cycle, so you kind of guess what happened next. I was in the search for a new Bluetooth headphones and Senso came up, and I really didn't want to spend over $100 for another JayB. When I saw the over 5K reviews I told myself is worth trying. Can't go wrong for that price. They are light, easy to put them on, and I like the over the ear support. I have used them only ones, but going to the gym later and planning to use them again. I'm not satisfied with sound though, coming from the Jaybird headphones. Othere than that aspect no complains yet."
1,"Absolutely love these!  They are comfortable,  they pair quickly and easily.  They sound great.  Very happy with the purchase."
0,Terrible Bluetooth connection. Always cuts out. Have to have your phone unobstructed.
0,They cut in and out.
1,Great stuff
1,"I have had these for over a year and they still work great! The battery lasts all day listening to music or podcast in the office and a workout afterward. I had no trouble getting them connected to any of my devices.  I bought them thinking that if they lasted me 6-12 months then I would have gotten my money's worth, 18 months in and they are still just as good as the bay I bought them. Simply a headphone that works well and lasts a long time."
0,The life of the headphones lasted about 3 weeks. The battery life kept getting worse and now they are completely dead and won't take a charge.
1,"I loved it! Simple to pair, easy to use, it works! Congrats, Senso people!"
1,"Too big to hit up under a helmet,  but awesome sound quality. Very lightweight ....but a cheap ear guard."
1,"Great headphones. Sound clarity is great. The only problem I have with them is the wire getting caught on the side of my neck. Other than that, the headphones are awesome"
1,My son loves them. Thank you for helping me make his experience a good one.
1,"For fellow runners, only got these yesterday. I'd say amazing value for the price. Quite comfortable, doesn't fall off while running and doesn't cause pain in the ward with prolonged wearing. A bit heavy in the ears but the cord is not as annoying as I'd expected. Bass is very good. Will have to see how the battery life holds up."
1,"Every once in a while, you get to do business with a special company.  Senso is that sort of outfit.  Everything about this purchase was just....right. The product packaging was easy to open, yet nicely protective of the headphones.  The &#34;kit&#34; included everything I needed.  Ever bought something and find out that the cable or battery or some such is not included?  Not these folks.  Each component was nicely engineered for usability.<br /><br />They kindly sent me a video in my email that has nice little tutorials on usage.  The manual was laminated so that it will last.  The USB charger has nice caps to protect the ends.  The headphones are easy to put on, light on my head, and clear to the ear.  I could go on.  Seriously ---you need to buy something from them just to experience their clear commitment to excellence.<br /><br />If these folks are selling stock, I'd be interested.  They are going to do well."
1,"These headphones have been the best ones yet. They are inexpensive, but have great sound! Plus they stay put when working out. I've had them for a few days now and I love them. They come with charging cords etc. plus other sizes of ear pieces. My friend ordered them and he liked them, so I bought some myself. Highly recommend these!"
1,"I have struggled with the Bluetooth wireless earbud conundrum for some time. I have paid way too much money for Jaybirds and Bose and neither of them are worth the money in my opinion. I bought these not expecting too much but having had them for a few weeks, I can say the volume quality far surpasses my predictions. Can’t yet comment on battery life because I haven’t used them often enough. These are very comfortable and stay in my ears better than either of the aforementioned styles."
1,"They fall off my ears and they always turn on.  The on button needs a safety feature, because when it’s in my purse with the slightest pressure, they turn on.  I only notice when I look at my phone and see it’s connected to Bluetooth.  Frustrating.  But the batteries last a long time."
0,"Wind noise was terrible even though it was advertised as having wind noise reduction.  I heard wind noise on a non-windy day, just wind that was generated from me walking around.  Returned."
1,So far so good with these. I bought them specifically for long runs. Batteries have lasted for them but I noticed if my phone is too far from them the music skips. And by far I mean I hold it lower than my waist. But for $30 you can't beat that.<br /><br />However I was missing a piece in the package when I received it and contacted the company. They immediately sent a replacement piece to make it right. Great customer service.
1,"I purchased these headphones after some quick research.  They have been awesome so far.  Easy to pair, easy to charge.  Great to workout with."
1,works as advertised.  great all around workout headphones.
1,"You cannot buy a better easier to use set of Bluetooth ear buds.  Rechargeable battery lasts 8 to 10 hours.  Not often you find a product that does what its specifications say. Great product, great value."
1,These headphones are great
1,Just took them out of the package and they linked up to my IPhone right away with no trouble. Sound is very good too. Needed some sweat proof earphone and hopingvthese do the trick.... so far so good!
1,The ear buds look great and the sound is superior.
0,Received the package and it's as if the headphones are used. The seal was broken and one of the earbuds is snapped off and the wire ripped as well.
1,"Beautiful sound, battery last good 9 hrs. Great buy, good price."
1,I have had these headphones for for five months and they are great.  Good sound for the price. Have a nice protective case for travel. Recent issue with pairing device after charging and excellent phone customer service  walked me through repairing both devices in a few minutes.  Would highly recommend.
1,It's too bad the ear hooks don't tighten. They sit high and makes the headset feel loose on my ears.
1,Good
1,I might just have odd shaped ears... but these slightly hurt to wear for long periods of time.  The sound is fantastic and the battery life is better than what is published. For the price... you can't beat it!
1,"I've only had these headphones for a week, but so far the sound is very good as is the battery life. I got the over-the-ear style because I wasn't sure about in-ear buds with my hearing aids. These are working well.<br />If they're still working this well in three months, I'll give 5 stars.<br />I would prefer the controls on the left ear unit, but that's just me."
0,"I wanted to like these headphone but I just can't get passed the connectivity issues. For some reason, when I run or bike with these headphones, if I wear my phone on my left side, the headphones cut in and out but work better (not great) on the right side. Seem to work fine in the gym if I just put them in the center of the room but when you bring them outside they don't work very well. Battery life seems to be pretty good."
1,These are amazing for the price! They come with a lot of extras too. They sync with my phone and watch and the sound is great.
1,My brother gave me a pair of the ear buds and I loved them so I ordered my husband a pair.  They block out noise and such clear sound.  Very easy to use.  Thinking of getting for grandchildren for christmas!
1,"Look folks these headphones are legit.  I've spent hundreds of dollars and went through 3 headphones by a very popular brand.  By far this was the best money I spent on a pair of headphones.  Pairs well with my Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+. It's loud, clear and most of all very comfortable.  I am waiting for my 10% off so that I can buy another pair.  However I did NOT get the wire tie?"
1,These are easy to pair with your phone with no hassle. The sound is good as long as you stay within the 30 foot zone. Very satisfied with these.
1,"Works great. Easy to use. For the price, the sound better than other earphones of the same price."
1,Works well for the price. Cann connect to both mac and iphone at the same time. decent sound quality and battery back up
1,These headphones have great sound and clear calling capabilities. The controls are just a bit finicky but all in all product for the price.
1,"Sound quality superior for the price, I have a wireless beats headphones and I did nott notice any difference between the two.  I bought these because I read an article that listed the best headphones under $30 and these were number 1  at the top of the list so I bought them and boy am I glad.  You can't go wrong with these headphones."
1,"I really like these. I don’t have a lot of experience with headphones, but they fit nicely without going too far into my ear.<br /><br />The only thing I don’t like is the cord that connects the earbuds. It curls up on itself and ends up touching you on your sweaty neck. So I sometimes pin it up to my hair. For the price, maybe they could have used a better cord.<br /><br />As for sound, I’m a total amateur. I can only tell you that it sounds fine to me. When I first connect them, the sound goes in and out a few times before it settles down and plays, but that only takes a few seconds.<br /><br />Overall, it seems like a good set of Bluetooth headphones.<br /><br />Update 06/23/2018: After 8 months, these headphones no longer paired or connected. I found the instructions for how to do a hard reset and that fixed the problem.<br /><br />1. Reset the Senso headphone to factory settings (while plugged into a power source, press/hold the power button for 7 seconds).<br />2. Unplug the headphone from charging cable and power them on.<br />3. Enter the earbuds into the pairing mode and follow instructions for connecting.<br /><br />I also had to remove Activbuds (these headphones) from each device and re-pair them. Trying to the connect to the old pairing wasn't working."
1,Quite surprised and happy with this little but powerful headphone set. Light and comfortable and the sound quality is great! Keep up the good work!
1,happy customer
1,"Left side does not stay in ear while running. When outside playing basketball, connection is really bad. Other than that, I like it."
1,Great sound and super easy to use! Very comfortable and with 3 different ear piece sizes I found the perfect fit. I bought them for the gym and the wireless capability is awesome to have and they drown out all the background noise.  Highly recommend!
1,"I really love these headphones. They're really good at cancelling out noise, I had no issue with excessive base, and they're super comfortable when I wear them at the gym. I haven't tried running with them yet but I don't see how they could fall off. Super easy to use and I was EXTREMELY impressed with the owners of this company. They constantly would email me making sure I was enjoying the product and if I had any issues, which I didn't. I will definitely be recommending these to all my friends."
0,Expected a bit more from SENSO. I think they used to be better back in the day. These headphones are good for sweaty atheltes but they definetly have distorted sound quality. Quality &#62; Quantity
1,Amazing - they even went in the wash by accident and still worked!!
0,Sent back ear clips too flimsy wouldn't stay in ears like the more expensive kind add 5 more words ok
0,The volume button was broken directly out of the box. Low quality device. Not recommended.
1,"Great for general use. Mowing, running, driving and working. A very cost effective option for anyone who doesn't require an expensive name brand product.<br /><br />Microphone works well for calls and the buttons all integrated fine with android. No complaints for a product around the twenty dollar range."
1,Quality sound with bold bass. Blutooth works great. The overall presentation with all the little accessories included is unbeatable for the price. 10/10
1,"Best wireless headphones I've bought.  Great product and would highly recommend it..When fully charged, it lasts for hours."
1,"Bought this as a present for my husband to use while working out, he was thrilled and said these were way better than he expected them to be. You really can't beat the price for the quality and amount of extras you receive with this product!"
1,"Excellent service, no complaints."
0,On button broke after about to hours of use:( other then that they where really nice.
0,It's very bendable. Not suitable for running.
1,I watched youtube reviews on this product and started to think maybe I made a mistake. However my laziness kicked in and I didn't want to go thru the process of returning them so I gave them a try. Well I was so pleasantly surprised how good they are. Sound is good and they stay pretty firm on my ears when I run. My only complaint is that they could fit more snug. I do have very tiny ears and this is always a problem for me with ear buds. Other than that I am very happy with them.
1,No more wires!! My battery died and I had to go back to my wired headset! Terrible reminder of what I had dealt with before.
1,"Wow.. I've had Dr Dre 2nd generation bluetooth Beats and some other cheap options.. all sucked. The Dr Dre ones were awesome... while they worked. They basically began disintegrating after 6months. So, I decided to explore cheaper options. The SENSO are very impressive. The sound in no way compares tot he Dr Dre Beats headset. Not even close. But, if you mess with the iPhone equalizer settings, you can get them to a satisfactory level. The battery life is impressive, the standby battery life is beyond impressive, and the quality of the product is solid given the price point. I should also clarify that I use these mostly for talk radio like Howard Stern, etc.. Music is always underwhelming on these. Oh, and phone calls are.. awkward. The mic is in one of the earpieces. For a clear call, you need to take the ear piece out and speak into the mic. Otherwise, it sound muffled for the other person on the call. For me, these are awesome."
1,"Not the best by no means but not bad for the price I paid for them. They will allow a pretty good range of distance from my phone before it'll start going out, but sometimes you can hear a slight distortion in the sound. Overall good buds."
1,Wonderful well-priced headphones that my teenage son loves!
0,Really liked these but stopped taking a charge after less than 6 months.
0,The button cover came off after two-three weeks of use<br /><br />the battery life is not great<br /><br />wouldn't recommend
1,. I bought these 9 months ago and use 4 times per week for 2 hours at a time @ gym . They stay on with all movements . The sound is basey and get slightly distorted at highest volume.
1,"Great set of wireless headphones. Fit is perfect and compared to more expensive headphones, they are just as clear and easy to use. Awesome product and company. Well worth the money!"
1,Good price for good product
1,Excellent product.<br />I am impressed.
1,Excellent product and service!
1,They were great headphones very good with sound base and noise canceling
1,"Sound is great.  Fits great.  Most importantly, they stay on during a heavy workout."
1,"I love these headphones!!!! I have 3 pair. I originally tried them for myself and then my son tried them, and took them. I like how the arm wraps around the ear. The sound is amazing! And they last all day without having to charge. I use them for music,  for talking on the phone, and watching shows on my phone. Great quality. These are better then the name brand ones I had. I highly recommend them. You won't regret it."
1,I been wearing these while running for about a week now. They are comfortable to wear and stay connected. The rubber earbud tips fit my ears well and provide good sound isolation.
1,Enjoying them very much
1,These ear buds are awesome. They sound great.
1,"They do their job, but one of the extra ear-tips came with a tear already, so I am was not too excited, and am not too hopeful about the durability of the rest of them."
1,Great set of Bluetooth headphones. They fit well and the sound is crisp.
1,"Got 3 sets for my children, they are very happy with the performance and quality."
1,"I’m not like the way they fit , gonna pass them on as a gift, they sound great and seem to be made well but just don’t fit right"
1,They're ok.  My problem with them is they don't turn off automatically and disconnect from my phone after a reasonable period of time.  I try to use my phone the next day and find that they are still connected to these headphones.  It's a pain.
1,Great sound and for a guy that sweats they stay in place and the sounds doesn't distort. A fraction of the cost of VERY expensive branded headphones and work equally as good.
1,"I've only had them for around a day, but they are comfortable and work well. I bought them to work out and while most earbuds fall out of my head, these stay firmly attached to my ears"
1,"Happy with the sound, surprised given the price."
1,"Awesome piece of equipment and a great price. Bought another as a present.  Good sound for the money, simple to use."
0,"The sound was surprisingly good for the cost, however these did not meet my expectations on any other level.  They were uncomfortable and fell off my ears constantly, even with the correct size ear buds on.  I bought them for travel, and the battery barely lasted 4 hours, not even close to the 8 that they claim.  These are being returned."
1,"I have had the buds only 24 hours, but I am quite happy. Fast delivery, much better sound than my previous ear phones, nice fit. And oh yes, great price!"
1,I bought 2 for my kids to use in while doing fitness; both works perfect and are ver confortable; holds tight to the ear. Sound is good and they are easy to use. Good for the price!
1,"They have really good battery life and sound quality. This is my first bluetooth headset so I wasn't sure what to expect. The sound does occasionally go in and out. The big issue I had was getting them to stay in my ears with my glasses on. To use this product I need to take off my glasses or they won't go in my ear all the way.<br /><br />I really like how they send a lot of things with the headset like the charging cable, case and different size foam pieces."
0,Horrible product. Not sure why but it keeps on disconnecting for few seconds. While driving it’s more irritating as mostly the audio is switched to car Bluetooth but suddenly when this disconnects n reconnects the phone switches d call or music to this Bluetooth
0,I liked these headphones until after less than 6 months the ear part popped out and was literally hanging by a wire. I realized it when I took the headphones out of the holding place I kept them in right before I left for the gym. I contacted Senso and they told me the warranty wouldn’t cover this even though it happened through no fault of my own. They did generously offer me a 5% discount on new headphones. No thanks. Found others on Amazon for less $ and work just as well.
1,""" Love them. Great sound, great price."""
1,Extremely satisfied with these earbuds!<br /><br />I needed some earbuds that won't fall out while I'm working out at the gym or running and these earbuds definitely do the job.<br /><br />Let's took a look at what you get:<br />-Amazing water proof and COMFORTABLE earbuds that doesn't get tangled and are extremely isolated (I had the volume at 30% and I can't hear a thing but the music)<br />-Slick and convenient carrying case<br />-Lightning/micro USB cable with covers<br />-Micro USB cable<br />-Dual USB car charger<br />-Wire holders<br />-Interchangeable earbuds<br /><br />You get all of these for $38!  It's an absolute steal for what you're getting.  The earbuds alone I say is worth the $38 and the fact that you get all of these other accessories for them is unbelievable.<br /><br />Definitely recommend if you're a really active person or just want some great sounding earbuds for a super low price!
1,test
1,Unfortunately my phone that I intent to use these with the Bluetooth has stopped band a replacement is on the way. I did however briefly try them with my work phone on a call. I can say they seem comfortable to wear and worked okay on a call but my may reason to purchase was for music when working out.
1,"Product works great!  I purchased a different pair of bluetooth headphones,but they would not stay in my ears.  The Senso headphones stay in and work like a charm.  I love that they come with a case, a car charger and different size ear bud replacements."
1,Can't beat these for the price!
1,"Great headphones! Just a word of advice though, they can cause ear problems (infections) if worn for longer periods of time."
1,Easy to connect.  Friendly and fit the ears perfect.<br />Good product.
0,Right ear a lot louder than left
1,love these headphones. Battery power isn't to great but not terrible. these are great for the price
1,Work great and easy to set up.  Have only had for one week but love them so far.
1,"Used these last night right after I opened them up. I bought these because I purchased them as a Christmas gift for my son and he raved about how great they are. He was right. I travel a bunch in the plane and these are going to work out wonderful<br /><br />Great quality, exceptional packaging and they thought of everything!"
1,Great sound; user friendly and very light weight.
1,"These headphones are very comfortable to wear and have nice bass, too."
1,"In the past I had always used earbuds with a wire and it was always a pain to untangle and it would get caught up in my towel and get pulled from my ears, with my new Senso earbuds I have no such problems and am completely satisfied with them."
1,"Great headphones for the price. So far, no issues whatsoever. sound quality, while not anything like high end headphones, are perfect for what I use them for, working out and running. Bluetooth has worked flawlessly so far, and connecting them was a breeze."
0,Update:They will no longer hold a charger. Will be asking for a refund<br /><br />Update: I originally gave these 4 stars. I bumped it down to 2. I love these but they simply do not stay in my ears. If you are just lifting weights they will work well but when it comes to running they are a pain in the a**<br /><br />These are a decent set of bluetooth earbuds for under $40. They have a clear sound with some surprising bass. The bluetooth distant is good. Only thing I do not like is how big the ear loops are. They are way to big for my ears. I advise the company to either make interchangeable ear loops or make them out if a more &#34;mouldable&#34; material. Overall a good buy
1,"The sound is pretty good, but I have noted two problems.  One is that everything is controlled by pushing a single button some number of times.  In addition to controlling on and off, it signals your phone to call the most-recent number.  I have accidentally done this a few times.  The other problem is that the headphones occasionally lose the Bluetooth connection momentarily unless the phone is really close, which is annoying when playing music."
0,"DO NOT BUY!!! These are the biggest pieces of S*&T on the market. They're cheap, 20 dollars I think, but you do not want to go cheap with headphones. The sound quality is garbage, and it constantly loses connection to my iphone just 1 foot away. If you turn your head you'll hear the headphones lose connection. I used it twice and then threw it away. Save yourself 20 bucks and keep shopping."
1,Good product
1,They work pretty well. I wear them at the gym and periodically get static where the sound breaks up. I'd say you can be 10-12 feet away without the static.  Overall they are great for the price though&#34;
0,"would not stay in my ears while running. really uncomfortable, couldn't wear them for more than an hour because they were so uncomfortable for me"
1,Good cheap Bluetooth headphones. Exactly what i was after.
1,"My biggest issue is pairing it to my devices. I use these with both a tablet and phone. I can only connect to one if I &#34;forget this device&#34; on the other FIRST. I cannot force these to pair with a different device once it has paired. Once I &#34;forget this device&#34; it pairs easily. This is a huge pain when I have it paired to my phone on the way to the gym. Then I power them off, change, and lock it in my locker. When I try to pair my tablet, I can't. I have to go back to my locker, &#34;forget this device&#34; on my phone to allow me to pair with my tablet.<br /><br />HUUUUUGE pain in the neck!<br /><br />The noise cancelling in negligible."
0,It serves its purpose yet the battery life isn’t long and when it’s about to die it slows down and speeds up.
1,Awesome headphones. Couldn’t be happier.
1,They are great. And delivered fast. Thank you so much.
0,"Battery didn’t last super long, and they fell apart within 2 months."
1,Not that comfortable.
1,I paid $350 for my JBL and they do not work. The sound of this product is the same as my JBL. Great price for this product!
1,Surprisingly comfortable with all the fit options. Sound quality is exalent. On a full charge I can make it through a full 8 hour shift at work. I work in a boiler room so it's loud to begin with and these still work and sound amazing.
1,Really comfortable and easy to use plus great sound
1,"The design is ok, it does stay on ears but that hook that goes around the ear is too wide and barely touches my ears. The sound quality is horrible !! and that's compared to a 25$ SkullCandy headphones i got from office depot !! its not for music, its for phone calls ... i dont like it overall but i have to live with it. I have tried so many different ones in the same price range and even cheaper, and this by far the worst sound quality."
1,"Works very well, don't really need the calling features... answering a phone call is fine but the button clicking to call people was unnecessary and there is far too much risk of doing so without meaning to"
1,"I spend a lot of my free time  in the gym or weight room working out or training someone and I must admit this is the best pair of earphone I've ever purchased. They fit snug and lightweight, the sound is outstanding. I plan on buying a second pair as a back up in case I lose these."
1,"Senso, you've done it this time. You've hit the mark. Very comfortable, work great, and sound fantastic. I'm happy with this purchase."
0,Amazing sound! But...<br />The mic is TERRIBLE!! You can't be heard.<br />Sending these back
1,Ok
1,Well I like the most is very clear and battery last long but what I like the least the earpiece is to flexible and become very soft and fall off my ear continuing have to put it back on
0,"THIRD PAIR in a row that has now broken, within less than a couple years. This last pair was only a couple months old. It made a small beep sound then would not turn on or charge, and is just dead. DO NOT buy these if you want reliable headphones. Big bummer."
1,These work great and are very comfortable.
1,Syncing issue when running. It is like it is trying to pair with other Bluetooth devices. The issue goes away have 10 minutes of running. I have not called customer service yet but plan too and will update afterward. I have only heard good things about their customer service!
1,Excellent product. Just what I expected. Will be buying again. Thanks!
0,"Worked great for a few months but now it keeps cutting out the audio every minute or so.  Tried repairing it to fix it but still didn't work.  It is great that it is cheap but then a few months later you have to spend more money to buy another set.  Went ahead and bought a quality paid and been well pleased.  DON'T BUY CHEAP THINGS!  In the long run, you will tend to spend more money than buying quality items the 1st time around.  It's science :-)"
1,"Exactly what I needed for the Gym.  Good battery life, comfort, and waterproof."
1,I’ve had 2 pairs of these 3 years. Only reason I got a new pair was I stepped on my first pair or I’d probably still have the original. Great sound quality and noise canceling. Good price for the quality. They last all week on a charge listening to music while studying and going on 2-3 30+ minute runs.
1,"Very good overall sports wireless earbuds (best I ever owned), form, fit, and quality of sound. What I also appreciated is receiving timely email communication from the manufacturing company when the product was shipped and after it was delivered letting me know that they're there to support me if needed, and to make sure that I'm completely satisfied with their product."
1,"Got these to use at work. My son recommended these to me. Like that they come with several choices of ear buds. First set didn’t stay put very well, second set I choose were perfect. Nothing to dislike at all!"
1,so far no problems i work out hard and sweat allot and no problems so far. very easy to setup with my phone Samsung s5
0,did not work as described
1,Great sound and cheap price...
1,My wife loves them.  She is using them when she runs and has not had a single complaint.
1,"Love them, great sound and very simple operation"
1,My initial impression of these headphones is great.  They fit nice and snug and are very comfortable.  The sound is also the best I've experiences with any kind of ear bud headphones.  Very impressed so far.
0,"Initially I really liked these headphones. Good audio quality for the price, comfortable, great battery life. However after just a couple days of use the adjustable ear holder fell out. After another week the volume key stopped working and the pressed into the device, from there it broke off and fell out.<br /><br />Very poor quality, I've had VERY light use of these headphones. I mainly used them in an office environment. For being advertised as ""Athletic/Active"" headphones is laughable.<br /><br />Save your money, go with another brand."
1,I wear these headphones for running and work. Excellent price and great sound. I would highly recommend these.
1,"The bass is lacking, but otherwise they're great. I mean they're pretty cheap for bluetooth headphones so I can't complain too much. They connect quick and easy, and the battery life is impressive. Just don't leave them on if you're not using them."
1,"Until our first pair got accidentally broken these worked great.  A couple of issues with the pairing and dying,but coming back to life in the beginning.  Then it was okay until a zipper got the cord.  Customer Service from Invotek was great to work with, but they couldn't do more than give a discount.  The new pair arrived and the foam ear bud parts broke very quickly.  Disappointing since they were super comfortable. If it weren't for that I'd give it a 5 star review."
1,"Easy to use, great sound, great customer service! I use these in the gym with iPhone 7 and they work perfectly-great deal for the money!"
1,"i've only used these a few hours on the treadmill, but i like them so far. the &#34;wrap-around&#34; piece is flimsy, which is good. my previous pair were flexible, but stiff and were sometimes NOT comfortable. these allow the piece to just hang over the ear and the bud piece stays put with a good seal. volume can get loud. i'm not an audiophile, so i can't really comment on the quality, but i have no complaints. the connecting wire is flat and doesn't gather on one side and pull at your ear if you turn your head like a previous paid did. so far, my one complaint is the power button is on the side instead of top or bottom. you're shoving the bud into your ear to power on/off....not exactly pleasant.<br />i do like the hard sided carry case that's included, keeps them from getting crushed in the gym bag."
1,Been thru the washing machine and dryer. Twice. Still work exactly the same. Great!
0,Headphones would not charge. Trying to contact manufacturer.
1,"The sound is better than I expected. However, using it the mic for phone use is somewhat annoying. A few times the connection from the headset to the phone would fade and the person on the other line could hear me. This has happened with a full charge. Now, it only happens when I'm in the car. Not sure if that has anything to do with it. Other than that, it's great for what I paid for it."
1,"I purchased these headphones to run and workout in, so I was looking for a pair that were on the less expensive side that I wouldn't have to worry about breaking.  I kept my expectations in line with the price (low), but I was pleasantly surprised.  The headphones fit well and do a good job of staying in place while being worn.  I have to readjust them every so often when running, but I found removing the &#34;cable management clip&#34; has helped to stop them from grabbing on my neck and pulling out quite as much.  I do agree with other reviewers that the piece that goes around the ear is very loose, and it would probably help the fit if the flaps were a little more snug.<br /><br />After 9 months of pretty substantial use, the headphones would no longer turn on.  I contacted Senso through their website and had a response within a few hours. After a short troubleshooting effort, they offered to send me a new pair of headphones per their 1 year warranty.<br /><br />In my opinion, these are great headphones for the price, and Senso's customer service was responsive and easy to deal with.  For those reasons, I would recommend these headphones to anyone looking for a less expensive alternative."
0,The sound quality is far inferior than expected. It sounds like music is played through a metal tube. Also the speakers suffer at any loud or high parts of a song. The only positive is that the plastic is very soft on the ears.
1,I think the plastic that wraps around the ear could be a little more rigid to hold the buds in place a little better but they are comfortable. These guys are on point with their delivery too!<br /><br />Update: I started having a problem with the left ear bud after 9 months (I use these things almost everyday) and I called up the support number (888-683-4914) to claim the 1 year warranty. The support tech guided me through a quick troubleshooting session but that didn't fix the problem so they are issuing me a replacement now. Call took less than 6 mins. Really great job! Thanks so much.
0,doesnt stay in ear.
0,Used mine once and now they do not hold a charge!
1,"Well-made, surprisingly good sound - no regrets!"
1,"These are great! Comfort, sound, ease of use. All perfect. Very happy!"
1,PERFECT
1,"great product, exactly as advertised. Arrived on time no problems."
1,Love these.  The battery works for a long time before needing recharging.  I'd guess 8-10 workouts each between 40-60 mins.  Connects fast and sound is good. Glad I bought these.
1,These headphones were everything they said they were but I had to learn how to use them. At first I did not like them and almost sent them back; however I connected with their tech support and the very knowledgeable technician encouraged me to 'seat' them in my ears better and the sound is incredible. I use them every day and really like they way they charge (from my computer) and hold a charge when I am working out or just riding my bike.
0,"I've had a number of Bluetooth sports headphones and I have to say that this is the worst of the bunch. Right out of the box, after a full charge I had sound problems. Lots of crackling and the sound, when I could hear it was like it came out of an echo chamber. Save your hard earned money and buy a different brand."
1,"Bought them in August, it's January and I already need a new pair. Randomly the left speaker went out 😣 before that I loved them! Really sad..."
1,Amazing quality. Great product and price
1,"Great headphones!  Sound is crisp and clear, easy to operate and excellent range. Only negative and it's not a big one, the profile is a little thick.  I've seen lower profile headphones out there but over all I have been impressed"
1,Arrived on time. So far so good as far sound
1,Great customer service. Great product.
1,The earbuds work well and are comfortable. They came with 3 replacement pads and a magnetic car mount. Good price and excellent sound. Easy to use.
1,"Great product for the price.  Sound is awesome, charges faster than other Bluetooth headphones I've owned.  Charge lasts a long time."
0,"TLDR: Audio cuts out constantly. You're better off buying a different set of headphones<br /><br />I bought this last year and did not use it as much as this year. At first there were some issues with the audio cutting in and out, but I assumed it was because I'm usually using it in a room filled with other people using bluetooth and there might be some interference. Now I know that is not the issue. I have been biking to and from school which is not far at all and I use these to listen to music along the way. My phone is either in my breast pocket or on my mount and I still have the audio cutting in and out. There is nothing else that is interfering with it at all. I've even had the phone in my hand about 1 foot away from the headphones and they would still cut out. It is ridiculous.  I've had 2 different phones and it happened to them both. Other than the audio cutting out everything else is great, but it gets extremely annoying while I'm trying to enjoy some music while biking or even at the gym."
1,"I love them, good sound, very comfortable to wear, will be buying again when I lose these"
1,Thank you very much For keeping in mind I am very happy with my headphones They sound the best and they are very comfortable Thank you again and I am recommending them ..
0,These headphones are awful. The connection between the headphones and my devices (iPhone and iPad) continually breaks. This happens even when I am in very close range with my devices.
1,"The sound quality is good, the loops fit my ears pretty well, battery life is also quite good.<br />They are VERY prone to errors, however. Mine just immediately stopped working, disconnected from my phone,and then the blue and red lights were both stuck on and have been ever since, with no sign of being fixed.<br />Not sure if this is a common error, but for the price, they're not terrible headphones, just prone to mechanical errors."
1,They have nice sounds! however my ears are way to small for these headphones and not only that they do look a little big once you put them on
1,awesome for the price! play for 5-6 hours depending how loud i play them. But good for a 60-75 mile bike ride for sure. I use the red plugs since they mold to my inner ear
1,"I don't write reviews often so it really takes a product that impresses me enough to feel like writing a review about it. This is one of those items.<br /><br />These headphones while maybe not the top of the line sound quality (but they do sound superb for what they are) are the best deal I have found for Bluetooth headphones.  They sound amazing for the price and the battery lasts longer than most BT headphones. I use them almost every day and for me, I will never switch away from them. They are exactly what I need in a pair of headphones.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- They sounds amazing for the price paid.<br />- They are comfortable and stay in the ears. I barely notice them when wearing them.<br />- The battery life is one of the best I have found for BT headphones.<br />- They are easy to use and NEVER have disconnected from my phone unless I turned them off or walked too far away.<br />- The BT range is amazing. I don't lose connect anywhere in my apartment or even walking out to the car.<br />- The case is made very well and the accessories included make the price even better.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- For me, NONE. I love these things as they are more than I ever expected for the price.<br />- Some say that the bass is not very good. I have listened to just about everything on these headphones and the only time I noticed not enough bass was during a few songs. Otherwise, they are nicely balanced sound wise.<br />- The ear hoops are not adjustable. They work perfectly for me, but might not be as good for small ears.  Try them, you can always return them, but they are worth a try.<br /><br />Company:<br />One of the main reasons why I am writing this review is not because of the actual headphones themselves, but the company that makes them, SENSO.  I bought my headphones about 6 months ago and I have used them VERY often ever since. A few weeks ago, the outer panel of the headphones started falling off.  After putting the plate back on lots of times, I finally contacted SENSO with a request for assistance.  I got a reply instantly from an amazing person who worked with me to resolve the problem. I cannot stress this enough. Their first reply was literally a few minutes after I sent the request (it was there when I next picked up my phone). Through a few emails I was able to explain the issue and give them some pictures and explanations for the QC department.  Then I got an email stating that they 100% support their products and want to ensure that &#34;each customer gets the highest level of quality products&#34;. Another pair was shipped out that day and arrived within a couple days. I just want to stress the amazing results from this conversation and the true extent that they care for their customers... The whole email process from request to an email stating they were sending the replacements only took 10 HOURS. I have never in my life seen customer service move that fast.  Every email was professional, kind, and to the point.  These people are amazing and will help you if you have issues with a product you bought from them.  I cannot thank them enough and will be a customer of theirs forever.  They have earned my business and I will gladly keep purchasing their products and recommending them to everyone I can.<br /><br />Thank you SENSO for an amazing product and an truly amazing customer service department. You should be proud and you have made a very happy customer. Thank you so much and keep up the good work."
1,"No noise cancellation, it wasn't secure and fit in my ear. Also, sometime it took awhile to correctly connect the BT on my phone. Sounds quality is so-so"
1,"It's ugly, clunky (large) but functional.  A lot more awkward than the ones that just drop into the ""pod chargers"", but that also lack the over-ear hook which is what I was trying to get.  Don't think I'd recommend it, but it's been doing what I needed it to do."
1,"Awesome product. Rugged, high-quality audio, snug without being uncomfortable; everything I could've hoped for."
1,"These are the most comfortable wireless headphones, and they actually stay put on your head!  I put them through the ringer with gym time, running, etc."
1,I use these everyday and they work great. I have bose and clearly the sound is of higher quality yet you cant beat these for the price.
1,Delivered on time. Sound quality very good. Many different power and connection capabilities included. Recommend - will buy for my partner.
0,No one could hear me talk and I sound too far away when I speak... Kept disconnecting
1,These headphones have amazing bass and he connection between my iPhone 7 plus is very strong. However the sound quality is very muffled which is a common trend among Bluetooth headphones.
0,"After only a few hours of use, the headphones are now cutting out and are unusable. Don’t waste your money."
1,Good sound and battery life
1,These earbuds have the most amazing sound quality I have heard for this type. They are exactly what I wanted and they work BETTER than I imagined. Thank you so much for such a SUPERIOR product!!
1,Great set of headphones and fantastic for the price. These are a great replacement for my Beats wireless headphones which for $200 have broken 3 times in the last 2 years.
1,I like this headphone so far I don't have any issues with sound quality.  It fits me right!
0,Durability of the product was a big issue. While using i pulled it back from my ear and it broke into pieces.
1,I mean i only bought them a week ago but ill steal another reviews post that made me purchase them.<br />JUST BUY THEM. I was really impressed with everything they came with and the construction and they work and sound loud! very happy that i  dindt spend 170$ on beats!
1,"Really love these earbuds!  Good sound quality.  I really like the earbuds are connected, less likely to lose them.  Really felt they are reasonably priced!"
1,I bought this boothtooth headphones to use while driving for work.  I found that I have to have the volume on 10/10 and it is still hard to hear when talking to someone.  Sucks to have to ask a customer what they said 3 times.
0,"I just received it. It did NOT come with a Short Charging cable! The wallet card is unnecessary, a cable would have been great! This was probably a previously returned item that I received. Cant charge them so I currently dont know how they work."
1,Great product
1,"I really love these ear buds. They pair well with my phone, have a long battery life, and the sound quality is generally great. The only thing I would mention is that the sound quality tanks when I try to pair them with my laptop. My laptop could just have a bad bluetooth connection, It's not A huge issue though, I would highly recommend them. They are definitely worth the sale price I bought them for of $35 dollars."
1,These headphones have very good sound quality.  They are comfortable to wear and were easy to charge and pair. For the price you can't beat them.
1,"Have done everything I expected so far. Haven't used them enough to judge battery life, but the fit is good they stay in my ears well and the sound on music and phone is excellent."
1,"The headphones ar awesome and exactly what I have expected. Great sound quality and great connection from one device to another. When making the device making phone calls, may have some weak voice data to the other end user but other than that, I love so do my wife. Affordable and do pretty much the same thing these 100 BOSE and Beats do."
1,Used for working out for like 2 years now. Never any issue
1,"I was skeptical buying these as they are the first pair of bluetooth headphones I've bought, but I've been very impressed so far. The bluetooth connection has been crystal clear and hasn't dropped. The sound quality is loud and clear, and the earbuds do a good job of blocking out external sound. The cord is short enough to not feel annoying and drag down the back of my neck which is a huge plus. Very happy with the purchase."
1,perfect for new iphone reasonably priced
1,3rd pair loved the first two  latest version is a down grade wire around head is harder rubber no wall plug instead some silly phone holder for your car i thought i bought head phones  sound not as good power button turns off with the slightest touch  old phones would talk to u power on power off connecting much more user friendly  last set died at one year  with these changes i would now spend more get the beats and better feel quality sound and warranty
1,Excellent. Exceeded every expectation. Great price. Would buy again in a heart beat. I’ve owned for 1-month and zero problems or issues. Battery life is good. Sound quality is excellent.
0,"I'm having a hard time liking these. I got them to use while biking, but they have a lot of wind noise and they start to hurt my ears after about 30 minutes. They also tend to work their way out of my ears over time. Otherwise, they connect right up to my phone and play music fine. Decent sound quality, but nothing special. I'll try to find a use for them, but will likely give them to a friend that they suit better.<br /><br />It's also a bummer they can't be left plugged-in to charge overnight. A bit inconvenient."
1,Ive had these since decemeber of 2017  and they worked perfectly. Its now february of 2019 and one earbud is starting to act up. I will probably be purchasing this product again.
1,"This is my second set of  ""THESE""  earbuds, if they were not worth the price, and the quality wasn't there,<br />I wouldn't have purchased the 2nd pair.<br />I'm getting 8-Hours + use before recharging."
0,Stopped working in a couple of months.  Don't waste your money.
1,So far they have worked fine. Have several devices that I use with. Comfortable.
1,These are durable and provide great audio
1,"No better than similar products that are half the price.<br />Sound quality is not that great.  Much worse than my normal $7 corded earbuds.<br />Ear hooks are useful but would be better if they were adjustable.<br />Microphone quality is good, but picks up all ambient noises around you.<br />Would not buy again."
1,Good sound clarity. Does not fall off ear.
1,The foam plugs work great but for soem reason already lost one of them. Not sure if I can get a replacement.
0,I'm disappointed in the poor quality of this item. I will return it.
1,Works as advertised!  I ride horses and they stay in place.  Very comfortable and very easy to use.
1,"Bought them for my 18 year old son. He wanted Beats or Bose, but ran across these on sale and decided if the got stole or lost while running to practices, games and the gym, it would be less painless. He was disappointed! BUT...after he tried them, admits he loves them. The charge is super and the sound is great. Happy boy and happy mom!"
1,"Good: Feels good on my ears. Sound doesn't give me a headache. Fast charging.<br />Bad: Connection could be better. It was only completely stable when my S6 Edge was in my front shirt pocket. It would lose connection in my fanny pack or cargo pants front pocket. Unfortunately, I forgot my phone was in my shirt pocket and bent over to pick up something and watched my phone cracking it's screen on my driveway. So there is risk in trying to maintain a good connection. If you like a lot of bass in your ear buds you might want to look elsewhere. The sound is clear and phone calls are easy to understand on both ends."
1,"Great bluetooth headphones,  great packing and accessories, for the price. 5 star quality."
1,So  far so good easy to work
0,"Sounded great and worked until one day they wouldn't turn on. Plugged them in to charge up fully and still dead as soon as I unplug. I tried holding the power button and attempted hard reset but still no luck.<br /><br />EDIT: Did want to note that when I plug them in, the light turns red then blue. Seems to be fully charged at that point. While still plugged in I can hold down the main button and it will take a second then blink light pink three times and then go back to blue. Light immediately turns off when unplugged."
1,Awesome so far sound great and the mic works great aswell
1,These are great. Love the extra ear buds. Easy to adjust volume and Comfortable.
0,No clue how this gets such great reviews. Music sounds like it's being played through a tin can. The rubber piece that goes around your ear was warped and is way too soft/not rigid enough.
1,Bought this as a Christmas present for my husband. He loves how comfortable they are and don't fall off. I used them not too long ago and forgot to turn it off so it stayed on throughout the night and on anger occasion all day long and the battery stayed 75% without charging it. I am totally satisfied with my purchase and I'm even thinkin about getting a pair for myself
0,"These didn't last long. They worked ok at first. The fit was questionable. In the ears was fine but the cord between is a tad long. It would catch from time to time on my skin and they'd pull out. That was manageable. The case was too soft. It's supposed to be a hard case. However, when I used it and put it in my pocket, the blue tooth still managed to turn itself on from just the pressure in my pocket (loose fitting work pants, but would tighten up little when I squatted or sat.) Finally, one of the ear pieces snapped in half. It's junk now."
1,"I got a pair of these a couple years ago and they were awesome. So awesome that when they finally crapped out, I didn't mind buying another pair. However, I found out with this new pair that the ear hooks are now totally different; they're huge and made with moldable rubber (probably to accomdate more ear sizes). The last pair fit perfect, but these are extremely difficult to get to fit right each and every time I wear them. Guess I'll just chalk them up as the millionth pair of headphones I've had that won't stay in my ears and restart a new search for the mythical pair that does..."
0,Bought these as a Christmas present and less than 90 days later they came apart.  Unfortunately they only have a 30 return which is very short for electronics.  Not worth the money
0,"Purchased these one week ago.  After four days, I am unable to turn them off using the multifunction button.  The only way is to plug them in. This turns them off.  Once I unplug them, I canam turn them on. Once the battery hits 30%, then every two minutes I hear “low battery”.  I would not purchase these again and would advise against anyone else purchasing them"
1,"I haven't had these long, but I've enjoyed them so far.  The sound quality, the thing I was worried the most about, is really high and I really like the fact that the headphones being halfway turned up is more than loud enough for me, where normally headphones are pretty quiet turned all the way up."
1,Overall ok
0,I loved everything about this product... the fit.. I just bought my third one and I’m done with this product!!! It’s not waterproof .....after running in a mere sprinkle it quit charging.. same thing happened before but I thought I’d give it another chance!!
1,"Headphones working wihout issue and with great sound after 1 month, though as a small woman they do not fit snugly, even in the smallest size of the three covers that come with the set (this has made me consider ear size relative to height as a valid issue for the first time :P). They haven't actually fallen out while running, but it feels like they will, which can be a little distracting, and since they are not snug it does have a mild negative impact on sound quality. I might have only given 3 stars for this reason, except that I had an excellent experience with customer service, because when I received my package it had been tampered with and the actual headphones stolen (presumably by someone at Amazon because the Amazon tape was intact, but the inner package had been broken into). I called Senso customer service and they gave me no hassle whatsoever in sending me a replacement set right away."
1,"2 stars...The earpiece is not very steady and the whole head set keeps falling down to the ground, because it doesn't have any wait to hold it in place. The sound quality is poor, but I have to say the customer service is excellent. It might work for you but sadly it didn't work for me at all."
1,Works great
1,Work great! Sound is very clear. Much better than my last pair (different brand)
1,"Before these I used the wireless over-the-head ear pieces. I was a little skeptical of going to the wireless ear buds, for fear that they would fall out often while in the gym or running. I bought these for the reviews and the over-the-ear place holders. I love them, and nothing gets in the way or feels annoying!"
1,fits well
1,These work great!  Had my first pair for work and lasted 2 years in a autobody shop. Used 5 days a week 8 hours a day!  Would recommend!
1,I was a little doubtful when I made the order. Best wireless earphones I have owned and the sound is really good for the price paid.<br />Their customer service is paramount.
1,These are GREAT headphones. Every package comes with different items inside. So check that 1st. this is my 2nd pair because I lost the 1st pair.
1,Love these earphones and this brand. Would definitely buy again.
1,"Great headphones. Plenty loud, clear sound, and most importantly, they stay in your ear!"
1,Love the headphones but didn’t receive the vent clip and wallet as stated in the pictures.  Would like to get them.
0,Poor sound quality
1,work great. They have a good bass response.<br />Update 2020: bought in Jan 2017. Still charging well. Still connecting well although some software updates make them act a little funny. Not their fault at all. Still have great bass and make my music sound amazing. Happy with my purchase. One of my best value purchases in a long time! Highly recommend.
1,"So far so good.  I had a bit of trouble finding the right fit for the ear buds and I had hoped the part that goes over the ear would have been a hard plastic verses a soft bendy piece, however, I ran a 1/2 marathon in a strong wind this weekend and they worked well.  Stayed in for the most part with little adjusting.  I do find I get static while listening to music - they aren't crystal clear, but they still are good."
1,My son loves them- says the sound is excellent and they block out noise as well.  You can't be the price- about 1/4 of the price of the top name brand.  If you aren't stuck on having a certain brand these are excellent headphones.
1,"Great sound and very comfortable! I was very pleasantly surprised with these earphones. The sound is surprisingly good, with good bass response and fidelity. Great deal for the price point!"
1,love them
1,It's good. Battery long is amazing.
0,Stopped working after 3 months :(
1,Very useful with great sound and features.
0,"poor sound, all muffled. Had high expectations given the ratings of the headphones but felt like wtf."
1,Good quality.  Functions as anticipated.
1,"Easy to use, works great!  love them!!"
1,"The package contains extras such as car USB adapter and micro USB and Apple connector.<br />The headphone is very well-made.  One nice feature is that the headphone actually tell you<br />what it is doing.  For example, when you power up, the headphone actually announces &#34;power up.&#34;<br />The battery seems to last a long time and the sound quality is good.  It is very comfortable to wear<br />and easy to pair with your devices."
1,Second pair
1,The headphones are a great fit and works well...comes with a carrying case and extra ear buds for sizes.
1,"Bought these nearly a year ago and use them 5-6 days a week between work, gym, running and traveling. I keep them in the case to prevent damage when not in use. Only had one issue, I dropped them and they would not connect via bluetooth to any device. I performed a factory reset and they've worked perfectly since. Sound is decent but certainly not Bose quality. All in all these are great and I will purchase another pair when these die."
1,Awesome! It comes with a case which makes it even easier to keep it in my gym bag. Super comfortable. Highly recommend!
1,"I'd been looking for quality earbuds that were comfortable for workouts, could hold up to sweat and heat and sounded good. I read mixed reviews about BT Beats and figured I'd get something else while waiting for their price to go down and quality to go up. Decided to order these while waiting and I LOVE THEM. Best earbuds I've ever had. They last the advertised 8 hours, charge fast, are comfortable to wear and sound GREAT. I ordered a 2nd pair so I don't have to transport them back and forth from home and my gym bag. For $30, why not?!"
0,"Poor quality, after a month of using broke and does not work."
1,They were great while they lasted.... 1 and 1/2.
1,"This is my second pair and they work perfectly. I had problems with the first pair and had to customer service twice. They have outstanding customer service. My item was replaced immediately and under his suggestion. Oh, and they sound great too!!:):)"
1,"Purchased these headphones after seeing them as a best seller on amazon.  Easy setup/pairing with my phone.  Wasn't sure if I would like the over-the-ear style, but figured I could give them a try.  Very comfortable.  Overall, very happy with the purchase.<br /><br />EDIT: My wife liked the headphones so much I ordered another set for her!"
1,"The wireless headset seems to work fine thus far. Sound volume has excellent range. Sound quality is good enough for the application: on the go. But sound range not wonderful when wanting to hear treble end. For the price, so far so good."
1,"I like the headphones, great for working out!<br />Great price for sound price."
1,Can't complain for the price. Worth every penny
0,"I purchased these hoping to be able to run and listen to music without having earbuds falling out constantly. These are too big, even with the smallest attachment, to fit into my ears. I've tried several times to put them in, even squeezing the rubber and shoving it into my earhole. Even when I managed to get them in, they are so heavy that they fall out within 2 seconds. If they manage to stay in for longer than 2 seconds, they fall out if I move. These are absolutely useless, and I do not suggest them. My boyfriend can manage to get them into his ears with the smallest buds on them, but they still fall out while running. He will keep them for weight lifting that doesn't require a lot of jarring movements, but these will not work for running."
1,"I use them almost everyday, mostly while doing yard work or walking the dog. Even on a hot sweaty day, they stay in my ears and don't fall out. I never have any problems with having to re-pair them to my phone when I turn them on and off. The ear pieces really keep out the noise. They were a bargain as well."
1,Amazing!!! Absolutely love them.
1,Uncomfortable after a few minutes. Not worth the money
1,Excellent service. Works better than what I expected. Would recommend!
1,"Sound quality is very good for this type of product and so is the price point.  Accessories are a bonus.  Company has first rate customer service and I think they actually care about what you think of their product, refreshing.  I would but a SENSO product again.  ."
1,The sound is AMAZING. Sound is comparable to BEATS!! Comfortable too.
0,"We thought the first pair we received were just a dud, but the second pair just died, too. Select another brand!"
1,Love these sound is great
1,They fit perfect on  my ears. They sound good and block outside noise. So fr so good no complaints.
1,The first pair I bought was about a year ago. They worked great no problems so i bought my grown kids a pair
1,These are awesome!!
1,"These headphones are perfect! They fit very snug around my ear and don't come loose when running or exercising. They are super loud, which I love! My previous headphones (skull candy) weren't loud enough to cancel out the super loud gym music in the background, but with these I don't hear any outside noise whatsoever! It comes with a super handy round zip up case you can store the head phones in, a portable car charger that has two ports, and a dual USB (one for iPhone and one for android) I would def. recommend these headphones to anyone in the market for Bluetooth headphones that aren't a nuisance, sound great, and can hold a charge!"
1,I ordered these after watching reviews on YouTube as well as seeing great reviews on Amazon. Just got them and I must say I am impressed. For wireless headphones under $50 they seem high quality. The case is a round shell and it has many options for charging. Extra buds were included and the charged lightening fast. The sound is also impressive! I am glad I went with these. This was a great purchase. I am bad with headphones and I think these will be a great fit. I probably will order more in the future as gifts. I am definitely recommending these.
0,I am so disappointed in these.  They started out fine but after a short time the bluetooth connection goes in and out so much I finally took them off and pulled out my old wired ones.  Specifically any time I go outside.  I was hoping to use them while I was gardening or mowing the lawn.  I tried them in my shorts pocket.  Every time I would kneel down the sound would cut out.  I eventually changed to a t-shirt that had a pocket on the chest and put my phone in that.  Again it would still go in and out and say &#34;Connected&#34; over and over.  Finally I even held the phone against the headphones just to see if that worked.  Still I had problems.  Inside the house seems fine but they're supposed to have a 30' range.  I didn't even get a 3' range.  And of course I've had them for about six weeks so it's too late to return them.
1,"These are amazing. I was looking for a gift for a friend, and thought for the price I'd try them as well. After I used them I bought two more pair and recommend them to several people in my office. The sound is amazing, and they fit so well.<br />The only possible downside is that the minimum volume before mute is a little loud."
0,So I bought these headphones because I wanted a decent set to workout in the gym with. For the first couple months they worked pretty well. The sound quality is okay but worth it for the price but 6 months later they dont work. They keep beeping and disconnecting. I tried charging them and the beeping still occured. I also tried unpairing the blue tooth and repairing but the issue persists. I do not think these headphones are worth the money honestly.
1,"Ordered 2 pairs of earphones, one for myself and one for my husband. We use them mostly for the gym. They are great! Great sound, they stay in place, and they are easy to use! Would highly recommend to anyone looking for wireless ear phones."
1,LOVE them!!!
1,Finally a pair of wireless headphones that stay in my ears. Lightweight and very comfortable. Just as advertised. Thank you!!
1,"These headphones have been working like magic with my Apple Watch Nike series 2.<br />The only problems I've ever had have something to do with the watch searching for wifi and cellular connections.<br />If you are streaming to a bluetooth device that has wifi, I suggest not starting music until you disconnect from all connections.<br />They fit my ear canal perfectly but I know that wasn't the case for my friend. Sound is great, no skipping except in the case I described above, but even that stops after a while. Today I did a 12 mile run streaming a playlist from my watch and it was perfect. I have been using it for months and honestly the only reason I came back and wrote a review is because I'm thinking about buying an extra one."
1,"I love my new Senso Bluetooth headphones. I use to hate running on the treadmill with my old headphones they use to slip out of my ears every time I started sweating, not anymore. I love the fact that every time I connect or disconnect my Bluetooth it lets me know via voice prompt. It comes nicely packed in a box with a storage box, extra earbuds, o short usb charging cord and a long usb charging cord for car. This is good stuff is high quality from the packaging box to the headphones. If you like running on the treadmill and hate your old headphones I recommend that you buy these your going to love them, no more workout interruptions."
1,I needed some low profile headphones for when I run and these work fine.
1,I was concerned that the over-the-ear design might not work with my eyeglasses but no problem.  And they are so much better that my 'stick these in your ears' wired earbuds which I frequently had to adjust to get the best sound.  I use them most while walking the gym's treadmill - a little classic rock encourages the exercise!  A quality product - thanks.
1,Amazing headphones at a great price.  I would absolutely buy these again.
1,GREAT SOUND
1,"I've had these in the past and I do not like these at all. I think they got a 3 cause they could be worse but the ear pieces are not as soft as the previous one of the same brand. They don't have as good of sound, when i put my phone in my pocket the sound skips as if the bluetooth connection isn't strong enough depsite it saying it has a 30ft distance. Definitely wish my old ones still worked!"
1,Working great!!
1,"OMG this makes life so simple, the sound quality is amazing, the battery life goes one for ever, and it as not died on me yet, nice color, i have being using this for over 3 month. money was very well spent."
0,"the item is bulky, keeps falling off my ears and overall poorly designed. Not a fan at all, would not recommend."
1,Great wireless headphones for the price.
1,"While I think these headphones fit nicely and sound quality is good, mine came with the wrong cable (the cable that came with it is to charge an iPhone) and somewhat used ear plugs. I presume that I was sent a product that has already been used by someone else and re-sent to me without checking it. Other than that I'd say buck for bang."
1,Best wireless headphones!!!
1,The headphones are amazing I truly enjoy them
1,"They work well, have great sound quality, and  really good range!"
1,"I went through several more expensive pairs of headphones before I landed on these.  I run in Seattle, which means lots of rainy runs.  Previous headphones died on me within a few months of exposure.  These have made it nearly a year now, and are going strong.<br /><br />From the price, you should know these are not high end headphones.  Audio quality is fairly middling.  And at least with my ears, there’s substantial wind noise, thanks to the air gap where they wrap around my ears in front.  Battery life is excellent.  So good, that I’ll forget about charging them, only for them to die mid-run.  There is a warning that goes off, but it gives about 10 more minutes of usage.  So if it goes off, odds are it’ll go dead before the end of the workout.<br /><br />Still, I’m very happy with the durability.  The fact that they’re still working outweighs any sound quality concerns."
1,I like every thing about the sensor Bluetooth headset
1,"If you are like me...loosing headphones or they stop working....I could no longer see paying high dollar for ear buds I wear 12 hours a week. These ear buds fit well. Comfortable to wear, and have great sound. Do yourself a favor...if your looking for wireless earbuds...give these a try and if you decide you want more expensive ones...they were only 35 bucks to try."
1,Great product and the service was great!
1,"The only thing that I would recommend, KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK! I love the mids and the bottom. Personally, I would prefer a little more on the high end. Not worth dropping a star for. Comfort is superior to any I've worn. Has them in for five hours yesterday and actually forgot they were in ears. Seriously. That's pretty comfy. Great job - great price - great service - great follow-up! Thanks!"
1,Great. That all need to be said. Sell itself.
1,"They have good sound quality but when talking and conversation,  not over excited."
1,"Only used it for the gym. Does what I need it to do. Nothing fancy, just something to play my music through as I workout."
1,"These earbuds have great sound quality, stay in place with the over-the-ear frame, and the battery lasts much longer than any other Bluetooth earbuds I’ve used before. I really like the foam padding that comes with them as an option to use rather than the standard rubber padding. If you’ve ever used foam hearing protection that you squeeze and roll to make smaller, place in your ear canal, and then it expands to fill the canal; this is the same concept but they have holes in the middle so you can hear the sound. Very comfortable and blocks out most external sound.<br /><br />My only complaint with these is that they often don’t want to connect quickly to the phone. Any time I turn them on I hear the voice say “Power on...connected” but if I start playing music it just plays on the phone’s speaker. It sometimes takes 30 seconds or more to actually start sending the audio to the earbuds, and sometimes never actually connects even though it says they’re connected in the settings. Also, even after connecting, the play/pause, volume up/down buttons sometimes don’t work and I have to go to the phone to make any adjustments.<br /><br />I’ve tried multiple other Bluetooth earbuds with the phone and these are the only ones that have this issue. If not for this issue they’d get five stars.<br /><br />UPDATE - After emailing the company about the problems I was having, they replied back with the following information:<br />&#34;Let's try a factory reset for your Senso headphones which usually fixes most similar issues related to the issue you are facing with your headphones.<br /><br />Here are the instructions for resetting the headphones:<br /><br />1. Reset the Senso headphone to factory settings (while plugged into a power source, press/hold the power button for 7 seconds).<br />2. Unplug the headphone from charging cable and power them on.<br />3. Enter the earbuds into the pairing mode and follow instructions for connecting.&#34;<br /><br />After doing the factory reset, they headphones are working great! They connect immediately and don't drop the connection. This made all the difference."
1,Quick delivery! Worked perfectly! Just what I was looking for!
1,Wife loved them
1,Impressive headphones. Very good sound quality. Sound is very clear and balanced. Maybe needs a little bit more bass but not necessary  Since 1995 I'm using Bluetooth. Hate cables!!!!!!  Right now I own 5 ones. 2 regular one . And 3 earbuds. Those ones &#34; Senso&#34; are my favorite ones.and the price is a stil steal. Just ordered another one.
1,"i love the sound quality of this product, buds are comfortable to wear and battery life if great.  i was really enjoying my buds until they stopped  working. i would have rated all 5's if my buds were still working"
1,Very happy with the item.
1,"Great set of headphones.  The fit is comfortable, the sounds is crisp.  The follow up by the company is comforting, that if there is a problem, they will respond immediately."
1,Good quality
0,"Had these for just over a month (unfortunately) just longer than the return window.  You get what you pay for in terms of sound quality, tended to have some problems with getting a clear signal via Bluetooth.  Not the easiest to adjust to your ears and they never seemed to stay at the an adjustment that worked. Worst of all they will no longer charge.  I had a similar set (assuming same manufacturer) that had other charging issues.  I’d stay clear of these or any other similar set."
1,"I would give these a 5, but the right bud comes out when I am lifting weights.  It might be my ear though as I tried a PowerBeats 3 and it did the same thing.  Have to say, I tried on PowerBeats 3 and they feel just about the same.  I am not big into sound quality so I did not test this.  Great product, excellent value/"
1,Great set!  Stays on even during rigorous exercise; sound is great; great price.  Highly recommend.
1,"I bought these as a gift for my husband first. He raved about them for a while, and I decided to buy myself some since I was tired of *always* catching the wires of my headphones on stuff. I have to say, he was absolutely right, these are great headphones. We've had his for almost two years and they're still going strong. Mine are every bit as fantastic as the day we bought them as well. The volume capabilities are great (I often use mine during yard work when there are typically machines making noise that has to be competed with, and I can *always* hear whatever I'm listening too very clearly), the battery seems to last forever (about 8 hours of use between charges), and they aren't uncomfortable or heavy. I love these headphones!"
1,Giod quality
1,The wife loves them.......Happy wife....Happy life!!!!!!
1,"I don't like earbuds, but I wanted some lightweight bluetooth headphones. These are much nicer than I expected. The battery lasts forever! I've had them for weeks and listened to hours of podcasts. I've only had to charge them twice. The foam earbuds are much more comfortable than the squishy plastic that is typical for in ear heaphones. Overall, I am really pleased with these!"
1,Very happy with the ear buds.
1,"It has been several months since I gave these to my son. He uses them virtually every day and loves them. Very durable, great sound, and better that average battery life. My son is not gentle on these type of products and if they can survive him they are tough. Thanks!!!"
1,Excellent headphones!
1,These headphones are amazing and have incredible durability.
1,Love these! Great sound and perfect for the gym!
1,Awesome headphones for the price
1,High end quality sound and construction at a low end price. Highly recommend for gym use. Pairs easily with my iPhone 7. One of the best deals on Amazon.
1,I like not being wired to my phone.  Sound quality is great.
1,I LOVE IT ALL! ITS EVERYTHING I WAS ASKING FOR!<br />1.) It connects SO easily.<br />2.) The distance in connection is long af. I can go upstairs and downstairs in my home and only every now and then it gets disconnected but it AUTOMATICALLY re-connects itself once I’m in range.<br />2.) The way it’s designed helps it not fall of your ears even after 2 minutes of jumping<br />3.) The sounds is perfect! The bass is beautiful along with all the other sound stuff.<br />4.) there’s no ringing and/or beeping<br />5.) it came with a cute case & extra ear bud stuff<br />6.) Pricing is totally responsible considering how everything is exactly what you need for workout headphones.
0,They just don’t fit well. Disappointed.
1,Sound quality is great!
0,Stopped charging after 3rd charge
1,They fit comfortably but the sound is muffled.  At first I thought it was because the bass was too high but I compared them to 3 other sets of headphones and they definitely are not very clear.  I'll keep them for running and working out I guess but don't expect any hi definition sound.
1,"I have had these headphones for 2 days now and they are awesome! Fit my ears well and stay in place! Good sound! Holds charge so far, wore them for almost 8 hours first go! All the buttons work so far...haven't used it with a phone call yet so not sure about call clarity but will update! Only gave it 4 stars, I would give it 4.5 stars if I could, because they are a little bulky...also they charge with a smartphone  port, didn't like that the 3 foot charger has an Iphone charger attached...good for those that use an Iphone...can dual charge I guess!"
0,I used for five minutes and the wind sound was louder than a nearby lawn mower even with no music or cues on!  I my music or running app cues were barely audible even at max volume.  These headphones could work in a still room but they seemed heavy on my ears so active use might be a problem too.
0,Had them for a short period of time before they quit working. I run 6 or 7 miles a day and I constantly had to adjust them to stay in my ears. They suddenly quit working one day in the middle of a run and I'm assuming it was because of sweat...? Very disappointed.<br />*UPDATE* They sent me another pair which lasted 6 weeks or so. I complained and I just got my 3rd pair. Will see how long these last.
1,"I bought these based on a survey of Bluetooth earbuds, which rated these as having the best sound.<br /><br />I really wanted to like these, and there's a lot to like.  The price is right, and the package includes lots of extras - a sturdy case, lots of different earpieces to achieve a good fit, and a very nifty charging cord that can be used either for the earphones or for your iPhone or iPad.  And indeed, they fit well; the piece that goes around the ear is stiff enough to keep them in place, but not so stiff as to be uncomfortable.  They pair easily with my iPhone and iPad, and the controls are easy to use.<br /><br />The problem?  The sound is not as good as I expected, and not nearly as good as other Bluetooth earphones I've used before.  There's too much bass, and the bass is boomy to an annoying degree.  And if you achieve a good seal, which is one of the points of plug type earphones, it's even worse.  Spotify has an equalizer to make them tolerable, but just barely."
1,These are the best headphones I have ever used. Very good sound and comfortable. Would highly recommend.
1,Very good headphone running
1,Received a gift from my friend and beside the price the quality is excellent. I have them for over a year and I used to buy at least 1 pair for different brand every six month if so! Highly recommend it I run with it and they stay still. Love them best gift ever.
1,What I dislike about this product is that it hurts my inner bone of my ear with the plastic around the earbud
1,"I was shockingly surprised how good these headphones sound, and especially for the price.  They sound as good as the wired pair I own, and prior to these I had Beats bluetooth headphones, and these are much better. The only thing I don't care for is the wrap around ear clip is pretty flimsy."
1,"I ran a 10k recently with my new SENSO headphones. As others stated the sound is pretty great! My biggest thing with ear phones that they need to stay put in the ears during activity and that's why I purchased these...well during my 6.2mi run I had to readjust both earphones which was annoying while running and they did attempt to fall out on several occasions during my run. I'm Not sur if these are the greatest earphones for long distance running, But for a few miles it may do well and working out I'm sure it would do justice. I also felt they were slipping out while I was sweating. Not sweat friendly. But for the price I guess you can't really beat it"
0,"The sound is great. The stay in your ears well and don't bruise surrounding areas. However, the earbuds do not stay on and constantly disappear or stay in your ear, when removing the rest of the device and after 6 months of use, the battery is shot and it shuts off every ten minutes. It also loses connection if your phone is in your back pocket and you squat down 😒. I would not buy again."
1,"Good product considering the price you pay. I have interacted with their support, very good experience."
1,"Comfortable and works well. Battery life isn't super long, but if you charge after every 4-5 hours of use you should be okay. The wire occasionally gets twisted which can be annoying, but that's expected. Holds secure to my ears. Would buy again."
1,Not the best at noise cancelling but overall great for the price
1,"Excellent pair of headphones, extremely flexible and comfortable feel  yet durable. Sound quality is very good and voice pickup from the mic is much better than other headsets. Pushing the multifunction button presses the earbud a bit hard into the eardrum but you can compensate by holding it out with your other fingers."
1,I have used them twice and they fit and sound very good.....I'll be testing them on the tennis courts...the true test
1,fraction of the price of beats and they work as good as the beats i had.
1,Fits nice in ear. No outside noise gets in.
1,Great Earbuds.
1,"They sound better than any other in-ear headphones I have used.  Very light, and the extras like the case and unique charger cable/plug make it very flexible."
1,"Best Bluetooth headphones I’ve ever had. From the price to the quality, just everything about these headphones made me feel good about my purchase. Would definitely recommend."
0,Stopped working after 3 months for no apparent reason.
1,I have been pleasantly surprised with these. I work out and sweat with these almost every day and have had no problems. I just bought a second pair for my wife to use. Great product! Great price!
1,Bought this for my husband to wear while he mows and he loved them
1,A very nice set of headphones for the price.  Easy to set up.  I have not had the opportunity to use them much but the sound and fit is good.
1,"Really poor sound quality. I mean really poor; its like someone took your perfect EQ settings in your app and pushed everything back to the middle. Really flat mids and highs, strong bass, but who cares if the rest of the sound quality is terrible?<br /><br />Only reason I am giving this 3 stars is because it works. I even accidentally ran it through the wash machine and its still working. Once I started using this to watch youtube videos on my tablet without disrupting everyone else, I forgave it for its sound quality (i.e., not using it for music)."
0,The over-the-ear part is soft and flimsy. They won't stay in.
1,👍🏻
1,loved these so much I bought another pair for my husband!  Great value
1,Muy buen sonido me gustan mucho sobre todo la duracion de la batería gracias
0,"Inexplicably stopped working after a few months, very disappointing based on all these great reviews.  I sweat a lot and suspect these may not be as sweatproof as claimed.  The battery also lasts nowhere near 8 hours fully charged, probably closer to 4 or 5 at most."
1,"They sound really good but seem to have trouble keeping them in my ear.  I changed the size and it seems to fit better but still seem to be fiddling with them for awhile until they get right.  The cord that connects both of the ear pieces is a little long but its nice so you don't lose them.  They ear covers are flimsy but they do help to keep them in your ears.  I've given them a 4 star rating because they sound great (decent bass), you can get about 20ft away from your phone before they start to get staticy, the battery life is AMAZING.  I've literally been using them for hours every day and still haven't needed to charge them (i've had them for about a week).  ALSO love that you get a phone charger w/car adapter to charge them. They are easy to pair and overall a great set of Bluetooth headphones."
0,"These were great for around 3 weeks, then the bluetooth radio completely stopped working (I tried connecting them to multiple devices). I submitted a request for a refund and never heard back from the seller.<br /><br />Avoid buying."
1,The product works fairly well.<br />Only problem is turning it off. May have to do it 6 to 7 times or more.<br />Usually it tries to make a phone call.
1,"I really love these headphones. I'm giving 5 stars because even though I started having trouble with these, the customer service IS 5 stars. They are prompt, courteous and immediately worked to resolve the problem."
1,"They're not bad.  For $35 i feel they warrant 3.5 stars.  I use them mostly while on the eliptical.  I'm not a big fan of earphones but these fit fine.  Sound is pretty good but not great.  The ear hooks are rather flimsy.  I think it'd make more sense if those were firmer.  I haven't fully drained the battery on these but I do know that they last at least 6 hours.  Overall, there's some good positives and a few negatives which leads me to 3 stars.  If I needed to buy another pair of earphones, I might consider these again as well as look at other options.<br /><br />BTW, The bonus 12V charger is junk.  I tried to use it in my car but when I did the radio stations were mostly static."
1,"For $20 the best headphones I have had ever. I had a $100 pair and these are pretty close in sound quality to those. They fit well, stay put and if you ride a scooter/motorcycle, you can still hear the music pleanty while riding and they stay in place! Been using them for about 2 weeks now and still havent needed to charge them yet. Will buy again if needed"
0,I am not sure how to put this but here goes.<br />Its rated the best in the amazon market but i am not at all satisfied with the pair i have got..the left ear piece is damaged dosent work properly and the ear hook on it is also molded incorrectly which seems to be a odd thing.<br />And as reviewers say you can shape the ear-hooks to have a better fit &#34;Wrong&#34; they do not have that property to it at all.<br /><br />So Overall I am not happy with the product i have got.
1,"Excellent sound, good comfortable fit, fair pricing , easy pairing-go for it."
1,Nice product. Easy to setup and great sound
1,"Good fit, easy to sync, good sound....lets put to the sweat test."
1,"Bought these expecting budget quality (washed out and flat), and I have been pleasantly surprised.  They have a full range of sound and carry bass beautifully.  I work a fast paced physical job that's often sweaty, and they haven't fallen, slipped, or had any degradation of quality.  It does help to get a clip to attach them to your collar to prevent the cord from sliding around."
1,Awesome i love it
0,"Good wireless function but the cord gets pulled to one side when working out, they really aren’t good for working out which is why I bought them, disappointed"
0,"I previously let a glowing review, but these headphones hardly lasted four months. Totally dead. Will update if they send a replacement."
1,"4.5 stars. These sound great. Loud, clear highs and lows. It isn't just bass."
1,Great sound quality.
1,Bought for my 10 year old son and he loves them. They sound good and clear and very loud. Only issue he has is the left one falls out of his ear a lot. For $30 we paid for them they are great Bluetooth headphones so far
1,Sound better than a 1000 plus stack Sterio by headphones. You could hear a triangle behind the base drum. Thanks
1,My son bought these and absolutely loves them. The fit is excellent and I appreciate the durability. Get these
1,"I like the headphones.  My only suggest is that the multi function button - power on and off as well as receiving a call - is extremely easy to press when you don't mean to do so.  This is because putting on the head phone is easiest by pushing exactly where that button is.  Even knowing that, I have inadvertently ended a phone call and had to call back several time.<br /><br />Other than that, I am delighted and truly appreciate the one year warranty as well as your followup to assure I am happy with the product."
1,"decent sound, comfortable, move a litte with running and sweating but still stay in ear"
1,"These headphones are a replacement for my Dre beats headset I currently own. In comparisons, Senseo sound, design and quality are comprable to Dre Beats in every way. I also like the buttons functions that are on the actual earpiece and not on the connecting wire as on the Dre beats. Save yourself about $130 and DONT waste your time and money with Dre Beats set, all I had with them was alit of problems with my 4 replacement headsets sent to me over the coursee of 1.5 years with Apple. ALL BUT ONE that they sent back were refurbished ones and quickly stoppoed working right after about 3 months. Hopefully, Senseo stands the test of time better than my DRE BEATS did for me. ENJOYING THIS HEADSET so far."
1,easy to use. easy to set up. comfortable. good sound.
0,"I’ve had these less than a year, everyday use. They worked well for a while, decent sound quality. I also got a flurry of emails after my purchase touting the warranty.<br />I have gotten about 8 months out of them. Now the Bluetooth inconsistently connects and disconnects, and the battery lasts around an hour on a full charge. Of course, I’ve had no response from the company when trying to contact them."
1,"I have several wireless headphones that I formerly used while at the gym. The others would fall out of my ears will on exercising due to sweating! I have not had an issue of that nature at all, plus the sound is extremely clear! I got them fast after ordering. I charged them up and the charge lasts a long time. I love them and I will order a second pair for emergency gym time."
1,Everything I needed and more! You get a lot for your money!
1,We were hopin it would fit into my 13 year old daughters ear. Unfortunately it did not.
1,Haven't gotten the connection between the buds and phone. The ear hooks don't feel sturdy.
1,These headphones are a great buy. The sound is good and stay in my ears when I run. I would recommend these to anyone that is looking for cheap quality headphones.
1,For the price they are excellent.. I use more than I thought I would
1,Great sound quality!  I really like that the cord is much more pliable than most Bluetooth headphones.
1,"We ordered two pairs of the headphones to accommodate our use of two IPhone 7s. One pair appears fine. The other was defective and we will return it. Your company accepted the return so there are no problems there. Sound came out of only one side of the defective headphone. I made sure the headphone was fully charged and got the same result. Sound on the working pair appears ok for the price. If it continues to work it will be a good value. We were disappointed however to find out, after reading the instructions that you can overcharge, and thus damage the headphones if you leave the headphones charging overnight. On the other hand, the directions say that you can recharge the battery using any wall charger or computer hooked up to the micro USB cord. I don't understand why you can overcharge the battery by leaving it charging for too long but not overcharge the battery if you use a wall or car plug that has too much outgoing power."
1,Very good and works perfectly.
1,"Great headphones! Fit comfortably, superb sound quality, and very easy to use. Would definitely recommend!"
1,Fast delivery and great sound.
1,"WORTH THE BUY, compete with beats for a fraction of the price."
1,They came through a heavy rain as I rode for an hour on the freeway.  They still work.  That's good.
1,Have used for a year work great
1,They stay in place during my workouts and the sound quality is excellent. Very happy with my purchase.
0,"I have had my Powerbeats wireless headphones for about 3 years now and they have been amazing. Unfortunately, they took a trip through my washing machine recently and didn't make it to the other side still functioning. Instead of spending another $200 on the same headphones, I did some research and found these to look almost the exact same online and figured the quality might be similar since there were so many amazing reviews and the number of reviews was so high. When I went to put them on I noticed the part that goes over the ear to be very flimsy and unstable, making it a little more difficult to put on. The earbud part seemed to fit in my ear fine. When I tried to use them on a video chat call, the person on the other end said they could barely make out what I was saying and that there was a lot of static. After turning them off and switching to wired headphones for my voice call, I tried to listen to music on them and the sound quality was crap. I also used these in my house and had my phone in one room and when I went into the other rooms of my house, the headphones started losing connection like they were out of range. I don't have a big house and this hasn't ever happened with my Beats.  Maybe I am forever ruined because I know how well Beats did their product and how well they worked for everything I needed them for or maybe my expectations were too high but for as much as I need these type of headphones for, I will be spending another ridiculous amount of money to have beats again. These headphones are in a box ready to go back to wherever they came from."
0,Arrived in May and already quit working in one month. I thought it might be the low battery but the battery shows full (blue light when I connect power cable) just won't turn on. Total waste of my money.
1,"Head set works well, easy to pair and charge"
1,"delivered as promised, I purchased this 5 years ago. when they finally broke just recently, I bought another pair."
1,"Great quality, and great customer service. Nice job."
1,I like the sound quality quite a bit. The only thing I would have to say I dislike is the length of the cord around the neck. Sometimes it pulls an ear bud out slightly. An easy and perhaps miniscule fix but just what I have to say. I would recommend these headphones though.
1,"For the price, you can't ask for more."
1,I really enjoy my headphones. I will most def say it was a good purchase but people cant hear me when I try to talk on them.
1,After one year the left side stooped working
1,Love these headphones - have went through several other brands and types but these ones are holding up the best - great sound - great price..!!
1,Love these headphones! Comfortable and last a long time on a battery charge.
1,"Sound quality is not the best and it sometimes loses signal, but for the price I can live with it."
1,"No complaints. Great sound, durable quality. Fair price for the product."
1,Take a long time to recharge. Get tangled in hair.
1,Like the base on the headphone..very easy to pair with phone
1,This was a gift for my son. He loves them. I would purchase this product again.
1,working good!
1,"Nice, soft, and light. Sounds awesome while working out. Happy Happy !!!!!"
1,Great product well worth the money
1,Excellent- the best pair of buds ever used. Beats my old Bose (wired) too! And product support (so it appears) ahead of the competition at a fraction of the price
1,The headphones are awesome! Especially for the price. The amount of accessories that come with it is pretty neat. The quality of the sound was great also. I can hear the bass pretty well and Bluetooth connectivity is easy to pair. I have used this a couple of times during my jogging activities and they have worked fine as of yet.
0,"The sound quality was better than expected and the earbuds are relatively user-friendly. Wind noise during runs was noticeable but not a deal-breaker.<br />Speaking of deal-breakers ... they are difficult to get onto my ears and do not fit my ears snuggly. During my workouts, they shift frequently and fall off occasionally - I ended up trying to pin the plastic arms under my sunglasses temples to hold them in place. For me, they are too bulky, which may be part of the reason they don't stay put.<br />The inconvenience of fitting them onto my ears, along with their tendency to move around during wear, means that these earbuds are being returned."
0,I don’t really like it.
1,It is the second time that I order these headphones I use them for the gym and run and I am pleased with their quality and resistance.
1,Great deal. A lot of useful items included with headset.
0,"They are okay for the price, but don't be fooled into the reviews that claim these work as well as the beats. Connectivity is fine, the fit is fine, but the sound quality is definitely not on par with beats or even other similarly priced wireless earphones. I wanted to give it a try for a while to make sure that it wasn't an illusion but I have used these for months and it seems clear; the volume is not equal on both sides. Right ear bud is noticeably louder than the left, and this bugs the crap out of me. I am not sure if it's just mine that has this problem, but one side being noticeably louder has been a big enough problem that I end up not using them at the gym half of the time.<br /><br />They may be okay if you just want cheap wireless earphones for listening to podcasts and etc., but I would not recommend if you are thinking that you will get high quality sound for music in general."
1,"I love these headphones!  These have a much richer sound than my previous bluetooth headphones.  They were easy to connect to my iPod and are very comfortable to wear in the gym.  In addition, the Invotek customer service is excellent.  I had an issue with my headphones and when I contacted them about it, they immediately responded and resolved my issue.  I would not hesitate to purchase products from this company in the future!!!"
1,Great headphones. I use them during my daily run and they stay on no matter what. The quality of the sound is very good. All these features for a very reasonable price.
1,"Great sound quality pretty easy to use, perfect for me I use it at the gym all the time and love it. Got this one sale at a great price from Amazon"
0,I was loving my earplugs and tgey just stopped working last night with no warning. I bought them in May so that's not a long time. I'm not HAPPY. I'm going to check and see if I bought insurance.
1,"I'm not tech savvy but these wireless headphones were the easiest technology I've every used!  I took them out of the package, bluetooth immediately picked it up new device, put earbuds in my ears....and started dancing!"
1,"I love it, its very comfortable, good sound quality, it doesnt hurt my ears and I used everyday. It turn off automatically if its non-active, it last for 8-12hrs and it charges in 4 hrs aprox."
0,The sound is great but the ear pieces are so flimsy that if you run or exercise while wearing them the do not hold to your ears.  The rubber is large and floppy.  I bought them for my wife but she can't get them to stay in her ears at all.  I can wear them for low impact exercise but they do not work for running
1,Best Bluetooth headphones I have purchased; purchased it as a gift for someone & now buying myself a pair. I was at a Bang & Olufsen store & they tried to sell me on a $250.00 sub par headset; Then I found these & I have been amazed. Highly recommend them to anyone looking to venture out in Bluetooth technology & leave the plugins at home.
1,Great product.... good company to work with.
1,"Awesome !! These are great ear buds for working out , I can leave my phone across the gym and never lose signal. Battery life is excellent as well."
1,"I have had these headphones for 3 months now. I really like them, you can turn up the volume more than with common headphones. They are are easy to connect and provide stable connection. The only negative side is that the band has some kind of rough feeling and it tubs against my t-shirt."
1,Thrilled!! Work great! Fabulous price! Definitely recommend!!
1,"I bought these headphones for the gym because the music they play there is awful.  These buds are very comfortable and easy to use.  At first I had to crank up the volume to drown out the gym PA, but once I switched to the foam inserts, they fit much tighter in my ear so less extraneous noise can get in."
1,"The sound seems mixed, Seperation of left & right channel is not enough."
0,The headphones no longer work and have only been used for 3 months!
1,"Nice,clear sound . Can't hardly tell there on your ears."
1,"Just received them yesterday and so far I'm happy, thanks for your  follow up email."
1,"These sound amazing! Great bass, good sound. Battery life about 6-8 hours."
1,"Fast shipping,  and a you can't beat the price for the quality of this product!  Would purchase again:)"
1,Hear good
1,These headphones are a very good value. The quality is superb especially considering the price. Everything about this product is top notch including the packaging. I’ll buy another set for my office.
0,"Though the sound is good, It broke on one side within a week of normal use."
1,Really like these
1,Just what I was look for
1,"These earbuds work wonderfully, lite-weight, sound quality is excellent. Pairing with my phone was seamless. Very pleased with the purchase."
1,Light easy connect and good sound
0,"awful head set, does not stay on the ears, the rubber not rigged enough<br />Blue tooth has very short distance and hard to sync.<br />Overall very poor Product./"
1,"Had these for about a year and they were great at first. The ear buds are connected by a cable that gets pulled on as you move around. Overtime the left ear bud became less loud. Even though I was gentle with the headphones, the left one has now stopped working completely."
1,My husband ditched his Beats for these!
0,"Worked great for a few months, but now it only holds a charge for 10 mins. so pretty much a worthless product. DO NOT BUY"
0,"You get what you pay, battery only last about 3 hrs"
0,"Lasted 8 months and then died.  Nothing special, cheap construction. Dont buy... this is amazon pushing crap as a sponsored item “best seller”... only because they put it at the top of the search."
0,It doesn't fit well into my ears and it's really uncomfortable if you have glasses. The sound doesn't come out clear.
0,Took out if the box and would not charge. I had to send it back. Not sure if I'm gonna take another chance.
1,"The SENSO Bluetooth headphones are a solid pair of headphones. They have a very nice sound for a lower end headphone. They also come with a good bit of accessories, which is always a nice touch.<br /><br />The only complaints I have is that the bass can be a little weak, which is to be expected of a cheaper pair of headphones, and they aren't the most secure headphones. While they remain on your ear, there is no pressure keeping them in your ear so they can come loose at times."
1,False advertising. The box did not contain the multi port cigarette lighter charger or the 3’ lightening charger cord. Very disappointing. It did come with a vehicle air vent mounting device (which I won’t use) and a credit card sleeve for your phone (which I won’t use). Headphones work as advertised.<br />*******<br />Update- I wrote the company and they took immediate action and mailed me the missing items along with an apology. Great customer service.
1,I like that I can answer phone calls while using and callers say it is a clear connection.  Comfortable in my ears. Listen to my music or my audible books while walking
1,"So far, so good with one exception.  I've been using my regular Bluetooth headphones for a while, and as my review noted, I really like them.  Except for one thing, their volume has gone down so much they were pretty much useless during airline flights where the ambient noise made the music indiscernible.  To save me from crying kids and give me my music, I ordered these Senso headphones.  They look nice and synch'd up easily. They are capable of very loud volume (YES!) and a default heavy base (I had to ramp that down for some music).  I took them for a bike ride and sweated like the pig that I am and the functioned well, the only problem being excessive wind noise.  This may be because I used the standard buds instead of trying a larger set--I'll find out.  The ONLY disturbing feature, and the reason why one star has been docked, is because when I use these earphones, the music player on my Samsung Galaxy S7 will randomly stop playing. No reason, warning or anything given. I have to then unlock the screen, and hit &#34;play&#34; again.  Is this something anyone else is having problems with?"
1,Wow these are excellent headphones! Especially for the price! Bass response is fantastic and the sound quality is exceptional. Phone calls are clear and sound good as well. These fit well and stay seated in your ears.
1,ok
1,Love these headphones! They stay in place during long workouts and last a long time without recharging. Would recommend!
1,They connected to my alexa show no problem very comfortable earbud wonderful  sound quality  every person needs a pair
1,Ear piece too big
1,Bought these as a gift. My grandson loved them.
0,"2/27 Device cuts out after 70 minutes of use..  Then glows red led slightly. doesn't take a charge..  Customer Server covered replacement as it was covered by one year replacement.  Did not live up to what it was described as. :-(<br /><br />Sound Quality was great,  Performance was outstanding,  Wear ability was great.  Loved them.  Microphone for phone call  worked great per callers that called me at the GYM.  They could hear me without problem.<br /><br />So Sad.  Customer support was good too.  When it cut out it cut hard.. No beeps warning just gone.  Then would not turn back on.<br /><br />If replacements work out well will revisit this 2 star rating ."
1,"Love these headphones! I wear them at work, and since I'm a blue-collar guy who works with his hands, with my body in all different positions, it's important to me to have headphones that stay in, are cord-free, and have a clean signal. This product meets and exceeds all my expectations. Thanks for making such a great product."
1,"Great headphones, as advertised. Even my non-techie wife was able to get them to work without my help."
0,"Worked for about a week before they wouldn't charge. As with all no-name import bluetooth devices, I am again baffled as to why I bothered to try."
1,"I really like these headphones, until the left earbud no longer worked.  This is the second pair I’ve gone through. No particular strain has been placed on the cord. Not sure why this issue is happening. May try purchasing the newer model. If that craps out, I’ll probably switch brands."
1,"""GOOD TECHNOLOGY EASY SETUP, EAR-RING THAT GOES AROUND EAR NEEDS TO BE MADE FIRMER, NEVERTHELESS A GOOD PRODUCT THAT CONNECTS FAST TO MY SAMSUNG ONE TOUCH ANSWERING, IT'S GREAT!! THANKS!!"""
1,Paid $200 for my Beats By Dre & I use these instead .... I've bought 2 pairs and love them....<br /><br />Hint: ADJUST THE EQUALIZER FOR BEST SOUND!!!! .... just like everyone has said. This is a must and they are perfect.... and only $35!!!
1,"Sound quality is just ok, and its actually not quite comfortable wearing it while running."
1,"Love these, they can struggle a bit if in an area with massive interference, like outside a major station in Tokyo, but otherwise have loved them.  Worth the money most definitely."
1,Bought them for the wife and she seems pleased with them. They fit comfortably around her ears and a have a good battery life!
1,"Arrived timely. After charging, paired with iPhone with ease. Fits quite comfortably in ears. Easy use of multi function button and on/off buttons. Like the addition of the additional charging cable. Sound quality is very nice. All in all a great set of wireless headphones especially given the price."
1,"Good price, great product."
1,They work great and stay on while running. Excellent Product!
1,"I have used these semi-regularly for about four months. For the first three months, they worked very well for me. Over the last month, however, they have had some issues. The battery life has seemingly plummeted. After I fully charge them, I will go to use them, and within minutes they start beeping in my ear while my music/podcast cuts out. This happens whether I begin to use them immediately after they are fully charged or several hours after they have fully charged (e.g. if I charge them in the evening and don't use them until the morning). I never know if they're going to work for more than three minutes."
1,They stay secure while exercising.
1,Light weight and personal use
1,"Great Wireless Headphones for the price. I received on time, well packaged and came with the case, car charger, usb charger and a collection of different sized ear buds. These headphones actually do stay in your ears and do not fall out, at least for me, at all. Quality of sound is Good, not a complaint because these are not $100 pair + but if your listening to music with a large amount of bass they will distort that bass. And lastly the microphone works well, Im having work level convos on these and all is heard on both ends."
1,Works exactly as advertised and I love the fact that it cam with different sized earbuds.
1,"The sound on these is great,  bass is good too, they actually stay on during activity. Testing battery life. Easy to pair,  accessories and holding case are usefull,  worth the investment, plus there's a 1 year warranty if something happens. I took a chance and bought them despite trial reviews which can sometimes be unreliable, but they are awesome so far. I will post any updates should something go wrong."
1,I wear it in my shower
1,"Just received the earbuds, I was surprised with how much they included with the packaging!<br />Comes with a case for them and everything!<br /><br />The overall build of the earbuds is good for the price, the sound is good if not a bit muddy on the bass. The connection is ok, it kinda drops in and out a bit when moving a lot. But overall a good product for the price."
0,"I've purchased two pairs of these buds via Amazon.  I use these exclusively for running and overall the sound quality has been fine.  The first pair stopped working after 6 months.  I thought it was a fluke so I bought another pair.  They stopped working after ~ 2 months.  Didn't get wet, physically damaged etc.  Just stopped working.  Everything about this product is great except that they're basically disposable.  Your mileage may vary."
1,"may be too loud for android, get the fine volume app from the play store fix."
1,Good.
1,There is a high pitching electronic noise during operation. It's hard to listen to anything with that noise in the background. Also after 2 years of use it disconnected from my phone every 60 seconds. It beeps every time it looses connection.
0,"I was extremely excited to get these headphones but was quickly disappointed when they arrived.  Even when I have what I'm listening to on the lowest volume, it is still extremely loud through the headphones.  I am worried that using them will cause hearing damage and have only used them 2-3 times in 6+ months that I've had them."
1,Like
1,"These are great!  I highly recommend them, especially for the price."
1,I use these to work -out in and they tend to fall off.  Especially if you do a cross fit type work out.
1,These headphones rock!!!! They are just as good as the big name headphones but a way better price. I use them 5-7 days week while I am working out whether running or working out in the gym.
1,"Bought these because I didn't want to spend the money for apple's bluetooth EarPods. They're a little big, but they connect well, have a very decent range and the battery lasts. Normally, I'll recharge overnight or first thing in the morning and they'll go all day without recharging. The sound quality is pretty awesome. I used to love apple's earbuds quality and normally listen to music, podcasts, youtube, audiobooks, sermons, etc. I'm currently using the red foam inserts rather than the black silicone ones. They seem to seal better for my ears and are more comfortable throughout the day.<br />I'll use these with my phone whether I'm working at my computer, building a shed or mowing the lawn. They work great."
0,"Bought these a few months ago, one side literally just stopped working. Sound quality is great enough. I enjoyed it while it lasted."
1,Has great sound and they stay put while working out!
1,"Fit is great for running, sound was a bit muffled, but downloading a free headset equalizer app fixed that."
1,"I'm disappointed that these headphones do not include some type of power charge indicator to help identify the amount of charge left in the battery. The headphones do provide an audio ""low power"" message - but just 10-15 minutes later, the device will shut off automatically. Common sense would dictate providing a ""low power"" warning much sooner.  By providing a ""low power"" message so late, the SENSO makers force the user to stop their activity immediately and find a power source.  This device is very poorly engineered.  CORRECTION:  While no power charge indicator is present on the headphones, a small icon is present on the phone, which should suffice. So I have upgraded my rating."
1,"These headphones are very high quality first of all, very comfortable, stay in your ears, block out most noise. I had an issue with mine and senso shipped me a replacement right away. You can’t go wrong with these headphones!"
0,Nice for awhile but now they don't hold a charge for anything. They start cutting out less than 5 minutes into a walk making them pretty much useless.
1,Super
1,"I've just bought my 2nd pair. I used the first 8-10 hours a day every single day. They finally just wore out. They are perfect for the money. Casual listing in any normal environment they work perfect. I had a pair of $100 before these. The expensive ones were a bit nicer, but not $80 nicer."
0,"The headphones sound great & the earbuds fit, but the earpiece that hooks over the ear is too big & doesn't fit either my ears or my (much bigger) spouse's ears. They were slipping off even when just using them at my desk."
0,"Since I cant find anywhere to contact the seller, I will leave feedback this way.  Look what happened after just 6 or so weeks of use!  I would like them replaced if the seller sees this!"
0,"I bought these for the first time in March 2019. They worked great (great bass) then they stopped working in August 2019. I didn't want to deal with the warranty process. Since they were such a reasonable price, I decided to just buy them again that same month and hope that they would last the second time around. Again, they were working great and I loved them so much that I even bought my mom a pair (which she loves and is still using).<br /><br />Now, it's January 2020 (exactly five months out like the last time) and they've stopped working again. I'm disappointed because I really loved these headphones. I didn't and don't expect them to last more than a year at $20, but I had hoped to actually reach the one year mark with them.<br /><br />I'll try my best to submit a warranty for these, since I'm still technically within a year, but I don't think I can justify buying these a third time. Hopefully my warranty goes through and I'll have at least another five months of wireless listening to save up for something better."
1,"The headphones are clear, but sometimes don't sync, or take a while to sync with phone."
1,These buds sound GREAT and I highly recommend them. The value here is Unsurpassed and you won't believe the quality of this product vs the price you pay. I'm very happy with my purchase.
1,Sounds loud and clear on the headphone but the weak ear wraps make me feel like it will fall out when I run with it
1,"These are an incredible value. I own a lot of different pairs of earphones and headphones, from a variety of different price points.  I have to admit that I was skeptical.  I wanted a relatively inexpensive pair of bluetooth headphones, and decided that at this price I would take a flyer, and if they didn't sound good, at least I didn't waste a ton of money.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  They come in a nice box, with a number of different ear tip options.  The fit and finish feels premium.  The sound is great, and compares to The bass response is definitely emphasized.  In fact, I had to turn the bass down a bit on my EQ. The battery life is good, and charging is fast.  They stay put in my ears very well, and don't move at all when I run.<br />."
1,Fit well and the sound is great!!
1,n/c
1,So far so good! I gave these a shot after all the glowin reviews and the exceptional customer service. The box has all kinds of extra goodies. Even a magnet for the phone to attach to a car vent clip. I’ll be putting these through the ringer as I work in landscaping. I’ll post an update soon to tell how they hold up.
1,Great set of bluetooth headphones for the money! Very easy to use and connect. The sound/music is clear.<br />I love and highly recommend this product to anyone in the market for decent bluetooth headphones
0,After almost 3 months of use I felt I had enough time with the product to write a thorough review. It's OK. Slowly starts to feel like the ear buds are falling apart. There is interrupted blue tooth connectivity. The bass isn't as great as other reviews seemed to suggest.<br /><br />One side has completely stopped working as well.<br /><br />The control side earbud is much heavier than the other side causing there to be unbalanced fit. Can fall out when jogging.<br /><br />I think there are equivalent or better wireless headphones for a lower price.
1,"Thought $35 was too good to be true, but these things work great! No complaints."
0,"Theses are just okay. They are inexpensive and have okay sound quality. My biggest issue is that the Bluetooth cuts in and out. I use Bluetooth speakers at home and have no issues even when I am inside and the speakers are outside, but when my phone is even in my pocket these headphones will cut in and out, which is very annoying and ruins my listening experience.<br /><br />I really wanted to like these at this price point, but they are essentially unusable."
1,"Excelent headphones, you can hear perfect only need half of volumen.<br />Fit perfect to your ear."
0,"Sounded great, stopped working after 2 months.  Will no longer take a charge"
1,"These headphones have never failed me in a couple of years of use.  You won’t get the kind of sound you’d like if you’re listening to music, but to listen to podcasts or any kind of dialogue they work like a charm.  The battery life is also impressive, which is in stark contrast to lots of low battery life headphones on the market."
1,"While these fit great, the right earbud has an annoying rattling noise, as it is the side with the charger and controls.  Maybe I should turn up the sound?"
1,"Thus far, less than 2 months, seems like a very good deal."
0,"Clunky and really not at all what I was hoping for. They've already broken. Only good thing was battery life, but otherwise a total disappointment. Already thrown in the trash can."
1,"Got these for the wife. Other than a shorter battery charge life than I hoped for, she says they are excellent."
0,"Recent update, 6/1/17.  There is NO way to tell when the battery is going to run out.  There is a voice prompt that is so loud I am afraid it will make my heart stop while I am working out.  Scared the hell out of me!  Then EVERY minute for the next ten, the voice YELLS at full volume, the battery is low!  Extremely annoying.<br />Unfortunately I am passed the return time.  I have had the product for 3 months, and would NOT recommend getting this.<br />1) No way to tell how much battery life if left, until it is too late.<br />2) Then, a YELLING voice for the next ten minutes!!<br />3) Terrible volume control, all of which are too loud.<br /><br />OK headphones.  The volume is VERY LOUD on the lowest setting.<br />The ear pieces don't stay in my ears all that great.  I have had better wireless headphones, but not at this price.  I prefer Pantronic BackBeat headphones.  But the Plantronic headphones only lasted 14 months... so take your pick."
1,"I had purchased this as a result of the glowing reviews it received. I wanted a unit to be able to have hands free operation of my iPhone, I do not have much use of earphones.<br /><br />The good is, these are light and comfortable on and in the ear - possible because of the soft covering on the earpiece and the hook which keep the buds in place. The sound reproduction is very good for an earbud when wearing both, it blocks out outside noises not totally eliminate them so one is able to hear when one is called and/or warning sounds.<br /><br />With regards answering the telephone, the reason for my purchase - I am able to hear the caller well, which speaks to the quality of the sound. Many times I am told by the recipient, they are not able to hear me clearly. I therefore have to shout and/or cup my hand over my mouth in order to direct the sound to where I think the microphone is located - very inconvenient, when my coal was hands free. The wire that joins the two buds get tangled if I try to wear it at the back of my neck, so now I wear the wire in front or use only one (RIGHT which has the controls and keep the other in my pocket). Unfortunately the solution I use looks tacky so I only utilize it when I am alone.<br /><br />This is a good solution for hands free listening, I am not sure about being heard when using it to answer the telephone. Very comfortable, not stressful on the ears. I would recommend it for runners or people who want to listen to their own &#34;stuff&#34;."
1,Use while running and they work great.
1,"Great quality, easy to use."
0,"These are a good value and sound great for the price, however they began to constantly drop the Bluetooth, and it tells you &#34; disconnected&#34; and then &#34;connected&#34;. It is getting annoying. It had been to months and I have an iPhone 7+., to clarify - it disconnects when my phone is in my hand or in my pocket and the headphones are on my ears."
1,Great price. Got it for my friend for his birthday. Product arrived in time and rest I don't know. It was gifted :D
1,Excellent quality and packaging. The sound is amazing... The best product ever
1,They are just good
1,"Purchased these at a discount to replace some weird foreign BT earbuds that broke quickly. Wow. I wear them for about 2 hours at the gym daily and they sound great. Great battery life, awesome sound, and easy to use controls. The customer service is top notch as well. I highly recommend them to anyone and would gladly pay $30 for a pair."
1,"I wish the battery life last longer, but I still love them :-)"
1,Like for my cell phone
1,"The price is very good. Sound quality is decent. The only reason for 4 stars is the ear hook is not adjustable. other brands have a wire going through the center of the ear hook that allows you to bend them to fit your ears. But again, other brands cost more."
0,I have bought two pairs signed up for a warranty and can't get them repaired I'm pissed! The frost pair worked well for a couple days. Sec pair has on side working and won't charge I'm done!
1,Battery last 7-8 hours on full charge. These headphones have a good sound with bass. They are comfortable and stay in my ears when running or lifting weights. Only negative is they come with a USB cord for charging but no adapter to plug the cord directly into a wall outlet.
1,I'm a 64 yr old and not always good with technology. These were easy to set up and use. Love them!!
1,Very loud nice balanced sound and super comfortable to wear. Doesn't fall off no matter what workout I'm doing.
1,Really like these. Only complaint is they don't always remain in the ear.
1,Great product . Very satisfied!
1,Second pair because I lost my first pair!
0,"Packaging smells heavily of smoke which has rendered the carry pouch useless to me. I can’t get the smell out and it permeates everything it’s around. Otherwise, the Bass on these things overpowers the mids and forget any highs. I mean i don’t complain about too much bass ever. I’m honestly impressed it was accomplished. But you can tell it’s a poor balance. So, for the price, meh."
1,"Wow! I can't believe the quality for the price. Super impressed. The ear hooks are nice and moldable to your ears, the soft silicone blocks outside noise, and the sound quality is great. I did a lot of research before ordering and then I was down to just a couple and I decided to go with these, I am so glad I did! Haven't had them long enough to test playtime or durability. Hope they last. Update, have had them several months now. Still working perfectly. Charge is nice. Sometimes I don't use them for weeks, go turn them on and wear them for a few hours just fine. Impressed!"
1,"Love these earbuds. Good quality, crystal clear sound and volume. Also nice bass!"
1,This headphone will keep the connection with your phone unless:<br />- You run too fast<br />- You run too slow<br />- You walk<br />- You walk between buildings<br />- A truck passes near you<br />- You put the cell phone in your short left pocket<br />- Also in your right pocket<br />- You breath
1,"I used these at work and when I go grocery shopping because I get social anxiety with crowds of people and it puts me in a bad mood. The noise cancellation is pretty good without being too good, I can still pay attention to what's going on around me if I have to. The volume adjustment and ability to skip to the next to YouTube video right from the earbud is great. For the price the quality is pretty good but then again I don't listen to heavy bass music, I mostly listen to YouTube videos."
1,I like what I got so far. Very easy to pair and has quality sound. Haven't tried car charger yet.
1,"Excellent product, I am not sure if it comes with a mic but I used it to answer calls and it worked very well"
1,I am really happy with these headphones.  The sound is really great. I wear them while I am doing chores around the house.  I have wore them on the bus as I communte to work.  I think the sound is really great.
1,"Truthfully, I only had the ear buds for about 24 hours. The little I tested last night, the sound was loud and the ear cuffs were comfortable.  Exactly what I needed.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I had made the mistake of having them around my neck.  And I jumped out of my car and it had fallen off without me knowing. I spent 2 hours looking for them and eventually found them."
1,These headphones are excellent quality and at a great price. The support is also very helpful .
1,"They are great, work well. The battery life is ok."
1,Stayed secure in my ear during my fast pace workouts where other headphones would always fall out
1,"I've tried several different brands of bluetooth headphones, and these are by far the most comfortable.  The sound quality is exceptional.  I'm very happy with this purchase and would recommend it."
1,"Been very easy to setup, easy to understand directions.  Have them paired with my Note 4 and works fine."
0,Bought for my fiance. He like them.<br /><br />**UPDATE**These were fine but now they have stopped working 3 months after purchase. I cannot exchange them because of time has expired. I would have to purchase again so I'm changing my stars from a 4 to a 1. This is because they stopped working under 1 year. I will try another brand next purchase.
1,They are great nice and clear
1,"I am up before others in the morning, so I bought these to use with my laptop. So many of the news items are on video and now I don't have to worry about waking others in the household up. Very easy to pair!"
1,The base is a bit muffled and the high and mids seem drowned out because of the bass. It is good for something to listen to at the gym but its not a clear sound.
1,Battery last a lot
1,"Really great for the price. The 1 issue I had was changing the sizes, I personally had a lot of trouble with that. All around though I would recommend"
1,"I'm a runner and these are the first headphones I have ever used that not only work but they stay in my ear.  They are light weight, easy to operate and the battery life is excellent. Most bluetooth headphones that I have used in the past would never last even an hour.  I've done two runs over 10 miles and between 1:30-2:00hrs and still had lots of battery life left. Best of all sweat did not affect them and they never moved in my ears, even when wet.  Only downside I can say about these is the sound quality, mainly bass is lacking. If your looking for exceptional sound quality you will need to buy something more expensive. But for running, I don't crank them up as I want to be able to hear cars around me so these work great for me.  You can't beat these for the price. I lucked out and got mine when they were on sale. They come with a car charger and usb cable for charging with any usb connection.  Nice little carrying case too."
1,"Great product, sounds great and comfortable. Had an issue with them not pairing up after 6 months, called the company and they sent me out a replacement two days later. No regrets."
1,"The best I've tried: 1. Way louder than necessary volume. 2. short recharge time. 3.quick pairing. 4. Very comfortable.The overear hooks really help. 5. Long playing. 6. No unnecessary weightier object on in-between wire whose swinging could cause earbud to dislodge from ear; they stay in place. 7. Very little build up of lag time between video and audio streaming.8. Awesome audio frequency response on high and low end. I can't find anything wrong with them, maybe wish volume could be muted more, the source can be muted also, anyway, and I like the extra power if necessary.9. Excellent go-the-extra-mile accessories, including a case which actually is small and protective. 10. Range from source is good or better than others. 11. And did I say they look cool?"
1,"Love these headphones, the size, the carrying case but most of all the sound. I ran into a problem pairing up with my iphone, customer service and the president (!) responded immediately - problem solved. Great price for a superior product."
1,So far I just got the headphones and am amazed at the high quality of the sound easy to pair with Bluetooth. It also came with car adapter great it's hard to get headphones that stays in my ear while running these so far seems to be perfect. Love it so far.
0,"Great and low cost alternative.<br />Great bass but im missing a little more of highs<br />*********MAY 2017 REVIEW UPDATE<br />they wont turn on again. tried to find a solution online but still looking for it. they last the same as my last BEATS BT headphones but for only $37 bucks. im really disappointed about this kind of headphones.<br />on my accpunt 2 BEATS BT and 1 SENSO BT mal functioning. believe me!!! it not me!... I only use them, sweat them and then charged them, thats all."
1,i like it
0,Fake .... not worth it ..
1,"i am wearing glasses, so sometimes i feel uncomfortable wearing both of them. and it is too easy to take off so sometimes wear off unintentionally."
1,So. Far so good. Easy to connect to multiple devices. This is my first try at blue toothy ear buds and s far I’m very happy. My husband will get some next. He has Beats already but would like an affordable option.
1,So far so good. Fit nicely. Pretty good sound. Definitely a great buy for the price.
1,""" I love this earbuds."""
1,I love them!
1,I use these in the gym and they don't fall off - even when jumping rope.  They come with different size ear buds which is very helpful.  I have small ears so they are comfortable and feel secure with the small ear buds.  The sound is excellent.  The bluetooth signal is strong enough that I can leave my phone in the gym and walk into the bathroom and still hear my music.  Good buy!
0,Gave them 2 stars because the quality was good and they held up well during the 13 months they worked.  I didn't get to use them a ton though and here we are 13 months (1 month after the warranty expiration...) later and they won't turn on.
0,"I'm a distance runner so I rely on music to keep me occupied.  The first thing I noticed was the sound was not so clear. It was slightly muffled.  The first time I used it I was out for 2 hours and the battery was fine. The second use after charging they died after 10 mins of being turned on. The 3rd try, I noticed the battery wouldn't fully charge (only reached 70% after plugged in overnight) and they died again after only 10 mins.<br /><br />I contacted the company and they told me to reset the earbuds, so I did but to no avail, I contacted the company a second time and no response, so I returned the defective item."
1,Iv'e been using this for more than 5 months now. I only had 1 problem in the beginning where the music was cutting in and out. I did some research in the reviews and found out that a reset will fix it and it did. I have not experience the same problem so far. I tested it at a good distance of about 100 feet and works well.
1,great product
1,"I've had the headphones for a little over a week and they are great! They fit very well and the sound quality is perfect. Connecting to different devices is easy and fast, and the battery life is very long. After a week, they started this weird thing where the right ear is quieter than the left ear. I contacted customer service and they had me try a factory reset. Unfortunately, that didn't work, but they sent a replacement for the faulty headphones immediately. I was impressed with how responsive and fast Senso's Customer Service was!"
1,"Wonderful, works perfectly, great bass"
0,"I try to use these connected to my phone, and it looses connectivity at the distance of being in my pocket. I played around, and to maintain connection I have to hold my phone in my right hand. Even holding it in my left hand I lose connection. Mostly useless unless I can have my phone out in front of me while riding a stationary bike."
1,The battery life is 7 hours at best usually 6 1/2.
1,Using them at the gym. Other pair I used would fall out from sweat and no wrap around ear.
1,"I am very satisfied with my Senso headphones. The sound quality is great, battery life is sufficient, and the comfort/fit is perfect. I recently had an issue where they stopped charging for some reason. I contacted customer service through Amazon and within two hours they sent me an email with steps that resolved the issue completely. I'm very impressed with their customer service and how they stand behind their product. My ONLY wish is that the ear loops had an ability to be shaped a bit to be more snug to my ears--but that's a very minor issue and doesn't affect the five star rating.<br /><br />7/5/17 Update<br /><br />I had an issue with connectivity about 30 minutes into a run yesterday. Once again, I contacted customer service and they responded within two hours. I was very very impressed. They walked me through how to do a factory reset. It was quick, easy, and resolved my issue thoroughly. I really love the quality of sound, ease of use, and customer service I've experienced with Invotek and their Senso headphones!"
1,You get a lot for your money.  It arrived very nicely boxed.  Senso provided a lot of accessories needed for an overall great experience.  Head phone quality is up there and synced nicely with my Android phone.  Highly recommend if you're looking for a quality alternative to much higher priced head phones.
1,"I was looking for a cheap pair of wireless headphones to use especially for commuting and exercising. I went with these based on the reviews and I am very glad I did. In terms of quality, these are undoubtedly some of the best headphones I've ever owned, regardless of any price range. The sound is perfectly crisp. I listen to various music types, from classical to modern day hip hop and old school rock. All of these sound exactly like they should.<br />I have used these while running, sprinting, jumping and catching (I play Ultimate Frisbee). I wanted a pair of headphones that allowed me to listen to pump up music during warm-ups, and these are absolutely perfect. They have never fallen out, sometimes they slide off a little bit due to sweat, but overall I very rarely need to adjust them once they're in, unless it's a 90 degree summer day with high humidity.<br />The battery life is very good, I always charge them fully before going to sleep at night and they last me all day next day. I use them about 3 hours a day, and have yet to even get the low battery warning, let alone have them die on me.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend these to anyone, whether you need these for work, sports or anything in between. Hands down one of the best investments i've ever made"
0,"These are decent headphones for the price. I've had many pairs of Bluetooth headphones, they all have had different issues and these have issues too. For example, Motorola headphones some parts which were glued gradually came off. Panasonic after a few uses would not turn on for a few days. Overall, motorola has been my best experience but they stopped making them. These, I didn't really get a chance to try working out because I am too scared they will damage my ear. The sound is WAY WAY WAY too loud. If I forgot to turn volume down to like the first few bars it would actually hurt my ears. I wouldn't be surprised if the half second it happened cause permanent damage. I worry that notifications which might be at full volume would play even though music volume is down. For now I'll use my Panasonic and wired headphones when they need to dry out or whatever makes them work a few days later. I will not be using these but I like the case it came with which fits my Panasonic headphones just fine."
1,"Love these phones - GREAT volume, easy connect, well made.  These are my favorites"
0,"Since 2017, I have purchased nine of these Senso headphones. (Yes, I can back that up with my purchase history.)  I purchased so many because they've been durable and at a really great price so I recommended them to family members.  Something has changed in the manufacturing and these went from treasure to trash.  As soon as I opened my most recent order, I noticed that these headphones were ""lighter"" and not as solid as the ones I've gotten earlier.  I use the headphones often for running.  These headphones seem to ""skip"" the music every 20 seconds or so.  Really annoying. Based on moderate testing, it's because I'm swinging my arms when I run.  If I stay still or bring my iwatch closer to my head, it helps.  It's a real shame and I'm going to have to look for something else from now on."
1,"I love these headsets. I use them in the car (when I remember to grab them from the counter in the house), when I mow the yard, and sometimes when I ride my bicycle. I have purchased several different Bluetooth headsets over the years and I always stopped using them eventually. These are definitely my favorite yet. Sound is good. There is enough bass for me to be happy. I still need to use someone else's phone to call mine with a friend using these headsets to know the quality of using these for phone calls. They sound great from my end, though."
1,"Great product! Exactly what the dialog states what the product can do and how good the quality of the product is. I woild know because I am an fan of sound and comfort xoiple with durability and these headphones have it all, great product, thank you for putting something of this quality and price out there!"
1,"Lost my Powerbeats so wanted to try something cheaper.  Good quality sound, not quite as much bass as the other ones but they are definitely more comfortable.  They do take a little maneuvering to get them on correctly.  Overall satisfied with them and would recommend."
1,"I’ve had a problem with these earbuds. 2 times they died after 2 month or less, however the company is absolutely amazing! They replaced them very quickly & Were very kind. I have hope that 3rd times the charm!"
1,"I am very happy with these headphones, the sound is great and works well with my iPhone and in my car."
1,Sound good and great battery life but the pieces that go over your ear are floppy and don’t work well
1,"The ear bud is great, it fits well in my ear, and excellent sound."
1,"These are as durable as they come! My pair has seen heck; theyve been stepped on and thrown theyve been through rain left outside in the sun, they continue to sound amazing! They fit perfectly and it comes with different size ear buds to fit your needs. Theyre quite possibly the most comfortable pair of headphones I've ever owned, sound quality is there too. It rivals that of 100$ headphones, noise canceling is very effective as well. I highly recommend these babys you wont regret buying em."
1,"It took me a second to figure out how to turn them on, but ever since I did they have been amazing."
1,I am really enjoying these headphones. The sound quality is great. Nice and clear even on low volume. They fit comfortably. They have a good distance to them. So I can leave my phone on the kitchen counter and walk just about anywhere in my house and not lose the connection. Battery life is good so no problems there. Overall I think they are a really good headphones and would recommend them to family and friends.
1,"I have small ears and these are able to wrap around them snug. I haven't had them fall out a single time. The Bluetooth seems to not be as strong as advertised, but it works for my use."
0,"Hated everything about these headphones. The actual bud is rigidly fixed to a very clunky piece that looks funny on each side of your head. The angle of the ear bud didn't fit my ear, and became very uncomfortable after about 30 minutes of use. I tried my son's Beats sport headphones, and they fit extremely well, so the issue I had is with these specific headphones. I tried a variety of different rubber pieces to see if that would help, but there is really no solution for the pressure point issue on the inside of the ear. The clunky rigid case is then connected to a very soft rubber ear wrap. These headphones won't fall off of your head, but there is zero chance that the ear buds will stay in place. I was constantly pushing them back into position. The battery life was every bit of 8 hours, but the battery warning comes at the very end of life. I was five minutes into a 20 minute walk, when I got the first warning. Then the warning interrupted the book I was listening to every couple of minutes for the next 10 minutes, and then the head phones died. Even my older style Fitbit gives me a rough battery level. You would think that ear buds could give you an indication of battery level when you make the Bluetooth connection. And is there some reason why I need to be reminded every two minutes? The head phone performance was poor. I connected them to a brand new Samsung S8+, and with the phone in my pocket the sound would cut out every couple of minutes. Even the internal voice that says 'Power On' played poorly and had an amazing amount of hiss. I've used sport phones with the controls on the cord (basically just below chin level) and on the ear piece like these headphones. Personally, I prefer the controls on the cord, but that is a personal preference.  I'll be returning these headphones."
1,"The sound is almost perfect. Very comfortable wearing, comes with all the necessary accessories. For me it's a very good first impression."
0,"UPDATE: Invotek contacted me rather quickly and sent another Headphone to replace the pair I received. Not sure what the problem was but these work perfectly fine and I am looking forward to using these while working out. Thank you for your great customer Service Invotek!<br /><br /> Very disappointed. After charging as recommended per instruction foldout and troubleshooting they will not turn on, pair with my iPod NOTHING. Returning these for a refund..."
1,"Outstanding product, regardless of the price (which was outstanding too!)<br />I researched other Bluetooth earbuds. The SENSOs had top tier technology and features. Sound amazing. Definitely recommend."
1,So far so good. Lightweight. Waterproof. Good quality sound.
0,"I bought a previously listed version of this same product on May 5, 2017. I threw them away yesterday. First, the left earbud started malfunctioning, and then the entire headset failed altogether. Less than a year of use out of a product is unacceptable."
1,Ive purchased a few pair of these ear buds. Not because they failed but because i was careless and lost or dropped them. They are very comfortable to wear and have great volume and clear sound. Only set I ever buy
0,"Ear loops were loose on my ears (I'm a big guy with big ears) and the right speaker started cutting out within 2 weeks.<br />You really only get what you pay for with these, pay a bit more to get something that might actually last a while!"
1,"Great sound, battery life & price."
1,"I needed some headphones for gym workouts that wouldn't fall out of my ears and have me tethered to my phone.  So I tried these out and was very impressed.  The sound quality is really good but best of all, the user interface is well designed so it works without much effort in setup or learning.  Also the battery life is pretty amazing.  But I did have a problem - one of the earpieces became disconnected and so one side stopped working.  I sent an email to the vendor, Invotek, on a Sunday not expecting a reply until Monday.  But there was a reply very quickly.  Explaining that there is a one year warranty, they asked me to take a photo of the problem and then sent me a complete product replacement in a few days.  They handled the problem very well."
1,Sound is great and came with some nice accessories. It has a long battery life and one charge can sustain my whole week at the gym. My only complaint is that the earpiece is a bit loose and can be annoying to put on sometimes.
0,"I bought them 4 months ago and loved them, they fit well in my ears and the charge lasted 2-3 workouts for me. 4 months later they stopped working completely..won't charge, won't turn on, nothing. But then again what could expect from for the price, my own fault."
1,This was excellent piece for a reasonable price... I’m enjoying every moment
1,Works great with my Amazon Dot. Sound is very good.
1,"great sound, easy to use"
1,"The sound is good. They are comfortable. I find that the switch control box tends to drift and hang to the right side a lot and doesn't stay in the center.  one of the main problem is, I am only getting about 2 hours out of a charge then the music starts to sound like a record skipping (for those who where around and remember that) this was one of my first blue tooth experiences so maybe that 2 hrs. is normal?"
1,Great for working out.
1,"I bought these wireless headphones on September 27, 2018 for my iPad Pro, whose headphone jack had stopped functioning properly. When they came the packaging was nice, intact, and everything in it was undamaged. The instructions manual is very clear and pairing the headphones to my device was a breeze. They worked plenty better than the 20 dollar non-wireless headphones I had before.<br />They lasted until February 2019, when the headphones didn’t turn on after being reset and fully charged. Costumer service was very quick to respond. I received a free new replacement since there is a year warranty.<br />What you need to know:<br />-The quality of the wireless headphones and bonuses are great- much better than what you’d expect for the price.<br />-The connection didn’t cut for me unless the headphones ran out of battery or I completely covered the sides of my iPad. I can stand a good 20 feet from my device without any disconnecting or decrease in sound quality.<br />-I used these while running on my treadmill at my house without problem. They didn’t fall out and connection didn’t cut.<br />-They do a good job cancelling out unwanted ambient noise, although that ultimately varies depending on how noisy your surroundings are.<br />-I can put these on after just minutes of getting out of the rain/shower and the water seems to have no effect on them.<br />-Very good battery life and recharges quickly.<br />-Great price.<br />-Great warranty.<br />-Great customer service. Best I’ve seen so far.<br />I highly suggest you buy these. Very good product."
1,Great!  Everything as promised.  Good sound.  Helpful directions for someone (like me) just venturing into the world of bluetooth.
1,Would Buy Again!
1,I really love the headphones. I use them at the gym and at work. The sound is great and they are ver comfortable.
0,"Sounds are good.  Plenty of volume.  Several &quot;inserts&quot; to fit your ear.  The &quot;hoops&quot; are SO floppy that they don't stay in place very well when running.  Very annoying to continually be tweaking them to get them to stay in place.  If you're stationary, they're fine.  But if you expect to run in them, I'd look elsewhere.  Glad I only paid $35 for them.  I'm probably going to try and return them."
1,The sound quality is great. I love that the ear piece goes in your ear and around you ear. Perfect for any activity. Amazing product for the price!
0,"I paid full price for these headphones. These are good quality and the customer service is excellent. The phones came in a great package, with nice extras (3 sets of ear tips, a nice case to keep them in, a very short USB charger cable, a dual port car charger and a 3' lightning charger that sadly, does not work on the headphones.) All for $37. Why did I only rate them 3 stars? Because I was looking for waterproof headphones that I could swim with. Sadly, these did not fit the bill. I feel like there was a little bit of misleading advertising; the explanation I received from the vendor was,&#34; ...these have been tested by being submerged for a short period of time. Although they have a IPX7 waterproof rating, we do not recommend you submerge them.&#34; Sweatproof? Sure. Good in rain? Probably. Work in the pool? Nope. Sadly, they have to go back.When Invotek make a truly waterproof set of headphones, I'll be the first in line.<br /><br />Edited 5-26-17: I changed to 1 star because of Senso's condescending and patronizing response. I do not feel that I should have to learn international waterproof designations when deciding on a pair of headphones. They either are usable in water (i.e., waterproof) or they aren't. Senso's advertising is misleading, as they don't tell you anywhere in their advertisement (and believe me, I looked) that IPX7 means you can't submerge them."
0,Thanks to the honest Amazon reviewers who alerted prospective purchasers to the existence of fake reviews and prevalence of bot-generated comments for these earphones.  Your vigilance has saved us time and money!!<br />Thank you!!!
0,"Unfortunately, like all other headphones these do not fit my ears. I'm always readjusting or holding onto to them. I really wish they would have worked because the sound is nice and like the packagking. One other thing that I didn't get was the charging cord - it wasn't hard to use, but there is one attachment that actually makes no sense because it doesn't fit at all."
1,"These headphones are definitely worth the price. They work well and have plenty good enough battery life. After a while, I notice that some of the points where they put pressure on my ears do start to hurt a bit but that could be just the shape of my inner ear and not a result of the design. Audio quality is good enough for podcast listening and passable for music listening. The ingress protection rating of X7 means they should be water proof up to 1 meter, so be aware of that. Overall, decent product."
1,"Got what I paid for, which was much more than I was expecting! Great job and awesome price"
1,These little things are legit! Great sound quality and durable!
1,The headset has great sound and really fits nice around your ears.  I am glad I purchased these.
1,"So far these work great!  I bought 2 pair, one for me and one for my wife.  Multiple sized ear buds come with it which worked great since my wife needed smaller ones.  Set-up was easy and charge time very short.  If you like bass and don't like to hear anything but your music these are a great value."
0,"Pros:<br />Very easy to setup.<br />Volume buttons on the right ear also work for skipping tracks, which was very convenient.<br />Micro USB port on the right ear allowed me to charge the earbuds with my phone charger.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The big bulge that bridges the hook and the bud was very uncomfortable as it pressed against my ear. I couldn't stand to wear them more than 30 minutes at a time.<br />The sound quality was acceptable..<br />Wind very easily drowns out the sound, so I would strongly recommend not wearing them on a bike ride.<br />Full charge lasted ~4 hours."
0,"I rarely give something a 1 rating.  Basically they simply do not work.  These connect, I see then in the Bluetooth settings as active.  But no sound.  I've tried multiple apps.  I just threw then away."
0,Either they're defective or just built poorly. Left side has absolutely no bass. It's very obvious when trying to listen to music. I can't even use these things. I'll have to throw them out.
1,"The sound is perfect and it comes with a lot of buds. Since I have rather small ears, for me the ear hooks are too big. Every few movements it falls out of mainly my left ear. The right one is slightly better though. For me running with them is no option. That's a pity."
1,"Great purchase! Came in a timely manner and the packaging was second to none. It included a small charging cable, a two in one lighting and mini USB charger, extra ear tips, wire tie, dual USB car charger and carrying case. The contents included in the purchase is worth every penny and more. The sound quality is great. The battery lasted as advertised. It has become my go to earphones! Irecommend this product to anyone."
0,It's not even 15 days I can't connect these headphones to any of my devices !!! So disappointed 😡😡
0,"2nd time in a year these things have broken in my hand.  This time, the multi-function button broke and it's now inoperable.  I'm going to need to find a new brand to purchase, this has been a waste."
1,1st I'll say I am a 70 year old lady that has little knowledge of electronics.  This took me about 30 minutes to figure out charge and listen to....love it.

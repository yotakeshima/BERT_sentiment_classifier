1,"great product, great sound, stays in your hear even when active."
1,"Wow, very impressed with these. I've had the wireless Beats and these are very close to sound and quality. The battery life is a solid 8 hours. They warm you when the battery has about 5 minutes remaining. And a bonus you get a short charging cable and a lightning / micro USB cable."
1,Fast shipping. Great product for the price. Easy controls and comfortable even when wearing glasses with the head phones.
0,"Only works for 4 months. It won't charge any more. Before it completed dead, it starts self-calling the last numbers and warning about low battery."
1,I love these headphones. I would recommend them for anyone not just the sports type. They are so comfortable. Thanks Invotek!
1,"WHYYY did they change to flexible earhooks? I had the last SENSO model that had the stable earhook - some of you may remember, the ones that came w/ the car charger and the dual USB to charge either iPhones or android devices (aka THE BEST ONES). The earhooks were so much more stable and better for the fit I was looking for. After over a year of use almost daily, my old ones finally gave out so I purchased the newer model, which has flexible earhooks that I HATED bc they wouldn't stay on my ears and I kept having to readjust them while wearing. I returned and bought what I thought was the previous set (the S-250, vs S-255). NOPE they ""upgraded"" the earhooks on the previous model too, with the flexible earhooks :(  IDK WHAT TO DO NOW AND I'M SUPER SAD bc they were the best wireless headphones for the price."
0,TERRIBLE quality blue tooth buds.  DO NOT purchase.  Even if there is just the tiniest semblance of a breeze it sounds like a hurricane in your ears.  Volume and sound quality are extremely poor!!
1,Awesome! Great sound blocking!
0,They worked perfectly for a day but today I tried to connect to them and it won't connect at all
1,"Sounds decent for a cheap pair, however you get what you pay for, the sound quality is no where near the $100+ powerbeats, jaybirds, etc.."
1,"Great sound, I only wish the cords were longer."
0,"This product is defective right out of the box. I received my headphones today and I have tried everything I can to turn them on but they simply don't work. When I press and hold the multifunction button, nothing happens. I plugged them in thinking they needed to be charged out of the box but the solid blue light comes up indicating a full charge. Will be returning."
1,Clear sound for the right price!
1,This is my second pair.  Was thrilled that they were still available to purchase.  I did a lot of research for my first pair and was quite happy with these.
0,"Bought them to use while biking. They shake off while riding over rough terrain. While riding over smooth pavement: sound is OK, controls are OK, comfort level OK. The right headset cover (the one that holds an on-off switch etc) fell off after approximately 15 rides. So these phones ended costing me 36.97/15=2.50 a ride."
1,Awesome very pleased
1,"What a lovely product. Easy to use, good quality and nice design."
1,The Headphones are great and the support team is the BEST!
1,"These are great fitting headphones. The only thing I don't like about them is that the button for start/stop/pairing is in the center. This means that when you want to start or stop music (or pair to bluetooth), you push the button and the headphones get shoved further into your ear. Slightly uncomfortable, but otherwise, they fit just as good as other headphones that are much more expensive. Definitely happy I went with Senso."
1,It s a very well done product. For the price I truly recommend this.
1,Sturdy ear plugs but hurt my ears a little. Sound quality was choppy when I first connected but I adjusted my equalizer on cp. Great buy!
1,I love how they fit. Comfort.  Sound to me is great. Sometimes I feel that I am talking loudly for the phone . So I can be heard.
1,"High quality product and easy to set up on Bluetooth sync. Bass is very good for earbuds and mid-tones and highs crisp. Haven't used them long enough to comment on the battery life, but if it lives up to all the other features I've reviewed above, it should be highly satisfactory."
1,They work really well & came with great accessories. I think they are a little large but that's just a personal observation. Shipped really quickly.
1,"Love these for inexpensive wireless headphones. The sound is surprisingly clear for the price. They are not completely noise-canceling, but do the job well enough people can sneak up on me!"
1,very good value
1,This is my second  one
1,"This is my first pair of Bluetooth earbuds so don't have anything to compare to. I think they're quite good. Sometimes the sound cuts in and out, not sure why. I find the ear loops a bit annoying to get on. The case is way to small and not even worth trying to store these things in it.<br />I appreciate quality sound. I have always invested in great stereo and speaker components and would like to find a pair of earbuds that deliver the same. Not sure if these are it or not. May try another brand to compare, perhaps Bose. Any suggestions?"
1,"These things are so good, my wife let me buy 2 for the inevitable day that I destroy one of them. First, let me say that I'm no normal blue tooth earbud consumer. To be honest, I have more blue tooth headphones than my wife has purses (not quite shoes). The biggest problem I have with earbuds is the inability to stay in ones ear when doing activities. Usually, even if there is an over the ear cord of some kind holding the earbuds up, they still come out of my ear hole. Lets just say, with the SENSO Bluetooth Headhones, I haven't had one time where I've had to push the earphones back in my ear.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Fantastic for audiobooks and any music heavy on bass. At no point have I heard any distortion from overpowering the speakers.<br />2. The audio is definitely not that flat treble tone you hear with most bluetooth earbuds.<br />3. The over the ear rubber parts are comfortable while not being so tight that you can only wear for a few hours a day.<br />4. Battery lasts for about 8 hours of semi-continuous use. It would probably last longer if I turned the volume down on the device from time to time.<br />5. Pairs quickly to my Samsung Galaxy 8 and Windows 10 USB Bluetooth 4.0 dongle<br />([[ASIN:B00VWEK4IG [2 Year Warranty] Avantree USB Bluetooth 4.0 Adapter for PC, Wireless Dongle, for Stereo Music, VOIP, Keyboard, Mouse, Support All Windows 10 8.1 8 7 XP vista]])<br />6. Recharges in 1-2 hours on standard cellphone chargers or the included car charger<br />7. Price at time of my purchase was 70% less than retail which made it so much better.<br />8. Wife saw how much I liked them and bought me a backup pair.<br />9. I can swim with dolphins while listening to tunes. Need I say more?<br /><br />Con:<br />1. Microphone doesn't pick up voices well. It probably works better if you have a higher pitched voice.<br />2. Color options would have been nice."
1,Worth every cent ! The shipping sucked though ...
1,Great item...good sound for the price you can't beat it...fast shipping no issues
1,"Good sound, great carrying case, EASY to pair with my IPhone!"
1,"Worth every single penny! They really do block out all outside noises, stay in place, and easy to use."
1,Love them and they are very long lasting
0,"Not very good product. Battery dies fast, fits badly on the ear."
1,These have become my all-time favorite headphones for working out. Just put them on and forget they're even there! they don't fall out and they're very comfortable. Great quality of sound too!
1,"Great sound quality (at least to my old, failing ears) and quite comfortable and easy to use."
1,"First let me say I got these to use in the pool.  Swimming laps and doing Aquacise classes. These headphones have the highest rating for water proof ability. I'm still working at getting these to fit comfortably. They are bigger than I normally have and don't stay in my ear very well. However, they do work as long as your head is above water and you are in range of the Bluetooth device. Instructions don't go into great detail but you get the basics. One side has all the controls and I have a hard time with them. Anyone with large hands and fingers would find it very difficult as the buttons are close and it is easy to hit two at the same time. While I am not thrilled with the design of these headphones especially for use in a pool, they do work."
0,Do NOT buy!!! The headphones worked 3-4 times and then stopped charging/working. When they did work they would disconnect from the blue tooth when my iPhone was only 2-3 feet from the headphones in my pocket.
0,"The headphones were great, i only used it for when i went to the gym and honestly it was a great little product. But then after a few months it wouldn't charge at full capacity only up to 20% and even then it would die within 5 -10 minutes.<br /><br />The headphones are basically non-functioning now but i will give it 2 stars since they worked well when it did and maybe i just received a defective one."
1,"This is nice and comfortable, but has echo when talking on it.  To minimize echo (on other person's side), I pull out one side of ear piece."
1,People cannot hear me well
1,"Great quality compared to ones I've had in the past, nice bass and a solid carrying case thats not too big, but still protective. I like these ear phones a lot and have already recommended them to friends."
1,"Good sound quality and nice packaging,but  they are a bit big so they catch the wind when running making theme uncomfortable at times, it's like the wind is echoing"
1,I love this product works great
1,"If you are on a budget, but still want some high quality workout headphones, then look no further! These are the perfect find for people who want a long lasting pair of headphones, that are sweat proof, and are incredibly comfortable to wear for long periods of time! I would definitely recommend these to everyone I know!"
1,"This is my second pair. The first pair gave me two great years of service, but I suspect the battery finally gave up.mthe second pair are pretty much the same, but they did include a magnet to mount my phone in the car. I’m not sure I’ll use it, but I may.mthey are comfortable, reliable, and easily “learned.”"
1,"Don't have to worry about pulling the copper loose, like you do with retractable headsets."
1,"I typically do not like over the ear headphones, but was trying to look for some I could wear to work out.  They are very lightweight and I could barely feel then on me.  They didn't pinch or squeeze my ears at all!  My partner will buy a pair shortly since I've been talking them up quite a bit.  Oh- and sound quality is really good!!"
1,Buttons are easy to use. Holds a charge well.
0,"I ended up returning them. Very broken sound, and unable to make a reliable handshake with an apple watch. Otherwise, the were comfortable. They just didn't do what they were supposed to for me."
1,"So far so good, though they aren't noise cancelling. I have seen other reviews stating that they have quit working after awhile. I have bought 2 other Bluetooth headphones that have cut out with every other step when walking. If these crap out on me I will have finally learned my lesson about buying cheaper Bluetooth headphones."
1,"Got these for my wife who is hard on wired sports earphones. So far, she loves them!  Great sound! Fit Well!<br />Give them a week and if still happy I may even buy a pair!"
1,Just as good as any popular name brand headphones. Would recommend if you're looking for wireless earbuds!
1,i cant recommend these enough. they have survived two obstacle mud races and lots of use. if i could i would give it 6 stars
0,They just didn't fit with my ear shape and are not adjustable other than the interchangable earbud sizes.  I can't comment on sound or quality.
1,Bought this as a gift. Will update once they tell me about the product.
1,Good sound and feels comfortable.
0,"Update -----<br />I gave this another try purely because I was desperate for a Bluetooth headphone in a bind. After another week trying them out, I can say they're pure crap. They've ruined so many runs because they DONT STAY IN so I have to keep slowly down to either readjust or put back in my ear. The strap that goes around your ear honestly makes it even harder for them to stay in your ear because they're so big so that just flop and help the ear bud fall out.<br /><br />I've try to contact the seller multiple times with no response.<br /><br />Original review------<br />I'm upset to say I'm not satisfied with this product. After excitedly awaiting it's arrival, the headphones just aren't what I expected. The sound is good and the connection is excellent, but once I start any sort of physical activity, the headphones slip right out. I tried all of the ear bud sizes and nothing fits right. I think this may have to do with how loose the hook for behind the ear is. Overall I'm upset to give a bad review, I thought I had finally found a perfect pair of headphones to run in."
1,I got an email after the delivery from the owner of Senso.  Asking if I&#34;m happy with them. and a 1 year warranty.  So far I totally reccomend this company!!! J
1,"Compact,comfortable and great sound !!"
1,"Great price, good sound. This is my second pair since my son took the first pair from me (which still work great by the way and I’ve had them since 2017)!  Tried a pair of Tozo wireless and they did not work, only one earbud would charge, so returned those and went with what I knew with work!  This Senso set!"
1,"The earphone came with a lot of accessories; silicone ear tips for all size and a comfortable foam tip. Good sound quality for its price range. Good and fast connection with my iPhone and battery lasted pretty long.  Only thing I didn’t like is the plastic behind the ear tips are a bit hard and could be uncomfortable.  Overall, great product for its price and would recommend it to anyone that need an affordable earphone."
1,"These are great workout headphones.<br /><br />I was looking for some wireless earbuds that would actually stay in my ears while at the gym. These Senso earbuds do just that - it's just a matter of experimenting with the bud size (they supply options) - and getting the angle right.<br /><br />The wireless aspect of this device was one of the main factors for my purchase. Bluetooth connectivity is easy - I connected up to my iPhone straight away.<br /><br />Audio quality is surprisingly good. They're as good as, if not better than, poser brands that cost a great deal more.<br /><br />In addition, the accessories are worth the price tag alone. Lightening cable, dual car charger, charger and power cable are included in a stylish protective zip case.<br /><br />Definitely worth buying - highly recommended."
0,"Good sound for low cost wireless earplugs. The black ear loops are pretty large, so if you have small ears they will fit awkwardly. Going to return."
1,"Very good quality headphones!<br /><br />The sound is crystal clear and loud. The connectivity is pretty smooth too. No complaints, 5 stars easily. Highly recommended."
1,The best I have ever gotten work far better than I anticipated. Bye far the best Product for the money
1,I love it
1,"I've tried a few pairs of wireless headphones in the &#60;$100 price range and I feel like this is the best you're going to do if you're not willing to shell out $100+<br /><br />Here's what I wish I would have known before buying:<br /><br />When initially pairing with my Android phone, the sound quality was poor. Everything was way too bassy and sounded very noisy. After downloading a free equalizer app from the Play Store, I was able to tweak the sound to the point where it is actually pretty good.<br /><br />I also had an issue where the headphones would cut out every 30 seconds really badly. I ended up figuring out that it was trying to pair to both my PC (previously paired) as well as my phone. After killing Bluetooth on my PC, no more cut-outs.<br /><br />Here are my ratings based on the vaue for the $30 price point for wireless headphones<br />Sound Quality Before Equalizer: 2/5 stars<br />Sound Quality After Equalizer: 5/5 stars<br />Build Quality: 4/5 Stars<br />Ease of Use: 3/5 Stars (due to the pairing issue with 2 host devices present)"
0,Has a lot of wind noise and constantly skips when trail running. Skips sometimes if there is any head movement.
1,"Very easy to use, connected to my phone with no problems."
1,"Product has worked fantastic.  I have listed to other headphones of similar style that might cost much more, and notice little to know difference in sound quality.  The headphones came with a nice case, travel pouch, charging cable, car adapter charger and additional iphone cable.  Simple to use and battery life thus far has been great.  Happy with this purchase!"
1,"First pair of bluetooth headphones, love them!"
1,very comfortable earbuds!
1,"I am impressed with the fact the fit and feel is just like my powerbeats headphones i wear while running. What i don't like, at all, is the amount of wind noise that these generate. While running the wind noise generated makes me have to turn the volume up 2 notches from what is needed on my other headphones."
0,"The sound on these headphones is OK.  Not great, and not as good as my previous pair of LG's which were only slightly more expensive.<br /><br />I'm returning them because I they too often fail to connect to my phone.  I need to turn them off, back on, and after that, sometimes go to Bluetooth settings, wait for them to disconnect (on their own), and then reconnect from the phone.  Also, when interrupting a video for a phone call, the audio for the video does not always come back once the call is complete.<br /><br />Also, the packaging advertises noise cancelling, but in reality they do not offer this feature at all.  Understandable for a $30 pair of headphones, but still false advertising."
1,"Battery life great. I use them for the gym. They are so comfortable and easy to use. I love the sound quality.  I turn the volume up and happily can't hear when people slam the gym weights. One of my best accessories..Also, I love that it's compatible with my Sony Xperia Z2."
1,My son said these are the best! He really loves them.
0,These worked really great until the right earbud electronic components cracked open and won't reseal. Very disappointed as I expected them to last a very long time and I've used them only a few months.
1,Very impressed with this item.  I use them every day and they haven't failed me yet.  Very easy and convenient to use.
1,Good for the price. Easy to use and fine battery life.
1,"Great pair of earbuds, and I HATE earbuds. Easy to charge, pair with phone, and operates easily. Loud, clear sound. Used while sitting, weight training, and during a run; only had to adjust them a few times during the run. Great price for all the functionality!"
1,"I’m re-ordering these headphones because mine were lost during a hurricane that destroyed me house. Personally, I have used them only when driving. They worked very well, were easy to connect and operate, and the sound quality and intensity were good. Because they were comfortable, I sometimes forgot to take them off and leave them in the vehicle."
1,Terrific for gym use!
0,"The microphone output of these headphones is very disappointing. My first call with them, and the person I called immediately complained that they couldn't hear me. Later I tried it myself on my phone and it was very poor audio. These might be OK earbuds for listening to music, but if you intend to have a phone conversation with them they are not going to make you (or those you call) very happy."
1,I bought these to walk on the treadmill and wash dishes.  They are easy to use and I'm satisfied with my purchase.
1,Music plays awesome and noise reduction is really great. It fits perfectly on my ear.
1,"This is my second pair.  The connection on the left ear started to go bad after heavy use.  I almost got the newer version, but there were too many complaints about the ear piece."
1,Very impressed with the price and quality of the product. I used them for running and they work and sound great.
1,Great product and at a great price!! Thank you
1,4 sets for four different people everyone likes them and the price was unbeatable
1,Excelent! Very Cool!
1,The LED light showing status/battery level/ etc. is very small - But I liked the light bluetooth headphone.
1,Very pleased with the product. I do not know what Moisture Wicking. I do not comment on that.  Thanks
1,Great
1,Very comfortable fit and sound is nearly equal in quality to my 300.00 Denon over-ear headphones. Quite a bargain and purchased another set as a gift.
0,All around bad product... the sound is mediocre at best... Battery life is shorter than expected... and it def isn't water proof. The ear pieces came apart as soon as they came in contact with water (See Photo)
1,Good
1,"Sound quality not as dynamic as expected. They are comfortable in the ears, easy connect."
1,"Husband ordered these and he sweats a lot while running or working out and has tried a few different wireless headsets. Out of the different products he has tried this has been the best especially for the cost. He recently had issues with them, but got them instantly exchanged by the company with no hassle at all. Cheap but good headphones, honest company with a 2 day turnaround on the warranty exchange."
1,These are the best earphones I’ve had ever. They fit nice and have a great sound
1,The headphones are great! Customer service is amazing!
1,Bought these headsets to listen to music and podcasts while in the jacuzzi. Great product! Sound is wonderful. The controls are easy and logically placed for smooth operation with wet hands. The ear piece that wraps around the back of ear is flexible for a custom fit. Highly recommend.
1,"Much better sound due to the design. Also, they do not hurt.<br />They fit inside the Ear canal. Deep, inside.  However, don't bother trying to have a phone conversation with them.. Siri can barely operate."
1,"Only used them for 2 days and they are killer so far... super long battery life.... but like I said, only 2 days so far.... we shall see... great customer service."
1,excellent
1,Amazing
0,"if you're working out and getting sweaty, these are not the earbuds for you"
1,Great quality and long lasting.
1,"I absolutely love these earbuds!!! I only encountered one problem while I was at the gym. If I was using the weight machines there was not a problem but as soon as I started the treadmill, I had no music. This could very well be a problem with the service provider. Other than that I am totally happy with the product and delivery! Would not hesitate recommending it to anyone. Thank you!"
1,"My ONLY complaint would be regarding the cord that goes between the two earpieces.  I found it a bit annoying.  The material that it is made of is a little ""grabby.""  I wonder if they could use a different material that would slide more easily instead of grabbing against clothing?  Otherwise, everything else about this product is great; certainly an excellent value for the money!"
1,"I have mixed feelings about the earphones.<br />Pros:<br />Nice Clear Sound<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Gives me a headache while all other headphones that I use do not give me a headache.<br />2. Even when the sound is literally at the lowest level, it screams &#34;LOW BATTERY&#34; very LOUDLY. Makes one jump from the screaming. I would understand if someone is listening to loud music at a high sound level and it screams, then ok, but when one is listening to very soft music at the lowest sound level , the loud screaming becomes out of the norm."
1,Wonderful sound!!!!!
0,"Device was on Delivered May 8, 2018 and it is already failing. Is there any Bluetooth device vendor that sells a quality product? This one will not turn on unless I press the button about a 1000 x. I might get lucky, it will come on.<br /><br />I hate looking for a new device every 4 months .... Is this programed obsolescent sales approach? If so, brilliant. I will add this one to the pile of failed devices I a;ready have."
1,"Had for quite a while. Use 3x a week when I workout and sometimes at work. Battery lasts nicely, don't have to worry if I forget to charge it for a couple days. Lasts me about 10 hours of use. They've held up well but the piece covering the charge hole did fall out. To be expected imo given the nature of how I use them."
1,I have no complaints these headphones work great and the price is great as well!
1,Good wireless headphones at a great price.  Also good warranty.  One side stopped working after 10 months and they honored the warranty.
0,"I actually love these and use them all the time as my Bluetooth for phonecalls and for listening to music.  However I have gone through 4 pairs now and eventually it just stops charging.  One lasted about a year before this happened, others a few months, and my most recent buy only lasted 1 month.  I like this product for the price but I can tell they are making them more and more inferior as their sales increase.  I am very annoyed with my last purchase as my ""1 month return window"" has expired which is a load of crap for a tech item."
1,"Fantastic, fits great with the provided ear tips.  The proper size ear tip is vary important.  I just love this item."
0,The noise cancelation isn't good. I got a warrantee and I was unable to get a hold of anyone via email. Headset stopped working at one point working again. But the static noise is awful my customers complain alot they can't hear me.
1,"The sound quality on these headphones is crystal clear. The unit itself is very easy to set up and easy to use. It comes with a number of different accessories that I probably won't use but it's the thought that counts. Like for instance the car adapter, I must have 30 of these things. 25 in the car somewhere, under the seat maybe, I don't really know, I've looked for one but cannot find it. so I just use the recharge cord in in the house. I had this unit up and running in under 30 minutes, it was easy and I was very surprised at how well it sounded. The headphones themselves are very light and comfortable, which you would think would make this set tinny and not very soundproof, but that's not the case. The music or podcast is very present and noise from the outside does not leak in, even at a low volume. I talk to myself a lot and need this as a way to cover for the voices that I hear, I bought them to be able to pretend to be on a call. Oops, gotta go, gotta call coming in. Would recommend."
0,"It has been roughly around three months since I purchased these and were pleased with them up until now. The rubber material that protects the inner wires to connect from the right earbud to the left, merely ripped open. Now everytime I use them, the audio drops every time I do any sort of movement. Perhaps, it is not the right earbuds to use for running or biking? It just did not seem like it is durable in constant contact with outdoor rough environments."
1,Nice and good for training. But for noise canceling it is not as written
1,Great earbuds with good distance from the phone. Comfortable and a great sound. Two thumbs up - one for the quality and one for the price!
1,"The headphones are pretty good and just what I expected.  What was surprising however, was the customer service I received after the sale.  After about 6 months of every day use during exercise, the SENSO headphones failed to power up.  Without much hope, I sent an email to Invotek on a Sunday morning to let them know they stopped working.  To my surprise, I received an email a few hours later (on a Sunday) with a few things to try in order to repair the headphones (essentially a factory reset).  I was able to get around to trying that on Monday morning and unfortunately that did not work so I emailed again to let Invotek know.  They responded again extremely quickly and notified me an order for a replacement set had been processed and was on its way.  For the price paid for the headphones I was happy with the product.  I am blown away by the customer service though and will certainly recommend them as a company that stands behind their product.  Get these headphones, you will love them for exercise and every day use.  You will have piece of mind knowing that if something should go wrong, the manufacturer will be there for you."
1,I would buy these over an expensive pair of headphones any day! They fit your ear almost perfectly!
0,Did not even charged battery the first time I tried it<br />Amazon is selling this Item which is a piece of garbage and is asking a high price for it
1,"Order these!!!  I love them. I'm not a huge earbud lover, but these are awesome.  Easy to use. Stay in place even during the sweatiest workouts. And the sound quality is excellent.  What a find!!!"
1,"The sound is great, the price is great but I dont like the fitting of these earphones. The silicon fit around the ear is horrible. Doesn't fit on my ear correctly."
0,I ordered this and just received it today. It doesn't appear to be damaged at all. There is a major mix up in the charging cable connection. It doesn't come with the correct connection. I clicked on the seller information and it has a number. I dialed so called number and it notes this number is no longer in service. I know I didn't pay too much for these but seems wrong. They look as advertised and look good but I can't charge them.
1,The best ones I had so far
0,Was loosing connection. Didn't work very welll.
0,Stopped working after a few weeks. Junk
1,Love these. Great for somebody not looking to spend a ridiculous amount of money for wireless ear buds.
1,These are the best..have tried others that were more expensive and these are better than those!!!  I have told all my girl friends about them .. please do buy them you will not be disappointed!!!
1,Best bluetooth ever!!!!
1,"I got them for jogging.  However, I first tried the different sizes provided to find the best fit and sound. As with all earbuds, a good fit will make the sound (particularly the base) much better. It sounded OK with the supplied middle size silicone tips, and better with the larger ones (I have large ear canals) but when I put in the foam tips I was blown away as to how good these guys sound! very rich and full of base. I swear, I could feel the deep tones in my bones - just like with my expensive speakers.  I then wore them for several hours while I worked around the house - very comfortable.  Today, I finally took them for a run - perfect! they stayed in place and continued to give me great sound!"
1,The sound quality of these headphones is very good and they easy fit over ears and are very comfortable. This is a very good buy for the price because the sould quality rivals that of some of the over $100 headphones.
1,"I am not an expert but I have bought many earphones and these are one of the best. The value is great, they fit well and offer a full range of sounds. For earbuds it has great bass but it can overpower the treble. However, if you want a good sounding earbuds that won't fall out running or lifting weights these are the ones to get without shelling out $300. You'll like them."
0,Already not working!!
1,"A lot of extra goodies that come with the earbuds.  My first set didn't work, and after emailing them, they did a great job resolving my issue.  Thank you, Senso.  They work great.  I recommend."
1,I bought these to use on my bike rides they have good sound quality no matter what ear buds I tried could not keep the wind noise out so now use them around the house yard work etc
1,Very light and comfortable. Great sound.
1,"Great customer service and product!  I order 2 pairs.... one for my husband and one for myself. The pair I received worked great. Sound was great and were really soft in my small ears. However, the pair my husband received had some kind of glitch.... wouldn't pair with his phone.  Contacted Senso customer service and they are sending another pair right away'"
0,I bought them a couple of months ago and now the left ear doesn’t work!
1,"Very comfortable, good battery life"
0,This product fell apart quick
1,"Amazing headphones, I workout 6 days a week and seat profusely, these things have been going strong for over 6 months, never had an issue connecting. Long battery life lasts me about a week."
1,"...they sound great for my purposes.  They fit well and I can jog, train martial arts, really jump around.  They don't come loose.  Cord is not an inconvenience.  These are a great set of headphones for the price.<br /><br />Only con I have is that the bluetooth range feels more like ten feet before it starts to break up.  30' might be the absolute max range at which you can get a weak signal.  Playing music from my Samsung phone I get about 10'.  That's good enough for most of my purposes."
1,"I am quite happy with the Senso ear buds, they work well, sound quality is great for what I need, impressed with battery life, light weight and handy carrying case. Great for music and calls. This is a great buy."
1,Every other headphone I've used has died in one ear or stopped working after a short time. These lasteed over 2 years and only needed replacement because I slammed one in the car door and crushed it.
0,Wouldn't stay in my ears at all. Apple Airpods are way better and the way to go!
1,"I was trying to find earbuds to work with my Apple iPad2 and these earbuds work really well for that purpose.  Not as good sound quality as I thought they might be, but it works for what I am using it for."
1,Very nice headset for people who don't do well with earbuds. Quality is great and the sound is awesome.If you want elite sound spend elite money if your looking for a good buy with great sound these are what your looking for.
0,Was a good product while it worked
1,So far they are great just got back from walk and I received phone call went well. Thanks for reaching out preety cool.<br />A
1,"Bought these for my son, he hasnt really used them yet, but I found them to be easy to use (albeit it was a little hard to charge initially)"
1,"Great for Cardio Workouts, stay on! Sweat is not a problem with them. And they have a great battery life and bluetooth range!"
1,"Wasn't sure what to expect as id never heard of this brand or owned anything similar. I've used these for about a year now for work nearly everyday (I used them while washing cars). I've gotten them wet many times and never a problem, easy to use and sound great!"
1,"Amazing for the price. Love them. Great accessories. A bit dull/bass-heavy for audio books, but could be a factor of ear-bud size/how deep you like to put them into your ears."
1,"I've had these for a month now and they are definitely worth the money.  Fit is good and the hooks keep them on my ears where other buds fall out.  The sound is very good, also.  I'd buy another set without a second thought"
1,"These make exercise bearable!  Comfortable and easy to use, w/ a compact yet sturdy case.  Came w/ 3 different sizes of ear plugs.  I would STRONGLY recommend these."
1,I only had these for six months and the left ear is already cutting in and out! The sound quality is absolutely magnificent and these are perfect for man on a bench lifting weights or running because they was behind the ear! The return policy from the manufacturer says one year but I will have to look into it because I do not have a return option here on Amazon anymore! But if you are looking for deep bass and excellent call Quality then these I can recommend! It's just the longevity of it that I question!
1,"Best Bluetooth phones I ever owned. Connect instantly, Good sound and volume, Bigger than the 300 dollar earbud type that I used in the past. But stay in the ear when jogging or walking. Good product."
0,They worked perfectly well for a couple of months but now they will no longer connect with my phone. I am able to get them paired occasionally but they still don't seem to want to connect.
1,"These are the third pair of bluetooth headphones I've purchased in the last 6 months and found these to be a winner. I had trouble with the previous two pair staying in my ears and was continually adjusting them. I have worked out several times with these and find they require little or no adjustment as I go through my workout. I haven't run with them but walking, using an elliptical and stationary biking have all been great. I find the sound quality much better than my Apple EarPods. The are easy to pair, adjust volume and change tracks as I listen to my iPhone or iPod. They are very light, and in my opinion, look great. The headphones also come with several goodies. They include a 2 port car charger and a USB - lightning/mini cable."
1,"Ok sound quality, low end is lacking and muddied but I can't complain for the $10/free shipping price I paid, and it being wireless.  It stayed in place pretty well so will work great for active usage.  It's a bonus that it comes with a car charger and a couple of USB cables."
1,Love these! Have bought two of these (lost a pair in an airport!).. Love the ability to charge my phone and the headphones with the same cord!!
0,They worked great for two months BUT then stopped working last week.  So my review will be better if they are replaced and work properly for a couple of years.
1,"Excellent packaging, good sound quality and comfortable."
1,Comfort and ease of use are great. So far I haven't tried using these earphones in the pool but I assume they will function well.
1,Very nice quality and sound
1,"These headphones are amazing !!! Great quality , very loud !! The bass is little too strong but it can be easily fixed by equalizer ! Also battery holds forever ! I got my headphones on Tuesday and I used it every day for 4 days without charging them !"
1,"The headphones work superb, I love them"
0,Very uncomfortable to wear. This was a gift and I bought too early and could not return.
1,Excellent product and service
1,"Nice sound.  I like the various sizes of buds included.  Wish the piece that goes around the outer ear was adjustable.  It’s only a piece of flexible rubber, so it doesn’t provide much security if the ear bud loosens from the canal."
0,"I’ve had these headphones for several months and have finally concluded that they are uncomfortable and not quite effective.  When using with my iPhone, I hear only out of the right ear piece.  The ear pieces keep falling off my ears and the clasp to hold the cable together easily slips off, even getting lost once.  I’ve just ordered another type but still SENSO."
1,Its a good cheap efficient wireless earbuds but I hate how much right side always falls out I've tried everything...
1,"Same as a few other bluetooth headsets here..literally! my hubby ordered one pair, I ordered another and they both are Meh as far as sound goes.<br />they WORK...but they def do not sound better than the OEM corded headphones."
1,Love them. I like the way they fit. The ear wrap pieces are soft and flexible. I also like the case and extras that came with the headphones. It is so nice to be wireless.
0,Quality is good ...sound is OK but the one I got has horrible connection....it cuts off with my phone just being in my pocket
1,"This is my third pair of Sensos. They are incredibly good. Especially for the price and for working out. They actually stay in your ears, even if you are sweaty. The sound is great and they come with a bunch of attachments to personalize your listening. A really great product."
1,It goes out every now and then when the phone is in my pocket which is annoying but overall I'm happy
1,"Excellent headphones. Very comfortable, clear sound, good connection. Paired easily with iPhone7. Recommend highly."
1,Battery life only about 3 hrs
1,"These are actually amazing headphones, long battery life and amazing quality AAAND at an amazing price. The best wireless headphones ever. Period."
1,Senso Bluetooth headphones are amazing! I’ve had my first pair almost two years and using them a close to 2 hours a day. Have yet to have an issue and so great I bought a second pair to keep at work. The quality is unbelievable and price is amazing.
1,"Pretty good gym headphones. Great battery life, comfortable and they feel solid. A little bass heavy for my taste but other that I have no complaints."
1,Excellent sound quality! the bluetooth is easy to connect and works great.
1,Need to return this product ASAP. They just like snapped in half on me one day while jogging and trying to adjust them. Overall I do like the sound quality and the fact that I have the option to answer my phone.
0,The first one i purchased lasted 10 months before the battery went dead and the replacement pair only lasted 3 months.  Spend your money elsewhere.
0,"Sound was ok for this price range. Bluetooth range was less than 2 feet. Couldn’t even run paired to my phone or Apple Watch without cutting out constantly. Bummer, you get what you pay for."
1,"These are great headphones!! They work excellent, the sound quality is great and the added bonus is the phone call quality. Will definitely recommend these!"
1,Its hurt when I put it on my ear .
1,This is a very good product and economical compared to similar ones
1,I was excited for these headphones as I liked the ear piece to hold them in place while exercising. The problem I experienced was that my ears are too small for the silicone hooks. They stick up over the tops of my ears and in no way help hold the headphones in place. The sound coming out of these is fantastic and I don't need to turn the volume up nearly as loud as with a previous pair of Bluetooth headphones. I was able to make these work by placing the ear grip under by headband but obviously that would not work for everyone. These would be five stars if the ear piece was either adjustable or came with interchangeable sized pieces.
1,"These are my first wireless earphones and I was very excited when I got them. For the price it's actually really great headphones but there are some issues. 1. It says it lasts 6-8 hours it's more like 5 hours for me. 2. When walking outside if you have your phone in your pocket and your arm gets between the earphones and phone the sounds breaks off a lot so It probably wouldn't be a good product to jog with not like I'd know since I don't jog. 3. Battery low announcement comes on every minute when headphones are dying making it really hard to enjoy the last 5-10 mins of my music.<br /><br />Update: after a year and a half they don’t work anymore. Fully charged, hard reboot. They won’t turn on for more than 2 seconds if they do. Really mad."
1,"These headphones work great! I wanted a headphone so I didn't need to carry my phone with me everywhere while listening to a pod cast or music and that would also cancel outside noise in the process and these headphones did just that. They came with a stylish case, and charging cable. They also came with some fun accessories which is a nice touch. Easy to use with a variety of ear size adapters which make them easy to fit in your ear. You can also switch them out for others to use them without using your specific ear plug. Nice!"
1,Very comfortable and fit very snuggly.
0,"The wrap-around ear pieces are so malleable that they don’t hold the earpieces in; since these earpieces are relatively heavy, not holding them firmly in place is a major design flaw.  Sound quality is passable,  but I really couldn’t get an idea of how good it is simply because the earpieces would not stay in place.  This device is sold under multiple different brand names; I had two others, both of which work adequately, but avoid the Senso brand. The other ones of this particular style are okay"
1,"Good grip on the ear, good sound, easy to set up and use, and the right accessories are included"
1,Great headphones and even better customer service! Highly recommend.
1,"Much more than I expected...easy to use, good sound and separation. Company appears interested in pleasing"
1,"Flawless transaction, easy to set up, great range and clarity."
1,"These are simply awesome headphones.  Exactly what I expected...light, comfortable, stable Bluetooth connection to my Galaxy Edge 7S, and great sound. Compared to my wife's Plantronics in a similar style, I much prefer these.  They are not quite as compact as hers, but the improvement in sound quality is well worth the little extra bulk.  I highly recommend these headphones."
0,"These headphones sounded really good for the few weeks that they actually worked. Unfortunately, both the pairs I had stopped wanting to recharge after 3 -4 weeks of use. Do yourself a favor, and choose something else."
1,Amazing customer service and a great product.
0,It works only for 3 month
1,"I lost my headphones which was the previous version of this set, in my opinion the old version was better. the cover for the USB charger never closed all the way, which doesn't change performance but was rather annoying. Additionally, it seems that they tried to cut costs on the piece that goes around your ear, this is a much thinner, more flimsy, and cheaper piece which does not hold as well onto the ear or hold its shape very well. Sound quality was slightly better than previous version though. Flimsy earpiece was a deal breaker for me, it felt like it was just dangling off my ears while I was working out and bothered me to the point of returning it, on top of the faulty USB port cover."
0,"Within less than a month these will no longer charge. I only used these about 4 times. I have tried to troubleshoot the chargers,which work for my other headsets so it's not them."
1,Love it!
1,"Easy to use, sound great.. comfortable and dont try to fall off when running"
1,"Awesome product! So far so good. Not the most confortable ones, but very good indeed."
1,"Work as explained, great sound and noise cancelling"
1,Just recently received today will see if they like them as a gift !
1,Yes I’d recommend you buy these.<br />Very good sound and easy to operate<br /><br />But I give em 1 Star on the “charge cover plug” used on the headset because it’s HARD to pull it out unless you’ve got good finger nails or get lucky- it would be easy to make the tab longer
0,"I guess I expected them to last longer than 30 days of use, even though they were only 30 bucks. I only got one real full charge out of them, the first one. After that, the charge they retained decreased drastically with each charge. Now, after the 4th or 5th charge, they only stay powered up for 10 minutes tops.<br /><br />My 2 cents: keep looking, and avoid these entirely."
0,"Worked great at first. Great sound and decent bass for the price. After a month, they started cutting in and out when I used them. A day after I did the reset on them no sound would come out of them when I connected them to any device! I returned them."
1,"This is the fifth brand of bluetooth headphones my husband has tried, and he LOVES these!  We hit the nail on the head, and I am so happy to have found them on Amazon- and for a wonderful price!  We hit a one day sale and that made them even better!  I highly recommend them.  The sound is clear, the music has great tones and bass, and phone calls have great clarity.  My husband has also had problems with headphones fitting his ears properly, and the design on these is perfect.  He doesn't have to push the earbuds deep into his ears to hear, and the flexible hook design keeps them on his ears while he's working or out on a run."
1,"I normally used Bose headphones but found I was replacing them about one time per year. I decided to give these a try - specifically as a workout set of headphones. Wow, fantastic sound (for the price).  I would not say they are on par with high level headphone out there but they sure are amazing! You won't be disappointed at what you get for the money with these. It did take me some time to figure out the proper ear tip size as the headphones would fall out initially fall out when I ran. I got it all figured out."
0,Only worked once before bluetooth died.
0,Stopped working after 4 months! Disappointed.
1,"The earphones are very comfortable and have great sound quality.  They are also very easy to pair with both my iphone and ipad, which is something I had troubles with using a different set.  And the customer service is great!"
1,"These headphones worked great for me for several months (mostly used for running - comfortable and good sound quality, they didn't fall out of my ears, and the part that bends over your ear worked fine with my glasses on). Then they stopped working suddenly. I contacted Senso Customer Support and after a factory reset didn't work, they had a new set of headphones on the way to me within hours of my original request for help. I look forward to getting my replacement headphones and getting back to wireless running!"
1,Really satisfied with my purchase! When I make calls I can hear and be heard clearly! Plus all the little bonuses are awesome!
1,"I bought these headphones to replace a pair of 1MORE fit in-ear bluetooth headphones. If you're not too worried about the sleek design, these are a good (cheaper) replacement. The sound is comparable and the the over ear hooks HELP keep the buds in place. The over-ear hooks, however; can't be adjusted or manipulated to fit to the ear. They fit okay, but while going through daily tasks around the house, one occasionally needs to be adjusted because it'll come loose from the ear. The package came with additional rubber buds to help fit into the ear, but I haven't tried other sizes yet. This may help fix this issue. I can't imagine using these for any kind of recreational sport. The blue tooth range is fine. The charging cable has to be forced into the charging port; it feels like it's not supposed to fit but it does. Overall, they're decent for the price. Time will tell how durable they are."
1,good sound quality
1,Best Bluetooth headphones I have had yet. Sound excellent . Connects easily and quickly.
1,"I love the well-rounded sound and comfort on my ear. The only issue I had is they sent me lightning to USB (apple) charger, even though the headphones charge via micro USB. No complaints otherwise, well worth the price."
1,Everything is just fine...
1,Work great sound great with a great price
0,They sound great just can't get them to work consistently they keep losing Bluetooth repeatedly then go out permanently
1,"This is one of many ear set that I bought, this is the only one that fits , the others slips right out, one ear but fell out while I was bent over to flush the toilet, it went right down the drain"
1,Love these!
0,Came with everything except for the actual headphones...rip off
1,"Great product! Sounds better than many more expensive brands! I do love Bose, but wow, for the price...well done Senso!"
1,"Great sound quality and I enjoyed them until a week ago when they stopped charging. It doesn't matter which charger I use, they charge all night and notify me of &#34;low battery&#34; as soon as I wear them. They lasted almost 3 months :/<br /><br />*** UPDATE: The customer service from Invotek is prompt and outstanding. They were willing to do a full refund if a reset didn't work, but gave me instructions on how to do it, and the issue has resolved. In case you have the same issue or any other malfunction, here's the snippet from the email with instructions on how to do resolve it:<br /><br />&#34;Let's try a factory reset for your Senso headphones which usually fixes most similar issues related to the issue you are facing with your headphones.<br /><br />1. Reset the Senso headphone to factory settings (while plugged into a power source, press/hold the power button for 7 seconds).<br />2. Unplug the headphone from charging cable and power them on.<br />3. Enter the earbuds into the pairing mode and follow instructions for connecting.<br /><br />Also, the issue you have described is common all Bluetooth devices as the connection between the two devices gets &#34;corrupted&#34; and needs to be re-configured.  In order to do that, please `Forget the Device` on your mobile phone for the Senso headphones and try pairing again.  In your Bluetooth settings on your phone, you will see all detected Bluetooth devices.  Click on the Senso ActivBuds option and click on Forget this Device.  Next pair your headphones to your mobile device once again as shown in the instructions manual.<br />I am confident that this will fix your issue.<br /><br />Also, you are covered by our 1 Year Warranty, so you have nothing to worry about in case these don't work.&#34;<br /><br />I have many pairs of Bluetooth headphones and these are my favourite due to comfort and sound quality. So happy they are working perfectly again!"
1,"Love these. Fit great in my ears, light weight, connect great to my Bluetooth phone. Only issue is when I run and there's a wind you get a lot of background noise. For the price these headphones are amazing. Highly recommend them!"
1,"At first I was hesitant to purchase Bluetooth headphones, I saw them as an unneeded expense. Once I wore them at the gym I was immensely glad that I did. They were incredibly comfortable, sound great and I was no longer getting the wire connecting my headphones to my mp3 player caught on the gym equipment. These are well worth price."
0,I bought these about a year ago. The sound quality is decent but no bass and now power to it. They are a budget set of headphones. If you aren't willing to pay 100 plus for quality headphones then these can be a decent set for running and what not.. Anyway they are pretty cheaply made. I am writing this review because I just pulled them out of my pocket the other day and the power button somehow got pushed in and stuck. I tried to carefully pulled back out and all the innards came with it. TOAST!! What the heck happened to 30 dollar pairs of head phones that had great sound quality and lasted longer than you wanted?? There was a time.  But No more!!  It's either cheap shit or spend 150 dollars for quality. Just my two cents.
1,Great product. I began using it at the gym and now I take it everywhere it is very comfortable and the sound is amazing.
1,Decent quality / Good battery life
1,Great headset
1,The headsets are easy to set up and the sound is excellent. I ordered a second pair for my husband.
1,"Sound quality is pretty good, in-ear pieces are comfortable, and they connect to my phone with no problems. The only big downside is the over-ear pieces. They are not adjustable or replaceable, and are very big. I have had many times at work where one will fall out of/off of my ear because the over-ear piece is too big to function the way it should."
1,I’m really impressed with the value for these headphones. I’ve had 2 different Beats sports headphones and both broke for different reasons. I decided to go a less expensive route and these have kept up with me for over a year of daily workouts. Haven’t noticed a single issue yet. I would definitely recommend these.
1,"So let me start by saying that I own Powerbeats 2 wireless Bluetooth headphones as well as jaybird X2 and the simple fact of the matter is these are better.  They fit well,they're comfortable, they have good sound awesome bass and power not to mention the added accessories and the price! I am generally a Bose snob so quality and clearity and power really matter to me. Shockingly enough these headphones sound close to my wired bose headphones and better than some of the top popular brands. Do yourself a favor and save some money and give these Bluetooth headphones a try. I promise that you will not be disappointed. Ps. I just ordered a 2nd pair to give away as a gift because I am that impressed!"
1,I buy cheap Bluetooth headphones because I think that they have much more better sound but these are the best one I bought yet the Samsung level wasn't really worth the $130 buck but the sensor win
1,"A little difficult to wear sunglasses with these headphones, but perfect for yoga and running."
0,I got this for my husband to use with the his iPhone X with very high expectations based on the raving reviews. I don’t think I’ve ever been so disappointed with a product that is rated so highly. They have not held the charge sonce day 1. I can barely get 20 min use out of them before the battery is drained. When they do work the sound quality and range is great but what’s the point when I can’t even use them without repeatedly having to charge them?
1,All as expected
1,Great to have it
1,"Good quality and sound,  had issues of the rubber ear pieces falling out and losing them.  ALSO I do ground work so i use weed whackers and leaf blowers, and had the issue of the blue tooth ear buds cutting in and out like if the loud sound and vibrations were interfering with the connection to the phone , more like if the song was skipping and then would totally disconnect sometimes.  *could of been the BT chip in my phone*<br />4/10 just for the inconvenience of connection  with phone"
1,These are wonderful. Paired right away. Sound great. Easy to use and comes with a great case and several ear buds sure to fit everyone. Love them!!
1,"The price was right but these do not stay our in my ears. I have tiny ears and the small earpiece does fit where most do not. However, the part that wraps around your ear is very floppy and does not hold the piece tightly to your ear.  If you move around much they will fall out."
1,So far I really like them.  My only complaint is that the ear pieces are a little bit big.
0,"I am writing this hoping that the Senso people read it and know how bad and shady their customer service is. The headphones themselves are actually great, they work very well for the price, fit in the ear well, come with bunch of extra stuff. I am a fan of the headphones themselves. However, being that they're 30 bucks, they're not invincible. Mine stopped working properly after about 11 months of use. I though ""oh great there is a 1 year warranty on them, I should be fine"" I filed a warranty claim with Senso and got an email response quickly asking for my amazon order number so they could verify the purchase, I responded and gave it to them as instructed. After that I heard NOTHING. After multiple follow up emails requesting help I still have not received a response telling me what I am supposed to do to finalize the claim. Because of their lack of response, I am now past the 1 year warranty and am stuck with broken headphones. Senso conveniently just stopped responding to me when they saw that my headphones were almost a year old. SHADY.... SHAAAAAAADY! Good headphones but bad support."
1,Great product.. great price
1,"Best headphones I have ever bought. Had a pair of high dollar pair of Beats, they broke the first month. Love these. Bought a second pair for husband. Sensor cares about there customer as well. 1 year warranty is also very nice. Good job Senso."
1,"Headphones are wonderful. Had a glitch with my first pair and the factory resett would not work, the next day they sent me a.new pair. Hopefully it was just a glitch because they perform as well as any beats. Customer service was excellent!"
1,I love them
1,"These earphones are a great price and great quality!  They come with multiple attachments and are adjustable, so they will fit no matter what size your ears are!  Moreover, they do a great job of blocking outside noise- I used to have to turn the volume of my apple earphones up all the way to block out other noises, but with these I don't even have to turn the volume up to the halfway point!  I wear them at the gym at least 4 times a week, and they are great for running, lifting, and any other workout.  They will even tell you when the battery is low!  Overall, these are a great buy!"
1,Wow. Best bang for buck purchase i've made in a long time.<br /><br />Great sound for what they are.<br />Comes with a car charger and an Apple lightening cable which is awesome.<br /><br />i'll edit once i've used them for a few months.
1,"Work great when at the gym! My husband loves them, long battery life."
1,"Shipping was fast and product came as described. I am still evaluating the product, will write detailed review soon"
1,These are awesome and price is nice :-) Very user friendly
1,I wear them when I am working around the farm they are great they block out the noise of The tractors
1,"Just got these today to listen to music, podcasts and Netflix at the gym. I've had wired headsets that keep getting caught on the gym equipment- what a pain. I'm using the foam ear pieces and they feel very comfortable and don't fall out.<br />So- just charged these up and am blown away by the sound quality sound. Nicely balanced base, mid-range and high end. Not perfect but way better than what I expected for a $20 pair of earbuds. I was going to buy the Beats but no way are they 10X better.<br />Off to listen to more music and a workout."
0,"I got the headphones a couple days ago. They were easy to pair with my phone, and are very comfortable to wear. The sound quality seams to be good too.<br /><br />Update: I've had them for a couple weeks and the sound is cutting out so badly that I can't understand what people are saying on the phone. On one phone call, the call was clear. I turned the headphones on and was chatting and they started breaking up. I turned the audio source back to the phone, and the conversation was clear again. The phone was right in my hand, inches away from the headphones. I'm returning them."
1,"Good sound. Easy to set up. Fit well in the ears. I'd give it 5 stars if the silicone around the ears was a little firmer. I've only used them once, so battery life is yet to be determined. I had &quot;beats&quot; before, these seem comparable if not better for over half the price!"
0,"Purchased the product as part of a Prime Day promotion in July.  I generally used it a few times a week and would put it on the charger on my nightstand that was supplied with the headphones when not in use.  Last week, we smelled something burning but couldn't determine where the smell was coming from.  The next day when I went to use the headphones, I found that they had melted onto the charging cord.  So luckily they didn't catch anything nearby on fire.  If yours do not catch fire, then the headphones seemed to work well."
1,"I got it for my dad as a father's day gift and he said he likes the 8hr battery life. He's a construction worker so music is great to pass the time at work. He also said the sound quality is nice as well. I say it's neat that it comes with a case and for the $40 sale it's amazing. Amazing work, Team."
1,As advertised!
0,When I first got these they were pretty cool looking and worked just fine. A few weeks in they started to lose connection with my phone when I would listen to music. As time went on they would work normal again and lose connection  basically every other week and now they rarely ever connect. I have gone weeks without using them and then trying them again and still nothing. I don't know if mine are just a bad batch or not but they aren't worth it
1,I got these as a gift for someone who needed headphones with no pesky wires for work. He loves them so much. He said they sound better than his Beats did.
1,"I ordered 2 models of Senso headphones; the A1 and the S-250. Although the appear to be the same model, they sounded completely different. The S-250 sound when playing music was muddy with distorted bass even when I turned the bass EQ down on my iPhone 7 Plus it still sounded bad. I fired up the A1 set and the sound was much more balanced without the distorted bass or muddy mids. I returned the S-250s.<br /><br />I had a change to really give the A1's a workout a few days ago and wore them while working in the yard for hours. I found them to sound great and be very comfortable with no loss of connection to the phone in my pocket. I did find that the wire kept rubbing on my neck and pulled out my left earphone. Next time I plan to use a cinch button to help hold the headphones in place. I also recommend the memory foam tips instead of the silicon tips. They do a better job of sealing the ear canal and help them stay in place. All in all I'm very please!"
1,"Have only had for a couple of days but sound quality is great and they are comfortable.  I am concerned about their longevity, but they come with a year warranty so for the price I cannot complain."
1,Soft and comfortable feeling
1,"Needed a pair for running that won't fall out of my ears, so I went for bluetooth. Definitely stays in my ears while running. Great audio. Mic works well. Stylish. I love these earbuds!"
1,It's what you would expect for the price. Sound quality is trash
1,"For sound it is great. However, Bluetooth is not very clear and you hear statics."
1,"Sound is what one would expect for the price. I like the over the ear style and they stay on. Included was a like 4 foot iphone charging cable and a cool cigarette lighter charger. Two ports, one higher amps...sorry I forget the two as I do not have it on front of me. Nice bonus for sure. Also a charging cable for the ear buds."
1,So far so good. My only complaint is that they aren't able to multi_sync. I didn't check for that either so....<br /><br />Great customer service
0,It worked great the first time with great sound quality but it wont charge so could never use again
1,"I've only used them once so far, but they are comfortable enough to sleep in and drown out my boyfriend's snoring quite well :)"
0,Crap
1,Very solid headphones with a comfortable fit.
1,Excellent product for the price.
0,The first pair purchased died before the 1-year warranty. Sense sent a replacement that had jammed buttons and melted within a few weeks. The third set they sent intermittently shuts off or initiates random calls to my contacts. Steer clear.
1,these things are  A-WWWWW-ES--OMMMEEE!!
1,"Product is just what I wanted, delivered quick.  Very Happy with purchase"
1,I've had them a year and used hundreds of times. I'd bought 2 other brands that were nothing but aggravation. Now it's been 18 months and the left side is cutting out. COnnection is going bad
1,I love this set of headphones.  I have very small ears and I can keep them in. Although I wish the end could even be  smaller. If you ever make a smaller ear pad let me know.
1,great sound and quality. Finally a wireless headphones that work
1,"These headphones were bought for my son a little over a month ago. The headphones were pretty clear and they stayed in his ears pretty good. Unfortunately, upon charging the headphones, the piece in the charging port collapsed inside of itself so you can't charge them, therefor rendering them useless. We would have sent them back but it is after the 30 days so he is out of his headphones now. And he is not too happy about it."
1,"For the price , they've got to be the best headphones I've had.  Easy hook up , sounds great and good quality.  Definitely worth the money."
1,This are a nice and cheap solution when you're in a bind and need a set of wireless headphones. But I have purchased them twice now and they've stopped working each time after a few months. Haven't tried out the warranty but will give that a go.
1,I use these when I go walking and the sound is really great.  For the price I think these are awesome.  I would highly recommend them.
1,"I'm so happy so far with this great headphones. I really highly recommend this because the price, the sound quality and the design."
1,Pleasantly suprised. Took a chance and it worked out
1,Sound is fair but not good and battery life was a joke.
1,"I like the features it offers, It never worked after charging. It would not turn on."
1,"These headphones are amazing. I haven't had one issue with them since buying them. The sound is great, there very comfortable and the length of the wire is perfect. Another great feature is they haven't given me an issue with connecting to my phone."
1,"Earbud on right side detached from the controller and is now hanging by a wire. Sound is good, but I guess durability is an issue. I usually stick these in my shorts' baggy pocket, so there wasn't much stressing it. The earbuds were comfortable  before the detachment."
1,Im impressed. I have a hearing problem and when i put them on i couldnot believe how good the music is when you hear it well. Thank you
1,"Fits good, paired within seconds, lots of accessories, don't fall out easily. Audio quality isn't the best, when at 3/4 volume there is audible distortion on bass heavy tracks."
1,Simply perfect material high quality fits amazing boy friend loves them and he works out really hard. Cord is super nice the sound quality is impressive and these are defiantly worth the money. If your looking for wireless headphones look no further price and quality ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️🌟
0,The bluetooth range is terrible. I literally have signal break up when my phone is sitting in my pants pocket and I have the iPhone X... Sound quality is good but pointless because the bluetooth does not work.
0,Didn't last long. Apparently I need headphones that can be dipped in water I sweat so much. They sound great but I noticed the seal started to open up. They stopped working because they pretty much got too much sweat inside. I tried drying them out but no luck.
1,These things sound great!  Excellent quality for a 29.99 set of headphones instead of buying the 179 pair of beats.
1,This is my second pair-- my dog ruined the first pair. :[. They work very well!
0,Horrible product. It stopped working altogether after 3 months
1,We have two sets of these but on one they are almost unbearably loud at the lowest volume setting. I’ve had my son stop using them to avoid hearing damage. Would love a solution because these are otherwise great headphones.
1,These bluetooth headphones are great for working out; the sound quality is very good and they are comfortable and easy to use. Senso offered very good customer support when one of my two pair weren't working properly!
1,sound quality leaves a little to be desired but for the price I suspect they'd be hard to beat
1,"excellent product,it worked good and the sound very good."
1,Great sound for the price. Has to be recharged more than I expected and they don’t stay snug on your ear when running.
1,They work great! Easy bluetooth connection/sync. Sound is clear. I am very happy with my purchase.
0,Lasted less than 6 months and died on me.
0,"They work fine, but they are extremely light and tend to bounce out of my ears. Also when you use them there is a blue light that flashes which is extremely annoying in the dark."
1,"Picked these up a few weeks ago but writing a review after having to order a second pair after someone stole my first set! Guess that means they are nice looking headphones but I'm glad they're cheap too. I definitely can't complain about the price or quality, great sound and no wind noise like others complain about. The different sizes work perfect for all ears and I have no issues with them falling out."
1,"Their customer service is top notch.the charge port cover broke off, and when I let the seller know, they were quick to send replacements.  The earbuds however were uncomfortable. I gave them a couple weeks thinking I just needed to get used to them. It got to a point where my ear was in pain after only five minutes. Maybe it was just me, and my ear, but I am an average size guy, so I don't have tiny ears. The sound quality in these were great. I only wish they were more comfortable."
1,Holders wore out and got softer really shortly after the purchase and headphones started to fall off during the run.
1,They stop working on me within two months
1,not so good bass sounds! expected more
0,"The sound is good and the battery lasts. Although; I had numerous problems syncing with the i-phone, also long day on sync-up. The earbuds trap water when they get wet muffling the volume. The cover for the charging jack is a hassle; you have to pry it out. lastly they're not very waterproof. Definitely get the warranty or buy a different brand."
1,"I've purchased two of these now over the last couple years, and they are excellent. The company ships fast, the product is solid and the price is very competitive. Strongly recommended if you're looking for a blue tooth headset that is functional, reliable and comfortable."
0,Not sweat proof
1,The sound on these headphones is amazing. The words are clear on my songs so that I can understand them and the bass and treble is evened out just right.  I would definitely buy these headphones again.  And the price is just right!
1,I have been using these headphones for the last year or so and they get the job done for the most part. The only issue I have had is after a few months it will stop connecting or stop charging but Senso then will send me a new set as long as I remember to enter them in the warranty. Overall good bang for your buck
1,For the price these are great headphones and sound quality is great. No complaints for the price!!
0,"I don't understand all the 5-star reviews. The Bluetooth connection is terrible - they're always getting disconnected from my phone, or the sounds becomes choppy. I spend 10 minutes fighting with these headphones every time I go for a run."
1,These are excellent light weight sound is Outstanding.
0,Returned after first short run.  Wind noise was unbearable
1,"So far, so good."
1,Can't beat the price on these headphones. They could easily sell for over $100. Paying less then $40 was a steal.
1,They work nice. Good range. Sounds quality is ok.
1,"Never had a set of headphones like this, happy I bought them."
1,Great sound quality and no slippage.
1,Great item and great service with 1 year warranty!!!
1,"So far great.  A little too much bass but have worked great for calls, music and movies.  Excellent purchase!"
1,the sound was not as good as I expected.
1,Have worked well...even after going to the washing machine in my pocket 🤦‍♂️
1,Good quality
1,they work good
1,"They are generally great, though they require more finesse with positioning than I imagined. The left bud falls off my ear more frequently than I would like."
1,"Connected easily to my devices, fits well during my workout, great sound!"
1,They work amazing and are comfortable. Both my wife and I got a pair for work and for working out.
1,"Okay lets get out of the way It doesent say im a vrfied buyer Well thats cuz im a kid and my dad bought me these.<br />1, Quality. Great Bass Trebble Volume control Heavy duty Plastic Good buttons, The waterproof IPX-7 part IS TRUE ive cleaned these in the sink and ive been through a sprinkler and shower And there fine, Overall good there.<br />2, Comftorbilaty. I know im a kid But If your an adult, Then the hook wont be bad If ur a kid tho then it will be fine but not the best.<br />3, Battery life. I mean. Ive had it about a day im wearing them atm and still got battery!<br />4, Overall. THESE ARE AMAZING."
1,I love love love these headphones. So light and easy to use. One of the best things I've bought in a while.
1,"Very good sound quality, deep bass"
1,Great Product . Love them . I use this product for the gym every morning. I have noticed other guy's using them as well. They connect to my blue tooth phone quickly.The battery lasts longer then the other pair i had. In the package comes with everything you need to use them and charge them.
1,Good sound quality stereo. Very good comfort. The only recommendation I have is that the cable from hearing aid to hearing aid would have 3 '' longer
1,Product stopped working 35 days after I purchased it. This exceeded the Amazon warranty. I loved them so much I purchased again. When I realized it had 12 month warranty I contacted the sellers and they gave me refund no questions asked. No problems since. These head phones are excellent value for money!
1,"Ordered a set of these for my wife as a &#34;test&#34; to see if she'd really like wireless headphones with the full intention of buying her a different set of really pricey ones (don't want to use the name but it rhymes with &#34;meats&#34;) if she did like going wireless.<br />Three days later she says she loves her sensos and doesn't want the others. I try to explain that the sound will be so much better, blah blah blah and she says, &#34;listen to them.&#34;<br />I do. Two days after that I ordered a second set for me. These are fantastic. Sound quality is impeccable, battery life solid. Light weight, comfortable and worked great even after my seven year old stepped on them.<br />Can't recommend highly enough, and TWO sets of these cost roughly the same as I would have spent on the... meats."
1,These are the best Bluetooth earbuds I have had to date. Sound is great not too much base but just enough for me. Also keeps outside sound to a minimum. Very comfortable was able to wear for 5 hrs with no problems and battery lasted the whole time. So far very pleased.
1,Definitely get what you pay for. Treble and vocals sound good but the bass sucks. The ear piece is too flimsy. I can definitely see it falling off... but it is comfortable.
0,Sounds good an all but my ears hurt after only like 15 minutes of use. Couldn't take it anymore and returned.
1,"They arrived as advertised. The setup was quite easy, and they were connected in no time. I got the right fit eventually, as they come with multiple sizes of the bud part. The sound was very good for the price. I tried them with some of my favorite music, as well as with audio books. I am VERY satisfied."
1,"I love them!! They are really ergonomic and easy to use,  it's a purchase that I totally recommend (:"
1,Very good product for this price.
1,I’m new to Bluetooth headphones previously just using your standard earbuds until I just got sick of twisted tangled cords. These are a revelation and the best thing I’ve purchased in a long while. Things don’t stay in my ears well so I like the over the ear hook which is really comfortable. I wear these for 1-11/2 hours at the gym and never notice them. I can’t speak with experience about sound quality except to say they are better than your apple ear buds. Loudness is more than enough and there is some bass effect. For the money I would highly recommend
1,Best of the best
1,"So far, so good. I've only had these headphones a few days but...they are GREAT! They paired easily to my tablet and phone and fit great."
1,Great product
1,"My pair worked great for a almost 3 months then started having problems with it holding a charge. Got an immediate response from customer service with instructions to try to remedy the problem. It worked but I continued to have some charging issues. When I contacted customer service again, they quickly responded and sent me out a replacement pair of earbuds. I'm pretty sure the charging issues is uncommon and even so, I would strongly recommend these to anyone!"
1,These headphones are great. I've had them for a few months without any problems and love them so much that I bought them for 2 of my friends. Good battery life and sound quality.
0,"These broke after 3 weeks, they are not tested or properly refurbished. Do not buy this. Amazon and Senso will refuse to help you."
1,"It break too fast, but great sound for the price better then some premium headphone"
1,Thank you Invotek for taking care of me.<br /><br />I love these head phones. Great sound. Comfortable to wear for long periods of time. I use these headphones everyday.<br /><br />Had a problem with headphones while they were still under warranty. Invotek customer service is prompt and great support.
0,these are too heavy they fall off my ears
1,Loved them they drown out my drunken brother perfectly
1,Very lite weight. Forgot I had them on during workout. Fit inside my ears were perfect! Highly recommend!
0,Comfortable but the sound is muffled bad. Like the treble is all the way down
1,Great value for the money.
1,Brilliant product all the way. I use it for motorcycling and it works perfectly. The sound quality is way better than expected with crisp clear music and bass. Bluetooth works perfectly and instant connection. Feels good to wear and holds tightly. 3 pairs of ear bud sizes to fit all
1,I purchased these for a christmas gift and the receiver just loves them.  Great for working out because they resist sweat and they stay in place.
1,"The headphones are very comfortable, and the bass sounds amazing (which I didn't even know was possible for ear/headphones).  Customer service is exceptional as well.  Very quick responses and helpful.  Would recommend to others."
0,These were found defective when I attempted to use them. The charging port on the earset is rattling around inside the earpiece rendering the device inoperable. Unfortunately for me my return window has closed 14 days ago.
1,So far so good perfect fitment. Sound level is awesome. Better then my jbl that they replaced great product.
0,"What you'd expect for the price. I was enticed by great reviews but am not wowed by them. I sync them to my Series 2 Apple Watch; first time syncing was tricky but finally got them synced. The audio is terrible; I mean really bad. I just use them at the gym so I tolerate them for the time being but as soon as the ones I've been eyeing going on sale I plan to upgrade. Also, they say there is a 30' range but when walking the signal seems to cut in and out of my wrist moves behind me etc. not wonderful when working out."
0,I actually loved these....for the two days I had them until they broke. I slid them into my pockets once and the part connecting the ear piece to the plastic base broke off. I really did like them but I caution those who buy them to be careful with them as they are NOT durable
1,I've purchased 5-6 different pairs of blutooth headphones. All of the previous best sellers or top rated pairs. These are the priciest but the best so far. The battery life and sound quality are the biggest standout. They are available for next day delivery have a 1 year warranty and come with a lot of extras. These headphones alas feel sturdy. Very good pair.
0,"Update:<br />They only lasted a few months. They simply just don't work now. Wasted my money. Look elsewhere. It's a bit expensive, but Swimbuds have 3 different types of waterproof head phones for the type of water activity you are involved with. I am still happy with my Swimbuds.<br /><br />Original Review:<br />I did really well with this. I kept accidentally going underwater with it during deep water exercise. Just below the surface, but the first time, the USB jack was not closed up and nothing went wrong. I should mention that I wasn't swimming laps with it. It did come off a few times, but not to the level of being annoying. Unfortunately, I've lost it. I now have to figure out if I am going to buy that waterproof MP3 watch for a few hundred bucks or buy another one of these.<br /><br />One thing to note: I did use this outside and the range is limited to 15ft if the mp3 player is not with you. I used my phone which I kept on the side of the pool. If you do use a phone to stream music, attach the phone to a portable battery charger or your phone will start skipping the stream in about 10-15 minutes. It's just trying to conserve battery for all the tasks it's performing. This is an argument for getting the mp3 waterproof watch, btw."
1,Perfect all around.
1,"Where to start. Ordered and received in less than 36 hours. Upon delivery opened packaging, read instructions, charged, (using supplied USB cable) attached to my PC and then used headphones for a 50 minute workout.  Great sound quality and user friendly design!  Also, Senso includes a dual USB port car charger, small storage case and extra earbuds.  Tekatron CS department even emailed their direct information if problems arise.  Hopefully all goes well, for l am very pleased and look forward to purchasing many more for family members."
0,"I truly loved these headphones, and on many levels and still would if...<br />They would last for one year.  They do not and will not and I am so disappointed.<br />I bought the first pair in 2018.  Before a year was up the headphones would no longer work.  One side started cutting in am out until that side no longer worked.  Fortunately, they offered a 1 year warranty so I contacted the seller and they sent me a replacement pair.  I registered the new pair on their site for the 1 year warranty and now...9 and a half months later guess what?? The replacement pair continuously cuts itself off every 30 seconds-2minutes.  I have followed the instructions for resetting them, disconnecting them from my device and “forgetting” them and reconnecting.  I have spent a lot of time trying everything to get them to work and they just won’t.  I contacted the seller again, mentioning when I registered the new pair and they said sorry, since it was a replacement pair I wasn’t eligible for the warranty.  They didn’t tell me this when I registered this pair.<br />I won’t be buying again.  I would love if they could have lasted for JUST ONE YEAR, but I guess that’s how they get you."
1,Great for the money
0,"Arrived and was able to pair with my phone, but then would not pair with my tablet.  I &#34;factory reset&#34; by directions and that worked to reset (was no longer paired with my phone), but then would not pair with anything.  Also, the power charger port rubber was cemented in place and my wife and I could not get it out without breaking the rubber.  I called the SENSO hotline for help and they told me I was incompetent and couldn't pair the headphones, so I just returned them for a different brand."
1,"Yes, the massive reviews are accurate--these Senso Bluetooth headphones deliver! Very comfortable, connects flawlessly with my iPhone 7 Plus once paired and sound is very good at any price-point . I do not think even an audiophile would be disappointed with these wireless gems."
0,"These headphones look good and come in nice packaging. You would think they're pretty awesome. However, if you sweat too much, go 15 feet away from your phone, have an android, or are in a hot gym, they will not work optimally. Not the worst headphones I've ever owned, though. I guess they were worth it for the sale price.<br />Would not be my first recommendation if you sweat a lot and like to do dynamic workouts that require you to put your phone on the ground while you exercise. Just spend the money on a higher quality pair with better bluetooth range."
1,"These were a lot better than I was expecting, here's some pros and cons<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Great sound and bass, compared to my 50 dollar Sony over ear wired headphones, they are about 80% as good. Nice noticeable bass, not as good as said headphones, but pretty good. Highs are pretty good aswell, can definitely hear that treble. Clarity is iffy, a bit muddy but nothing that's noticeable without trying to look for flaws. It's very loud aswell.<br /><br />2. Battery is good right out the box, been listening to music ever since I got them 4 hours ago.<br /><br />3.easy to pair, just turned them on and found them in the bluetooth settings.<br /><br />4. Lots of different accessories and eartips, the small ones are the best for me. TWO DIFFERENT CHARGERS, HAIL TO MICRO USB<br /><br />5. Fit pretty well, too well actually, residual pain does occur so be ready for that, it's not their fault just the earbud design. But it does not and will not fall out.<br /><br />6. Easy controls, they are located in the right headphone.<br /><br />7. You can use Google assistant while phone is off, if you hold down the button for a second it will say voice dial but really it's just the assistant. Cool if you need a quick fact but don't want to get your phone out.<br /><br />8. Calls are pretty good, people can understand me fine on the other end.<br /><br />9. Perfect for any occasion, school, public, workouts, jogs, push ups, work and even home.<br /><br />10. Small and compact, can carry in pocket anywhere or around neck<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. They hurt your ears when you wear them for any length of time, oof my ears. Also random really high pitch noises when listening to music, unless your ears are good level like mine you won't notice.<br /><br />2. The cord is a minor inconvenience but you already know this.<br /><br />3. Some slight static noise, hardly noticeable, am I hearing things?<br /><br />4. They can't make me toast.<br /><br />Conclusion: Are these the best headphones out there? No. Can you buy a better pair for $29.97? No. Don't buy anything more expensive, unless you really want super fantastic awesome sound. Plus these come with ballin accessories that could potentially cost more than the product itself! ( I honestly don't know how they could pack so much accessories into this product, have it cost 30 bucks and it still be good quality, mind blower. I still can't find where they cut corners other than maybe the build quality, it doesn't look 100% like the picture but it does enough.) If you're on the edge between these and some more expensive but essentially the same headphones, get these."
1,"I bought these because of the reviews but the sound quality is NOT good. Too much treble and hardly any bass. Songs sound like there’s auto tune. Next time I will invest in the more expensive option, but this is ok for just watching shows."
0,"Have had mine for a year, treated gently, and not very often.  But last night, the left side started going out.  It would crackle and intermittently go on and off depending how i moved it around.  From experimenting, it appears the problem originates where the wire comes out of the right side to go to the left.  Holding the right earbud and moving it around a little would cause the left earbud to come on and go off intermittently.  I really liked these, but am definitely let down by the fact that with the little amount of use, and treating them gently over the last year that I've had them, that they would stop working properly.  It's possible that this pair somehow slipped past quality control.  I don't think I've ever had a pair of bluetooth headphones that broke down after one year, because as I've stated, I've always treated my gear very carefully and gently.  I have been using these headphones for 3-4 hours, one day a week (Fridays) for online gaming and that's it."
1,"They do work with my tablet computer, not just my smart-phone, which was a problem with a different brand that look a lot like these. Unfortunately, I cannot get them to work with my Linux laptop."
1,The product arrived on time and they work fantastic. Love the product.
1,Broke pretty easily. Only used maybe 10 times in about a month.
1,Good product.
1,I love using these headphones to jog and garden. I happen to be a person who sweats alot and these earplugs stay put! The music quality is very nice and they are easy to operate.
1,"Great value. Easy to set up. Better sound quality than comparably price headphones. And the company sends out an email after the purchase with 24/7 toll free support number, warranty info and satisfaction pledge."
1,"Great headphones.  The sound is excellent, the battery live is very good and the are quite comfortable.  I had a brief problem with them buzzing, but got an amazingly quick response from customer support with instructions on how to do a factory reset and the problem was solved.<br /><br />I lost sound in the left ear.  Wrote a note to Senso describing the issue and they sent a replacement immediately."
1,Works great!
1,The sound from the Bluetooth is top notch and still working
0,"They fit very well and the general sound is fairly good, however, it doesn't handle lows very well and I get a lot of distortion on some songs. Also, the general sound has some noise, singing lacks clarity. I would not buy these if I heard them in the store."
1,My punctual excellence servicio
1,My buds arrived on time and have worked extremely well.
1,"These are a great, reasonably priced set of headphones!  I use them for running and have always had problems with headphones staying in my ears.  These stay put and sound good!  I have had them about a year now without any issues."
1,These work great and the thing I love is that they actually stathe put in my ears while I'm running.
0,"I bought these last month and they worked great.  I used them on average 2-3 times a week.  Now they won't even turn on.  I tried the factory reset they told other reviewers to do and nothing has worked.  I took good care of them, they always went in the case after use.  Never dropped.  It is now passed the 30 day return and so I'm stuck with a useless product! I feel robbed, thanks a lot."
1,"These headphones are fantastic (but has its down side)! Great sound quality, definitely hear nothing but the music coming through. Great bass for how cheap these are. So far the only problem I can find are the hooks that are &#34;supposed&#34; to keep the headphone from falling. I read that this might be a problem when running, in the comments. However, i have yet to try them out while working out. They are definitely loose on the ears and no way to adjust. Everything else I give a 10/10 so far. When I see that the hooks become adjustable, i will rebuy and rate 5 stars."
1,works great
1,These are the best pair I own. They are in fact my second backup pair I like them so much. Great quality sound and excellent comfort. I run 75-150 miles a month and I use them every time.
1,Solid pair of headphones and great customer service
1,I've been looking for a pair for quite some time... One of my friends posted about how amazing these were and how the price was even better!! She also commented on how they were better and lasted longer than her BEATS!! So I had to &#34;see&#34; hear for myself!!! These are AMAZING!!!! Will be ordering 2 more sets 1 for my hubby the other for my teen daughter!!!
1,Sound s good and very comfortable
1,Good headphones......one ear just stopped working due to illtreatment...but good headphones overall.<br /><br />Good
0,"At first I really liked these headphones. They come with a car charger and seem to have good build quality. However, these headphones are terrible if you use them while you are active. I used them at the gym and the bluetooth was constantly cutting in and out. It happens all of the time and it doesn't matter if I restart my phone or the headphones. The sound also cuts out and there is a lot of background noise. Do not buy."
1,"These headphones are incredible!  Pairing was a snap.  The audio from these headphones is outstanding across all types of music, and they are very comfortable.  Highly recommended."
1,"This was my second pair, I loved the first pair only disappointed in the distance I could get from sound source. I found these to be the same and they broke while replacing ear buds, so I sent them back"
1,These headphones are excellent and I love that they are Bluetooth.  Shipping was very fast.
1,"Works very well out of the box. Sound is good for the price paid. Thought wire tie wasn't included but was confused by its large picture, leading me to think that it was a larger accessory part when it is actually very small. Nice I have the car charger and long charger cable, though if doing away with those resulted in lower price, I would have preferred that."
1,"Extremely happy with these Headphones! Can go pretty far 80+ feet away from the source. Sound quality give a 9 out of 10 Always room for improvement, LOL. Seriously ... nothing comes close value for the dollar; comes in a nice box and a carbon fiber &#34;Look&#34; carry case. Love the wrap around ear buds. No more tangled lines and catching the cord on stuff!!!! Could not be happier with these.<br />DAR Illinois"
1,"&#34;Lots of extras with it like, foam ear pads, case, car and phone chargers.&#34;"
0,Would not charge properly and died in mid-use when supposedly fully charged.  Odd delay in taking almost a minute of holding the on button to turn the headset on.  Do not buy this product.
1,Great value! I'm super active and this product is durable and delivers good sound quality.
1,I have lots of trouble finding headphones that fit and don't fall out when I run.  These headphones fit perfectly and I haven't had any problem with them falling out.  They are also easy to turn on and off and adjust the volume without having to constantly take them off your ears.
1,These earbuds are so nice. Work as advertised. They get loud and sound quality it great.  Thanks you.
1,It took me a few minutes to figure out where the charge port was located.  I had to learn the controls.  The earbuds are comfortable and have good sound.  After that I love it!
0,I have had issues with the left ear shortly after i received this item and finally after about six months it has stopped working. The only good thing about these earbuds is they have some of the best battery life i have seen and only reason for 2 stars.
1,"I like that they are wireless,  great sound. I was a little concerned at first because the ear loops seemed large, but it appears they will decrease to my ear size"
0,"Headphones worked good for about a month but the headphone that powers it up fell apart. I had it in my hoodie pocket and when I took it out the backing was missing. How does it just fall apart? If you look at my picture, the headphone wasn't crushed or anything, just fell off. I would still use it if it wasn't the side that powers the Damn thing."
1,"I've had these bad boys for quite some time and they've held up. Shoot, these headphones have been through it all. From flights, to camping, kayaking, and running (from bugs of course lol). These suckers are the best! I love how they can hold a charge for hours!! And they're so durable! They're easy to charge and have a convenient carrying case. I've had a couple of friends but these and they've thanked me for the recommendation. The Beats from Dr. Dre are good but these are just as good if not better, cause I don't want to pay an arm and leg for the same quality! But hey, that's just me. Anywho, this product is Sheila Approved!"
1,Received headphones in a timely manner. Product works really well.
1,"Great product!  So far, these are the best ear buds I have purchased.  I have had three different styles and these are it for me.  Comfortable and the battery lasted about eight hours.  Just like they said.  I also love the USB charge cord, etc.  I have an older car and this will be very handy to have."
1,"Got these for Father’s Day 3 years ago.  They’ve been left out in the rain, the dog ate them and they’re still the best headphones I’ve ever owned.  Sadly, they’re finally starting to fade and not having the controls (that my dog chewed off) is cumbersome when running.  I recommend these to everyone that is looking for headphones, you won’t find better ones for the price."
1,Great battery 🔋 life/ mediocre sound quality. rating ⭐️⭐️⭐️
1,The sound is much better than any earbuds I've used. They're surprisingly comfortable. They're also durable and well-made. I'm very happy with the purchase.
1,Nothing! I love it!
1,"These are a good deal for the price. The sound qulaity is great with phone calls, apps, and music. The ear pieces are the most comfortable ones I've ever owned."
1,Sounds good as long as you do not max out the volume
1,"I bought these to use in bed. I prefer headphones but cannot lay my head on a pillow. So my four stars is only because of my personal choice.<br />The buds fit well once you figure out what size adapters to use for your ears. The sound is great and they are comfortable in bed.<br />You need to pay attention to charging, one charge usually last me two to three days. I have gotten in the habit of plugging them in when I get up in the morning."
1,Very comfortable and easy to use. They sound great and work well. Price is unbelievable for what you get. Highly recommend these!! Lasts hrs on end and are very durable.
1,Love them.
1,Great product. !  speedy delivery
1,"Only have had these a few days so far, but so far so good!  The sound is excellent and I'm hoping for a lot of use out of them.  We had Beats wireless before this but they really didn't last that long and we weren't paying that ridiculous price again.  The Senso's were a great price!"
0,Did not like the adjustable ear holders.
1,"I'm very pleased with the quality for the price. I even bought a second pair for my wife. The headphones are great and as advertised. Hopefully they last, but so far I have no reason to believe they won't! I have a little trouble with the right ear staying put, but unless it's an over the ear headphone I have always had this problem."
1,Enjoying them
1,They work great.  Met my expectations.
1,Perfect for price range. Great sound. Decent base. Plenty of options for comfort.
1,So far i have only used them once but the one time i have used these they have been great.
1,Works as described and the price was right. Passive noise cancelling means they block out noise by filling you ear holes. Don't be confused that this is actually doing anything that putting your head under a pillow doesn't do.
0,"These headphones worked great for a few months. Then I had an intense workout with a lot of sweat and they died. They dried out and worked again until my next workout with lots of sweat, then they died again. They have yet to come back on. I am disappointed."
0,Bluetooth connection to phone/watch deteriorated over a few months to where now it does not work when device is in my pocket.
0,Stopped working in less than a month
0,These headphones look great and the packaging and extra items included were awesome but these headphones are NOT for active wear. They never stayed in my ear while I was working out or running and when I began to sweat they just got worse. The flaps that hang over the ear do absolutely nothing. I wonder if the folks at Senso even test these products before the bring them to market. Sadly I will be returning these.
1,"I wouldn't say I'm well versed in head phones these are the first blue tooth ear buds I have tried but I'm very happy with my purchase. These head phones are easy to use, comfortable, and have good sound."
1,Very prompt delivery and I am thrilled with these bluetooth headphones.  They are just what I was wanting.
0,Not happy with my product. When at the gym and I had my phone in my pocket the Bluetooth would cut out making the music sound choppy. Reallly ruined the workout. Not satisfied
1,Sound through the headphones are great. They fit well and the battery last very long.
1,"So far,  I am very satisfied with these.  Had an LG headset that stopped working after the second use.  These are more comfortable and more suitable for exercise."
1,"Product works as expected. I am pleased with this purchase. Since I wear glasses, its important that the earbuds stay securely on."
1,"They're decent. The quality is a bit tinny, but not terrible. Sometimes issues connecting via bluetooth, but works most of the time. Generally stays in my ears well.<br /><br />I find it's good for listening to one ear bud as I bike to work. The button is nice and big so I can pause even with gloves on."
0,Better options available for this price. Not ergonomically designed and sounds very choppy.
1,nice
1,"Great sound, bass, quick charging, decent quality headphones for the price , can't complain!"
1,"Sounds good, but they don't stay in place when making exercise. somehow uncomfortable."
1,"I loved them!  The uses for the gym and the sound is great, they are super comfortable."
1,"I use my headphones for working out, running and biking. The different size ear pieces make it easy to keep the headphones in my ears and the bendable ear hooks allow for a tight fit (I've had problems with other ear phones falling out to easily, especially when running). I listen to podcasts and books on tape and the quality is clear. Also like the button placement. The sweat proof feature is a plus for me as I look like I've been exploring a tropical rain forest, sweat wise, by the end of a work out. I had a problem with my headphones no longer charging after 7 months and contacted the dealer. They walked me through a couple of possible fixes over the phone and when they solve the problem, they sent a new pair which arrived in a few days. This was a no-hassel replacement process which I greatly appreciated. Would buy again from this dealer."
1,"These headphones are awesome!! I previously had purchased a bunk pair of TRELAB XR500 headphones that I felt were &#34;better&#34; because of reviews and value, however, after 2 months of everyday 6HR use they fell apart! I got these yesterday and they are more clear, responsive, and the battery lasts 90 min longer. If you are looking for a good cheap pair of headphones these are an absolute must! Better than any PowerBeats! I never review either."
1,"At first I was scared to buy em because I thought the sound quality would be bad if they only cost $22. But I love the sound it makes, it's high quality for just a $22 headphone. Battery life is very long and included in the box it's way more then just $22 in my opinion"
0,"I used my headphones for about six months, on and off, until out of the blue they stopped working. They were kept in their zip container away from everything between gym visits. I would save your money and buy something more reputable."
1,Amazing sound for price ..quality and the stuff that goes with it case and goodie make this amazing ..one slite flutter to great ...is the sheer size is big on ear compared to others..but yeah it's very well done
1,wish the volume would go up higher but they great. battery last my 8hr work day. i put them on the charger for my 30 min lunch. as far as how far i can walk away from my phone i would say 5 feet.
1,Headphones are awesome. Very comfortable 3 spare rubber earbud tips. Nice case to keep them in and includes a charging cord. And a couple other things that were a surprise that I enjoyed.
1,"I bought these to use in the office and to exercise. The bass is awesome. I currently have the volume on low, maybe 25% of the full sound volume bar and it is loud. I can just barely hear a very low murmur of sound around me. I have not tried the mic yet, but that feature was not a deciding factor for me."
1,Really great workout bluetooth earbuds at a good price.  They were super easy to pair with my phone and very comfortable to wear.  So far so good.
1,"My husband ordered these actually. We’ve always spent $80+ on headphones, just for them to break within a year so we decided to get something cheaper. So far these seem pretty great. He says they are Comfortable and the sound quality is impeccable. Definitely 5 star worthy. Sadly, my ears are to small so there’s no way I can’t get them to fit and stay. Thankfully, they are my husbands lol."
1,"&#34;Great Product — I own the PowerBeats3 and use them religiously for workout and travel and needed a pair of earbuds for my commute and work but didn’t want to spend what it would cost to get another pair.. I would get these before buying the PowerBeats, Bose or other high end brands.&#34;"
1,I love these headphones!  They have great sound and are light weight. Also came with great carrying case!
1,"Great headphones. Has a small microphone which is great for answering phone calls. I use for podcasts, those with more discriminating tastes might be disappointed in quality, but they serve my needs. I would recommend these headphones."
1,"Quality good, but doesn't react on skype and viber"
1,"Bought these in July 2017. Survived trips to Ireland, Houston (through Harvey), and Italy. I get back to campus at Prairie View (about an hour outside of Houston) and the left earbud's sound begins to fade in and out, or cut off completely. Now only the right earbud works, unfortunately. Outside of that main issue, these are a solid pair of headphones; nothing to write home about, but good enough to get some use out of (or for people to mistake them for Beats). The only other minor issue is that the included foam noise-canceling ear tips are poor."
1,I bought two pairs of these because of the reviews and the price.  I was not disappointed.  They get loud and have very good bass.
1,"Fantastic  Especially for the price. Comes with a car charger, charging cord and a free Apple iPhone charger- not sure why. Great value.  Actually amazing value."
1,"I DON'T CARE WHAT ANYONE ELSE THINKS ABOUT THESE HEADPHONES,I BOUGHT IT JUNE 28 2017 AND THEY ARE STILL PERFECT<br />I DO LANDSCAPING SO YOU KNOW IT GETS A BEATING IN THAT HOT SUN.A MUST HAVE PRODUCT 100%"
1,Excellent headphones
1,"Fantastic headphones. These work better than my beats and are less than $30. This is the best purchase you'll make this year! I've had three pairs of the Powerbeats Wireless 2 and 3 and these are comparable. Not as much bass, but I prefer it that way. LOVE LOVE."
1,Great set of wireless headphones and were delivered a day earlier than confirmed.
1,Great value for the price.
0,"These worked really well at first.  I was underwhelmed by the sound quality, but hey for $35 I wasn't complaining.  After a few months the connectivity started to decline.  They cut out a lot even when they are right next to my iphone 7.<br />Senso support had me do a reset which helped a little bit, but I don't think any cutting out is acceptable - bluetooth technology has been around for a long time.  They are willing to replace but not refund.  So I will give the new set a try, but don;t have high hopes"
1,I have bought similar items with this one and the quality of the material is much better in this one. It is the perfect weight for you not to feel like you will drop them. The price for this one was just  a little higher but it is definitely worth it.
0,I am slightly disappointed with Senso headphones.  Not quite what I expected. I battled with keeping the left earpiece in my ear whilst running.  It did not fit securely and I find that the ear flaps are a bit useless.<br /> I am yet to still try the soft red foam buds in my ears ...but I really did not quite favor those too when on my other headphones. The sound quality was not much quality either.... Very deep and almost low and flat with no richness in stereo quality when connected to my ipod.  It pairs well to Bluetooth.
1,"I love this headphones except when I use them as bluetooth for a phone people complain about hearing an echo as they talk. I have tried to do a factory reset, which  helps for a little bit, but is only a temporary fix as the headphones soon pick up the echo again."
1,"Fast shipping, quality product, great sound and comes with a few extras that are kind of neat. For the price it’s defi a good buy. If I HAD to pick something that wasn’t great about them, for me personally after wearing them for an hour or so my ears are pretty sore. Something about them, regardless of which ear buds/pads I’m wearing just doesn’t fit quite perfect in my ear, but it’s nothing bad enough to where I won’t use them."
1,"Excellent sound quality, and they fit very very comfortably in the ears.  Great product and a great price!!  These are perfect while working out."
1,"So far, extremely happy with this product, hopefully it lasts longer than regular headphones."
1,"Excellent for in the gym, but there was a lot of wind when running outside. I do most of my workouts inside so I really love using  these!"
1,"The BASS! These little guys really give a lot of bass for their size, and they block out almost all background noise, but one of the buds regularly slips out of my ear, especially once I start sweating at the gym. Also they seem to wake up and connect to my phone if I move them, so took one star off cause that drains the battery"
1,Love these headphones ! Comes in super clear and the battery life lasts me all day. Plus they are super comfortable!! I recommend them for sure!
0,Absolutely garbage. Sounds quality is tinny when it stays connected. Battery lasts no longer than 90 minutes. It doesn't stay connected to my phone in my pocket (Blu hdr1) yet all my other blue tooth devices work as expected. This is my first 1 star review. Don't waste your money like I did.
1,Just got these today but I’m am super impressed. Great quality. Connected right up. Love the foam tips! They fit super secure. Also comes with 3 different sized regular tips. My only issue is the unadjusted eq. It’s totally lacking highs and some mids so if your planning on using these for a music app like amazon music or pandora which don’t have an equalizer function these aren’t for you. I ended up downloading Spotify and with a few adjustments to the built in equalizer these things are perfect. I haven’t tested the waterproof side of things but I don’t plan on ever needing it.
1,I ordered one set for my daughter.  Then my granddaughter complained.  I proceeded to order a second set.  Both girls seem to be happy now.
1,Great Sound stays in your ears battery lifespan is really good
1,"The size options for the buds themselves are fantastic! My number one issue with others I've tried. The sound is good and noise cancellation is great! I love having the strap, front or back. Great buy for me!"
1,"I'm quite happy with this purchase, these headphones work surprisingly well."
1,"I am hard of hearing and this was my best hope for really good sound quality. After looking at other reviews, many said it sounded amazing and the sound was only at 50% volume. I figured this would be too good to be true at this price. I figured, what a steal! It came in and the packaging looked great. I took them out of the case which comes with everything as shown in the product images. I paired them with my Samsung S7 and it paired immediately. Then I put them on and for me, it was not as comfortable as I hoped for. I changed out the ear buds and it then felt better.<br /><br />Time for the music! I eagerly then browsed through my songs looking for one with the right amount of bass and rhythm and found the perfect song. I started playing it at 50% volume and my expectations came crashing down. The sound was very muffled and i figured I'll boost it up. At 70%, the sound was obviously there but the lyrics were not clear and still muffled.Then brought it to 100% and it sounded tinny. Not clear at all and muffled. For those that praise this, it works for you but if you are hard of hearing, I highly recommend going with Bose, Beats, Sennheiser, or Sony headphones because those have always sounded crisp and very clear to me. Although they are more on the expensive side, it is will worth the value whereas these only led to disappointment. You do not know until you try though!"
1,"I bought a pair of these and had them for about a month before I lost them. I liked them enough that I bought a replacement pair. The sound is decent on these headphones. To get good base out of them you have to really have them plugged into your ears.  I had no issues getting them hooked up to my phone (Samsung Galaxy S5). They can hurt the cartilage in your ear after wearing them for an extended period. The first pair I ordered came with a case, extra ear buds, a short usb charging cable, a long usb charging cable with an adapter for USB C on the end, and a car charger. The second pair came with a short usb charging cable, and a magnetic phone holder that was missing parts. The case for the second one also reeked of stale cigarette smoke, as did the headphones themselves. It took about two weeks for the headphones to stop stinking. The case was simply a matter of spraying it with Febreze until it didn't reek anymore.<br /><br />While I am disappointed with the different items included with the second set I ordered, and with the stink of cigarette smoke, the headphones themselves are good enough to warrant only taking one star away."
1,Fit great and sound amazing!!!
0,Quality was ok for few weeks and after that it became so bad.
1,"Ive only had these a few hours and they sound awesome!!  I own and have owned many pairs trying to find not only a quality solid sound but a comfortable fit that I can wear for 2-3  or more hours With technology ever changing my old powerbeats are getting left behind, plus they have issues. These have excellent sound w bass that beat my beats, they may 'break in' to sound better the controls are simple enough. Pairing w my iPhone 6 was a snap With the weight being extremely light combined with very soft ear hooks these should be able to be worn with out the ear fatigue ive experienced w others after just an hour.  These came w a nice case various ear tips a lightning/mini charger wire and a cigarette plug base! For under 35$  yeah an easy five stars! They we're very well packaged as if the company is proud of there product as a company should be! I usually wear earbuds for hours a day so the duribility will be tested soon. (I guess I will find out about the brain tumor my oldest daughter says I'm going to get from Bluetooth too lol) For what it's worth I put comply ear tips on these, but I use them on all my ear buds."
1,"Great Headset, Use It To Workout At The Gym With No Problems, Great Battery Life."
1,"Ordered about six weeks ago, and have worked great. Recently experienced sound loss in one of the earbuds, and after reaching out to the seller, I was quickly provided with directions to conduct a re-calibration of the set without having to send in or replace! Great service to say the least!"
1,These headphones worked wonderfully for about 6 months when they suddenly refused to charge.  Customer service was prompt and helpful in offering me troubleshooting options and honoring the 1-year warranty.
1,People can't hear me and say I sound like Im in a tunnel.  Used best if just listening to music
1,"Amazing bass. Almost to much. Almost. These things thump.<br />These are comfortable, the controls are easy to get used to, the battery lasts a long time and they sound great."
1,"Everything I hoped they would be and more! The sound is outstanding, and I listen to a lot of songs with Bass so I was hoping that these headphones would live up to the positive reviews that I read on these, and they definitely exceeded my expectations. These wireless headphones are my FIRST EVER pair that I have ever owned and I wanted to get a pair with truly good sound quality as well as a good price and these were an amazing buy for me because I wanted to make sure I could hear all the background instruments as well as a good fit. I have very small ears and normally regular headphones always seem to fall out, but these fit my little bitty ears like a glove! So happy with not only the product, but the extra's that came along with it including the dual carport charger, the extra pairs of ear plugs, the awesome case, etc. If you are looking to buy a pair of outstanding quality wireless headphones at an AWESOME price THESE Bluetooth headphones are a MUST. Now I understand why they are backed up as an Amazon recommended purchase. I have only had them for about a week, but I am extremely pleased with them and glad they accommodate to my music loving experience :)"
1,"So far, I love them. They are comfortable and loud enough to play my drums. I was tired of a cord head set, so these are working great so far.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Will Dillard"
1,My daughter works out and uses them almost daily. What she likes best is the sound quality and the fit.  The only complaint is they are not good for making calls.  If you make a call it picks up all the noise around you and the other person can't hear you.
1,"These are great headphones.  They sound great, comfortable to wear and are super light weight.  You get a kit as well full of accessories..i would buy these again."
0,"Bought this mostly for around the house when doing chores like cleaning the yard and so on. I have Samsung S8 and for whatever reason the headphones kept cutting in and out. I have tried other wireless headphones and haven't had that issue. I bought another pair of these, and the same thing kept happening. Besides that the sound quality is pretty bad below average for what I'm used to. Even for the price (which is low) I don't recommend, spend the extra money and get some good sounding headphones. You do get what you pay and this is no different."
1,"I was skeptical of how good the sound would match up to my other headphones, so I tested them out.<br /><br />Wired, Apple headphones as my &#34;low quality&#34; competitor. Wired, on the ear Kraken headset as my &#34;high quality&#34; competitor. These headphones were miles ahead of the Apple heaphones in terms of sound quality, and nearly as good as my headset. The highs sounded great, but there was a noticeable difference in bass quality. The bass was still heard quite well, but of course not as earthshatteringly low as in my headset.<br /><br />Also, there was no lag when watching videos and using these headphones. If any sync issue between video and sound would have been seen, these would be an insta-return.<br /><br />So, overall these were a great purchase. Solid sound, waterproof, no lag, they stay in my ears while running, what else could I ask for?"
1,Arrived sooner than expected. Great sound quality.
0,"Used it in 5 work outs, charged them, brought to gym only to find the headphones dead. Completely dead. No amount of charging or holding and pushing power button does anything. Hope your experience is better."
1,"They are excellent but they broke three days after receiving them.<br /><br />Edit: Company responded to my email within 24 hours, offered to replace the headphones, and gave me a discount for my troubles. I have been using the new headphones for over 3 days and they are working well so far, no issues. As long as they keep working, they will easily become my favorite headphones for working out and listening to music wirelessly."
1,"Arrived to the game late, my first pair of Bluetooth headphones, and I'm happy with the quality and ease of setup and use."
0,"Comfortable. Easy to set up. However, only clear audio when holding my phone in my hand. Starts breaking up as soon as it gets into my pocket or a case."
1,"I like the sound quality of this product. For the price price you pay for them you actually get a great sound. Yes, they need to work a little more on noise cancellation, but they work well. I’m sure that with time they will eventually better this headphones!"
1,For music and talking on the phone works great.
0,"They work great with very high fidelity and clean bass.  Pair with ipod at least 30 ft away at gym and hold charge for Loved them UNTIL they STOPPED working and will not charge. No red/blue indicator light!<br />This is the THIRD replacement pair Senso has sent me and they ALL had the same problem as the first pair I bought.<br />Tried to recharge on several different chargers and charger wires, to no avail."
1,"Very comfortable, easy to use and great sound quality."
1,"Good speakers! The foam pieces are great for comfort! And canceling noise! I paid $30.00.. But right now they are lightning deal, so purchase... Plus, customer service is fantastic!  ***update... my set broke within 6 months, so The awesome customer service team are sending me a new pair. One day they just cut out... well.... 5 stars for the customer service team! And 4 stars for the product."
1,I like them so much I've just ordered a set for my husband.
0,Stopped working after month. Purchased warranty but does not have option to return product. How can I retrieve my warranty?
0,"201708 used for less than 2 weeks. For similar price range this one is still rather bulky with great sound if earbuds stay in the ears.<br />Wire hanging on the neck, plugs are coming slightly out from the ear which makes a huge difference in sound.<br />Also, if you exercise the excess wire will rub against the neck pulling out slughtly either of the earbud (at least for me).<br /><br />Plus for controls and plus for water resistant (if true), battery time and quick to connect."
1,For the price these are nice. Loud wind resistance when running but I am still pleased.
1,Awesome customer service! Love the headphones as well
1,Bought as a gift for my husband. He loves them!
1,"We always runbafter big brands but expensice things,<br />However this product proven us all wrong !!<br />It is one of the most amazin m earphones i ever used if it is not the best !!!<br />Qjlite of material sound value of money every thing is imppresive diffeantly buy it !!<br /><br />The only draw back nowdays that they dont ship it internationaly any more.. all mybfriends want to buy it again but it dose not ship"
0,"Had high hopes for these, but they are really lacking. It loses connection..<br /><br />The wrap aspect is just &#34;decoration&#34; as they are basically held in wit the cushion in the ear.<br /><br />If you move, you lose the sound, or the stereo effect.<br /><br />Definitely would not buy again.<br /><br />I waited to post this review, hoping I could get the right fit, but didnt happen."
1,"Purchased these headphones in June and love them. Clear sound and comfortable to wear. Started having trouble connecting with phone and was past the return window with Amazon. Contacted Senso support at Invotek, and they offered instructions to reset headphones which did not fix the problem. They immediately processed shipment of new headphones. Great customer service."
1,Great headphones!! Quality - great sounds and really great battery life
1,"Comfortable, sound great and block quite a bit of background noise. I would purchase again."
0,Some days I love these headphones and then there are others like today where they are fully charged and I’m in good wifi and they click on and off and are constantly disconnecting. Disappointing<br /><br />Edit: And now less than a year later they are totally broken. Won’t turn on and won’t charge
1,"Product came with cool magnet accessory clip for vehicle. Sound is adequate, not great. Little to no noise cancellation. I used comply foam ear tips which helps significantly for comfort. Battery life is fine for my needs (I only use for the gym or running). Overall, prob the best wireless buds in the $20-$30 range. Gonna need to spend more $ to get better sound quality. Am satisfied with my purchase."
1,Great sound!
1,Great pair of headphones. I use them for running and also for leisure and they are awesome. Great sound and fit.
0,Bluetooth not light<br />Today my Senso start not working correctly.<br />I not listen  message &quot;Power ON Connected&quot; and &quot;Power OFF&quot;<br />Cheers
1,GREAT
0,uncomfortable and very bad sound quality
1,"I've had this set of earbuds for about 10 months now and use them mainly for listening to audio books, music and for phone calls.  I own two sets of Senso earbuds (S-250 and S-300) and am very happy with both.  They have very good battery life and charge quickly.  They come with various size fittings for ears including a foam set that works really nice as well as a nice zip up carrying case.  In addition, they have a one year warranty.  When one of my sets began to fail, I contacted customer support through their website (during the weekend) and provided my Amazon order ID.  They verified my warranty and processed a replacement shipment immediately.  It's been a great experience overall.  I would definitely recommend these earbuds and the company in general."
1,I brought the headphones for my wife. She loves them.
0,Terrible
1,Initially had some issues with it. Now it's just fine
1,Great product and great price. Easy set up nice sound quality and it lasts all day while I'm working.
1,It's works well as a headset for media but it's not that great on phone calls. There seems to be a high amount of noise especially on windy days.
1,"These headphones are decent for use in situations where you may not care much for audio quality, such as working out, running, cycling, doing yard, etc. They fit extremely well and are very comfortable to wear. However, when it comes to sound quality, they aren't very good. The treble is pretty much non-existent and the bass is way too boomy. Using this with my phone, I had to mess with my audio player's equalizer to get them sounding acceptable, but that will only take effect in the audio player. Any other apps I may be using while also using the headphones will sound pretty bad. If you have the ability to mess with an equalizer, these are fine for the price. However, I have a pair of $12 wired Skullcandy earbuds that sound better than these without needing to mess with an equalizer. I'm really only keeping these because they are bluetooth and I need something with no cables while doing yard work and cycling."
1,"Love these headphones for running. Great value. Super comfortable, great sound, charge lasts FOREVER."
1,"Surprisingly amazing. I had low expectations, but these really work better than most others I've tried. Very satisfied."
0,"I purchased these headphones because it looked like a deal too good to be true.. well it was. I changed out the ear tips and they don't cancel out noise. Because I can't get them to fit properly they make a popping sound when I run, which is extremely irritating and makes me hate cardio more than I already do. They also don't cancel out noise effectively when I lay down while lifting weights. I bought them several months ago and thought I could stick it out but I purchased another brand of headphones today and will see if my boyfriend has the same issues with these."
1,"Easy to connect and the sound is fantastic. Much better than the apple ear buds I'm used to using.  I'll have to play with the different sized earbuds to see which one fits my ear better, but otherwise is a very good buy."
1,These Rock! Are waterproof. Booming sound.  Mic works great for calls. Connects easily. Great sound quality. Would have thought they were $100 headphones
0,Poor sound quality. They broke after the 3rd use. Don't waste your money.
1,"Iphone 7 and 7 plus perfect solution! You won't miss your wired headphones after you get a set of these amazing and inexpensive Bluetooth headphones! Allows you to charge your phone and talk at the same time. Great sound quality, long battery life and no more stressing out about not being a able to charge your phone while talking. I actually cut off the price that goes over your ear for a less nerdy look! You will never want to use wired headphones after you get these! After you use this technology you will see Apple made the right decision to eliminate headphone jack. They have always been at the forefront of technology progress and this is just another push for people into the latest technology which happens to be wireless."
1,"I'm someone who usually just uses whatever headphones come with my phone but I finally decided it was time to get a higher quality set, and I'm glad I chose these! The sound quality is amazing, I was able to hear parts of songs I didn't even know were there before. They're a little bulky but still really comfortable (I have several ear peircing like my tragus and cartilage and these don't bother them at all). My only complaint is that it took a while for them to pair with my phone and I had to do a bit of finagling, but I finally got them working. Great purchase overall!"
1,"Never had Bluetooth headset, I will say that they are easy to pair and sound is great, like very much and the cord between ear buds don't tangle ."
1,For under $30 they work great!!!
0,"There is more sound on the right side then on the left, it was not worth the money I spent."
1,VERY HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT THANK YOU
1,Excellent product. Very comfortable and great sound. You wear these and forget you have them on.
1,These headphones are literally perfect for the price. My favorite set of headphones yet.
1,They're better than the beats!! Love them!!
1,Finally found blue tooth that has great stereo for music and excellent clarity when talking on phone. Thank you!
1,Works great so far best 40 I every spent☺️
1,"I absolutely love these. I'm an avid runner and no matter how long run these stay put and don't hurt my ears. It's not only the quality of the product but the accessories are also wonderful. They come with different size ear buds which helps as I have small ears and struggle with larger buds. The price was great as well as the follow up from the sellers. I recommend these if you truly workout, build up a serious sweat but need the musical motivation."
0,"Absolute garbage - died in less than 90 days. Never went even 2 full hours on a charge and declined rapidly from there. Range was very limited. I should get money money back, I certainly don't want a replacement. Don't buy them!!!"
0,"I have had these headphones for about 4 months. I have used them probably at least 4 times per week, much of which has been on runs and bike rides. They worked fairly well at first, but recently I have been having issues:<br />-The charging indicator hasn't been working, so I'm not sure if they're charging or not when plugged in.<br />-They have starting to lose signal repeatedly while on bike rides, to the point where eventually they just connect/disconnect constantly so that the audio doesn't have time to come through for more than a second.<br />-They no longer connect to my laptop.<br />It seems that they are just starting to fail in general, and soon won't be usable. I don't know if this is a common issue for this product or if mine just happens to be defective. The return-by date has passed, and I'm not sure about the warranty policy, if there is one. I will probably just buy new headphones from a different company."
1,Bought these for my son.  He said he loved them
0,worked great for the whole 1 day that they stayed together they the outer ear piece came apart just with every day usage.
1,"This is a great pair of COMFORTABLE, Bluetooth earbuds. The sound quality is great despite not being noise cancelling (my preference for outdoor exercise.) The over the ear clips are great. I don't feel like I've got anything on or in my ear."
1,Works as advertised...great sound!
0,"This is my second pair of these headphones. I use them daily on the construction site so they’re not necessarily getting an easy life. The first pair I couldn’t have wished for better. Obviously nothing is going to last forever. However, my second pair had issues only a few weeks after receiving them and only lasted 3 months before it became impossible to turn them on anymore. Will there be a 3rd pair? Not without trying something else first."
1,"I'm really enjoying my Senso bluetooth headphones.  The sound quality is actually very good.  It only takes about an hour to fully charge them and they last a good 8 hours on a charge.  Included with the headphones were different size ear buds, a carrying case, and a magnetic car holder for your phone.  The different size ear buds were a nice bonus.  I was able to change the size and they fit perfectly in my ear with no slippage at all.  These are great headphones for the a good price."
1,"Good headphones, recommendable!"
1,They lasted a little over a year then quit charging. That’s pretty good for my usage. Seems like that’s as long as I can make them last as this was my second pair purchased that lasted about that long. I wish they would have lasted longer but for the price can’t really complain too much. Probably will buy again and expect 1 more year of service.
1,Super happy with these earphones. They seem to be very well made and sound great.
1,"Bought these for both my husband and I to use while we work out, and we both LOVE, LOVE, LOVE them. He's thanked me 20 times for getting them, and we've only had them for a week, lol. If anything comes up, I'll update again, but they were a great find for us thus far!"
1,"I actually washed them through the washer/dryer, they still work!<br /><br />battery life could be better, but gym workouts are now simpler... no need to worry about phone wires etc."
1,"Comfortable ear phones, easy to use , and fantastic sound. Great headphones for the price."
1,"Pretty good sound, comfortable secure fit and many different ear head sizes and styles for your best fit and comfort. Good quality and price. While Beats earbuds might sound slightly better, $37 vs $130... plus I've seen a lot of scams on phony beats earbuds. The Bluetooth phone feature works well even with the Mic up by your ear.<br /><br />The only thing I wish was different, is to be able to use the multi function button to access siri/voice commands on your phone for hands free dialing."
1,Great sound quality and noise cancellation. Best &#34;cheap&#34; pair of wireless headphones I've ever had.
1,"Great sound (good bass), lightweight, perfect for exercise"
1,I've had other bluetooth headphones that kept falling out of my ears - these stay in place and are comfortable.  Very happy with my purchase and I'd buy them again.
1,Very easy to use with good quality!
1,"Bought these to watch TV without using TV speakers.  These are not high end headphones, but they work well.  A little uncomfortable if you are lying on your side."
0,"Did not fit in my ears at all, tried all the ear pieces and they just wouldn't stay. They also weren't comfortable at all. Returned for different Bluetooth headphones 👍"
0,"Sent mine back - not sure if a product defect or false advertising. There is no noise canceling whatsoever on these. I own several other pairs of noise canceling earbuds/headphones and am familiar with the technology. Also, these are bulky. I ended up returning these and getting the TaoTronics Bluetooth in-hear headphones. They aren't perfect either but a better product.<br /><br />The other issue is that the car charger that comes with it did not work properly. Tried it in 2 cars.<br /><br />I did like the control options on this one."
0,"I bought this ones 2 months ago, the quality of the headphones is pretty good but suddenly it's stop to works, the battery appears to be charged with the blue light, but when I try to turn it on it does nothing. I'm very upset with it."
1,"This product has been great. Holds a charge for a long time, recharging is quick (1 1/2 hrs). Great sound quality and easy to pair with my I-Phone SE. I like the fact that this has a one year warranty and a customer service number if you need assistance. I would certainly buy this again."
1,overall very good headphones...
1,They work well. Nice features and great sound.
1,There ok I don't think there hd quality headphone you get what you pay for.
0,sound quality sucks.
1,"Okay, so for the price and items it comes with is a good deal, but the earbuds itself, well let's say the sound isn't all that great, when it says the bass is good, yeah but it's really fuzzy, if you're a person like me that really likes music with a good sound and really enjoy it, these aren't the earbuds for you. [Edit] Okay so if you read their comment below they told me how to reset it, and it actually works, it sounds like my earpods from apple wow amazing!"
1,"Easy setup, different sized ear buds, cute carrying case, plenty of charging equipment including a car charger, music is very clear, easy to use. Can't say enough...perfect for my workouts"
1,"Only used them three times so far, but they are great. Wireless works well, I've been able to get as much as 5 feet away from source. Have yet to test the Waterproof aspect."
1,"Excellent quality sound,everything works properly only time will tell if they hold up well to moisture and shock from my workouts."
0,These don’t work after 10 uses. I tried to fully charge and they won’t even turn on now.
1,They work great.  Stay in the ear without a struggle.
1,Ok zipper on case broken
1,My sons bought two pairs in different colors & they both have really liked them.
1,"Just got them last week, but so far I like them. The fit comfortably and the sound quality is good.<br />I had a pair of Toshiba earphones and the ""control"" mechanism was on the wire in between the left and right earphone and when I ran it would bounce off my neck. Anyway the Senso earphone have the ""control"" mechanism inside the right earphone so it does not bounce off my neck when I run.<br /><br />So after one week, I'm very happy with them. And if they last over a year with almost daily use then I would buy them again."
1,I bought these earphones for my spouse. He really likes it. The quality is good. The only negative is the left ear bud keeps coming out every time he runs. Otherwise its fine.
1,Terrific buy.  Worth the money.
1,Work as promised. For the price they're hard to beat.
1,Great product! Lost first pair and got another!
1,"It was a toss up as to whether I would replace my iPhone's cabled earbuds or whether I would venture into the world of cableless bluetooth. I'm glad that I did. The SENSO Bluetooth Headphones paired easily and quickly with my iPhone 7. I'd read that after market , non-Apple headphones and earbuds sometimes have trouble pairing with the iPhone. Not a hitch. I was quickly impressed with the sound of these little things. I'm much happier than I was with the original equipment that came with the iPhone."
1,Good sound and they stay on my ears. I have a tragus piercing that prevents most buds from staying in my ears. But these stay in my ears even when I am running at the gym. Buttons are easy to use and I have no problems with connectivity.
1,Great headphones! Have not had to adjust them at all while running which is key.
0,"These headphones do not work as advertised.  I use them to exercise in, so they do get sweat on them but they have never been submersed in water.  After about 4 weeks of use the headphones stop working.  Senso support will send you a replacement pair, which will break after 4 weeks of use.  Then, when you report that the headphones broke again, support will not respond.  So, I bought a second pair on Amazon and the exact same thing happened - worked for 4 weeks, stopped working, got a replacement pair that stopped working, and then Senso support doesn't respond.  These headphones are prove the saying that &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; - cheap, crappy headphones and poor support service from Senso."
1,These are much better than Beats. The placement of the control button is on the ear plug. Therefore no sweat would ever damage them. The sound quality is excellent. The price is right.
1,I really like this headset  when it comes to my music. I work in a noisy  environment  and the sound quality is very good. On the other hand  it  does not have noise canceling  ability so it picks up all the background  noise. I have owned 4 different  lg headsets. The sound quality of the  Senso headset is just as good If not better.
1,"Excelente presentacion y funcionalidad, el producto es más de lo esperado, calidad y mejoría en el sonido inigualable a los headphone ya utilizados. Muy buen producto."
1,Better design than the other around the neck bluetooth headphones. It's probably the flat cord. This design is more durable. I'm a gardener and put these things through hell. Great purchase.
1,"Great for the price you can usually find these for. The over-ear loops are a little big for my ears with no way to adjust, but the sound quality is good (all things considered, they don't compare to better brands obviously) and the battery lasts all week for daily 1-hour work outs."
1,"I didn’t want to buy $200 headphones so I went for these and I haven’t been disappointed. I’ve had them for over a year now and they’ve held up great. The sound is great, they connect easily, the battery life is decent and they’re lightweight. If you’re looking for an affordable pair of headphones that won’t disappoint, you’ve found them."
1,Great for a quick run or trip to the gym good value
0,Good product but when lifting weights ( no sudden movements) they will skip or break up for a second. My cord earbuds never do this. Must be a Bluetooth problem.
0,"I purchased these headphones because of the amazing reviews, however not impressed!! The headphones fell out multiple times while running and every time I would reposition I hit the pause button due to it's location on the headphones. The ear pieces are not adjustable and are made one-size-fits-all, however they would work better for a person with much larger ears. Would not recommend this product!"
1,"I purchased this product based solely off the price and customer reviews and I must say that I am totally pleased with my purchase. This product arrived the next day after ordering it on Sat, it was here by noon on Sunday and the headphones were easy to set up and work perfect. The only thing I would suggest is to buy an armband for your cell phone if using it with that. The sound will cut in and out with your phone in your pocket, however in defense of this product that also happened with every other similarly priced Bluetooth headphones I purchased."
1,"These are my first an only set of Bluetooth ear buds. So I can't compare them to others but I can compare them to my corded setup and these are superior.<br /><br />So far I have found the sounds to as good or better than my Sienhauser  corded set.  Battery life is great.  Haven't reached a low battery message yet.  They work great for cycling and seem like they should work well for running or other activities.  Once you read the instructions, they turn out to be versatile and easy to use."
1,Best Bluetooth earbuds we have ever had!!
1,Great product
1,They just stopped working after a month and half.
1,Surprised how good they sound for the price. Have used for about a week and no issues.
0,This product worked great for the first month I had it. Now 3 months later it will constantly connected and disconnect. I have tried multiple things to right the problem but nothing has worked.
1,"Just received them yesterday and used them today on a hike and at the gym. Works great, & stays nice and snug in my ears. Very happy with the price and quality so far!"
1,Headphones work great! Right out of the package they had a full charge which I never expected. They fit perfectly over my ears and don't have an issue with my glasses being in the way. The extra 3 foot cord is nice when you do not want to charge them on your desk with the mini cord.
1,Great headphones that come with a nice complimentary carrying case and extra ear bud covers. Great quality product. Great sound. The hook that curves around your ear is bendable so it gives a custom fit for who ever is wearing them. Also can use as bluetooth for phone. Would definitely buy again.
1,Easy to use!
1,"Look, feel, and sound very good."
1,Love these headphones. Totally comfortable and efficient with an amazing price point. Also love round zipper carrier and all the optional sized ear buds.
1,Great value!! Sound quality is excellent!! Better accessories than a lot of the more expensive supposedly high end earphones.
1,"Bought this for my husband, and didn't realize that it can sync up to our smart TV via bluetooth. So he can watch tv while the baby and I are sleeping without the loud noise. It's a great product that I just bought another one today from the lightening deal!"
1,Loving how easy it is to bluetooth. great sound and no cords to get in the way of bicycling. great fit to the ears with several sizes to choose from.
1,Exactly what I was look for. They sound great!
1,Nice feel & look for a wireless sports headphones.  It stayed put during my 2 hour crossfit workout.
1,"I love the reception...so clear and it never fades in-and-out...and no static.  The only problem I have is with the fit in one ear.  One ear fits perfectly, the other not so.  May just be my ear, as I’ve had problems with earbuds in the past.  However, they are so nice, I’ll make do..."
1,Great headsets. They have long battery life and they are comfortable.
1,"I've bought several different sets of ear buds on Amazon because I am cheap and won't pay for Bose or other name brand ones.<br /><br />These are by far the most comfortable. The bass is the best I've heard out of sports headphones. They are really quite comfortable. The Bluetooth covers a long distance. They have a great battery life.  Most importantly, they stay in when I run and work out! Add to that it comes with multiple chargers different size buds, etc. I haven't found any negatives yet. Buy these headphones if you need a good set for running and you won't regret it."
1,I bought these for the gym and they are really great. The sound is amazing and noise cancellation is perfect. These are just as good as any other brand out there.
1,I bike about 15 to 30 miles  on dirt gravel and mountain bike trails. Lot of wind and sometimes heavy rain but these headphones have git me through. They have even survived a few crashes.  They can get loud and thte bass is actually good. Phone calls at above 10 mph are a no go.
0,"These headphones did not fit in my ears, despite trying all ear tips provided. The sound was tinny because I couldn't get a good fit, and I was told the I sounded far, far away when I picked up a call using the headphones."
1,Raving reviews for earbuds/headphones on Amazon have no been very accurate for me. I think most of the people posting reviews about sound quality haven't had nice ear buds!
1,"UPDATE 6/21/2018<br />I want to start off by saying that I meant to do this update for some time now. Okay, here I go.... Unfortunately, I have to say that I am not happy with my replacement headphones (that I paid for with my own money) as, if you read the whole review, I had initially purchased because I thought the first one was broken.  So the very 1st pair that I bought continues to work like a charm.  However, the 2nd pair which I received February 4, 2018 has turned out to be absolute garbage.<br /><br />Even after I received the 2nd pair, I continued to use primarily the 1st one and didn't really use the 2nd one much.  So honestly it took me a awhile to notice that the 2nd pair, whenever I used it, would not work right.  It kept on losing the bluetooth connection.  This is how it would go.  I pair it to my phone, and less than a minute later, it's lost the connection.  I re-pair and the same thing.  However, since I have my original pair I would just go back to that and would chalk it up to maybe I forgot to charge the second pair.  Anyway, it wasn't until I had misplaced the 1st one and had to rely on the 2nd one that I noticed once and for all that it constantly loses its connection, it's not my phone or our home wifi, it's the headphone itself.  So now, I don't even bother using it as it's been nothing but a headache.<br />I hate to have to report this but I have to be honest about my experience.<br />Thus, my conclusion...I still don't regret having originally bought, the 1st pair anyway, which I still use.  However, I am just a little saddened that the backup that I had always planned to purchase is basically useless.  So, that's my 2 cents.<br />Thanks for reading!!!<br />*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************<br /><br />UPDATE:  2/27/2018<br />I purchased these great earbuds back in December 2016 and proceeded to use them all the time.  I even used them in the shower as I had originally stated in my first review.  Well, about a month ago I thought that they had stopped working.  It started after a 2.5 hour jog/walk and of course by the end I was pretty sweaty.  So I had issues with it working properly after that and thought, oh great, my fault, I wasn't careful enough with these babies and decided to go ahead and purchase a second pair.  Well to my absolute delight, as I was waiting to get my second pair, which was a very short wait.  The company is really fast with shipping and they arrived in like 2 days.  Anyhow, I decided to try using my first pair again, I just wasn't ready to part with it even though I knew I had another one coming.  Now here's the delight part, it actually started working again.  Apparently, it just needed to dry out.  That's it.  It's working perfectly again.  So as I had initially intended to purchase a second pair anyway, I am just ecstatic.  These really are the best earbuds I have ever come across and I still continue to use these all the time in favor of other earbuds.  Also, I wanted to add as I hadn't reviewed how they work with phone calls before. I can truly say that they are great on that as well.  The sound quality on calls and the ease with answering and hanging up, such a breeze.  Additionally, pairing is also a breeze with connectivity occurring at around 5-7 seconds.  They charge very quickly as well.  If they are drained it may take about 2 hours or less to fully recharge, but half an hour goes a long way with these too .  Thus, I continue to be extremely happy with this company and this highly recommended, stellar, well made, quality item and I am very thankful to now have two of them.<br />Once again I did not receive a penny for my review.  I gladly spent money out of my own pocket for these and like I said before, money well spent.  Thanks again Tekatron!!!<br /><br />Oh and I almost forgot.  The company, both times reached out to me by email, even one of the owners, just to check in on me and to see if I liked the product.  They made me genuinely feel that they wanted to make sure that, should I have any issues that I could easily contact them.  I truly appreciate their sincerity and I believe anyone reading this will too.  Thanks again, so loving this company!!!<br /><br />*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************<br /><br />First off let me start off by making it absolutely clear that I did not receive anything for my review.  I paid for these out of my own pocket.  Very very happy with my purchase by the way, but I’ll get to that shortly.<br /><br />Okay, let’s begin!  Where have these been all my life or atleast since bluetooth earbuds became a thing? I have never ever ever owned such a boss, primo, whatever word suits you, throw your own in there if you have these already because you know what I am talking about, pair of earbuds.  Earbuds, earbuds, I just cannot believe these are earbuds, these are A..M..A..Z..I..N..G!!!  I honestly resigned myself to simply average earbuds until I found these.  I can do somersaults over here, with them on.  They are so super snug, absolutely no slippage.  I always have trouble with that, always, but not with these.  They have literally become my go to.  I find myself making excuses to wear them.  Phone calls, listening to music (of course), workouts, playing games on my phone, to make it seem like I’m on a call even when I’m not because I am trying to not be bothered.  I even shower with them on, it’s like a spa experience.  No, I do not recommend this, please do not try this and if you do, leave me and the company out of it.  But these are just so good and incredibly comfortable!!!  Plus, the sound quality actually rivals that of some of my headphones.  Not listing any, not an audiophile, but trust me, I’m sure if you gave these a shot you would not be disappointed.  Even the battery life is pretty plentiful at a whopping 8 hours which knocks my Soundpeats out of the water at a supposedly 6 hours (they never really seemed to really last for that amount of time anyway).  Plus, the Peats were much more bulky in comparison to these pretty sleek buds.  And did I mention the bass?  How could I forget that?  That’s one of the main reasons why I am so shocked these are earbuds.  The bass is absolutely killer.  It’s just the right amount, not too heavy, not too low, just perfectly pound-erific bass.  I know pound-erific is not a word.  But these are so great I feel like Willy Wonka, Dr. Seuss, (whichever fits the bill), when I wear them and I can make up words.  I gain magical powers with the freedom and the pleasure that these provide me.  It’s like having a soundtrack to my life.  I obviously wear these a lot.  Please don’t judge me.  But it’s not just about the bass.  I listen to just about everything with these, and the sound is remarkable.  I find myself getting lost in the music, an absolute pleasure to my ears.  Even the packaging is top notch.  It comes with everything you need to get started.  You get not 1 but 2 super quality charging cables with covers.  Like I said top notch!!! You get a car charger, 3 ear tips, a wire tie, and a nice size, actually stylish case.  Also, my buds charged up really fast at only 1.5 hours and I was ready to go.  So very very happy with my purchase especially since I had my eyes on them for awhile and even more so that they ended up being so delightfully, deliciously, spenderificiously, (I know, not an actual word) lovely.  So, basically as I come to the end of my review, if you’ve made it this far, stop, go back to the top of the page and hit the add to cart button.  You deserve a happy purchase.  A happy purchase, what’s that?  Well let’s just say I would have gladly held up one of those signs on the side of the road for businesses trying to advertise, you know the people wearing the Statue of Liberty costume or in regular clothes, some spinning signs trying to get you to stop or go in to see a business.  If this company ever said they were giving these away as a promotion if you do this, even though I already own a pair, I would do it.  I really mean that, the company can hold me to it.<br />Alright, having said that I will, finally, officially, conclude by stating that these were in fact my Christmas gift to myself to block out some holiday chatter.  Let’s just say they worked like a charm.  THANK YOU!!!!  So I say to SENSO, you rock, literally and THANKS so so much.  My life isn’t transformed but I can block more stuff out, they really are that great at noise-canceling.  Didn’t even know they would be great at that, but just another one out of the many great features of this product.  Amazon, THANK you so much for introducing me to SENSO!!!  One of my most happiest purchases, money so well spent that I plan on doing it again, (must have a backup pair or two).  Thanks so much for reading!!!  And finally, depending on where you are, good morning, good day and good night!"
1,"They were very easy to connect and sound great. The ear piece was hard at first but I finally figured it out, never use one that had a ear piece before. Great product great price.."
1,"These things are the real deal.  They fit well and work great. I work under jumbo jets all day and these headphones not only block out noise and deliver quality sound performance, they stay powered up All day. I couldn't be happier. Best purchased in awhile"
1,Great headphones! Sound is clear and the controls are easy to use. I use them for the gym and will get about 6-8 uses out of them before I have to charge them. I will usually use them for an hour or an hour and a half at a time. Super easy to charge in the car. Stays secure in your ear. It only takes an hour or less to get a full charge.
1,Work well  Nice battery life
1,"I have been using the headset for the last 4 days and they work just as described:<br /><br />* Great sound. It Is better that what i expected.<br />* Comfortable enough in your ears. I have used them for 6 hours straight and my ears weren't husrting and they are pretty light (at least for me)<br />* It charges in hour and a half (10 mins give or take) and I think the battery died after 6 hrs of continious use (didn't timed it properly)...the description says 8, but I think that is acceptable. Although I will time it next time.<br />* All accesories included as described and the case is pretty cool.<br />* As for the distance I think it has a good range. I have gone to a considerable distance, gone inside a server room and still get the signal strong. I haven't made a proepr distance test (~32 open space)  but so far it has proven to have a good range.<br />* The microphone seems ok<br /><br />So I can say, so far so good. I still need to do more testing and see how it behaves in the long term."
1,Fits great and good quality sound
1,Great sound. Great price. I just wish the battery life was a little better. It's seems to play between 3 to 4 hours before it needs charging again.
1,"These are fantastic. The sound is really good and pairing with my phone was a breeze. They are so great that my spouse keeps trying to borrow them. Comes with accessories pictured below, which includes three different size ear pieces. Comfortable fit as well.<br /><br />**did receive at a promo rate."
1,It has been a year since I bought these headphones. they are now part of my gym routine. Bluetooth connection is very good so I can just leave my phone on a corner and walk around 50ft radius inside the gym. I usually use spongy heads for my ears. However they don't cancel windy noise while running outdoor. it is a little annoying
1,Love these!  Light weight. Sweat-proof. Great sound. Easy to use.
1,"Perfect so far, excellent sound"
1,"I LOVE these headphones! Loud volume and great bass. The battery lasts a long time also. These pair, unfortunately, now has a short in one ear. I will contact support  to inquire about a replacement. But my 1st pair - I've had 6+ yrs are still going strong 😊 Noise cancelation is pretty good. I can make and take calls, no problem. The other person can hear me pretty good, which is great in my book, considering I work near an airport and take calls mostly outside."
1,Best headset for the price!!
1,"good product , i will recommend to my friends , great sound and inexpensive"
1,"Really like these earphones, but even with the phone in my pocket, the playback is interrupted like on a walk...possibly by my earrings? Nice for working around the house when you can set your phone within a clear path and move around uninhibited."
1,For the price these are great little headsets. I was amazed at how clear and concise both music and conversations come through.  Love them!
1,Finally a reasonably price set of headphones that sound good and stay in my ears when I run.
1,I like everything
1,"There are so many comprehensive reviews of this product already posted, it's hard not to be redundant. I bought these for my husband and he loves them. He had them synced and working with his devices in no time, including an old LG cell phone that has Bluetooth and some other limited capabilities but in no way can be considered a smart phone. (This particular LG model happens work as a pretty decent mp3 music player  which is why he paired the headphones it.) The Wi-fi range is somewhat limited - you can't be very far from your source, but the sound quality and volume control are good and the buds/clips fit comfortably on the ears, at least for my husband. These light-weight, easy to use headphones are, so far, performing well and proving to be a good quality product at a very reasonable price."
1,I use them for bicycling and weight training and the sound is excellent. Also they work great for weight training as the last pair I had kept falling off and it hasn't happened at all with these. Definitely would recommend them.
1,"...6 months in and I'm having a very difficult time with the Bluetooth remaining connected.<br /><br />This is my 4th purchase since 2017 (the other ones would either get lost or somehow messed up), but I've always enjoyed the quality of music and ready connection to my Android devices. Maybe it's just nearing the end of its shelf life?"
1,the sound is very clear and the device is easy to use. However it is not very comfortable in my ears.
1,"I've been using this headphones for a few months now, and I've gotta say, there're great! I listen to a lot of music, and these things last from when I leave the house at 7:30 to when I get home from work around 5. The sound quality is great. The design is great too.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like about these headphones is that the bright LED flashes periodically, which is unnoticeable during the day, but can get a bit annoying when I'm listening to podcasts in my room at night with the lights  off.<br /><br />If you're looking for an affordable wireless headphone set, buy these!"
1,"Hands down worth the money I spent on these! I have some powerbeats3 which I love too, but the powerbeats3 have shut off, due to all the sweat! These have been perfect! I like to do lunges and use a class size room, to do them, and the music didn't cut off at all, so the range is pretty good too.. definitely worth it for me!"
1,I have been using these for 2 months now and they still are going strong. I got tired of my beats breaking down and not connecting to bluetooth so I bought these. Great for the price. I use these 5x a week and they still are working good as new.
1,Very very nice of earbuds and Bluetooth
1,I like the headphones for the price. They occasionally get some weird static when the battery is close to dying or when I'm listening to something and then scrolling through sites that have videos. It has good range and pretty good battery life
1,"I purchased these in February of 2017 and I have been amazed by the sound quality since day 1. Amazing clarity, good bass, and high quality sound. The battery life is also worth bragging about. Each of my gym sesseion lasts about 2 hours, and sometimes I go 3 or 4 sessions without charging it and they have only died on me once (my own damn fault). Just this month, a year and 10 months later, one of the earpieces started going in and out. I have put these things through the ringer and they have taken liters of my sweat and worked great for almost 2 years. I am writing this review now since I was so pleased that I am purchasing another pair. At this price point, there is no comparison. These things are AMAZING!!!"
1,"I've had this product for about 2 weeks. So far I have been pretty impressed, great volume good fit, battery not quite as described but I do listen on full volume so that could be the issue there. Let's see how they hold up over time but so far I would recommend these especially for the price"
1,Easy to link to my Samsung 8. I am really loving them. Best purchase.
1,"These headphones are great! They are of excellent quality and the sound is amazing. The battery life is great and I highly recommend them. They come with several accessories, a case, extra ear pieces and they adjust to your ears to be comfortable. Like I said, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM!"
0,The ear straps aren't adjustable so these don't stay in my ear while exercising
0,Not a good quality item
0,Sound quality disappointing. They were cheap and they sound that way.
1,The best wireless headphones I've tried.  I like them better than Bose.
1,Robert Lacey
1,Same sound quality of beats... Few hundred dollars cheaper!!
1,"They were great! For about a month. Now all the troubleshooting steps in the pamphlet will not make them sync with my iPhone blurthooth. Update: They responded to my email within an hour on a Saturday night, told me to reset the buds to the factory settings and clear it from my iPhone and start over. It worked. I'm back in business."
0,I bought 2 of these in June and one of them is no longer working. When it is charging it says that it is charge but once it is taken off the charger it does not work.
1,These bluetooth earbuds work great with the new iphones.
0,"I thought these were great! I would have given them 4/5 stars... but, I was charging them and came home to them melted! Our home smells like chemicals and I’m SO thankful they didn’t start the house on fire or hurt our dog!<br /><br />Will not buy again!"
1,"Full marks on being a quick source to outsourcing sound from your phone 📱 to a in ear 👂 device so I can hear my podcast, music 🎶 and calls all fine, the only problem is the device terribly fails at being a good alternate to the 🎤 microphone to take phone ☎️ calls on, people often complain of how I sound like someone inside a tunnel barely audible, while I hear them fine."
1,They work great and stay in place.
1,"Love these earbuds!  They stay in my ears. The thing I didn't think about before going wireless is that if they do fall out, they're not attached to your phone via a cord. Hasn't happened but made me careful when I took one bud out. Love the tidy litttle case that comes with the buds. Great product!"
1,If you want to buy some cool wirless headphone? This one would be the best item ever! Quality sound and light even looking good!<br />No regret ! I would buy this one again for my family and friends as well!<br />Thanks Senso !
1,"I love these headphones! I love how comfortable the ear pieces are. The cord is so light, I barely felt it while I was running at the gym. Finally I feel like I can work out without having to mess with my headphones too much or worry about them popping out. I bought a Bluetooth wireless set before this but it was bulky & bothered me while running. Thank you for making these so I can run with ease!"
1,Great Bluetooth ear buds for the price! Would buy again.
1,So far they are excellent great sound and the phone was crystal clear with comfortable ear fit.
1,Great product. Very simple to set up and understand functionality. Great value.
1,"So far really happy with them. I've had them for about a week so far, and am really impressed. Sound quality is high, very comfortable after putting in the ear piece that fits my ear, they don't move or fall out even with heavy movement. Connectivity seems to be kinda short range, but it's something you can deal with. Only thing I would change, is the material the cord that connects the two. If you're sweating, it tends to stick to your neck pretty bad, so you've gotta adjust it quite frequently. If not, then once you turn your head after it's been sticking, it can rip it out of your ear. Other than that, still definitely 5/5 stars."
0,This is the second pair and both went bad within 6 months. The first pair the USB port fried somehow when plugged in overnight. The second pair started not holding a charge for more than 3 hours after 4 months of purchase. Within 6 months just turned off in middle of workout and then wouldn't charge anymore. I surmise that the rubber over the USB port isnt sufficient to protect from sweat. So don't buy these.
1,"Awesome wireless headset. Good quality feel to them, great sound and they fit over the ear very well. Easy to use, links right up with my Andriod phone. Great purchase."
0,"In my initial review, I gave this a 5 star because of the customer service. The earphone I received initially seemed to have some defect. They Customer service was very prompt to respond to emails. Based on my email, within a couple of days a new earphone was shipped.<br />Initially i though the replacement earphones worked very well. But after a week, i regret buying this. If I keep my phone in my pocket and go out for a walk or jog, there is severe distortion. It keeps losing connection every few seconds. Cannot even properly listen to a song. I take the phone out of my pocket, and no distortion. I have earphones from another brand (costs way less than senso) which works quite well compared to senso. Avoid buying this. Its a waste of money."
1,"Very good product, came with a lot of accessories. Thanks"
1,My headphones showed up promptly and everything works well.  I wore them at work and once to go running so far and I have to say that I am impressed.  After getting them connected to my phone they are pretty much hands free and I haven't noticed any issues with the Bluetooth cutting out.  They fit well and I haven't had any issue with them falling out (my last set was terrible for this and is what prompted me to buy this pair).
1,"Excellent headphones, I wear them to run or go to the gym. Great sound quality, holds a charge for a long time. The earpieces are pretty comfortable too, unlike some other headphones I've worn. I sweat quite a bit and it doesn't seem to have affected them.  The microphone is ok, the people I'm talking to complain that I'm too quiet and hard to hear. I didn't buy them to make calls, so it's not really an issue for me."
1,Bought for my 11 years old grandson who use to play outside with ball and I am not afraid that he may loose it; if it's felt from his ear - it will stay on his neck. He said he loves it.
1,"Really great headphones, especially for the cost. Fits well, sound is good, and they stay in place while working out. My left bud buzzes a bit but it is really only noticeable in a quiet setting. The standard noise of a gym with music playing makes it really hard to hear any buzzing. Customer service was excellent as well - very quick to respond and super helpful with everything."
1,"These are awesome headphones! Very easy to connect to my IPhone. The sound quality is excellent! I love how they came with 3 sizes of ear pieces. I was able to find my perfect fit in no time. They were fully charged when I received them so I was able to enjoy them right away. I haven't used them enough yet to run down the charge, so I will update this review after my first charge. Very highly recommended!"
1,"It’s hard to complain about these because they’re so cheap. However, they don’t fit around my ears correctly. As long as I don’t move they fit just ok but the second I move they fall off my ear. So personally I would never wear these for anything but sitting still at my desk at work.<br /><br />On the positive side the sound quality is pretty good. They synced really easily with my phone. I just turned them on and opened the Bluetooth on my phone and they were synced. They also make sound in your ear telling you they’re synced. Another thing I like is when they’re connected to your phone it shows the battery level on your phone so you know when to charge them.<br /><br />Ultimately these are great for the price but I had to give them a lower rating strictly for the fact that they don’t fit the shape of my ear well or stay put."
1,"Edited: I have upgraded my rating from 2 stars to 5. When I wrote about a problem here, Senso support contacted me and helped me fix the problem. I've been slow to edit my review, but they were quick with service. Very pleased.<br /><br />Pro: Stay in the ear pretty nicely. Deliver good sound when they deliver sound.<br />Con: Don't deliver sound. (Edit 5/22/18: This problem has been solved.) Will signal that they are connected. But often they don't deliver any sound. Clicking the button will pause or unpause the application that's trying to deliver sound. You can hear this because the sound is coming from the phone's speakers. (iPhone 6+ in my case). But no sound comes through the earbuds. Restarting either the earbuds or the app will fix the problem, but sometimes it requires several restarts in order to fix the problem. In the meantime, you're annoying the people around you with sound from the phone's speaker. I would have been delighted with this product if not for this serious failing."
1,Product delivered on time and exceeds expectations. Outstanding fidelity and the &#34;setup&#34; was easy and fast. Highly recommend supplier and product.
1,Was hoping sound quality would be better than what it is. It’s a bit worse than the Apple wired headphones. Might only use these when I desperately need wireless when doing active work.
1,I had purchased a pair a few months ago and they were great. Unfortunately i lost them and I didn't hesitate to purchase another pair. They hold a good charge and have a really good sound.
1,These are perfect for running. I bought these to replace a pair without the earloop bc they kept falling out during my run. These were perfect.
1,works great...<br />stays in during a workout.<br />light.<br />good volume.
0,Junk don't buy this ...as it is low quality. Item lasted all of two charges before it stopped working.
1,I can't imagine better wireless headphones for the price.  I wore them running today on an extremely windy day and sound quality was great.  They are also comfortable to wear.
0,"These are headphones I only use when I run for the most apart and occasionally when I take the subway to work. I bought these in late January and the left side has stopped working entirely. Super disappointing given how little they’ve been used and only stored in the container it can with. Additionally, the charger provided only works when I play with the cord after plugging it in to charge. Horrible."
1,These headphones are way better than I expected. The sound is amazing! Also they’re super secure. I like boxing (hitting mitts/heavy bag) and I didn’t have to adjust them at all. Oh the memory earbuds are an amazing touch! Complete cancel out noise and I hardly know I’m wearing them.
0,"On the first day of using these, one side started not working. Not very impressed, hopefully they will answer my email and refund us or send a new pair. The LOOK great- but not working properly is a bummer."
1,"I work out in these several days a week, running, weights, and HIIT. They sound great for the price and stay in my ears during all types of workouts. Battery life has been much better than my Tao's."
1,"I have had these for nearly two years now, and they are still going strong. I use them almost every day at work, and they have yet to disappoint. The battery life is excellent, the controls are excellent, and they came with a car charger adapter, usb charger adapter, iPhone/micro usb charger, a clamshell case, it’s unbelievable. These are one of the best values I have ever seen!!"
1,The cord for the iPhone doesn't stay i very well. Still trying it out. I didn't realize it was this complicated.
1,"As others have pointed out the base is amazing... down side is there are almost no high notes.  I'm finding out that I am a bit of an audiophile.  Also the cord is too short, I often find one side wanting to get pulled out of my year when I turn my head."
1,Works very well when running
1,The head phones are great and are of the exact same quality as the major brand competitor but s third of the cost.  I highly recommend them.
1,"I AM REALLY SURPRISED HOW GREAT THEY ARE.  I USE THEM AT THE GYM  AND THEY ARE AWESOME. STILL LEARNING  HOW THEY WORK BUT LOVE THEM ,GREAT SOUND, EASY TO USE.  THANKS."
1,"These wireless headphones are the best I have used. Battery-power is amazing--I rarely have to recharge more than once a week. The over the ear straps make them comfortable and secure even when running. Sound quality is great. The extras, like the headphone carrying case, cell phone card carrier and car mount, are nice add-ons. I hope not to lose these, but if I do, I will immediately replace with Senso."
1,"They stay in my ears, pair up quickly, and last quite awhile on a charge.  For the price I guess they're OK but these reviews are questionable at best.  Everything about them is good except for the most important part which is the sound.  They sound like a $10 pair of earbuds.  Voices sound muted and any kind of bass like you would find in a typical rap song distorts the sound considerably even at low volume.  Outside, these things are almost unusable on any kind of breezy day as they pick up and amplify wind noise more than any other earbuds I have used.<br /><br />Long story short, I gave then 3 stars because if you just want a cheap pair of sweat proof earphones for use in the gym and don't care much about sound quality then these are probably as good as any other in it's price range.  If you want something that sounds good though, spend the extra money and skip these 'off-brand' models."
1,"Great quality, I also like the way it fits in the ears comfortably"
1,Great headphones for a very reasonable price.  I had an issue with pairing my headphones after 1 week of use.  Very frustrated I wrote a poor review.  Customer service responded immediately and provided a solution which worked perfectly.  Great product and even better customer service!
1,Easy to use- stay put- good sound
1,So far so good 2 months and counting.
1,"Great fit.  I run 3-5 miles a day and do interval training, and they never come loose.  Bass is pretty good as well as loudness.  Works great with my Samsung Edge.  Also, the wire fits nicely around the neck or tucked into your shirt.  The ear clip is a nice soft rubber that I barely feel.<br /><br />Not sweat-proof but may be sweat-resistant.  Found a few times having to wipe the unit down in order to get even sound.<br /><br />There is no reason to spend a fortune for headphones for working out.  They are sort of meant to be replaceable eventually anyway.  If you're in the studio mixing tracks, then, of course, yes this is going to matter, but in the gym or outside, I just want to hear my music loudly and with a broad frequency spectrum.  This will do it."
1,For the price these are a great deal. They stay in place while running which I have had problems with other headphones falling out.
0,The sound quality was really poor. I was shocked!!
1,Wish they had a smaller ear tip I have small ear openings. I used at the gym and they seemed to cut out now and then. Hopefully that was a fluke but very convenient and love that they come with a case!!
1,i love it great sound
1,By far the absolute best headphones I've ever owned..  they are exactly as described... Up to and including being waterPROOF worthy of IPX7 rating... And I can be heard crystal clear thru speaker phone by person on other end of the line even with wind racing past while biking...
1,"I'm so disappointed I didn't get wireless headphones before now. These headphones are awesome for running or exercising. They don't budge at all and I don't notice the cord at all. Even while doing burpees, these don't budge! The only downside is that they don't have the greatest sound quality in terms of bass, but that's alright because of the price and convenience."
1,"these were easy to set-up, i actually needed to change the size of the buds, which was a little bit of a pain, but so far there are exactly what i needed"
1,These were a gift for my husband.  He loves them!  Says the music quality is excellent and loves that they stay in unlike traditional earbuds.  Thank you!
1,Awesome headphones. The fit is great and they sound awesome. They also came with an awesome 2 in one lightning/mini USB charger
1,Bought these as a gift for Father's Day.  He enjoyed them while cycling.  He said they were comfortable and easy to figure out.
1,"Love that if you fall asleep, don't lose them like wireless, and don't end up chocked like wired. These are great, especially for the price"
1,"Good sound, comfortable fit and lasting battery life."
1,I like the bass that the headphones produce and the 8pin/mini combo cable is a nice touch.
1,Love the quality and the accessories that come with the product. Was a little disappointed that I could only by one at a time. I wanted two pair (one for me and hubby). I had to buy the second from different company
0,Just 4 months of using it and one side of this earphone is already not working. I liked it when they were working fine.
1,So far so good. The sound quality is great and they are so convenient. Just started back going to the gym and I needed a good pair of earphones that could drown out all the noise in the gym.  Very happy with this purchase.
1,"This is actually the third pair of the exact same headphones that I bought. I bought my wife a pair, me a pair, and another replacement pair for myself. The sound quality is good (not amazing$, but what I really like is the fit. I’ve had many pairs of headphones, and they always seem to come out of my ears when I run, no matter what I do. These actually stay put."
1,Battery lasts for forever! Got these on sale and was extremely pleased with the outcome. I also have wireless beats and these are very comparable.
1,"Seriously stop what you are doing and buy these. I've had them about a year and they are perfect. They don't come out when I run or lift, and have decent sound and can get REALLY loud if you need them to. I've tried about 4 different types of Bluetooth headphones for working out and NONE I tried came even close."
0,"Don't buy under the assumption that these are actually waterproof. They had decent sound quality and were pretty durable for at least basic gym wear, but they don't connect consistently to iPhones and my pair broke after initial exposure to water."
1,"My 16yr old purchased a pair of these for himself and loves them, his brother asked for a pair for Christmas this year!"
0,I was excited to buy this product. It worked well for a few months and then just stopped working. I would not recommend these.
1,"I love the SENSO earbuds.  They come with a USB car 12 volt charger, a travel case and a charging cable. They sound just as good or better than the Sony earbuds I have. And they are very comfortable to wear.  I am very happy I found them on Amazon.  You won't go wrong if you purchase these earbuds.  A1 product in my opinion."
1,"Throughout the first few months, they worked great.  I loved the way they fit for my runs. However, after a few months, one ear just stopped working.  Kind of frustrating to have this happen for no reason. I wish I could give it 5 stars, but when a product only works for a few months, it simply won't do."
1,"I have had these ear buds for a little over a week and love them!  I use then at the gym during cardio (elliptical), abs circuit and strength conditioning.  Absolutely NO issues with them falling out, even with heavy sweat.  As for the sound, I tried two pairs from Bose and cannot tell the difference, other than $110-$160 in price for the latter.  For the price, you can't beat them!"
1,Product description on Amazon was completely accurate. Headphones work perfectly.
1,Enough said. Good deal for the price.
1,I am so surprised at the price of these awesome sounding earphones.  Keep up the good work.
0,"I worked out with these often and within months of having it, it stopped working. It doesn’t charge and won’t respond to a reset. I am super disappointed."
0,"This thing sucks, it does not pair with iphone 6. I'm assuming it doesn't work with any subsequent iphones either. So I couldn't do a proper review of the sound."
1,"These are by far the best wireless Bluetooth headphones I have owned and have since purchased a second pair for my wife.  I have tried others which either fell out of my ears while walking, or working out, and/or the battery life was dismal.<br /><br />The pairing instructions were straight forward and worked without any problems, my Samsung 7 Edge recognized and paired with the Senso right away.  The Senso headphones pack great sound, has good reception when the cellphone is in a pocket, and reception to/from while talking on the cellphone is excellent.  The buttons are conveniently placed on the right bud, and the On/Off/Answer/Disconnect, as well as the volume controls work flawlessly.<br /><br />The battery life is excellent, although I have not tried to go non-stop for the rated 8 hour battery life, I have used them on long walks, or working outside all day with the battery still holding a charge after 5-6 hours.  I have a pair of Bose noise canceling earbuds which I use on airplanes, but whether it's working out, working around the house, outside work, the Senso's are now my goto for all my other activities."
1,The wireless headphone are AWESOME! not overpriced and great quality
1,This is my second pair I keep my last pair over a year And I wore them every day at work I think they’re pretty great
1,"these headphones are even better than advertised! They are attractive, easy to use, comfortable to wear and the sound quality is exceptionally good. I couldn't imagine a better productive at such an attractive price. I listen to jazz, soul and classical music as i work out and find these far superior to other products of similar price range that I have owned. Congratulations Senso!"
1,Excellent
0,"Very uncomfortable. My ears hurt after a hour or so.If I knew they were this painful to wear, I would have just bought a more expensive set of headphones."
1,"Great Sound and Very Comfortable. However, the attachment to power it is sunken and hard to attach"
1,I’ve enjoyed them so much I bought an extra pair to keep at and one at work.
1,"They work pretty well. Ok sound, good construction, good accessories. One small complaint: the buttons for next song and previous song should be swapped. Previous sing is towards the front of my head and next song is towards the back of my head, that's reversed from what I would expect. Same story for volume up and down which share buttons with next and previous song."
1,"Works as advertised.  Very nice, comfy, and easy to use.  Totally would buy again. Great for mowing lawns, working out, or ignoring your coworker."
1,Love these headphone
0,"Sometimes it works, It must be the connection problem."
0,I've had these for about a year and the left earbud no longer work.  I've used the almost every day for 8 hours. Pretty disappointed that they lasted only a year. Other than that they are great! Noise cancelling works wonders.
1,"I synced these with my phone and hit the gym. The sound is great and they're super comfortable, but when I put my phone in my pocket and did some stretches sometimes the sound would go in and out. I guess having my body between the headphones and my phone cut off the connection a bit?<br />Either way, they were worth the money I spent! I use them for working out or watching a movie on my phone."
1,"Excellent sound quality, volume can get bonkers loud, charges quickly, comes with enough ear bud covers in different sizes to get a a perfect fit,  ideal for working out. Had no issues pairing to my phone. Very pleased."
1,That are real nice. Come's with extras that would cost more if you had to buy them. I wish I could just buy a few of the lighter chargers they are great
0,Battery life is only 4-5 hours of music playing. The ear piece is a bit bulky. Can't activate Siri.
1,I love my new wireless headphones. Great for working out and they actually stay in your ear!!
1,I've only used them twice now and I'm impressed with the sound! It was super easy to connect to my phone! I'm hoping they last but so far so good 😊
1,Easy to set up and they stay on and are quite comfortable in the ear.  I really appreciated the price point....~$150-300 for other name brand bluetooth earbuds is ridiculous.
1,"Comfortable headphones, they stay put during exercise even when sweating and moving fast. I like the case but you cannot keep the charger and the headphones in the case as both items won't fit. I don't really need that but some people may want to know.<br />The reason I purchased these headphones is because the reviews I read said they are comfortable, Well, they are! Buy with confidence besides, they are nicely priced and you won't have to buy new ones for a long time."
0,To pair a second device you have to go into the first device and disconnect it and then go back to the headphones and pair the second one.<br />The sound quality is bad and doesn't block out background noise. The earphones are fidgety to put on. It's difficult to know if they are on or off so you might leave them on and the battery dies. Just terrible and cheaply built.
1,Exactly what I was looking for at a great price!
1,Great sound and paired without effort! Fit is great which is important to me when exercising.
1,Work as expected good quality I’m happy with this senso Bluetooth
1,Charged and connected easlily.  Sound is great
0,"Too big to fit around ears, fell off head.  No way to adjust to a tighter fitting."
1,We purchased two set of ear buds last spring.  One set stopped connecting to the iphone.  It was a breeze to receive a replacement set.  I would order from this company again based on my customer service experience.
1,"Great product. Great company. Give them a shot, personally I'm not going to shell out the cash for jaybirds when I can get these at more than half the cost. Easy to use and sound great!"
1,Great for gym/running
1,These headphones are excellent in high clarity sound and it is very convinient to set to your ear. Outstanding battery backup is a very special to this headset. but the only thing is you can't hear with very low volume other than these all futures are very nice. I strongly preferred to this haed phones with low price.
1,I love these headphones. They stay in through my workout with no need for constant readjusting. The volume is great. Everything I was looking for at a reasonable price
1,AMAZING!!! I had a pair of the wireless beats and they stopped working after only having them for 3 months and this pair hasn't given be any trouble! I use them about 5 times a week for about 2 hours at a time and I've only had to charge them ONE TIME since I bought them back in may!!
1,"These are great, i recently bought some ear buds that have a rechargable case as replacements, but they're trash compared to these."
1,"Decent sound, but the buttons seem backwards. As you're wearing them, the button to the rear advances the track and turns up the volume. The button towards the front turns it down and reminds... Also, for about a week, it tried to randomly connect to my coworker's phone, then stopped for no reason. Good range and good sound quality."
1,Great product even better customer service. So far 100% satisfied.
0,"I received these on May 6th to give to my husband for his birthday on May 8th.  He started using them a couple of days after receiving them, he said that they worked well and was happy when they were working.  Just last week he asked me to get a receipt for him because they are no longer working (June 9th).  I'm out of luck because I bought them on here Amazon and the window to return them was before June 5th.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I have to give these one star.  They should have lasted much longer!"
1,Great sounds and easy connection. Very comfortable ears pieces.
1,"I love my headphones. I am in the military and I do a lot of running. The headphones are light, loud and clear. Great bang for your buck."
0,"I've had these for two months now, and since the beginning they've had Bluetooth connection issues with my devices. They randomly drop off often and I have to turn on/off, etc to be able to reconnect. Desperately seeking a reliable pair of earbuds without having to spend too much."
1,"So far, all good. Cool technology with good sound, arrived quickly, great sale price. Now we see how durable they are!!"
1,"I bought two headsets to try for my workouts as I hated my last ones.  I failed to realize this pair doesn't have the mic to use for talking, too.  The headset is fine and seems to hold a charge for a super long time, which I appreciate!  But a bummer that I can't use for a regular headset, too.  My recommendation is keep shopping for a different option.  I'm keeping this as I've used them a few times but there are options for similar price that would give you a mic, too.  My bad for not reading the description more closely."
1,It's mic is not good as expected.
0,Blu tooth distance absolutely blows.  Basically might as well get wired headphones.
0,Very good product but stop charging .. i cant use it anymore :/
1,Pretty cool headphones. Fit great and easy to set up. The only down side is there is not a lot of bass.
1,"Love them! They work great and seem very durable so far, also the case and double charger are awesome bonuses. Definitely worth purchasing."
1,"Glad I purchased these. After fumbling with the apple wired earbuds for the past year while hiking I decided to research a set of BT Wireless buds. These SENSO wireless headphones had many 4 and 5 star reviews. Actually I think they had better reviews than the Major Brands which sell for $150-200. Several reviews talked about Excellent Customer Service as well as great quality. I cannot comment on Bass being good or bad since my only reference is the apple brand wired ear buds which I never felt were of great quality or fit. Not sure what ears apple was trying to fit?  I think the volume and bass in these Senso headphones are great. Sound quality is awesome. Waterproof feature seems great. I have had them for a couple weeks and I hike 5-7 miles a day and definitely give them a good sweat test. No issues. Connecting is a breeze. The &#34;hooks&#34; that go above your ears are so comfortable, they're soft and flexible and even with my glasses on, there is no pressure points or areas that are uncomfortable. I never even feel them.  The controls all work great. Funny, the volume up and down seem to be backwards to what I naturally would expect, but in a day was used to the setup.  I have Nike+ Apple Watch and have read it works great with it as well, but have not had the opportunity to try them connected directly to the watch since my hikes have elevation gains I want to track and the watch does not track elevation so I pair with the phone, start my music and launch NRC on the phone. The microphone works great, I have had several calls come in during a hike and have never had any connection issues, static or anything else. I have asked the first few people who called if it sounded ok and they all said perfect.  The customer service is amazing. I got an immediate response to an inquiry and two follow ups on the issue as well as follow ups from the ceo regarding the purchase and my satisfaction.  I RECOMMEND THESE TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY. I would repurchase these in the future should I need another set.  Customer Service also offered, free of charge to send spare cushions for the ear bud part. Although I have not yet received them, I have no reason to believe they are not going to show up. Very satisfied and very cost effective solution for me."
1,I wanted a set of wireless headphones to use with my iPod Nano but found there is connection problems of the same type mentioned by others in these reviews.  I found they have more to do with the order the devices are turned on.  If the headsets are turned on first and then the iPod I find the connection is poor - if I do it in the opposite manner the connection is fine.  Why this should be a problem doesn't make any sense to me. I wear my ipod on the brim of my hat within a couple of inches of the headphones so there should be no poor connection at all.
1,"The head phones came in a nice box with easy to follow instructions.  Therr were 3 sets of plugs, plus a foam set similar to ear plugs(guess for noise canceling/dampening).<br /><br />Used them at my gym once and was very happy with the sound volume and quality.  Did have some interference issues but that's most likely due to other equipment used in the gym.  Couldn't go more than 10 feet before the sound cut out some.  I tested them at home and could go about 30 feet before any issues.<br /><br />Overall I'm very happy with them.  Did not have issues with them falling out or when I got sweat on them."
1,"Been using mine for over 3 months now, and still impressed by it. After breaking them in, I believe the sound has improved a little bit.<br />I use mine very heavily in the gym almost everyday with no reservations, sweat dripping on it profusely and all that--so far, it's been like a submarine. I charge it every 2 days, which does not bother me much really."
1,"It sounds awesome, especially for the price point. Very comfortable and asking people I speak with on the phone and they say I sound good. Now I am going to see if it last, Always have an issue with other Bluetooth headphnes, down in Florida sweating is an issue. I will keep you all posted!. Not too worried though it does come with a 1-year warranty."
1,"Theses headphones are really good,, loud HD sound and the the bass is really good. you can really feel the bass in these headphones. I use them for working out and they same in place the whole time.  Good job on these headphones"
1,"I was worry about the quality of the sound and feel due to the price, but after tried them for a couple of days, the sound is very good and they fit ergonomically in my ears, the design is cool, time will tell if they will last. But so far, i like them."
1,"Nice sound, work well, and easy set up.  Great deal."
1,great sound and long lasting battery. Used these in the gym and on an airplane both times my sound was good with a good bass sound.
0,"The product has quite the title; it is if course not accurate. The sound quality was tolerable, but the Bluetooth connectivity left a lot to be desired. Everything was okay for the price, but three months in, they stopped being able to charge. At the price you shouldn't reasonably expect much, but do not buy these if you intend for this purchase to be the last Bluetooth earbuds you ever own, because they are definitely not that."
1,"Sometimes you buy something and you hope that it's everything it says, but you're not surprised when it's not. These headphones are everything they say they are! I bought them for the gym and, so far, so good. The sound quality is good, sweat is no longer an issue, and the volume is easy to control when they are on. They are also spot on in terms of being noise cancelling as I also used them to meditate. I still have to work on using them to make/take calls. However, that wasn't my primary reason for getting them; it's just an added bonus for me."
1,They are super comfortable.  Never even come close to coming out.  Pairs with my iPhone 6 and iPad Pro very easily.  Nice sound too!!  Only issue I have been having is it breaking up when playing music when phone is only in my pocket.  So that does suck.  But only when using my iPhone 6 which i can't be sure isn't the problem since it needs an upgrade.  I also just did a factory reset on headset as I read that can help.  So here's hoping tonight at the gym I have uninterrupted music since they truly are beyond comfortable
1,"I had the same pair before, but I was not paying attention and tried to put the charger in and broke the charger port. However, this is a great product so I ordered them again. Great sound quality. Use them under my ear protectors at work and in the rain all the time."
1,Wow excellent bass music spectacular.....<br />Excellent support...
1,"So far so good.  For the price these headphones seemingly designed off the Beats by Dre PowerBeats platfoem offer surprisingly good sound, stable fit and useful features. I was pretty impressed.<br /><br />Aesthetically, the unit is a bit bulky and thus not as visually refined compared to the Beats.  Also the over ear stabilizing apparatus is almost too flimsy to be useful but on balance I am very satisfied thus far.  Time will tell if the build quality holds up."
1,Very nice headphones! Great sound! Battery life last awhile. Only problem for me they won't stay in ears! So annoying. It's not the headphones iv decided it's my ears haha. Get this yal if you don't have problems with these kind staying in ears. You won't regret it. I've had them about 6m or more.
0,I purchased this product this past August but it just stopped working & the window for returning has expired. 2 months.
1,"me encanta que se sostienen bien, se escucha impecable"
1,Really like bvb it but nise cancellation not great.
1,Great for the price.
1,i love it but battery not good
1,"I am extremely impressed with these headphones. The audio quality is exceptional, they are secure and comfortable to wear no matter the activity and they are user friendly to operate. I can safely say this is my go to headphone and I do intend to purchase for family members. Brilliant product!"
1,"This was my 1st purchase of wireless headphones, so I was a little skeptical as to the quality at this price! I was delightfully surprised at the quality of the sound &amp; fit of the SENSO Bluetooth Headphones! They have great sound quality, but even more so they have great customer service! I would recommend these Bluetooth headphones to family &amp; friends!"
0,Regret this purhase. Does not live up to expectation. Awkward fit in ear. Bluetooth connection seems poor.<br />Impressive appearance and packaging.
0,Never worked right from the start. It charged and worked for about a month. Showed it was charged and will not turn on. sent a message and haven't heard back. Don't waste your money. Buy a good pair of wireless...these were not worth the 38.00 at all.
1,Great product! Plan to purchase another set soon
1,Great fit and sound
1,Long lasting battery and great sound. They do not stay on my ears very well. And of course sweating a lot doesn’t help.
0,I have really tried to give these a chance due to all the good reviews. I have other blue tooth devices and these are without a doubt the worst. If you don’t mind your music disconnecting and reconnecting similiar to an album skip then these are the head phones for you.
1,"Holy moly.These earbuds are louder than ANY I have ever owned. I use them to ride a vstar with custom pipes and I can barely hear the pipes.<br />I give these a 5+. They are the real deal. I have never heard of the brand, but they rival, compete with, and sound as good as drs beats. The price is unbelievable.High quality sound for a crazy low price. You can hear the base, tremble, and voice on these. They have a warranty and all the high end aspects, a case, car charger, pc cables, extra ear rubbers. They made me a believer, check um out, you won't be disappointed<br />Docc"
1,"Great product at a great price. Comes  in a convenient storage box. Excellent sound, noise cx and battery life."
1,These headphones are okay and sound okay. But I feel like I'm constantly trying to adjust them in my ear. I much prefer the over-the-ear headphones now I bought a pair of those and stop using the earbuds.
1,Great sound
1,The sound quality is great and the battery life is very good but they won’t stay on your ears. Just keep falling off if there is any movement like running or even weight training. If they stayed on your ears comfortably it would have been a perfect 5 stars.
1,"I use this product for weight training, ultramarathon training, driving,  and while at work.  I have used for almost a year now and still amazing.  It's easy to use, charge and doesn't fall of whole running.  I love that they give a lot of extra silicone plugsfor the ear. It came with a pouch and they threw in a card holder for my cellphone.  My only problem is the range is not the greatest.  If I take 3-5 steps away from it at the gym I lose signal. I didn't knock them for it on my rating because for the price you can't beat it."
1,"I was looking for some headphones because I am a big fan of bass. I liked these headphones because they produce very good bass. Sound quality is fair, and noice cancellation is good as well. I didn't face any challenge connecting to bluetooth with Andriod, and iOS devices. The setup is very easy. The only negative about these headphones was that they stopped working after 3 months, but I got a replacement for free so that was good."
0,These are good for general use but they have a very limited blue range. Often they don’t work in colder weather too at or below 40 degrees. While running the reception is spotty and i’d often hear my music cut out which is not something you want during a run. I had to buy a different brand after all that.
1,Purchased as a gift for my daughter - she loves them at the gym.  Quality!
0,worked for a few weeks before the adhesive gave and one of the earbuds detached from the housing
1,Perfect
0,"Product feels cheap, and looks. I could get better quality from Ross, Marshall's, and even from Big Lots that would cost less than this product. On the second usage, the right ear bud where the speaker sits inside broke off and the wires snapped off the speaker."
1,Works great. Only problem I had was trying to figure out which buds were the most comfortable
1,My son uses these everyday while working out. Says they are the best thing I brought him.
1,Great for a hands free workout.
1,Sound quality is excellent. Battery life is at least 10hrs of constant music streaming. Connection to my IPHONE 8plus was simple. However the ear piece that wraps around the ears are hudge and you tend to have to adjust the ear piece. The only reason I’m giving 3 starts is for the design to the ear piece.
1,"I selected these earbuds after lookin at all kinds and brands. The high rating was a big factor AND the cost! I love to listen to music and I do like it kind of loud. My primary reason for getting them is my husband works in a factory and when he comes home does not like the loud music.  Now if I'd like to use the earbuds it doesn't both him.  I get a great, clear sound with the bass I enjoy and can be doing whatever I want because I'm free to go about things with no wires! Great product and highly recommend!"
1,"Happy with the headset, but I do wish the ear hooks were more adjustable, the silicon doesn't provide adequate support."
1,Would only connect one in three times so I returned them
0,people couldn't hear me speaking and when i try and talk to people they fade in and out really bad to where it goes completely
0,"First usage, Side fell off, exposing the Battery.  Poor Quality, not durable.  Would recommend people get a better quality headset."
0,"Great for the price, these headphones hold enough charge for my full week of 30-45 minute daily workouts. Included with the headphones are a cable and a car charging port, but these accessories are poorly designed and of shoddy quality (the car charger fell apart in a couple weeks). The sound from the headphones is certainly louder than other wireless sets I've owned, and that includes sets costing three times as much. Sound quality, however, leaves much to be desired. The bass is strong, but it is also muddy. The mid and high tones are hollow and make most music sound distant even at high volumes. These headphones are great for workouts if, like me, you tend to go through several headphone sets a year. I would not recommend for casual listening because of the poor sound quality.<br /><br />Update: dropped a star because the headset died after just 5 months of use. This short lifespan is probably to be expected with such a low price, but a better headset might be worth the investment if you need a headset for any significant length of time. I did notice that the headset I bought to replace these did not have nearly the volume nor the bass that these offer."
1,"These are fine for music not so great for speaking on the phone. I used them and people couldn't hear me or they said there was too much background noise. I was hoping for a pair of headphones that I could use for making phone calls and these aren't them. But the sound quality is good for music, podcasts, etc."
0,"Worked for several months, then Bluetooth broke. Overall dissatisfied. I would think this would be made of finer more long-lasting materials"
0,Stopped working after a month of use.
1,the only thing was that the box shows that it brings a wire tie and it was not in the box.
1,Awesome headphones. Sound quality is superb. I would buy these again as a second pair to use at work since I do not have a headset so being able to use these with my personal phone if I need to jump on a conference call is nice.
1,"I ordered these because I wanted to have a set of earphones for my daily hike that didn't have a cord that got all tangled up.  I was concerned about the over the ear clip, since in my experience that type of earphones was uncomfortable.  The ear clips on these SENSO headphones are made out of a soft rubber that is very comfortable.  They easily stay in my ears.  The sound is great.  I've had no trouble with the Bluetooth connection.  They connected quickly and automatically to my iPhone 6S as soon as I turned them on.  I am very pleased with my purchase."
1,Works great for the price!
0,I worked out with these once and the sweat shortes them out in less than 30 minutes of jogging
1,GOOD QUALITY PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE
1,"The value is outstanding, compared them to my friends power beat 2 and actually enjoyed the fit of these better"
1,"Just received my Bluetooth ear buds, paired them easily with my iPhone, and the sound is great. Have not used them for a very long period of time yet to test battery life but so far am really pleased with my purchase.<br />Kathleen"
1,I recently purchased three sets of th Senso wireless ear buds. I am so pleased. The set was very quick and easy with great directions.
1,"Well, My initial impression. It pairs really fast and works great. volume is quite high and clear. Fits very well on the ears.<br /><br />Like it a lot."
1,Great product that comes with multiple accessories. The low price doesn't match the high value. More than 5 stars! Thank you
1,"I run using these headphones almost every day.  They have a very long battery life and great sound.  Unfortunately, I left them in my pocket after a run and ran them through the laundry.  Dryer and all!  I was able even then to get them to charge and work, but the battery life was zapped.  My fault...totally.<br /><br />So, I ordered another set because I like them A LOT!<br /><br />Then, my wife's Bluetooth earbuds bit the dust, so she now has a shiny new set of these!<br /><br />Update:  My buds wouldn't turn on after charging.  I called Invotek and received GREAT customer srevice!  They already have a replacement pair on the way.  Nice to see that the company stands behind their product.  They were very professional and polite.  I will do business with them again!<br /><br />I'll try not to launder the new ones, but I know where I can find more!"
1,Easy to pair. Simple to use. And works great! Very please with these headphones.
1,These are great ear buds. Sound great and feel very comfortable. I wish I had bought some sooner. I got these because they are advertised as waterproof.  I use them in my hot tub to sit and listen to videos on my tablet in a waterproof case as I'm relaxing.  No issues with the steam yet.
1,"These are a great pair of workout headphones! They pair to a number of devices really easily and the audio quality, durability (they're water and sweatproof as far as I can tell) and the look are all a steal at this price! My one gripe is the volume adjustment and skip track buttons, you would think the order of the buttons would be switched so it takes some getting used to over a couple days use, no biggie.<br /><br />Now, that said, I did have issues with my first pair of these and my second broke from physical wear, but I still rate these at 5-stars. What made this a 5-star purchase for me was the customer service I recieved. The people at Senso stand by their one year warranty. I contacted customer service both times my headphones were having issues and they replied quickly and sent a replacement pair my way, quick and painless. From other reviews I've read my durability issue seems like a fluke, but even if you have a similar issue, senso's got your back. Reccomended for anyone looking for a great pair of headphones to lift and run with!"
1,"These wireless earbuds are perfect for working out and have a terrific sound. I bought a pair of the same headphones about a year ago and they seem to have enhanced the sound with this pair, especially the bass. These are fantastic and will make my workouts much easier to deal with."
1,So far I love the product.
1,"These are the most comfortable ear buds I have owned to date, trust me I have owned several different brands in an array of price ranges.  Senso lives up to the hype.  Great sound quality and that for me is critical to quality buds, crisp highs and clear and responsive lows, able to answer phone calls clear voice, great for working and playing out side and lounging around house you barely even feel them in your ears.  Great Job, I will definitely promote these to my friends, hell I've already bought a second pair to share with a friend as a Birthday gift, she loves them just as much as I do."
0,"Good sound! Flimsy hooks, the earbuds fall out after every few steps on the treadmill. I tried all 3 sizes. You get what you pay for."
1,"Shipped on time, good sound, convenient size, nice packaging, overall good product and would recommend."
1,Decent headphones for the price. Long battery life so far.
1,"Packaging shows the love for detail. Love the charge cable that works for Iphone and headset. The set came charged and was very easy to pair with my Iphone 7. I was amazed at the sound quality. I love my Bose headsets but this does an amazing job! It fits my ears perfectly and did my first workout with them today. I used to listen to my Iphone through the Apple earbuds, but this was so nice to be able to place my phone on the floor and not in my pocket. Fits perfect and cable hangs conveniently in my neck. More than enough volume!<br />I recommend this to anyone that does not want to compromise sound quality, spent an arm and a leg, and work hands free."
1,"I bought a pair of these headphones almost 2 years ago. I loved them. They replaced the plug-in headphones that I had been using, and I so loved losing the cord. The sound quality was good and the battery lasted long enough between recharges that, unless I forgot to charge them, it was not an issue. However, I loved that pair to death, and when the connection between the two sides died, I asked for and received a new pair as a present.<br /><br />In most ways the new set is as good as the old, but there is now one irritating problem. The new set has different material (they call it ""memory metal"") in the thin, flexible ear-hooks that hold these on your ear. However, the ear hooks are now too flexible. They don't hold their shape well and so the earbuds start to come out. I am constantly having to reach up and try to readjust the earbuds or rebend the ear-hooks to try to hold the earbuds in place better. Now these headphones, rather being something that just does what is needed, have become an constant irritant."
1,"Pros: Sound quality great, Cons: the ear pieces seem a bit larger than other ear buds; the. Cable between the two ear pieces can be irritating on a bare neck."
1,i've only wore them once but they didn't fall out or hurt.  so 5 stars.  im interested to see how well they hold up in a marathon!
1,This is my first set of wireless earphones and they are much better than I thought was possible without wires. The only problem I noticed while out walking is that the music I was listening to would cut out intermittently. Not a major problem but noticeable. The noise cancellation is a lot better than on other wired earphones I own.
0,"They simply did not work for exercise. They paired fine and I played a song through them and everything seemed ok. As soon as I tried to take them out on a run, they simply would not work. My phone was in my flip belt so it isn’t like it was too far away. Every other second, it would cut out. I thought it was a problem with my phone trying to connect to the wifi at my house but even well outside of that range, it was still spotty. I counted and the longest it continually stayed connected and played music was 6 seconds. Other than that it was like someone was changing the radio dial constantly. I’m returning them."
1,"For the price works well. Very acceptable sound and comfortable on ear. Sometimes there is distortion on start up, might be bluetooth connection, but usually works fine."
1,Really comfortable! I use them for bouldering and they are perfect!
1,"I bought cheap ones before and they were trash. Kept losing the signal even when the phone was in my hand or pocket. These bad boys haven't lost a signal yet and hold a good battery life! And they haven't fallen out of my ears, which is awesome. I've had mixed reviews on how well the microphone works, but I'd say they're about 85% positive so I'd still stick with these."
0,"I don't know if I just got a faulty unit, but I'm not about to find out. The audio was muffled and sounded like it was underwater. Even the built-in ""Your headset is now connected"" recording sounded terrible. It sounded like someone had stuck cotton in the earbuds and I was hearing the audio through it. Complete waste of money."
0,"Extremely disappointed. My first set died completely after less than two months, and they were great about replacing them. Now the replacement set has died after just five weeks. Overall, the durability of the product is way below my expectations."
0,Had them for two months; one side stopped working. Ugh
1,I just love the sound. They are awesome. I would recommend these to my family and friends.
1,The sound quality is good and set up was very easy.  I bought them for running and haven't been out yet with them but am hoping they stay in place and don't create a lot of wind noise.
1,I just purchased these ear buds and so far they have been great. I'm glad that I do not have to have the volume all the way up for great sound and they paired very easy to my phone. There's no way that I will ever fall for the gimmicks of the high priced head phones bc they have given to famous people and paid them to do commercials. These are well priced especially with the 1 year warranty.
1,Work find for me
1,"Great sound, easy connectivity and the car charger and mic were welcome additions."
1,"I still have these earphones after 2 years of use. SENSO brand was on Prime and sponsored/ choice, I paid a bit more for these than identical looking options, but I cannot complain. Some people buy $100 dollar earphones that don't last a year and others $10 ones that don't last a week.  So far, so good. I recommend these for everyday use and I usually charge them after 4-5 hours of continuous use. Great Value and experience with my pair."
1,Good one. Gifted my dad. It made him happy.
1,The ear hooks are bit too soft
1,"This is our third pair: one for me, one for my husband, and one for our son. They work that well for us."
1,I would recommend this project.
1,I have went through probably 5 pair in a year and couldn't find a pair that I liked. Well now I have! The volume is great and they stay in place while running or working out. I would definitely buy these again!
1,Sound quality is great and fit great in my ears. Cheap and good quality
1,We bought a 2nd pair! And I'm about to purchase a pair too!
0,"Audio kept cutting out while jogging with phone strapped to my upper arm.  Company emailed me after purchase, and suggested I reply if I had any problems.  I did, and heard nothing back.  I called them, and they walked me through a pointless procedure that did not help at all.  Service rep on line did not care about the problem, did not want me to try to reproduce after pointless procedure, told me to &#34;call back&#34;.  I am returning them, and avoiding this brand in the future.  It failed at the one use case it NEEDED to nail."
1,"Wow! I'm amazed at the sound from these little ear buds. I would preface this review by saying that, if you are using any headphones with a smart phone or PC, you should first of all get yourself an equalizer app for the phone or equalizer software for the PC. It simply will make any headphone set sound better. That being said, these SENSO buds are awesome for sound. I like heavy bass and they give it! I never would have expected sound like this from such a small headphone. The larger headphones like my BEATS are much larger with much bigger drivers to give sound that isn't that much better than these. But remember, if you aren't using an equalizer, you will definitely be missing out their full capability. But even at flat response they are great. I'm not using these for athletics so I can't comment on how they do or don't stay put in my ears other than to say that, while I'm sitting in my easy chair they don't eventually loosen and degrade the sound like some others do. They stay put. Don't hesitate to spend your money on these. I'm sure you'll love them."
0,"Headphones pair with my iPhone 7 2x and then never again. Have been online, completed all possible trouble shooting directives with no success. First Bluetooth headphone purchase and I'm very disappointed. I have no issues with my Bluetooth connectivity re: any other products; i.e. Car, Apple Watch, Bose speaker...just this. Makes me sad. 😔"
1,Works well
1,"Great product.  I travel, work in the yard, go hiking, go to the gym occasionally and these have held up in each place...Heck, I wore them in the sauna and they never fell out or got nasty.<br />Buy these...the sound is great too."
1,"They mirrored the Beats earbuds design, but at an absolute fraction of the cost.  They are just as nice as the Beats (I have now had 4 pairs of Beats and tired of them breaking every few months.  Fool me once...fool me twice...)I decided to give these a shot since they were highly rated (7k+ people can't be wrong, right?).  The case is nice and fits well into a computer bag, the battery life is good, and they stay in my ears during hard workouts.  The one thing to be careful on when you first get them, until you remember not to do it, is not to push the earbuds in by touching the gray button on the outer surface while you are on a phone call.  It will drop the call!  More my fault than anything.  4 out of 5....5 stars is perfect, and I just don't think anything is perfect.  There is always room for improvement."
0,"When the headphones worked, I enjoyed this product.  But be aware, this is not well made to last an entire year.  Please do yourself a favor an read a few of the reviews.  In my case I bought these headphones in June 2017.  In November 2017 they failed.  Because of the warranty, I was sent a new pair.  Now, in July 2018, the replacement pair have failed.  I used these several times a week for running and meetings.  They truly are in perfect condition in appearance.  But in operation, they either do not turn on properly or they do not connect to my bluetooth device properly.  When I presented this issue to their support team, I was turned away because outside of the one year warranty.  So please note, the warranty is related to the original purchase and NOT the individual product itself.  So, the replacement pair I received in Nov 2017 is not covered for one year but only the remainder of the warranty period based on the original purchase.  I think this says something about the product quality.  Also, I am now 13 months out from my original purchase date and Senso is not willing to flex on an issue where a customer has had TWO failed products.  The addage ""you get what you pay for"" is definitely applied but here perhaps it may be better stated, ""you dont get what you paid for"".<br /><br />I cannot recommend these for someone who wants regular usage and dependability. You would be better served at paying a little more for ones that receive solid reviews from other industry reviewers.  True, this product has 27k+ reviews with about a 4.1 rating (as of the date of this review).  But, I have a hunch that my situation is not a outlier.  The headphones have just enough quality to placate the average customer, but for those that need to have regular usage and dependability, this would NOT be the product for you.<br /><br />Again...  stay away...  buyer beware..."
1,"Great product, wish the battery did not die every few days. But if you're someone who can remember to charge them, it is well worth the money. Bass is a amazing, and sounds as good as premium Bluetooth headphones"
1,"I like it very much,"
1,"I tried this headphones with an audio book.  The sound quality from this headphones is clear.  For me, the headphones is not comfortable.  I have small ears, and small ear canals.  Even with the smallest ear buds, the headphones is still too full in my ears.  The ear hooks hover over my ears.  I think for someone with larger ears, this headphones could be quite comfortable.  It's a good quality headphones though."
1,Very nice product excellent sound quality
1,The ear phones are really great  and the connectivity is  so smooth that it connects in just a click
1,Easy to use and well-designed as well as well-priced.--ES
0,"I bought these a couple of years ago and was seriously impressed with the value for money. Sadly I lost my pair and had to get some new ones. The updated version has inflexible rubber bands that are hard to wrap around your ears, they sit uncomfortably around the ear and don't feel secure. The sound quality is not as good and the on/off message isn't as clear. Very disappointed. The original headphones were superior."
1,Excellent value.<br />Works well. Battery seems to last long.<br />Sound quality is excellent.<br />Seems better suited for indoor use.<br />Design allows a bit of wind noise outdoors.
0,These suddenly stopped working on August 23.  I take perfect care of them and they barely lasted two months.  I am extremely disappointed.
1,The SENSO Bluetooth headphones have great sound and very good battery life.<br />The controls take a bit of getting used to but overall this is a fine product.
1,"Thus far, after a few runs, all is well. They come with several sizes of buds to accommodate most including a pair of foam (I'm assuming more of the noise canceling type). The loop is a bit large which means that it doesn't fit as snugly as I'd prefer when running but if that's the greatest issue they're pretty good. I've not had the pleasure of running in the rain with them yet to test their water rating but sweat has done nothing so far. I also like that they came with a clip to hook the cord to my shirt to shorten it up."
1,"Ken, I'm happy to leave a review.  I received thr headphones the other day.  I like the packaging,box and carry case.  Also appreciate the accessorys including the charge cord I can use with other devices. And the two USB charge plug.  All seam to be good quality.  I have listened to some of my favorites on my play list with the headphones for several hours and really enjoyed the sound quality,volume and range.  Comfortable fit too.  (bought red model )  Later that day I ordered another pair for a gift and had them shipped to my son  I also ordered another pair for myself to keep on my motorcycle.  I would like to know if there is anyway to have two pair play from the same bluetooth phone source  That way two up on the bike could listen to the same music source.  I've tryed after receiving the second pair, both pair show up to allow connection but only one at a time will play.  It would be great to figure out or have the tech software to allow for this type of use.  So far very pleased with the sound,quality and use ability at the price you sell them for."
1,"Seemed like a great product, but too bulky for my ears. Had to return them. I would purchase a smaller version if available."
0,"I bought these for my wife for Christmas for use with her iPhone 7. She used them 2 times and they came unpaired from her phone. We now cannot get them to go into pair mode again. Also cannot do a factory reset on them. I have followed the manual precisely, and the only explanation I can come up with is they are defective.<br /><br />Update: I called their customer service dept. which was very helpful. After having me try several things to get them to pair again they confirmed they were defective. They are sending a new pair within 5-7 business days."
1,"Sound is great, noise block is great, volume is great."
1,I have only had these for about a month and a half. I had to forget the device on my phone about 3 times. It disconnects but customer service says it's normal. Overall these do the job. They work fine and sound good. Customer service responds quickly which is nice. Great buy for cheap earphones.
1,&#34;Great headphones! They completely block out the sound around me. They just took a while to get my order shipped. :( Worth the wait though!&#34;
1,This is the best pair of bluetooth I have had. It conforms to my ears making workouts wearing it less distracting (for always having to readjust). Very good sound quality and a southern accent for voice cues :)
0,2ed pair won't work
1,"These are the best. Very comfortable, very clear. And they stay on my ears when I am running. The best."
0,The headphones work pretty well. But they died after about 6 months. I would have been better off spending a little bit more money to get headphones that would last more than 6 months.
1,Sound is very good from tablet and phone.
0,"I used these earbuds for about a month at which point the ear bugs constantly crack.  As it turns out, if I touch the wired connection between the ear-bugs this triggers the crackle.  It is very disappointing to get just over a month of usage (maybe three occasions) before they failed."
0,It has been returned.
1,"Pros: Easy to set up and Pair, Sound Quality, Length of time listening on overnight charge, Proce<br /><br />Cons: a little bulky but manageable"
1,"Work fine, but at roughly 20% battery remaining will start issuing loud low battery alerts seemingly every 30 seconds, an extremely annoying feature making the headphones unusable at that point."
1,"I loved this when I first received it, Sound was terrific and stayed charged for a while.  This past month the headphones will not stay plugged into the charger, so I am no longer able to use the headphones"
1,Sound quality is great! nice little package with some bonus items included.
1,good fit and work great!
0,"Ear pieces are way too floppy, provide no support.  The left side won't even stay on my ear, just falls off.<br />I basically have to charge it after every run, or the battery won't make it thru the next days run.<br />The sound quality is good, but overall pretty dissatisfied with the product."
1,"I love these headphones.  They fit well in my ears, the sound is very clear, they are easy to charge, they come in a nice carrying case and the price was really good.  They were also shipped very quickly.  Cannot go wrong with these, I highly recommend them."
1,"I've consistently gone to the gym about 6 to 7 days a week over the past two years using powerbeats2 and then powerbeats3 wireless headsets during my workouts. I do free weights and end each workout with cardio on the treadmill, elliptical, or speed bike...mostly treadmill. For those Powerbeats users out there you know about the battery issues with these headsets. I have presently gone through 5 different Beats Powerbeats wireless headsets during the past two years.  First headset was purchased through Target, which it stopped holding a charge after 8 months.  I sent to Apple for repair but they promptly returned that said to me saying there was a small hairline crack at the base therefore not covered by the warranty.  I purchased my second Powerbeats on Craigslist from someone who received it free with his iPhone purchase.  That headset lasted about 6 months before it stopped holding a charge  I have since gone through three sets purchased at Costco, returning the last one two weeks ago due to same battery issues and the headset not holding its charge.  Costco presently does not have these headsets in stock.<br /><br />I purchased this Senso wireless headset for my wife as a Christmas gift.  I wasn't sure if she would like the over-the-ear wireless so I didn't want to spend $160 for Powerbeats. She doesn't know this but I've been using this Senso headset over the past two weeks at the gym and have feedback how it compares to the Powerbeats 3 headset.<br /><br />First thing I noticed about this headset is the sound. There's definitely more bass coming through the headset and overall it's louder compared to the Powerbeats.  Flexible hooks that go over the ear are thicker and more stable with the Powerbeats 3. The Powerbeats definitely has a tighter fit around the ear.  The ear buds for both models feel identical to me and both fit snugly inside the year.  Both sets are sweat-proof and for the most part stay on the ear while I'm running.<br /><br />The biggest difference I noticed that favors Powerbeats is the range in which the headset receives the signal from my Samsung Note 5 smartphone. For example with Powerbeats I can easily walk 30 to 40 feet away from my phone and get absolutely no disruption in my music.  The Senso headset starts to have distortion after about 15 feet. I will say though that with my wife's iPhone I actually found the range of the Senso farther than the Powerbeats.<br /><br />I would suggest Senso consider including the cable/wire attachment to allow for tightening of the cable against the back of head for stability or under the chi  depending on how you wear them.  I actually took an extra cable attachment that I had from my Powerbeats and used with this Senso. Without that the wires would be dangling and bouncing back and forth while I'm running.<br /><br />One annoying thing I noticed on this headset is the plastic cover leading to the charge input. Powerbeats2 had this issue and it was corrected with Powerbeats 3 version. I found it very difficult to uncover the outlet to charge this headset so I ended up ripping it off...much better now.<br /><br />What I loved about Senso is the hard cover case they included. Powerbeats 3 started to include a soft case which is an absolute joke. I was very pleased with the hard case that came with this Senso headset.<br /><br />Conclusion.... aside from the range and the feel compared to Powerbeats with his headset, I am actually considering purchasing a Senso set for myself and getting away from Powerbeats at $160.  Of course I'll have to revise this review and see how long the battery lasts and the durability of this headset but so far I've been actually very pleased the two weeks that I've been using this headset."
1,Sound is great.  The fit is comfortable and the price couldn't be beat.  They were really easy to set up too.
1,use these every day at the gym and they work great! I have pretty small ears but they stay in just fine. i do HIIT workouts as well as run on the treadmill. every once in awhile i need to adjust them but they have never fallen out. the sound is really good. I also take them on the plane with me when i travel so when someone has to get out i don't get tangled up in my headphone wires! haha  keeps out the noise of crying babies quite well :)
1,"Sound is great, but I have to adjust during running and the brand is very popular in my neck of the woods and have seen / talked to others and it's not perfect, but very good.  That being said it baffles me that nobody can quite figure out good sound and a super tight fit for joggers, but maybe it's my big head that causes issues :)"
1,Only lasted 5 months. You get what you pay for I guess.
1,AAAAAAAA
1,"It is not fitting well on my left ear. It keeps falling down. At times, my ears are hurting as well."
1,Exactly what I was looking for.  The receiver is on the right side and noticed it's best to have my phone in the right pocket.  It's light and has great sound.<br /><br />***update***<br />Had them a year now.  I use them strictly for yard work.  Microphone works great.  Battery lasts at least 5 hours continuous music play.  Good base and sound quality.  They do tend to move forward slightly and I have to seat them in my ear again.  I live in hot humid Houston and I sweat a lot.  Never an issue water/sweat.<br /><br />***2 years now and still would buy them again***
1,"Okay, clearly this is a review for the headphones but honestly, one thing that gave this product 5 stars is their excellent customer service and there is nothing better than buying a product and knowing that merchant will take care of any question, comment, or concern that you might have and this company definitely excels at it and deserve to be acknowledged for it. But other than that, these headphones are probably the greatest headphones you can get at such a reasonable price. The quality is superb, I can barely hear myself speak and definitely excel in the low to mid ranges to give you really good bass. The look and setup is simple and nice and sleek and overall an amazing product. Definitely recommend to anyone looking for incredible headphones at a resonable price with amazing customer service."
1,"I am very pleased with the SENSO Bluetooth Headphones, the sound quality is great as well as the craftsmanship, operation and linking is very intuitive and and the signal range from Headphones to cell are within my expected working limits especially at the gym which is my intended use of said device. I dropped the SENSO Headphones in a water filled sink and was pleased to learn that no damaged was caused by the water immersion. I've used the SENSO Headphones for five continuous hours without any sound or signal degradation that I can think of. Comfort is important especially at the gym and I have to say that the SENSO Headphones felt quite comfortable and caused no irritation around my ears, I noticed that among the different ear buds that come standard with the SENSO Headphones the was a separate small plastic baggie which contains a different kind of ear buds, this particular set is made out of foam and resembles the same kind of foam plugs that someone would wear for hearing protection, they're small and fit in my ear canal just right, and the best part is that they're able drown out all outside noise while the music is at a descent level. I would like to see a more advanced and powerful SENSO Headphone set from Invotek in the future that has over the ears coverage but for now I'm enjoying this set with no problems."
1,"Love the sound quality, rich bass. Comfortable, easy to set up. Interesting dual charging cord for both I phone and android very clever. Excellent timely service and delivery!"
1,"I absolutely love these headphones. They were quick and easy to set up, and the sound is fantastic. I've historically had problems keeping traditional earbuds seated properly in my ears, especially when exercising, but with the ear hook and different size ear pieces, these fit perfectly and are extremely comfortable. Thank you for making such an excellent product at such a reasonable price!"
1,Somehow these survived the Washing machine! Best non-True Wireless Earbuds!
0,"I recieved this product yesterday.  followed all directions.  the unit will not power on.  the unit charges, but as soon as you try and turn it on it goes dead."
0,Broke after a month.<br /><br />Don't buy these they are extremely poor.
1,So far so good
1,"Finally an affordable and reliable set of wireless headphones for the gym!  Easy to set up, comfortable to wear, great sound and most importantly they DO NOT FALL OUT when I'm busting it on the treadmill or rowing machine!  Bravo SENSO, you figured it out where so many have failed!"
1,Senso buds are great! i love them for running. i have small ears but the buds still stay in them. highly recommend!
1,I use mine everyday to the point of wearing buttons down  this pair OMG. Ear loops are 2 different sizes  thank God they are bendable to wrap around ears
0,Sound is good. They don't fit good around my ears. I have to keep adjusting them.
1,"I have two pairs because the first pair was perfect. Sound was good, and fit my ear pretty well considering I could be mistaken as having the ears of a 2 year old.<br />However, bought a second set and only one of the ear buds works consistently. Still not bad for the money, but a little disappointed."
1,Great sound. Great service
1,easy setup.. good sound quality....quick shipping....excellent customer service... and you get some cool extras like car charger and dual cable for charging....
1,"Dollar for dollar, I think that these headphones are the best value/quality out on the market!"
1,"I've used them for a couple of workouts now and I really like these headphones!  They stay put, sound is pretty good, they are easy to use, definitely make answering a phone call mid workout much easier."
1,"I've only used these headphones for one day, but so far they have worked great! It's nice to not deal with a cord and the sound quality is wonderful! My only complaint is that if the device you're using (I was using an Ipod) is connected to WiFi and you're having problems with the WiFi (I was being kicked off and on again) you will hear a quiet clicking noise from the headphones each time you are disconnected and reconnected. It wasn't super noticeable, but I could still hear it. Other than that, great product!"
1,"Once I found the driver for my computer, they worked great.  They sync right away with my phone and fire stick with no problems.  If I go too far away, I have to reset them when I return or they stay crackly, but they are very easy to reset."
1,Pretty much exactly what I was looking for. Simple headphones that I can wear during workouts and whenever else. They have good sound quality and are comfortable.
1,"I've only had these for a few days but my initial impression is that these are an incredible value for the price. Easy to charge, easy to pair with multiple devices, and the multiple included ear tips ensure a good fit and comfort. Best thing - they sound very good too, no complaints in the audio department."
1,love love love them.
1,These headphones are amazing. I have smaller ears and love that come with different size ear pieces. Sound and quality is great! Would recommend these to anyone!
1,I love this thing!  Easy to use and it’s just awesome. Helps me get all my cleaning around the house done. I use it for work conference calls too. It’s great.
1,"I've bought these mainly for running. It works really well with my android phone. Pairing was as breeze and sound quality is surprisingly good for a Bluetooth gadget.<br />Light-weight, does not chafe after hours, and the battery lasts for AT LEAST 4 hours (might be more, I only used it for four hours in a row) :)<br />Silicone tips are good quality, though if you want true(er) noise cancellation buy foam tips.<br />The silicone 'earhooks' look flimsy but they hold the headphone in place, just fine. I run with a headband, and if you stuck these under it, the headset stays in place even if you are doing trail running.<br />Waterproof? Yes. I usually just pop into the shower with them on, don't bother switching off the music. Also, an hour long drizzle didn't even phase it, so win-win.<br />Packaging and carry case is nice (extra thumbs-up for the carbon fiber look!), buttons are well placed, easily distinguishable.<br />Volume levels and Bass is surprisingly good for a Bluetooth headphone and the built-in mic works fine even in windy conditions.<br /><br />All in all, I am super happy with it, would buy it again."
1,"Decent for a cheap set of Bluetooth earbuds. Easy to pair and use. Audio quality is pretty muddy and bad, especially at the mid-range (to be expected for the price). There seem to be a lot of similar-looking, cheap Bluetooth earbuds around this price range, which might be separated by what accessories they come with. This pair has a cable for charging the headphones or an iPhone, a carrying case, and a car adapter.<br />There is nothing special that would make me buy this (or any other cheap Bluetooth headset) again.<br /> If you just need sound in your ears when you work out and aren't picky about audio quality, you could go for these."
1,Product works as advertised
1,Good device
1,2nd review has echo sound during talking on the phone.<br />Music excellent sound
1,Really like these! I never have to adjust them while running and they don’t hurt my ears.
1,Perfect
0,Can't rate the product but this is how the item looked when we received it.
1,These are amazing. Great sound quality and battery life. I ran into a problem with the earphones about 6 months in and the company swapped them out almost immediately. Excellent and friendly customer service
1,I received the product as expediently as I hope. Thank you!
0,Great Sound but broke 2 weeks after owning them.
1,great sound
1,Just got them. They sound great and comfortable. Bringing them on vacation soon to get real test
1,These headphones are incredible. This is my first pair of Bluetooth headphones and I have always been skeptical of what the sound quality would be like on Bluetooth. These headphones are SIGNIFICANTLY less expensive than my BOSE headphones (which are not wireless) and the sound quality is just as good if not better. They are truly noise cancelling and the ability to control the music from the earpiece is fantastic. This is the best purchase I've made in a long time and I would highly recommend them to anyone.
1,So far so good linked up with my iPhone 6 with no problem great sound love it so far
1,"I love these headphones! I have a really hard time with keeping headphones inside of my ear because my ear holes are really small. These stay in great! Even when I am running, I feel comfortable and I don't even have to worry about them. It's so convenient to be able to adjust the volume and change the song without taking your phone out as well. I can't have my phone out at work but I can listen to music so it's perfect for what I ned. The rubber on the ear part is hard to clean but I'll let that slide because they work so well. I also wish they had a longer run time because I will use them at work and while exercising and I feel like I always have to recharge them."
1,Product came as described. Very pleased
1,Good quality earphones they do not slip. Only lasted one year and I took very good care of them
1,I love my earbuds!!  They sound great and are comfortable!!
0,"I was really excited when I first received these, they looked nice, with the case, but they were very disappointing. They kept falling out of my ears and really are made too big for a woman, in my opinion. The right ear broke quickly, after not much wear."
1,"Great sound, working perfectly."
1,FANTASTIC!!!
1,"Lost my Bose, bought this as a replacement.  Sound quality and battery life are comparable so far.  Will update if that changes.  Very happy with this purchase."
1,"It is a nice product, but not good for swimming. Stop working after few minutes in the pool."
1,"These were great for a little while, but i noticed that the sound quality slowly degraded over time. They also don't fit snug on my ears, I used these to workout and I would have to constantly readjust them. FYI, I have pretty large ears. I'm writing this view as I'm trying to power them on, but they're not charging or turning : ( RIP."
1,"First off the price was a little deceiving since it could keep some buyers from thinking the quality might not be there, but these are high quality headphones with a low budget price.  You can't ask for a better combination.  Would recommend to all audiophiles.  I<br />took a chance and was surprisingly rewarded.&#34; Shipping and packaging were excellent. Quality headphones with very good noise cancellation. Can't beat the price. &#34;"
1,"These Bluetooth headphones are very nice for the money.  I’ve owned a pair for almost two years now and because of their performance I bought a pair for my wife.  I use mine when doing chores around the house listening to music from my iPhone.  They’re light weight and might seem very cheap but the switchgear are sturdy, have held up, and still feel as new.  They paired easily with both my iPhone and iPad.  I’m not much of an audiophile but the sound produced is just fine for me.  I know I’ve easily gotten 6 to 7 hours battery life a few times although I rarely have them on for more than 3 or 4.  I usually charge them immediately after I use them.  Battery life has not been an issue for me.  There was a time when the device had trouble pairing or staying connected.  Did some research and did a factory reset of some type (I don’t recall the procedure).  I have never had to reset it again.  Rarely use them for phone conversations but they worked fine the few times I have.  Been very happy with this purchase.  I’ve gotten a lot of satisfaction for very little money."
1,These are great but after awhile my ears hurt from using them.
0,I had problems pairing with my Apple Watch and phone. I thinking about returning them.
1,Great headphones - they work as advertised and I would buy them again in a heartbeat!
1,"These ear phones are great at the jump (as you can read from other reviews), i can say just over a year into owning them that one ear stopped working. No accident happened, it just stopped working. So, either buy the extended warranty or plan on buying a new pair each year. These ear phones are great, but their lack of longevity steals 2 stars."
1,"I cannot mention noise canceling because I only use them in a quiet environment, but otherwise they are wonderful. Comfortable, they stay on my ears where they should, different sized tips give me choice, the sound is great, they connect every time. Highly recommended"
1,These have worked great! Easy to set up and use.
1,I've had these headphones for a few weeks now. I've fully charged them and used them at least 5x working out for at least 30 mins or longer. They are pretty good noise cancellation headphones so be careful where you wear them - probably not a good idea to wear them walking around in public. I like them and they are comfy.
1,Didn't last long. Battery couldn't hold a charge after a couple of months.
0,"These headphones are unusable. Trying to use them with amazon music on an iphone, the minimum volume setting is deafening. No way to turn volume down enough to use them. Contacted Senso and they were no help. Said to do a reset, which I did, but it makes no change.<br /><br />Trying to research this problem, it seems to be common with lower priced headphones. I will be looking for headphones that specifically say they can be adjusted to a reasonable volume when used with iphone. Buyer beware."
1,I bought the Bluetooth ear buds after a lot of research. Most cheaper ones had poor reviews. This one had better reviews. The voice/ Audio quality was good but the mic was not good. People on other side complained that they could hear constantly some background noise although I was in quite surroundings. Setup was easy and it was fully charged on arrival. I gave it 3 as good audio and timely delivery plus accessories.but poor mic and not good for business calls. I have returned it and may have to buy something pricey for my professional calls
1,They fit great and don't fall out while I'm exercising. Very good price and product.
1,Get what you pay for. Muddy bass and sound quality. Low battery life.
1,Good product works well.
0,"I’ve had these 2 months, now static I noticed at the beginning has gotten worse.  They disconnect and connect frequently along with the static.  Not good!"
1,"These headphones have an amazing battery life and sound great. The bass is great compared to most other Bluetooth headphones. The case is nice and small so it's easy to carry around. The one negative thing I can say about these is that I haven't had the best experience when using them for running. They tend to slowly come loose, they don't fall out but you have to keep adjusting them. Given that I'm not a runner, however, and that I hardly ever run this isn't much of a downside for me."
1,I love my new headphones!<br />They wrap around the ear and go in the ear so they won’t fall out when I’m running like my last pair.<br />They are easy to charge and I love the carrying case since it goes in my purse easily.
1,"I'm a very active runner and have sent back a few pairs of Bluetooth headphones I've bought from Amazon in the past. Mainly for them not staying on very well.<br /><br />Prior to this purchase I was using Motorola S11 Bluetooth headphones and I was happy with those but they quit charging. I didn't feel like spending the extra money on a new pair.<br /><br />I've now been using the Senso Bluetooth headphones for a few weeks with no issues. For the price, the sound is excellent. The headphones fit securely on my ears and are pretty comfortable. The only time they became a little lose was towards the end of a 5.5 mile run. With all the sweat they were a little less snug but still good enough for me especially considering the price.<br /><br />I am giving this product 5 starts solely based on the price. Excellent bang for your buck. I would buy these again!"
1,"I've heard better sound but not at this price point.  Easy to pair, decent sound,  straight forward controls and nice complement of accessory (cables, car charger)."
1,good items  and good seller<br />working good - 6 hr of running music
1,"Love, love, love. Fit perfect"
1,Have had them almost a year and have used them every day still out preforming my Sony and Bose and great sound quality highly recommend
1,Well just about 2 months in and it cuts out on the left side. Wish they last longer I liked these. UPDATE company sent me a replacement in no time
1,We bought these for my husband to use when he mows the yard. He is able to put his phone in his pocket and use the headphotos without the cable being in the way. The sounds is great. He can hear the music well even above the sound of the lawnmower.
1,"I've been looking for a good, but inexpensive set of Bluetooth headphones.  And frankly, I didn't do a lot of research before I bought these.  In fact, I was sitting in a local bar, drinking a beer and looking at wireless headphones on my phone's Amazon app.  But the Senso headphones seemed to be a good bargain at less than $40, so what the heck, I ordered them.  I've used them for about week now and I have mostly good things to say about them.  First, of course, is the price.  That's a positive.  Next, they are reasonably comfortable when being worn.  They come with three sets of ear plugs, so you can probably find a size that will allow them to remain in your ear canal.  Having the part that fits over your ear is also nice, as that piece holds the headphones fairly stable.<br /><br />You also get some very nice accessories along with the product.  Two charging cables, a car charger with two charging ports and a very nice case for the device.<br /><br />I also must say that the sound quality of these headphones is excellent and loud.  Music that sounded tinny coming from my wired earphones sounded much richer out of the Senso.  Also, they are much louder.  When mowing the yard and listening to music or talk radio, I had to turn the volume on the phone completely up to hear over the drone of the mower motor.  Now, with the Senso, I have to reduce the volume.<br /><br />The reason I deducted one star from my review is that the battery life isn't nearly 8 hours, as advertised by the company.  I estimate I got 4 1/2 to 5 hours on a charge.  Not too bad, I suppose, but as I've never owned a set of these before, I have no other product to compare it with. Still, the headphones charge quickly, but if you're like me and use them at a gym, I'd recommend being diligent in charging them or carrying a good old-fashioned pair of wired earphones with you as a backup in case the Senso goes out on you.  But, all in all, I'd buy this product again."
1,I use them on my daily walk that's 30 to 45 mins long and listen to music.  They are much more comfortable than my old pair which was a different brand...
1,These are awesome and work perfect for me. I often have to be very mobile with my job and these I can tuck under my collar and they never fall off from my neck.
1,"These headphones are awesome for the price. They come with a lightning cable adapter (micro usb to lightning), two micro usb cables, a carrying case, several earbud options, a carrying case, and a car charger. On top of that, the audio is surprisingly good, nothing you’d get out of a several hundred dollar pair of headphones of course, but definitely good. The audio controls all work as well, which is a big plus."
1,Headphones were an amazing value. I’m an acitve long distance runner and the clarity was crystal clear and fit was good. I had gotten more expensive headphones previously and would hear skipping as I ran. This is not the case with these. Would definitely recommend!!
1,"Great customer service. My first pair worked really well but only lasted 2 months. I talked to the support team and they sent a replacement right away.  Besides the first pair breaking, I have been really happy with the product. I used a beats wireless headset before this and I think they sound very similar and a fraction of the price. Like I said earlier, GREAT customer service."
1,"Headphones are great, but I lost the small charger, and the longer cable has a lightning connector end rather than a micro USB. And the lightning connector won't even charge my iPhone. Thanks Senso!"
1,Worked great for 7 months.  After that the headphones would no longer connect to any Bluetooth devices.
1,purchased mine in March and now they are on the blink.
1,"Sound is good. Good bass. Good battery life, but low battery warning comes far too little battery life left. Only about 15 mins remaining after you hear it. Ear hooks are very cheap rubber and cannot be shaped to fit ear, so may not stay behind ear. Silicon earbuds are large, and falls out after a while of running. Fixed angle of the buds cannot be adjusted. Rubber connector between the phones is constantly twisted."
1,They work great for the money.
0,"Very poor. This was the second pair i bought.  They melted will charging. Had to throw them away.  Bought Beats, much better."
1,"First and foremost I listen to music, in general, a lot.  Additionally, I normally work out pretty regularly and have had numerous pairs of headphones over the years die from when I sweat and the headphones would get &#34;wet&#34;.  The best way I can describe these headphones is this, have you ever bought a pair of shoes or jeans that were so comfortable you bought a 2nd?  Just in case of the off chance you weren't able to find them again?  That's how I've been with headphones for a long time, but with these I'm going to buy at least one more pair, if not two just to be safe.  Phenomenal sound quality.  Sound just as good, if not better since they're cheaper, than Beats Solo2, IMO."
1,The sound is very clear and rarely slips.  Easy to sync with the phone.  I have not figured out how to answer the phone when listening but bought for podcasts while I exercise.
1,Incredibly powerful headphones.
1,I’m doing this for a free arm band
1,Comfortable and work great!
1,"Best battery life of any bluetooth headphones in this price range.<br /><br />Had some durability issues, but company was swift to offer replacement."
0,"This is the second pair of these headphones I’ve bought. The first pair worked beautifully.  I had no problems with them. I only brought this pair because I thought I had lost the first. Unfortunately these headphones are constantly losing connection with my phone, even though my phone is 3 feet way. If move my head the wrong way they lose connection and power off. Since I use these for working out, this happens constantly.  I found my old pair, so these are going in the trash. I should have returned them when I had the chance."
1,Great sound at an affordable price!
1,"Not a techy, but this was easy to set up.  Great sound, and so nice not to be tethered to my phone at the gym."
1,"Love the headphones, perfect for workout."
1,"Great sound quality, light weight, and very easy to setup & use."
1,Light weight n easy to use!
1,"great...i have bought 4 sets thus far, and turn about charging them for constant use"
1,"They work, don't fall out easily, and sound pretty good. I'm sure they are perfect for a lot of out door activities, but I wear these when I'm riding my bike, and unfortunately, the design seems to funnel the wind into my ears, which drowns out the music a bit. I haven't worn them in the rain yet, so no comment yet on how they hold up."
1,Love them. I wore them on a walk yesterday with my dog and talked to a friend the whole time. She said I sounded great even with blowers being used a few times by neighbors. The sound is very good too. I love that they didn't get twisted with the dog leash like the cord from my other ear phones. They come with all sorts of cool things like a car plug for the phone and multiple ear pieces of different sizes. Also a great carry cas. Very pleased. I think they are just as good as my daughters which cost three times as much.
1,Very happy with them. Sound quality is surprisingly good.  Easy to use.  Have not been able to test battery life but hope to soon.
1,These are the greatest..  They fit comfortably around the ear and provide excellent sound.  The bluetooth component works perfectly with a touch of a button on the ear.
1,"Clear sound, holds a longer charge, good fit."
1,I like them very much.  I finally found these that fit my ears and don't fall off.
1,I ware these so that I can listen to the radio while I work during the day. They are absolutely perfect for this job. My only con is the little rubber stopper that fits over the USB port. It is very difficult to get open!
1,product arrived well ahead of time and packaged well.  I'm sure my guest recipient will love them as a gift from their list next week!<br />They were impressed with the write-up for this product and will be happy to use them immediately!
1,"This is a crowded category, with products that come and go daily. They look identical but the manufacturing quality varies wildly. I’m now one of three people in my little office who have gone for the Senso Buds. They work great with phone or computer Bluetooth and Skype. They hold a good signal in most conditions and don’t drop and reconnect like other headsets. Battery life is around five hours of music. The sound is quite good. To do better, you’d probably have to spend 4x as much."
1,"Great quality, sound, and value for the  money. Easy set up and great sound."
1,Very good deal. Easy to pair with my phone and tablet.
0,"I am returning these. The piece that wraps around the left ear is misaligned-- so it keeps falling off the ear. You can tell that it's not aligned correctly when you compare it to the right piece-- the right piece curves in more so that it wraps closer around the ear (see attached picture).  They're not moldable so you can't manipulate it to to the shape of your ear. Also, when I was trying to adjust them on my ears, the sound kept cutting out. I think their quality control needs to be reviewed."
1,"I like the ear pieces. However,  I wish they were slimmer.  It's very hard to wear my motorcycle Helmer with them in my ear. The reason why I bought them was to wear with my helmet,  so I could have a Bluetooth set.  Do you have any suggestions?"
1,Very pleased with the product. The earpiece fits perfect for all my activities and haven't had to worry about it falling. I've done a multitude of workouts to test it's stability and it's worked great!<br /><br />I wish there was a feature to show the battery life because I've forgot how long I've used the device and find out that I need to charge it when I need it.
1,Bought these for my husband for when he runs. He loves them.
1,"Great set of headphones, no problem connecting them, sound great!"
1,Easy to set up and to use. Very comfortable.
1,"Work excellently, the sound is good, connection great, price great, and battery lasts.  The only thing I wish for was that they were fully waterproof, plus my ears rarely fit any kinds of buds well so thank goodness for the hooks around the ears."
1,Much better than PowerBeats3. I bought PowerBeats3 with $134 and was struggling to connect it with my windows laptop. This connected smoothly and is a great product.
1,"love them. long battery life, and clear sound"
1,These work great!  I had them out of the box and linked to my phone in about 5 minutes.  The only negative is that the volume switches on the right ear piece are opposite of what you'd think.  The button toward your face lowers the volume.
0,"They work good indoors, but for some reason when I'm out doors, they cut on and off,  I'm going to return mine because its not what I wanted."
1,These headphones are really great.  I am a senior and can never really hear everything anymore.  It has been so wonderful to be able to listen and understand every word in a movie that is being played on my tablet.  Have not tried to pair with my TV yet.  Also was impressed with the quick assistance I received when I had a few questions.  Mike was very patient and helpful.  This product has really improved my life.  Thank you
1,"I really like these headphones!  My only beef is I'm having trouble getting the left earbud to stay in place.  No, it doesn't come completely off of my ear, but the bud pulls away from my ear canal a bit after working out for 20 or more minutes.  I'm not marking down the product, however, for 2 reasons:<br /><br />1. I think the problem is with my ear and not the earbuds.  The bud in the right ear fits snuggly and comfortably.<br /><br />2.  They provide 3 different bud sizes.  I've tried all 3 and no matter what I do it still comes a bit loose.  So, they've done their due diligence to ensure their customers find a bud that properly fits their ears.  Kudos!<br /><br />The sound quality is very good for the price point ... probably superior to others at the same price point as other reviewers have noted.  The noise cancelling capabilities are very good as well.<br /><br />Additionally, the customer service is outstanding.  I had an issue within the first couple of days (turned out to be a signal interference issue) and they responded with a solution within 24 hours.  They've also checked in on me more than once to ask how I'm enjoying the product."
1,Like it !! The sound is really nice.
0,"I run daily and rely on wireless head phones.  They were very comfortable, battery life was great and I really liked them.  One day while running they just stopped working.  I thought maybe the battery just died, but it was weird since usually a voice comes up telling you ahead of time that ""battery low.""  After that event I went to recharge them in the car and the light did not come on showing that it was charging.  I tried to charge at home on another adaptor but still no luck.  My biggest mistake was setting them aside and not returning them immediately.  Time passed and by the time I got around to sending them back, the time had passed so I was out a few bucks.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I did try ordering another pair from another company and they were basically the same product with a different logo on them.  I'd say keep away from any of the brands out there that look like this product because that 2nd pair I got did the same thing but only after 1 week.  I was quick to return those though, so I'll get my money back."
1,"I have been using a Bluetooth device with my cell phone for years, having done through a number of  Motorola and a Plantronics in-ear units, dating back to my Blackberry days.  My last one died after 2.5 years, so I needed a replacement.<br /><br />Being an older person with (sadly) declining hearing, I decided to investigate a full two-ear unit. I looked at several options on Amazon, then found the SENSO product via the handy ratings, and decided they were worth a try given other's ratings and a very reasonable price.<br /><br />Shipping took longer than I hoped (not a Prime product at the time), but they got here in just over a week.<br /><br />My first test was sound quality; I paired them with my laptop and spun up some classic Indigo Girls via YouTube. The sound quality far exceeded my expectations - really very, very good quality! Not quite that of higher-end good value headphones, but my satisfaction is high.<br /><br />Very light weight and extremely comfortable. The standard size ear buds are just right for me, and they stay right in place. A vast improvement over my previous single ear/in ear devices - for comfort, staying in place, and sound quality.<br /><br />I have marginal cell service at my house, so I tried them in my car, calling my spouse. The sound quality on my end was exceptional, like never before - very night and day, and the combination of greater volume and sound in both ears made it a totally new experience! I was a little concerned about how well the mic would function, but my spouse reported I sounded just tine to her. I have not yet tried them in a windy environment, but spring is coming and my car windows will come down soon.<br /><br />The SENSO headphones allow me to use a single unit when away from home, as opposed to the BT device for calls and ear buds for stereo music.<br /><br />Very well designed compact case.<br /><br />My only question is whether or not the full headphone nature of the device are legal when driving my auto; headphones per se are not legal in my state, but hands free devices are required when driving and using your cell phone. I think it will not be an issue with me, as I very almost never use my cell while driving; I can always make or return a call at a safer stationary location.<br /><br />Getting used to the small buttons on the right ear bud to adjust volume is no better or worse than my previous devices. I usually set the bluetooth device near full volume, and then adjust sound level on my cell phone.<br /><br />Far exceeded my expectations!"
1,Headphones have great sound and I love the dual head charger.  Ear wraps could be a bit more firm but overall great headphones for the price!
0,"I had high hopes for these, based on many of the reviews, but the reality has gone down since I began using the headphones. These started out great, and the sound is definitely a pro of the product. My main issues, of why I wouldn't go higher than 2 stars, is that the battery life isn't as advertised and the fit is pretty poor. The flexible ear hooks would be nice, if they weren't so darn large! I've tried all three of the ear buds, thinking a change may help, but the ear hooks are definitely not comfortable and I'm constantly having to fix them so the headphones don't fall out/off. Not the best design for everyone, although I'm sure others find this appealing.<br /><br />I would certainly return them, if I had the chance, but at this point I'm stuck. Certainly buyer's remorse..."
1,"Great product, especially for the low cost. Easy to pair, comfortable and secure, very good sound."
1,These work really well & with the various bud sizes you can find the right fit for your ear.  I will say that if you pair these with a smart watch wear it on your right wrist otherwise the bluetooth may not be able to go through your body & the music will cut out & have a lot of static.  I normally wear my watch on the left but switch it when working out & I have no problems.  Even with that I give 5 stars.  Not the earbud's fault.
1,"Absolutely love these headphones. I was a little skeptical at first about the ear piece, but once I received them I realized they didn't fall off. I wear these while working out, if you see me don't talk to me because I won't be able to hear you with them on :) I love the sound quality also. Trying to get my husband to convert.<br /><br />Had to get a new pair of these since I lost them while moving. The news ones are made different. The material appears more durable and the flap that goes around the ear actually stays put this time. I love them. Only con is the charging cable that comes with it doesn't fit at all into the port. I have to use my cell charger to charger them. Otherwise, they are great, sound is impeccable."
1,"Was very well packaged,easy to pair with my iPhone 7,fits well on my ears,very happy with the sound quality and did not irritate my ears when in use<br />Very good value for what I got and I am very pleased with my purchase"
1,"Exactly what I was looking for!! Great value for the dollar, will buy again!!"
1,Amazing headphones ! They are awesome
0,some of the worst fitting head phones I have ever baught
1,Product is as claims- have had no problems with these earbuds
1,"Great product for the price, i have owned several Bluetooth sets and this one so far has preformed beyond my expectations i would definitely purchase in the future if i needed."
1,"First pair failed as after the first use they would not hold a charge. Invotek responded excellent. They tried to help fix it but doing a factory reset did not work. The replaced the headphones and my second pair has worked flawlessly. They are comfortable with good quality sound and very affordable. As a I previously mentioned, customer service is great too."
1,Great sound but a bit deep and bass rich...I don't notice when walking or exercising.  GREAT basic wireless headphones with overall good sound!  Cheers!
1,So far these headphones have acted just as well as my old beats that broke. Seems like they will be the better alternative moving forward.
1,Just what I was looking for and more.  Fast and easy transaction.  I walk and run the beach here in San Diego and have had no issues with these headphones.  Great music quality and stay right in place.  I will be buying more for family members for sure.
1,"GREAT sound quality use for work and gym , cant beat the price ."
1,My head phones paired up very easily and have great sound .
0,After 5 months headphones will no longer hold a charge. Too late to return. Better buy warranty insurance.
1,I love the sound and fit of these headphones. Customer service was quick and helpful.
1,Great quality for the price!  Definitely exceeded my expectations!
1,Took a small monetary risk and very satisfied with my new earphones.  I recommend them.
1,have 3 pair
1,Love the new headphones - work great - fit great!
1,"Very happy with this product,as well as the company. The headphones work well,are easy to operate, and the sound is well above average. The company sent follow up E-mails to ensure that I was satisfied, as well as not having any difficulties. They seem to  are about customer satisfaction. Well done."
1,Good fit in your ears. Nice design with several options to fit different ear sizes.
1,"Met and exceeded my expectations. Thought the quality would be inferior because the price point was lower than so many other brands. It wasn't, very happy with this purchase."
1,"I'm have been surprisingly pleased with the quality of the sound and ease of use, only thing I would recommend is the strap that ties them together is a little stiff and would have like to have one a little more flexible."
1,"I have a nice pair of Bose over the ear headphones, but when outside walking my dog they tend to fall off when leaning over to pick up.  These Senso are just the ticket and the sound is fab with pretty good quality and a year quarantee.  I found a good fit within the included three tips and they are comfortable and stay on nicely.  Instructions are good and customer support if needed seems to be there with an e=mail from one of the company owners right after delivery.  Lots of good reviews on you tube and Amazon.  I do lots of research before buy a product and so far pleased."
1,"I was hoping they would at least last a year. I purchased in February 2018, they have stopped charging already."
1,For the price love it and the sound is great and it's comfortable.
0,"Worked great, honestly.. until a week after return window closed, magically won't pair with any Bluetooth devices."
1,This is my second time purchasing a pair of these headphones and live them! Great sound for the price.
0,"I bought these wireless headphones a couple of months ago and I have been regretting it. Let me start by saying that I only use these once every week or so maybe every like 5 days, so I've only worn them less that 15 times total at this point.<br /><br />They are a total pain in the neck! I go for runs with them and one of the ear buds is ALWAYS FALLING OUT, even with the things that curl around your ears which SHOULD HELP keep them in, but barely do. Because I have had them for over a month now I don't have an option in my order history to return these for a refund.  (Keep in mind that when I had gotten to the 1 month mark I wore them maybe 5 times so at that point I didn't think it was that bad)<br /><br />The only nice thing I have to say about these is that the sound is good... But so what, I have 2 year old wired headphones that have great sound and they were less than $10. These are not worth $35 just for Bluetooth and good sound.  Unless your dieing for wireless headphones that are cheap, I would either get better ones that will be more expensive or stick with wired ones that are just as good for half the price."
0,"I got these headphones so that I could listen to zoom meetings while walking around the apt (quarantine reality), but the bluetooth connection is really poor. Walking within the same room it will disconnect and reconnect repeatedly, not to mention the multiple times it did this while I was sitting right in front of my computer! When they work they are good, but the hassle is not worth the money."
1,"Great company. Wrote me emails and kept me updated every step of the way. Plus, once I open the package, amazing.<br />Beautiful design and great sound! Highly recommend it! &#34;Great product! Works great! Amazing design and great price"
1,"After my previous Bluetooth ear buds failed, I thought I would go for this seemingly more popular design. Unfortunately it has worse reception (listening with my phone in my back pocket leads to stuttering audio).<br />Also unlike my previous set when not it use it has a tendency to fall off your neck (my previous versions had a solid half circle in which the ear buds where magnetically linked onto)<br /><br />Won't be going back to this design of I have an opportunity next time."
0,"Not sure who’s reviewing these, but the sound from the kid driving down the road is clearer."
1,"This is my third set of Bluetooth headset the first worked great.for about it a year.<br />The ear buds would not stay in verry well nor were they comfertabl.  but after some moderate use one ear bud quit working on one side after six months.tolerable but no cigar for 150.00 bucks really 6 months.<br />Well on to the next gen style ear buds were a little uncomfortable but stayed in place some.little pricey but waterproof said so right on the box...... well at work the controller not so water proof wet hands oh well ,dryed them out worked well enough. Not very loud  for a noisy background area  then the battery started dyeing fast all the time. Not even a hour of use  trying to charge them one day they fell on the floor shattered one came compleaty apart now useless.... 75 down the drain<br />One week of use WTF..<br />Seen your buds on amazon kinda sceptical read a lot  of reviews abought them now....<br />YOUR ARE THE BOMB..<br />Thank you love the comfert for long term use its  great.lots of ear bud sizes which do fit me very well.<br />Love ease of use  no small bumps On a wire you have chase on your neck to  to adjust the volume.  And they dont care if they get wet nor do they fall out.<br />Thank you.....  Scott H."
1,"Great headphones, fits great in the ear, sound quality is great and battery life is excellent. Couldn't be more satisfied."
1,"These are amazing! The sound is great. Comes with everything you need, even to keep the ear phones. Packaging was incredible and arrived quickly. I would really recommend them to anyone especially for the price. Use them everyday at the gym."
1,Good
1,Good sound
1,Perfect
1,The only complaint I have is that connecting two devices doesn't work very well.
1,"My third set of wireless headphones/earbuds, both more expensive.  These are the best.  Sound is great.  Controls work and they pair both phone and media without manual intervention!"
1,I've had these for a week now and they are awesome. Great sound and the buds don't hurt my ears. Very comfortable. The case is a wonderful bonus.
0,The charge port broke the first time it was plugged in. Before it had ever been used. So can’t speak for sound quality
1,Cant beat the price. This is my second pair (Lost the first one) I liked the first one so much I came back to buy the second one
1,works great
1,It's good. It's been nine months but something's gone wrong. How do we do that? Please help me.
1,"Great sound, good battery life, very comfortable and excellent Bluetooth range.  Can't find any fault with these - highly recomended"
1,Super easy set up.  They sound good and convenient for use at the gym
1,"Work exactly as advertised; good sound quality for both listening and speaking through mic; takes a little bit to get used to the ear hangars, which are loose and flop around."
0,ugh annoying they only worked well for 1 month! and now they won't charge or anything.
1,"Bought these to replace another pair that didn't quite work well for running and went out the next day. Loved the fit, comfort and sound quality."
1,"so far so good, sound great, fit in my ears great.  we'll see if they are durable, and if the battery lasts."
1,These headphones are easy to pair. The sound is clear. They fit well. Happy with this purchase. Would highly recommend these.
0,"I got this product for use in gym, but I hardly used it 5 times altogether in this 3 month period.  My product support window expired two days back and my product doesn't even charge anymore.  I think they design the product to fail after just the support period.  A costly headphone for 5 time use"
1,I love these headphones.  They sound good for music and for phone conversations.  So nice to not have to plug them in to my phone!  And I like the cord between the two headphones - when I need to take them off I can use it to hang them around my neck.
1,Great sounds quality and greatest price
1,"I liked it, arrived as per mentioned date. Thanks"
0,Could not get it to stay on right.  The earpiece was too large for me and would not stay in my ear.  The piece that suppose to hook around your ear to keep in place is also too large and very flimsy.  I guess it was made for people with large ears and ear-canals.
1,I am very impressed with the sound quality and  volume! The only problem I have is They are a uncomfortable in the ears  the Bulge before the silicone earpiece seems to be pressing on my ears otherwise they are very GoodProduct
1,Pretty good quality
1,"It took a little while to connect to my phone but I don't have one of those fancy high end phones. Once everything was set with phone these ear buds are GREAT, I'm on day 3 of using them at gym. I spend at least 1 1/2 hrs each day at gym.<br />For down side, I wish the things that go over my ear where a little more solid. Other then that I would change nothing."
0,Worked for maybe a month and then stopped..
1,Great wireless headphones. Relatively good sound and stays on while exercising.
1,"I like that the piece that goes around the ears is bendable, so I could secure them around my ears. Very comfortable and responsive buttons. Found them simple to pare with my devices. Wish they could be pared with multiple devices simultaneously, but they get the job done, so not too concerned. Wore them during my 5K this morning and never had to mess with them at all during the run. I like the case that came with them too."
1,"Excellent headset. Only reason it didn't get 5 full stars is due to the part that wraps around your ears. I have tiny ears so they do not wrap on my ears. However, I work out every day and these have not fallen out my ears once. For the money, these are great!  Yes I would buy again."
1,GREAT HEADPHONES AT AN AFFORDABLE PRICE
1,I have used them twice so far. Work great! My husband just ordered a pair too.
1,These are already broken w/ static of loose wire. I have used maybe 10 x! Save your money
1,"Light weight, comfortable, and they sound great. Long battery life."
1,"These headphones hold their charge, produce solid volume, and fit comfortably. No complaints here."
1,Purchased SENSO ActivBuds for use with I-pad.  It was very easy to &#34;marry&#34; the bluetooth wireless headphones to our iPads.  Look forward to using these headphones for a long time....
1,Working out
1,I like this product!
0,"They have excellent sound and I love the design. They are very comfortable and stay on my ears securely.  I love the case and accessories they provide, everything you could possibly need to charge and take your ear buds. They are super light weight, seem well made and the cord does not tangle which is great.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />They died, and it's a hassle to ship them back to Amazon.  Must have QA issues."
0,Mic is really bad.
1,"sound quality is good but the battery drains fast, good thing it charges up to 100% in about 1.5 hours, no complaints i like em. will buy again if needed"
1,The headphones are nice and fit well.
1,"Headphones work great, crazy good range away from phone. Have used them nearly daily for 4 months now. Not a single problem so far. Purchased two more for friends they love em. The voice quality for hands free is OK, but not the best. But if all you need them for is listening to music. These are the headphones for you. At this price they can't be beat."
1,Love the new earbuds! Noise cancelling works great. Charge really last and so comfortable to wear!
1,"Top quality product, as well as excellent and prompt customer service."
1,My husband says he would not change a thing. He is not easy to please so this is a real compliment . My comment - paid 10.99 for shipping & handling. Did not appreciate trick to be put on unwanted prime Amazon. I don't order online enough to benefit from this.
1,Great product
1,"If you are looking for great headphones for yourself or for a gift , no need to look further. Delivered on time and great packaging.  I have to say these are the best headphones.  I listen to audiobooks and they last for Almost 8 hours.  They come with 2 cables. A shorter one for the headphones and a longer lightening cable for my iPhone with an attachment for the headphones.  (Initially the lightening cable didn't work so I contacted customer service and was send a new one.  Now that's customer service!!!!!!! )  You also get a car adapter and a case.  For the money I have never had so many things included!!  Have I mentioned these are great headphones!! .  They have a volume button and are extremely comfortable. I can walk, vacuum or run on the treadmill and they never fall off.  I can also leave them in my room and go outside to mow the lawn and still hear with no disruption.  This is the type of product you want to buy for anyone you want to impress. Don't hesitate!!  Just buy them, you won't be disappointed."
0,Poor sound quality compared to similar headphones.
0,The on-off button stopped working. That made them useless.
1,Fits good and sounds great
1,"They are pretty cool but mine are starting to have problems - sound going out in the left one. In all fairness, I am hard on them - if I put them in their case, that probably wouldn't be happening, lol. So, I plan to order another pair and treat them better.  The only rightful complaint was a few connection issues in the gym but nothing major."
0,"I have been using these earphones for a month now. I put them on daily during my bus commute to talk on my phone. Most of the times, the person on the other side of the call isn’t able to understand my voice. I too am having difficulties listening to people’s voices correctly. The audio is not crisp clear. This device maybe OK to listen to songs, but not for phone calls."
1,"I would highly recommend these headphone, I use them daily, I am in the landscape business, so these headphones endure everything!!!! My headphones quit working I called the company and they were very friendly and courteous, these headphones come with a 1 year warranty. My replacement headphones arrived quickly!! Awesome product, Awesome customer service❤️"
1,"Awesome for price. If you're looking at beats, just get these. Save yourself some $$$. They all get dated anyway."
1,"I have had these headphones for 2 days now and so far these are the best headphones I have ever had. Not to mention that the price was under $40....They sound as good as my Beats 2 Wireless earbuds !!! They were easy to pair with all of my devices, and have the BEST volume of any wireless earbuds I have ever owned (that's over least 10 pairs) You can actually keep the device volume at 50% and it is still loud !!!......So far they are very comfortable and fit and stay in your ear (but that is with limited use). I would highly recommend these if you are thinking about getting a great sounding pair of wireless headphones for a reasonable price....."
0,Don’t waste your time.
1,"Sound is excellent.  Controls are easy to learn.  I had the misfortune of the volume &#34;plate&#34;<br />falling off when attempting to attach the charging cable.  Too much force on my part, not<br />a good fit of charging cable.  This all happened on a Saturday.  I e-mailed SENSO, I was<br />asked to send a photo of the problem.  A bit later I was asked to proof my address and today,<br />Tuesday, I am using my new AirBuds!!!"
1,"Headphones are nice and loud, but as with every other pair I've purchase the buds, even the ear forming ones, don't stay in.  REALLY annoying!  Also, do not cancel out noise, but could be due to the fact that they don't stay in my ear."
1,the sound is great when I'm not riding my bicycle however when I ride the bicycle the microphone picks up the wind noise which then can be heard<br />in both of my ears in stereo just as loud as the music is and that is anoying.  Is there a way to turn the microphone off when not using the phone?
1,"Sounds good, links to my phone great, but cuts out if my phone is in my left pocket...especially if I am outside vs indoors.  Doesn't matter where I am either.  Not sure what causes that but it is annoying that I have to use my wired headphones to mow the lawn because they keep cutting out."
1,These are great earphones. A little big for my small ears. Sound quality is great.
1,"It works, doesn't stay in my ear because the hooks won't actually hook around my ear, not very comfortable."
1,So far the work great. The sound is awesome. They are fairly noise cancelling and stay in even when running. The battery life is very good also.
1,"They do hurt my ear a bit, but they are well priced, super durable and bluetooth! Can't ask for more!"
1,"Not a 5 star review, the charger that came with the earbuds  doesn’t even fit the actual earbuds very disappointing."
1,"Excellent equipment on first use. Will update later if issues arrive. Sound range and clarity are remarkable and significantly better than models twice the price. Additional equipment included is a big bonus, especially a selection of earbuds to custom fit. Wish they had included a 110 charging unit instead of the car adapter- this is the only complaint though. Again, excellent product!"
0,Broke after couple of uses
1,"These headphones are amazing, sound is better than most!"
1,My husband loves them! They worked great for his run and the sound quality is amazing! Would definitely recommend these headphones.
0,Easy to use / connect<br />Annoying Chinese voice providing status messages on connect / disconnect<br />Poor sound quality compared to others I have tried at this price point
1,"For this price, this is a good deal! I love how they fit in my ears, easy to operate. They came with a cute case and a dual charger (USB/Apple) as well, which is a big plus. The only thing I would like to see is the improvement on bass sound... sometimes it cracks when I listen to heavy hiphop... but again, for this price, and as wireless headphones, I cannot ask too much I guess."
1,"I have had these for 6 months and have used them pretty regularly.  The sound quality and fit is very good for their size and in particular, their cost.  They readily connect to my iPhone 6 every time.  The earbuds do a great job isolating outside noise...the sound comes through clear through the wind noise when I am biking.  The battery is nicely sized as I can use these for a good number of workouts and rides before needing to recharge.<br /><br />The sweatproofing works very well -- I inadvertently put these through the washer when I left them in the pocket of my biking shorts.  Once the unit dried I could not detect a dropoff in sound quality, connectivity, or battery life.  The only thing that is a bit annoying is that the cord will swing up and catch on a shoulder as I run or ride which creates an unbalanced feeling.  The headphones feel very comfortable when the cord hangs behind my neck.<br /><br />All in all, for $10 more than wired earbuds from Apple that hang from your ears you really can't beat these!"
1,I can’t be any happier with my purchase. No where on Gods green earth can you find headphones like these for under $20!
1,"These headphones work great. Some wind noise, but overall these are quality."
1,Very good item and fast deliveryed thanks SENSO see you again.
1,"Charge lasts two days, recharges in less than an hour, great bass for earbuds, super durable design, and you can wear them in the shower! What was originally going to be a back up set of earbuds quickly became my main set in spite of the fact that they look like those hands-free earbuds that douchebags wear.  I would use these even if they weren't waterproof."
0,"These are terrible. They work for about 60 days and then wouldn't hook up with any of my bluetooth devices. I went online to determine if I could reset them but it did not work. I took them today, and after charging they won't even turn on. I would seriously recommend that YOU DO NOT PURCHASE!"
1,Headphones fit very well and have good sound quality.  Battery life is good but when battery life gets too low a voice comes on every minute for 10 times to say &#34;Battery low&#34;.  This is extremely annoying!  Just tell me once and let me here my music without interruption until the battery dies.  You will get some wind noise from these while riding a bike.  My older over the ear headphones do not pick up wind noise.
1,Crisp sound.
1,Very impressed with the product so far. Great sound! Great design! Great packaging!
1,Awesome headphones. Great sound and they don’t fall out
0,"These earbuds have no range, only work if your phone is in front pocket, connection is frequently interrupted, have underlying hum while connected, do not stay in ear during running workouts despite multiple sized inserts. In general they do not perform as advertised. Company did their best to resolve issues by replacing with a second pair, but both perform in the same manner."
1,"Charges fast, pairs fast. Stays in ears for a prolonged period of time, even while  running/jumping. Long battery life. Good acoustics, not the best, but good for the price."
1,"Arrived quickly.  They work really well and don't fall out of my ears, as promised."
1,"JUST received my package & it’s PERFECT, I love the package & headphones"
0,"From the Amazon Product Description: ""...Earphones for Gym Running Workout Noise Cancelling Earphones Earbuds Noise Cancelling Headsets...""<br /><br />No.<br />Incorrect description.  These are in no way ""noise cancelling.""  No noise cancelling behavior in use.  No noise cancelling description on the product box.  No description of noise cancelling functions in the documentation.<br /><br />Not noise cancelling."
1,Great headphones! Easy to figure out too. Love them.
1,Bought in May and unfortunately the power button has stopped working.
1,"I exercise regularly and sweat a lot. I've been through more headphones than I can count. I've owned many different brands and price levels, mostly from $50 to &150. My last pair were PowerBeats 2, and were supposedly sweat proof. They were expensive, and much like others that I've owned, only lasted about six months. I've only had the SENSO headphones for about a month now, so I'll have to wait to see how long they last.<br /><br />Sound quality is great for ear buds. Plenty of base even without adjustment. It's not as good as the Beats, but it's definitely good enough. There is not a huge difference between the two, especially when considering the huge difference in price.<br /><br />The place where I exercise is loud, and most headphones are just not loud enough, even at full volume. These are plenty loud. No need for full volume.<br /><br />They are packaged with everything that you need (different size ear cushions, cables, car charger) - even more than what came with the PowerBeats. Packaging and accessories were better than expected.<br /><br />I've used many different brands and paid many different price levels for sweat proof earphones. All have broken in 6 months average and only two or three had decent enough volume and sound quality for my needs. It remains to be seen how long these will last, but even if they only last 6 months, I'm better off buying 4 pairs of these rather than one pair of the Beats. Everything about these earphones has been much better than expected. Based on the excellent initial value, I'm giving them 5 stars. If they break like the others, then I'll update..."
1,"We couldn't be happier with our choice. These are absolutely the best headphones! Great sound, quality and love them being wireless. Great for our workouts at the gym"
0,I bought  them  a while  ago. Then wanted to use them and nothing . Won't charge. Just nothing
1,Great headphones!  They are comfortable and I don't have to worry about them falling out while running.
1,"As follow up to mine below, I was contacted almost immediately by the company who promptly accepted return of the product and replaced within 2 days at no cost.  The product is working flawlessly and I would recommend it to all for sound quality and use at the gym and heavy exercising.  The company response was excellent and they made a believer of me.  Thank you!<br /><br />It charged but will not pair / go into pairing mode (flashing red / blue) or reset to factory settings.  The diagram with the instructions needs to be clearer and I have to guess what function is what.  Not what I hoped from reading the reviews."
1,Product as advertised
1,"Love these headphones!  They sound great and the customer service is amazing!  Everything is high quality, even the plug/adapter and the case!"
1,"Great headphones with really good sound. A few months after utilizing them daily, the left headphone stopped working intermittently. I contacted customer support, and they sent me out a new pair right away after troubleshooting the issue with me. Great customer service."
1,"Great sound out of these little guys.  Couldn't fit my helmet over these, the reason I bought them, but that's not the company's fault."
1,"A business colleague had a pair of these and I tried them....they sounded great so I purchased them while traveling. Arrived home, paired them up with my new iPhone 7 and immediately in business.  They sound really well.  Bass and volume are good - much better than the standard ear buds that come with the phone.  Wireless also a huge benefit as the iPhone 7 only has one port now and allows you to have your phone plugged in for charging and listening at the same time.  Would highly recommend this based on my experience so far."
1,These are perfect for running! I love them - especially at this price!
1,Best headphones ever.
1,These don't fit into my ears. This style never down but I read some reviews that said they worked on people with smaller ears. They didn't. I couldn't get them to stay on but my husband loves them!
1,Great sound quality and quality-produced headphones. Sound is the same quality as similar products from Beats or Bose and paying significantly less - additionally on prior reviews it sounds like those other headphones had issues with battery life. The cellphone card-carrying case and the car phone mount were nice touches too! Would recommend for anyone looking for a reliable headphone for the gym/running/etc.
0,"I'm not an audiophile, but the bass in these headphones are too overpowering. If you're not listening to house or hip hop, the music will sound hollow and muddied.  Headphones  with this kind of balance should state state &#34;bass boost&#34; in the title or description."
0,"Sound is good (good bass), but they do not last long at all (battery/charge???) Phone was in pocket and kept getting distorted after short period of use...dissappointed."
1,"These things are awesome!  They surpass every metric set for them in the item description.  They stay in place when I work out, and that was Priority # 1.  The second priority was sound quality.  Again, they surpassed expectation.  The third priority was comfort, and the soft, flexible material that the clasps that hold the buds against my ears are made of make me forget that I'm wearing them!"
1,"Muy útil para mí diario de trabajo se escucha bien claro me dura 11 horas y todavía con un 60% de batería, muy bueno muchas gracias complacido hasta el momento."
1,I have been using these headphones for a few months now and I must say they're great and long lasting too. The sound quality is good and the silicon material of the ear grips mold to your ear. I love them and would highly recommend.
1,I ordered these for my husband and he loves them! They stay put on his ears during workouts and he can’t stop talking about how great the sound is!
1,"They work great.  Easy to use, when you turn them on it verbally tells you they are on, instead of guessing at flashing lights whether it is on/off.  Volume, fast forward, etc..  All work fine, paired with my Galaxy S8 no problem."
1,They fit the bill perfectly and hooked up without a hitch to our iphones.
1,"Bought these as a gift. So far the recipient is loving them. Says they have very good bass. Personally, I loved all the extras that came with it. I think they are very good value for the price."
0,"Battery life on it is great. But breaks to easy, they are so over price for the quality"
1,"I bought these earphones to hear my Visio Bluetooth tv.  I lost 60% and 50% of my hearing last year.  With these earphones, I can hear the tv very well.  Speech is excellent. Buy these for they sound great.  I haven't figured out how to control the volumn yet, but I will."
1,I was thoroughly impressed by how high quality these headphones were for the low cost. I guess technology has come a long way on the last few years. I do appreciate the aesthetics of this. Everything from the charging cable to the earbud case has been a joy.
0,"The headset sounds good and all but the battery life sucks big time.  Bought this 8 months ago and the battery life degrade so much.  Went from full charge to the battery low voice prompt in less than 3 hours and it was advertised for 10+ hours.  Emailed Buyer several times, Buyer WAS responsive the first couple of times but stop responding afterward."
1,"When I was looking for wireless headphones, two colleagues of mine insisted on the Beats brand.  However, when I searched Amazon, there were many options, and I chose Senso based on reviews; they were consistently fabulous, and there were more for these than for Beats.  I absolutely made the right choice.  I love these headphones.  With three sizes of ear covers, plus the additional charging wire for my phone, this package cannot be beat.  I've already told two family members they need to get these because they're just that great.<br /><br />Regarding comfort, I wore them for two hours the first time and had no tender spots from the earbuds pressing against my ear.  Also, when you're connecting the headphones to your device, put the left piece in your ear, and the device will tell you when it's connecting or turning off when you push the push the function button (on/off etc) on the right earpiece."
1,"I really like these headphones, with a couple reservations. While riding my bike, there was a lot of wind interference when riding into the wind that I don't get from my Apple earbuds. That was a bit annoying but in all other uses, and particularly around the house, they are excellent. The other thing that is a little annoying is the flashing blue LED - it reflects in my glasses in dim light and in the darkened room at night - minor issue, but definitely noticeable."
1,Wore my new SENSO Wireless Headphones on a run yesterday. Easy to sync up to my phone. Fit perfect under a stocking hat. Great sound! Comfortable fit. Filtered outside noise out as well. Looking forward to future miles with with these headphones.
1,"There is a little bit of a learning curve trying to use this product. I wear glasses, so it took some trying to get it to fit properly and the attached cord seemed to get in the way a lot.<br />Once I got it to fit and learned the controls, the sound quality is awesome. The earbuds blocked out all the outside noise and I was able to enjoy my music without interruption.<br />It has been 4 days of constant use and the battery is still going.  Battery life is great."
1,They work well.  Only complaint is the low battery warning keeps repeating every minute.
1,"Husband uses them to work out every day and while doing all yard work. He says the sound is great , yes he sweats up at storm in 90-100 degree weather too and they still work like day one . He loves them and I barley ever see him have to charge them. So I’m assuming “ hey the battery must be great too!”"
1,Great price and work as expected
1,Good
1,Really great wireless headphones.  I have had others that cost same or more that were not nearly as nice.  They come with case and various ear buds sizes.  They are very light and do not bounce around when running.
1,Great product! Easy installation and configuration
1,"I bought these headphones to replace a pair that I lost. I like these much better. They work very well and the battery charge last a long time. What I am most appreciative of is the customer service. I received an email asking how I liked my headphones. I had a couple questions and they were quick to reply. At one time, I heard a faint echo while using the phone. When I emailed the company, they sent me explicit instructions on how to reset the headphones. Great customer service goes a long way. Also, the price was great. I think they were about $50 less than the other type I bought at Walmart. Different brand but still. Thanks for a great product at a GREAT price!"
1,"The sound is crisp and the bass is excellent; and for a rocker, bass is imperative! The fit is so comfortable. Even on the lowest volume setting, I can barely hear anything other than my music."
1,Very simple to use and long battery life. Registers two profiles for headphones and headset so you can pick your sound quality
1,"This has great sound, I am very pleased with them!"
1,too much bass
1,"Just used for the first time tonight. Great headphones! They paired in seconds, fit snug and sound great. I listened to music and watched a bit of Netflix too. Both sound great. For the cost I feel that this was a wise purchase. I love the fact that it came with extras too. +++"
1,Excellent product and well manufactured with comfort and style in mind.
1,The best headphone i ever had..LOVE THEM!!
1,It worked well for me for about a month after I purchased it. Now every time I try to charge the headphones it simply wont charge. It has to be a problem with the charging port since I can still turn them on but cant charge them. I refuse to use them right now since they are at low battery and I want proof to back up my claim.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />I figured out the issue and its that it is still charging but the light indicator is out of sync and will re-sync eventually! Taking back what I said and  giving this amazing cheap alternative 5 stars!
1,Great product and a great price.
1,"They're light, comfortable and have a good sound."
1,I love these headphones. I use them at work and at the gym and they have great quality sound.
1,"Very happy with product! Lightweight, comfortable,and good sound.. and at a good price..would def recomend"
1,"They are wireless, and I can’t hear any other noise when my music is playing. LOVE THEM!"
1,"I am 1 week into these headphones and I am liking them.  Good sound quality.  If there is one thing I would improve, it would be the fit.  Maybe it is different person-to-person, but these are kind of loose on me"
1,So far these have been excellent ear buds. Simple to use and water resistant. That extremely important to me. Thank you for my ear buds!!!! Strongly recommend to others.
1,Love the Bluetooth headphones. Great for working out. Just wish I could see when the battery is running low.<br />They are a little bigger then some other Bluetooth headphones.
1,"I really love these earbuds! They work really well, have had an impressive battery life so far, and are pretty comfy! My one problem with them is that they're a tad too big for me. I've tried all the ear canal pieces and only the memory foam one managed to actually stay in my ear, as the over the ear parts are DEFINITELY too big for me."
1,Great sound quality. Very happy with this purchase.
1,"Love them, great deal, good sound and a low price."
1,"These have become my new favorite workout headphones. I usually run about 2-3 miles on the treadmill, followed by a full workout on free weights, cables, etc. They don't slip, easy to sync up, very comfortable, and good quality sound. They also came with different size ear pieces/buds which was nice, I prefer the small ones. Great headphones."
1,"I've been using this daily ever since it arrived and I'm very pleased with it. The headphones come with a car charger which also includes a bonus lightning adapter which was a nice surprise. I feel it is well worth the price I paid. I got this for listening to podcasts and it works perfectly for that, however the quality is a little lacking when it comes to music, but it's definitely not as bad as other ones I've tried. I'm rather pleased with it!"
1,wow! thats the best way to describe these headphones.of the 20 or 30 headphones i have had over the years these beat them all.they stay in my ears (brilliant idea to include 3 different ear tip sizes) they are very comfortable and the volume control and off buttons are easy and convient to operate.i would purchase them again and highly recommend them to anyone looking for headphones.especially those who need a secure and comfortable pair for any type of workout.i just wish i could give them more stars.
1,Just perfect
0,Audio constantly cuts out when moving
1,good product
1,"Wireless earphones arrived quickly and are amazingly high quality. Talk about a Big Bang for your buck, these Senso earphones are!!"
1,"Really good headphones for an affordable price, easy set up, and nice fitting....good job..."
1,Connected with phone easily. Great battery life. Comfortable.  Comes with an assortment of earbuds so you can fit the product to your ears.
1,I really liked hands free  listening while I was gardening good sounds no static walked all around the yard no cords I left my phone on the table. I have used these buds with my android phone and my kindle tablet highly recommended
1,"Simple to use, work wonderfully"
1,I am very satisfied with my headphones so far. they do everything I need them to do and more. easy to set up and use and delivery was fast!!!
0,I bought 2 separate kind of headphones. This set and a lesser costing pair. They are exactly the same. Sound quality is not the best. Distortion is bad at times.
1,Awesome quality! Great company. My headphones fit great.
1,What can I say. I abused these earbuds for 5 years and I bought them on sale for 15 bucks. Tell me beats or Bose can give me that much bang for my buck
1,"Really good sound quality, good bass, just charged them finally for the first time since I purchase them after about two weeks worth of gym use. Also good connectivity, forgot my phone in my bag when I went to the bathroom and didn't lose connection from the other side of a wall. Very happy with these."
1,Amazing headphones. I love them. I use them daily.
1,"Really work great.  I wear them walking, jogging and even working out in the pool.  So far no problems."
1,"Great product...works great... initially I thought it will not have a good sound effect but, after using it for quiet sometime I really liked it and the battery backup is really good :)"
1,"These are great headphones, they do exactly what they say they will. In one example, I used them in a very noisy area to watch a video on my phone. The audio came in clear and sharp, the outside ambient noise still came in but very soft in volume. The ear hooks come in useful to securely hold the headphones, and the gel-like buds fit comfortably in the ear canal. As far as battery life, I haven't used them enough to know how long power would last, but I have never run out of power after using them again after not charging for a long time (a month or so)."
1,This is my second pair of Senso headphones.  I love them but they seem only to last 1.5 years.  I tend to replace the a little after a year.  My first pair stopped working and my second pair lasted a little over a year and same thing won’t turn on anymore otherwise great quality if they can only last longer that 2 years
0,When phone was in the pocket sound constantly cut out. Was fully charged. Would not buy again.
1,"These are my first pair of wireless headphones. I wish I would have gotten them sooner. So much better than regular headphones that need to attach to your phone or iPod. I work out every day so I need good reliable headphones. I bought these in March of this year and the headphones starting turning off on their own last week when the battery wasn’t even dead. I contacted the company and they gave me detailed instructions on how to fix the issue which I followed. A few days later the headphones turned off again while I was listening to them. Since this product comes w a one year warranty, I have another pair on their way. The company was extremely quick to respond and address the problem. This is literally the best  and quickest response I’ve ever had from a company when their product malfunctioned. The fact that they come w a one year warranty and they are inexpensive to begin with shows how much the company stands by their product. Excellent customer service!"
0,"I originally gave this a 5 star review, but almost exactly 1 year later...the right ear piece speaker sounds terrible.  For the money I guess it's ok compared to other products.  Just be prepared to buy a replacement or buy the extended warrantly."
1,Love it the best
1,"I only gave four stars, because I just received the headphones, and only used them once so far. I can say during the first use that they worked great. Sound was loud and clear enough for me, and I loved not having the long wires from traditional headphones.<br />The headphones cut out only a handful of times, for a short short second, but this did not really bother me at all, as it was not a long buffering glitch. I was cutting the grass with my phone in a pocket.<br />Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase as of now."
1,"All are good thus far testing this headset out for a few run. Sound is compatible with others I have owned.  the only thing that other me is that if I have only 1 in my ears, the other would fall on the other side. It is almost a must to have both in you ears when you use it."
1,Nice fit!<br />Very good sound!<br />Easy access to control buttons!
1,"great product, great price. will recommend to my friends and family."
1,"Bought a pair for myself, wife liked them so much that I had to order myself another pair."
0,I dont recomend this to anyone!!! Terrible product keep disconnecting from the phone! Also impossible to talk on the phone with it because its picking up all the noises from the background and no one can understand anything when i try to say something! The only good thing with this to listein music. It sounds very nice and clear exept when it decide to disconnect and the music will stop. Battery life if fair lest like 5 6 hrs
0,The ear hooks are too soft.  I bought these to wear while bicycle riding.  The motion of riding shakes the earbuds off/out of my ears - no matter how I bend the hooks.
0,They fell apart the fourth time I used them. I was super excited about them and then they broke.
0,"Update: (from 4 to 2 stars)<br />After a couple of years since the date of purchase, the rubber on the wires that connect the earphone to the other, started peeling off until it was totally gone. What's left now are the thin wires that once were covered by the rubber. I tried taping it it all around the wires, but it wasn't pleasing to the eye so I disposed of it. It was expected and it did serve its purpose considering the price.<br /><br />Great quality sound for the price. My only complaint about the product is that the silicone piece that wraps around the ear is too high and I don't see a way to adjust it. Although it is flexible, in terms of width, the height is way too high for my small ears. Good thing though the ear plugs do stick to the ears even with movements. Overall, decent headphones with good quality audio and design."
1,They kinda don't like to stay in ear but they work great
1,"One minor annoyance is that the material that the cord is made out of sometimes catches on my neck and pulls at the headphones when I turn my head.  Otherwise, a fantastic product."
0,"I liked the headphones, but I've bought two pairs so far and both have died within a year of purchase. Moving on to a different brand."
1,"This is my 3rd set of Senso Bluetooth headphones. The first set lasted a year until I accidentally ripped off one of the ear pieces. It was an earlier version with the non-adjustable ear hooks which I liked. The mic feature never worked for that set and neither did the music control other than play/pause. I also noticed occasional skipping when my phone was in my pocket. Otherwise I was very happy with the product.<br /><br />The second set I got was more or less the same. I actually DO NOT LIKE the adjustable ear hooks. I take them in and out regularly when talking to people directly and then find I have to take time to readjust them in my ear constantly as the hook doesn't seem to hold its shape very well.<br /><br />I got the new model ones to see if they fixed the ear hook annoyance. It does seem a little better though it might be because they are brand new. It does seem they have fixed the skipping issue. So for the price they are great, just wish the ear hooks were even stiffer to stay as you form them better. I loved the original hooks but I understand that they wouldn't be a good fit for everyone."
1,Works fine so far. Seems like a good quality product. Thank you.
1,Good quality and easy to have two devices connected.
1,They mostly work as expected but there's a lot of wind noise when I'm running and into light breeze.  I can't imagine using them for cycling. I imagine they'd be fine for indoor use.
0,"I do not reccomend these at all!<br />Really disappointed to have these quit working on third use, after diligently keeping them dry before charging, as other users suggested. I guess you get what you pay for!"
1,Exactly as advertised. Love these headsets. Sound quality is amazing and great bass. However I wish they would work with my Ps4 but other then that a must have.
1,"I'm a fault finder. I can find no fault other than they are a little bassy, and that's coming from someone that grew up putting subwoofers in every car ever purchased.<br />Other than that can't find any real fault. Comfortable, really are noise cancelling and seem to be on the durable side.<br />Battery hasn't ran out on me yet full day of landscaping."
1,"I just received these so I will do an update once I get some time with them. Initial impression is that they have great bass for ear buds, they fit snug and have nice almost memory foam buds from the factory. (They come with extra rubber ones if you don't like the foam ones.) Also, they are LOUD. I only need to have them 3/4 of the way up at the gym, anymore and it's to much. I had the HD pump Bluetooth headphones before these. So far, these are much louder, have more bass and more comfortable. Will update as time goes."
1,"so far i really like them, I'm not sure about the hook in the ear is way to fragile it looks like it can break any time but is kind of hard put it in, just for that i don't give 5, I love the doble connector<br /><br />ok an update, it has some conection issues when you put it on takes time to pair or something, have to try few time...so sad on this"
1,I bought these to wear for my outdoor activities and while they are performing well enough for my needs they do tend to cut out quite often and not just in specific areas. I do find them very comfortable to wear for extended periods and the battery life is sufficient as these are not top of the line ear buds but very budget friendly. Worth their cost
0,Blue-Tooth connection was terrible
1,"Update: just went to charge these for the first time and the charger does not stay in.  I tried another one I’ve used before, same problem.  So the cost for this air is down the drain.  Try the charger as soon as you get them.  I didn’t and now can’t return them.<br />This is the 3rd set of these I have owned.  The only reason I replaced them is that I lost the last 2 pairs. I need the over the ear piece because that is the only way the stay in my ears.  The sound quality is excellent, but still allows me to be aware of my surroundings when I am out walking.  I highly recommend these."
1,I bought these for my husband and so far he's really enjoying them. Thank you
1,To hear my music.
1,"Now that I've used the SENSO Bluetooth Wireless Headphones for awhile, I can attest to the fact that they provide excellent sound quality! Battery life is really good. Overall, I definitely recommend these wireless headphones to my friends."
1,Very nice headphones sound really good and easy to use I work and I move a lot so at times the cord would move and that is a little annoying over all very good product
1,Great hands free device. Perfect for working out and so easy to use. Really affordable and overall best electronic accessory for any device. It'd be even more amazing with a fitted carrying case but that's a personal preference lol. Would recommend to any one looking for new headphones.
1,"Got these this week. Here's why I love them. I've now run 10 miles with them, and I've had to touch them when I put them on and when I take them off...NOT when I'm running!!!<br /><br />They're pretty hyped in the low end, but that's partially because they just do a great job of sealing off the ear. I have had 20 sets of headphones for running. These are the most comfortable so far.<br /><br />As long as they don't quit working in a month, I'll call this a 5 star product, especially considering the price.<br /><br />The only negative I've found so far is that the voice that tells you when your headphones are on and connected sounds like an angry astronaut sending a blotchy transmission from the moon, but it's such a minor thing I can't take away any stars. Super happy."
1,Great earbuds so far. Ran and trained with them.
1,"I used to use expensive Earbuds like Dr Dre and bose all of yhem above 100$.<br /><br />So after i watch alot of reviews about this product i decide to try it since its cheap price.<br /><br />After two days of workout usein these Earbuds am so empressed for this price i got high end quality, amazing package, noise cancellation excellent its even much batter than the expensive Earbuds that i have, sound so loud if you want. Does not drop while u running or workout, real battery life around 8 hours this product worth every penny i paid for. Highly recommended.  try it nothing to lose its just 35$"
1,Very nice head phone. It is connects to my forerunner 645 watch and I used it for running.
1,I can still hear the surrounding areas but the sound is crisp. I love it that it only cost $17! I believe it was on Unbox Therapy on YouTube. Lew never lied!! Too bad that my 👂 just gets sweaty. Good product! Thanks 😘
0,"I am sure these will work fine for many people but they would not stay in my ears no matter what I tried.  They were a bit heavy and did not fit securely so there was no way I could workout while wearing them.  I feel like my ears are pretty average size but my earlobes are detached, I am not sure if this was the issue but wanted to let others know.  The sound quality was nice but I had to give them away because it was impossible to use them without getting super frustrated"
1,They fit my ears well and they stay still while I am running. The seller was also help with an issue several months later still within the warranty period.
1,Fit great and have extra buds for different fit. Battery last a long time and the quality of sound is really clear.
0,Receive these as a gift and These were great earbuds for the price but unfortunately only lasted about 2 months before the right earbud stopped working.
1,I love these! Great product. Great company to work with. Earphones exceeded my expectations. May get more for Christmas gifts.
1,"These are legit. Range from my phone is about 30-40 yards. I walk the whole gym without them cutting out. Stay in my ears through everything. Snowboarding, running... and I used them all day snowboarding without turning them off for two days and hey still said they had 90% battery. Not sure how true that is but they didn't die! Get them! I just hope they last. Have only had them for two weeks. Time will tell"
1,Great product and reliable service provided ! Happy to trade again.
1,Decent set for price
1,"These are working GREAT for me.  Cost, service:both excellent."
1,"I needed some Bluetooth headphones for the gym, as I kept getting all tangled with my wired headphones while exercising. I didn't want to spend a fortune on something that was going to be used during active activity, so I saw these on the top of the list and the price was definitely well within my budget. I received them and was surprised at the sound quality and especially the bass that came through in comparison to my iPhone headphones. The noise cancellation is great, as well, as I definitely have to pause my music if anyone is trying to speak to me. It's Bluetooth connection is strong, too - I can walk across the gym to pick up a weight and leave my phone at the equipment I'm using and there is no break in connection! The battery life is pretty decent, as well, but it doesn't give you much warning once they're running low. It's not joking around with you when it says ""Battery Low""! Regardless, I highly recommend this product if you need something that is inexpensive but of good quality."
0,"Do NOT pay for Beats! These work quite well. Battery lasts a very long time. Nice bass response! Good fit. My only complaint would be the mic not picking my voice up adequately in a phone call. And there is some wind noise when walking/running caused by the housing design.<br /><br />OUTSTANDING customer service. They will make sure your are happy with your product!<br /><br />Revised: After a year, these headphones constantly cut out. They sound good when/if they are connected."
1,They were super easy to pair with my fitness tracker and they are very comfortable to wear.
1,Fantastic little workout bluetooth headphones. Good sound quality and very comfortable. Would recommend
1,My son love it. Good sound and quality.
1,"I don't have anything to compare these to, but they are wonderful for listening to music. I've bought 4 of these over the years and gave them gifts and they were loved by the receivers."
1,"My headphones came fast. Awesome case. Great sound, great range. My dog walks have become a lot more enjoyable listening to music while we walk. Love them."
1,Great headphones ...  I use them to listen to music and talk on the phone.  I take conference calls for work on these headsets -- the quality is great -- clear --  Just perfect.  Thank you.
1,"Aloha this is my second Bluetooth headphone, this by far is superior. I am totally pleased with the quality very well made.  I appreciate Ken the owner for standing by is proud.<br />Mahalo nui loa<br />Robert Kuya Alamodin"
1,good product . i like it
0,"Update: this is my second pair. Using with iPhoneX now. My first pair just stopped working. I thought it was a fluke because I left it plugged in to charge for a long stretch of time. This pair also just stopped working out of the blue. Won’t charge or turn on.<br /><br />Former review: Works great aside from very occasional interruptions in sound. Used with iPhone 6s. Sometimes when turning it on it wouldn't run sound through the headphones automatically. I'd have to go to Bluetooth settings, disconnect and reconnect."
1,"I use these headphones while running and although I just started using them, so far they work well. I have some trouble keeping the ear buds fixed in my ears during long runs but that has been a problem with every headphone set I've used without rigid support bridging between each ear bud. The sound is good and the design should prevent sweat and moisture from shorting out the speakers."
1,"I bought these after I got my new iPhone7 so I can listen to music at the gym.  They fit well since they wrap around the outside of the ears and come with 3 sizes of ear bud casings.  You just need to figure out which size works best for you.  They stay in place very well while exercising.  I would have given it 5 stars, but the only issue I have is that sometimes the button that turns on / activates everything seems a little finicky.  After turning them on, sometimes they say they're connected, but they get no sound.  I'll have to turn them on and off a couple of times to get them connected to the device.  The sound quality seems good, although I don't have any basis of comparison since this is my first set of wireless headphones.  But I would recommend these for anyone looking for a well-fitting set of wireless headphones.  They do block out almost all of the outside noise."
1,"The package arrived within one day as promised and the headphones comes with so many extras, chargers, case, various charging cables and so much more.  The sound is amazing and is as good as other high price headphones. the headphones don't fall out and are sound canceling.  I absolutely love these headphones and the price was great.  high quality product and excellent vendor.  I highly recommend this vendor and headphones."
1,"Very comfortable to wear, excellent sound quality! I like the additional accessories and the neat box :) Most importantly, the customer service is superb! I had a problem in one of the buds so I wrote them via the amazon email and they sent me a completely new set within a few days! Would definitely recommend to a friend."
1,Work VERY well. I do a lot of bar work and am upside down a lot for handstands and these suckers work fine.
1,Can't keep them in my ears even after changing the buds and the floppy ear pieces aren't much help keeping them secure in dynamic situations
1,Great
0,"I thought there was a catch when I saw it was going for $25 but normally over $100.<br />At first I was impressed by the sound quality, but then I found that if you moved the right earbud at all while music was playing, the music would skip. Left bud was fine.<br />Really disappointed and not likely to buy this brand again. Better to stick with pricier buds that are more reliable.<br />Remember: if it seems too good to be true, it is."
1,"I just received these and tried them out during my workout.  These things are great, stayed in place and the sound is very good.  Easy to set up via bluetooth, great product."
1,"I have been looking at wireless headphones for awhile, but I didn't want to spend top money on a pair in case they didn't fit my small ears well or they didn't have the quality of sound output I was hoping for. These have worked out great, especially for the price and I have been recommending them to family and friends."
1,This is a great headphone at a great price! Very impressed with the sound quality and durability for a fraction of the cost. Great buy!
1,First pair of wireless earbuds. I am mainly using them to Bluetooth to my TV while working out. I am impressed with all the extra wires and chargers that Senso gives. The sound seems very clear. A decent balance between bass and treble.<br /> I called into Senso tech support because the lowest volume was too loud for me (pairing to my IPhone). The tech support was very helpful and did a factory reset. That seemed to work. He also suggested an app (equalizer) to help.<br />Overall seems like a really good purchase for under $30. My only complaint was I wish the ear gels were a little more comfortable (they are kind of thin). I did workout with them and they stayed in and connected the whole time. I would recommend them.
1,I have had no issues with linking these up to multiple phones and ipads. I have it synced to my fitbit as well. No issues. Sound is great and they stay on.
1,"Best bluetooth headphones!! I recently had Zipbuds,  pretty good but these Senso bluetooth headphones are much better. More bass in these headphones than the Zipbuds."
1,Well worth the money !  I bought these to replace of plantronic cordless Bluetooth headphones my dog ate.  This set was MUCH less expensive and in my opinion much better. The fit is much better. They feel good in the ears and don't feel like they are going to fall out and I love the case they come in. These are definitely worth the price.  They arrived quickly and in great shape.
1,Got a pair for myself and my boyfriend. The sound is really good. So happy when it came with three ear insert sizes and a foam ear insert. The carrying case is sturdy. Be careful if you get this since putting the headphones in the carrying case sometimes accidentally push the power button so the headset turns on when you may not even mean for it to. The volume works really well also.
1,Great for the price very comfortable and sound is very good.
1,"Wonderful - I have a problem with running with normal earphones, because they fall off - these don't and have great sound quality"
1,Sound good till used outdoors . A lot of wind noise is created by the portion that is not in the ear .
1,"This is all opinion, but I seen the reviews before I purchased it. I think the company makes a well and affordable product. However based on my experiences sound quality takes a hit. The base from a song sounded a bit muffled, couldn't hear lyrics to clear and the button logo area felt bulky.  As I mentioned, its.great idea and affordable. Anyone should enjoy the product if you don't care about &#34;DJ quality&#34; sounding headphones."
0,"I don't remember what the advertising blutooth range was for these headphones but unless my phone is in my pocket, they don't work. I would say max distance is 5 feet if there are no walls or windows in between. I am also still struggling  to get them to fit my ears properly. So far, they're more trouble than they're worth but a) they hold a charge for a long time and b) they sound good when they're on, so 2 stars.<br /><br />Update: I use these only when I mow the lawn. It's been a year, I use them once a week when for 3 hours at a time. They have a terrible short circuit happening in the wire, so badly that I can't hear anything if I turn my head to the right. Not a great product."
1,These are really nice headphones for the price.
1,"These are great! Work really well, sound quality is great, and it’s easy to set up! Instructions it comes with are crystal clear! I definitely recommend this to all my friends now."
1,Sound quality is excellent.<br />Noise cancelling works and earbuds fit very well.<br />Wearing them is like being in your own world.<br />The only issue with that is possible safety - if you want to make calls or listen and still be aware of your surroundings then a single ear bluetooth would be a better choice.
1,"I like these headphones, seem to have a good range, I've never been disconnected.  Stay in well while exercising."
0,"I bought these headphones because I thought the wireless capability would help with listening during my workouts, but these really just ended up being more annoying as the headphones slowly slide out of my ear no matter the size of the earbuds used."
1,I am very happy with my headphones. Very comfortable and great sound.
0,"I really liked these at first, very comfortable and fit well. But soon the charge went from lasting all day to only a few hours and now the blue light will indicate that they're charged but they immediately die. So, I've had them less than a month and they're already useless."
1,The sound quality and bass is awesome. Great at noise canceling. They fit comfortably with my glasses. The best part I don't have to keep readjusting them while I'm walking.
1,Good product for the price!
1,"Battery life is okay.. could be longer. My biggest problem is getting it to play music from my iPhone (which is supposed to be the whole point of these earbuds) . There’s many times where I’m pressing buttons for 5-10mins trying to get the music to play through the earbuds rather than the phone itself, even while it says “paired-connected” on my phone"
1,"Great product. Extremely comfortable, sound is terrific, they have not lost connection in over 2 hours of use while walking."
1,"I love my headphones. I had a problem when one ear began cutting in and out. When I informed Tekatron know of my issue, they immediately responded and walked me through a manufacturer reset. Unfortunately that did not fix the problem. They immediately sent me a replacement set. All of this transpired within a 24 hour period."
1,These are the most comfortable earbuds I have ever seen. They're so lightweight you almost forget they are in your ears until someone trys to talk to you.Which brings me to the sound which is just amazing for their size. They produce dynamic tones through the whole spectrum. Truly an Amazon best buy.
1,Extremely easy to set up and use sound quality is adequate for the price point
1,"Foam earpieces seem far better then any other form if you don't mind them being a bit dirty. Sound quality is not as good as others -even very cheap pairs- but so far durability has been great, and having controls on the earpiece is far better then in line for balance on your neck."
1,I put 4 outta 5 only because evend though I am happy with this product and currently enjoying at this moment when I opened the box the only thing missing was the wire tie listed on the box. Now this doesn't effect the device it's self just wanted to make it aware incase other boxes were missing different items.
1,"They're comfortable..have great range and don't come loose when you sweat. I've got them paired to my iPhone 7 plus and they're great. I gave them a 4 because they do drop connection sparingly but are good mostly...sound is a tad bass heavy also, but otherwise awesome"
1,"Best in ear headphones,  ive purchased alot of them,  these by far are the best! I thought about the beats by dre,  no need,  these do the job just fine! I will by another pair,  long lasting battery,  great sound."
1,I am more than impressed with these headphones. 30 dollars?!? Really that's it?? I'm very glad with the purchase they sound better than I thought they would for that price and wireless.
1,"Amazed by the quality , I like the adjustability of the ear pieces and fitment."
1,Super super by excellent headphones great battery life great sound will recommend to everyone the price you can not be I promise these will Be just as good if not better then a very expensive pair
1,I really enjoy these. Very nice.
1,"At this price, cant go wrong......i feel the high frequencies are a bit muffled, they are good enough"
0,what a piece of junk! went off within few months of light use! doesn't boot-up anymore though I made sure it is charged
1,"Took my ActivBuds S-250 to the Rec-center today. I liked them very much, Excellent HD sound, Comfort, fit, function, really great,<br />These are the real deal, Everything you need, Extra Eartips, wire tie, car charger, charging cables, right down to the carry case could not<br />have been much better at such a wonderful price point."
0,"The sound quality is very good on these especially depending on how far you get them into the ear. The microphone on these is absolutely terrible and does not work at all. For example, taking a phone call will require to remove the buds in order to talk. Otherwise, the style is good and charging is fast. Just wish I had full use. I tried to contact the seller back in July and no response."
0,I used the headphones for 2 months after going trough 3 pairs of MPOW headphones and yet again I run into another brand that has a great price but if you use them daily don't last. At least these didn't melt.
1,These are great headphones! The fit took a few seconds to get used to but the sound quality is really good. Easy to install and they were playing music within seconds. And it comes with some additional goodies I was not expecting.
0,"I've been using these for a couple of weeks now and they CONSTANTLY cut out.  Sometimes they are fine if I turn them off and on a couple of times, but finally decided today I can't take it anymore and will send them back.  Based on reviews I might try them again one more time, maybe I just got a bad set."
1,"I bought these to connect to my laptop because it's SO aggravating to deal with my corded ear buds while moving around. They are very well made, the sound quality was excellent BUT they keep disconnecting from my laptop. I tried connecting them to my phone to use while I work out and I'm having the same issue. No matter how good the sound quality, if they won't stay connected, they are useless to me. I will probably give these away as I ended up buying a pair of wireless earbuds from"
1,I found them easy to pair with my iPhone and were fantastic at the gym!
1,"For this price, these are probably the best earbuds that you can buy. It's even better than some earbuds that I bought at a $40 price. The sound quality is very good, especially at this low price. What makes these stand out is the quality of design. The over-ear rubber doesn't just flap about uselessly and it's not too hard. You can literally bend them to the shape of your ear or however you want them to be shaped. I've bought several other brands of earbuds, and none of them deliver on the build quality that these have, especially the fit on my ear."
1,"After buying 2 lemmons, tried the Senso headphones and they are good. Easy to setup and had no problems with my iPhone and iPad.<br />They come in a nice package with the accessories posted. I’ve used them in the gym, in noisy places (restaurants), and on FaceTime calls without issues.<br />Their only flaw is the bass.<br />If you lusten to rock music like I do they do the job, but I listened to bass heavy tunes and the lower frequencies sounded distorted. I was able to get around this with the EQ settings in Spotify so it wasn’t a big deal to me.<br />Again, high end Bosse will sound better, but I’m comfortable with this purchase."
1,"I love the product, so much so that when I lost the first set I bought another one.  I used them mainly in the gym and I don't hear the music they play throughout the facility.  The sound is very clear, and when I talk to my husband while wearing them, he hears me quite clearly, and I'm a soft spoken person."
1,I've been using these for my nightly jog through the neighborhood and they work great!
1,So far the  great quality nice  sound and I love all the extras
1,I have used the headphones for a week and I am very happy with them so far. Sound quality is very good. The fit is great for working out.
0,I am not sure if the product is of cheap quality or the one delivered to me was a defective piece. It broke on the first day with the normal use.
1,"My earbuds stopped working unfortunately. When I called customer care for support, without even asking any question, they offered me a free replacement!<br />Overall great sound quality and durability"
1,"I've been using it for 2 months and it works so good, charge very fast  and the battery really do as 7 to 8 hours also!"
1,"I'm very happy with this product. The sound is fantastic. The packaging was really well put together. I was happy to find a carry case and a car charger too, which I didn't expect. I've already recommended this product. Definitely a good buy for the money."
1,"They did what I wanted them to do, which was to listen to audible books. I like them so much when my dog chewed off the ear buds, I bought another set. Pairing was also very easy once I read the directions."
1,One of the best purchases on Amazon in quite a while. I was not expecting such good quality for such a low price. A true gem.
1,"Good value for the money. Battery lasts many hours between charges, and charging completes quickly. Many other included items, so I'm not sure how they're selling these headphones at this price...but, glad they are!  This is my first set of Bluetooth headphones (as I normally prefer wired sound quality), but I am very happy with my purchase, so far, and did not have unrealistic expectations about audio fidelity.  Some may find the overall size of these to be too big, especially if you wear a beanie or other hat that goes over the ears, but I have not had a problem with them, yet."
0,Sound cuts out constantly
1,"Decent sound quality, but they stay in."
1,"I own several pair of bluetooth headphones, and I was looking to expand my workout gear by adding wireless earbuds to the collection. I'm glad I picked this brand. They fit very comfortably in my ears, and they stayed put through a 4 mile run. The buttons are very easy to use, and the volume is nice. Now they don't have the most clear sound, but they get the job done for me, as far as working out comfortably is concerned. If I want concert sound, I have headphones for that."
1,So far so good.  Good sound and mic as well.  I am pleased with these!
0,Stopped working after two months of light use...
1,I love these headphones!  They work very well.and are easy to set up.  They come with multiple ear buds along with a car charger. The clarity is great and work amazingly at the gym!
0,"Bluetooth connection for these earbuds is terrible.  I kept losing my connection – once when my iPhone was under me.  I realize that these are cheap, but don’t waste your money – you buy cheap, you get CHEAP."
1,"Not bad earbuds for the price that I paid ($30). They do have good sound but sometimes the bass gets a little muddled. As in when listening to rap or dubstep or EDM or anything with deep bass, the earbuds kinda muddle the bass to where the rest of the sound isn't that clear. But what I can't figure why this only happens sometimes. Sometimes I use them and the bass is fine, no muddling at all, it sounds perfectly clear. So they aren't super consistent in that regard, but everything else such as acoustic music or music that emphasizes vocals like Sia's Chandelier they work perfectly. Battery life is pretty decent, i get about 8-10 hours most of the time. And for those curious people I'm using them with an iPhone 6s Plus. As far as exercise they are very secure as in they don't fall out, and previously i've just been using apple earpods. So I do like them alot but would they be worth the MSRP of $180? Absolutely not. Worth $30? Yeah I think so, although I would not have paid more than $40 for them. Overall not bad, just the inconsistent bass bugs me, but other than that no problems."
1,Headphones are great! My only complaint is the ear clamps should be a little firmer.
1,"I had been in the market for a new set of Bluetooth headphones for quite awhile, and finally, after reading all of the reviews, decided to pull the string and order the SENSO headphones.  There was a delay in receiving the delivery...no fault of SENSO, but the customer service team helped identify problem & provide direction as to how to remedy the situation.  I received my delivery the next business day.  The quality of the product, carrying case and ancillary supply was far better than I expected.  The set-up/pairing of the headphones to my girlfriends iPhone was very simple.  The sound quality, intuitive design and comfort has for an initially positive buying experience.  I like them so much, I plan on purchasing a second set for myself!"
1,"Honestly,  this piece is amazing and very high quality,  i had the beats wireless and my son lost it so i start looking for another one but cheaper than beats and i just got the senso today 10.04.16 and it is better than beats in my opinion.<br />If it is still available get it because it's great for work and gym. And i used it for both today."
1,"These are amazing! My husband ordered us each a pair of these. They are an amazing price for the quality. You feel like you're wearing one of those super fancy brands. They come with a cute case and lots of different choices for ear bud size, so you can pick the one that works for you. We have already recommended this to our family and they love theirs as well."
1,Was a gift and so far good reviews. Not as nice as beats but for the price it's a good buy.
1,Great headphones!
0,Sound is horrible. Nothing like the description. Bass distorts the music.<br />Not good at all
1,I use the earbuds when I do yard work.  No problems with them and nice to not have to worry about wires anymore.
1,"I have purchased these for my husband and my father. They both rave about how loud, comfortable and long lasting they are, and they both wear them to run and mow grass.  My stepmother bought a pair for herself after trying them, and I’m just waiting for price to go back down to get them for myself. I just wish they care in different colors."
1,These headphones are a good value but if you are looking for high end sound quality I would not recommend them.  They do deliver good loud sound and the quality of the materials seems good for the money but there is distortion when the volume is high and even at lower volume levels the sound is just muddled.  I'm no sound engineer but I am a musician and if I play the same song through my air pods they blow these headphones away. Obviously there is a $125 difference in price so that has to be factored in.
1,They work great! It's nice to be cord free!
1,"The sound is great! But the part that goes over your ear is too flimsy. It keeps falling of the ear. Otherwise, I would give five stars."
0,"I recently purchased this product, i am really disappointed about this product. When i connected this to Samsung 8, while using the headphones suddenly it's disconnecting and some noise is coming when i was using this phones. I am going to return this product and ask for refund.. I don't recommend this product to anyone and not worth for money!!.."
1,Awesome buy
0,These Senso headphones are poor quality. They quilt working after 6 weeks of gentle use.
1,Fantastic earbuds at a super low price!
0,"I'm sorry to say these only worked for a couple of months, and then stopped taking a charge.  I used them perhaps a dozen times.  I kept them in their case, and charged them after every use, but then they quit on me in the middle of a song, and no longer work at all."
1,great buy don't miss this one
1,"bought this for my 14 year old son and he absolutely loves it, he uses it for running at school.  It's also water proof and he goes in the pool with it, he just wanted to see if it was really water proof and it sure is"
1,"I've had these for almost 2 years now.  They honestly are worth every penny.  I use them mon-fri, 8hrs a day behind a grinder sharpening knives all day.  Even with the dirty atmosphere and metal shavings they work great.  Even if they only last 6 months I would buy them every 6 months.  Just reliable as heck.  Simple 3 buttons. on off.  volume up down. and change songs. If I had to complain it would be make the battery last a little bit longer. But like I said almost 2 years and they still last about 7hrs.  Can't beat the value. TRY THEM!"
1,"These are replacements for an identical-looking set I purchased a number of years ago. The sound quality is excellent and the base is true. They are very comfortable to wear in the gym and I find that they are far better sound quality than any of the non wired earbuds."""
1,"I lost my headphones unfortunately. I used to use it at gym. In office, if I put sound at (what's equivalent to) 7 - everyone around me would hear the noise. It is light, battery stays long and it looks good."
1,"Bought these on eBay and they are the best earbuds I've ever used.<br /><br />I used to have an old pair of wired Beats earbuds, and the conventional wired beats, plus I currently own a pair of bluetooth iLive headphones and these Senso earbuds work better than them all.<br /><br />Be careful not to turn the volume up all the way for an extended period of time because it'll probably cause damage since these earbuds are VERY loud."
1,"GREAT HEADPHONES!  I've had a few, but for the money these are by far THE BEST!"
1,"Sounds ok, none of the earbuds fit except the nerf type."
1,"For their price these Bluetooth earbuds are hard to beat. No, they don't sound like high end earbuds, they don't have some sexy charging case, but what you get is a decent headphone that performs accetablely and is a great compainion for the gym. I would recommend these to anyone that needs a good pair of beater ear buds to use at the gym with no regrets!"
1,Crazy good deal for the money.  Bought ear buds that cost twice as much that crapped out in about 2 months and didn't sound as good as these.  had these for about 6 months now and still going strong!
1,"I purchased these to replace a pair that I have that are still working, but they hurt my ears after a while.  I was worried that they would not have enough noise reduction if I didn't shove them in my ear canal like I had to do with my old ones.  Surprisingly, you don't have to do that, and the ear clip is nice to keep them comfortably on your ear.  The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the blue light blinks regularly while the headphones are turned on and that is a bit annoying.  I also really like the cord that has the dual iPhone 6 and beyond port as well as the charging port all in one.  I've only been using these for about 1 week and am really liking them."
1,"Comfortable, but even the smallest set do not fit in my ears, just my ears, not the fault of the phones...the generic wired iphone earpods do though???....they stay in place well,, I just don't get the best audio.  They come with a charging cord for your ipod/iphone and a zippered case both which improve the satisfaction of this purchase.  I love the charging cord and the case.  The earphones are reliable and easy to use, and I have run them for three-fours  hours or so, they haven't run down yet.  I wish there were some way of telling how much charge is left.  The company is very responsive.  I had an issue with the first set, company refunded the purchase and I bought another set.  I would buy these again."
1,The headphones work at a good distance from my phone and are comfortable to wear.
1,"I used the headphones to run, they did okay but one of them kept twisting inside of my ear, kinda annoying but could just be a personal problem."
1,"Great sound, quick connecting blue tooth, comfortable !  I like them"
1,Very good so far.  Only had it two days.
1,Couldn't ask for more for the cost. Great value!
1,I love the sound. Battery is great!
1,"I had only one issue after about two weeks of use. My cell suddenly wouldn't connect or recognize the headset. I was bummed and tried and retried every which way that the little instruction manual was suggesting. Message kept saying 'Connection failed&#34;.<br />But I finally just deleted the &#34;Active Buds&#34; from my bluetooth device list, and it reappeared with a reset.<br />So happy again.  Issue hasn't happened again. But if it does, I'll know what to do.<br />Just simply a great bluetooth headset. Especially for the price!"
0,"These are the worst headphones I have ever owned. I bought them to use it when I ride my bike. The Bluetooth connection constantly goes in and out and they're unusable. I have tried rebooting the headphones by telephone, and the connection to no avail. They appear to be a quality product but they simply do not work the Bluetooth connection is awful. This is a brand new top-of-the-line phone and it connects to everything that I've ever tried to connect you via Bluetooth without a problem. I'm returning them. Can anybody recommend good Bluetooth headphones reasonably priced that I can use on my bicycle?"
1,Did not work as well while swimming but they work well for anything else
1,Have been using my SENSO headphones now for about a week and I really like them so far.<br />I gave up on wireless headphones last year when I went through 3 pairs of Motorola headphones the would stop working after my first or second use at the gym... so I'm glad to have found these SENSO Bluetooth headphones and am very satisfied so far.
1,"Sound quality is very good, there are buttons for every function I need. I'm very happy with this product."
1,These ear buds are awesome theyou connect to my phone with no issues real easy to understand and use an very comfortable and there soft thank you
1,Got it on time. Used it 20+ time. Not as good as wired version but it does not get in my way while lifting weights or running.Much better then the other junks at the same price.
1,Works pretty good for the price. Signal gets intermittent when windy. Good quality.
1,Extremely impressed with the sound quality in the price that I paid for this product not only do I work with headphones but I also work out with them and this is a perfect products or both and has a nice Sleek smooth and small design as well as offers premium sound quality and amazing price I couldn't Rave about it more I am completely satisfied with my purchase and the amount paid I feel like I got a steal of a deal thank you SENSO for providing such an amazing product
1,working great so fare
1,"Love these. I've had them for over a year and they're still going strong. They put out pretty good sound quality for a low price. Perfect for using at the gym. Easily could get a 5+ hour battery life from one charge. Definitely hold on to the spare ear prices, they get kinda gross after awhile."
1,"This is a great product and perfect for my workouts. However, more than that, Senso's costumer service has proven to be particularly exceptional and I would definitely recommend them to my friends and family."
1,Really good product
1,So far I love my headphones! Set up and controls are easy; sound great. Has some nice bass tones. Hope they work well for a long time. I feel like I found a bargain.
1,Very good headphones and nice price.
1,"I have small ear canals.  Finally a pair of headphones, bluetooth, that stay in my ears.<br />The fact that they are waterproof means I can use them while bike riding.  They don't completely block outside noise. Some would consider that a drawback, but it's not safe when biking."
1,"I just tried it on a long run, and it worked very well.  No glitches.  It stayed in my ears which is something I was concerned about.  The sound quality was excellent.  The ear hooks are comfortable.  They're soft, so I worry a little about the durability.  We'll see.  So far, so good."
1,Comfortable and great sound.
1,Clear sound and secure fit
1,Maybe it's me and if your like me none of the buds truly fit. They tend to slip out and you'll need to keep your head still to keep em in. Forget about cardio exercises. These will fall out in 2 min flat. Either the sweat causes the slipage or the rubber and buds dont seal well.<br /><br />Maybe try using foam tips on these for good seal and better sound.<br /><br />However the sound is great. Nice and loud.<br /><br />And the battery can last you days which is sweet because I forget to charge them a lot. Beware the annoying female voice when the battery is low. She'll tick you off before shutting off.<br /><br />It's waterproof and I can vouch for it since I've carried them through days of sweat and rain storms.<br /><br />Good deal but beware they might not fit or stay on that well.
1,Excellent value for dollar. Very comfortable
1,Works great
1,"Below I have pasted the email I sent in reply to Invotek, regarding the Senso wireless Bluetooth headphones I purchased-<br /><br />&#34;Wow!<br /><br />Thanks for checking on me! :)<br /><br />So far, the Senso headset has exceeded my expectations!<br />I truly am, super happy with them.<br />The sound quality is great and the fit....<br />They fit my ears better then ANY OTHER EARBUDS<br />set-up I've had.<br />They have better base and volume then the air pods for my iPhone!!!!!!<br />Thanks again for the email.<br />You give the impression of being a top shelf company!<br /><br />Rebecca<br /><br />I will add for this review, that the phone call capability is also remarkable.<br />People I'm talking to can hear me perfectly and the answer/hang up function is easy to use.<br />I am seriously happy that I bought these!!!!"
1,"I've had it for about 3 months. I've liked it so far. The pieces that hook onto your ears are a little stiff but it works fine. I wear glasses and they don't interfere with my glasses. The sound is fine. No problems, yet."
1,"My only major problem with these is with, of all things, aerodynamics. The sound quality is fine and the battery life is great, but if I do anything where wind is blowing toward me, from walking on a windy day to riding my bike, generating my own &#34;wind&#34;, the air blows around the earpieces in a way that mostly drowns out what I'm trying to listen to."
0,Received a broken product
1,I have several Headphones and these Senso sound like others that cost over US 100. Also great customer service!
1,"More than I expected for the price.  Great sound and fit, even with sunglasses.  Secure with no movement during my trail runs.  Great product."
0,I have trouble getting the headphones to stay connected to my phone.
1,Very good for the price ! I like how you can bend the ear loops to really fit your ear .
1,"Excellent product, easy pairing and good sound quality you got your money's worth."
1,These are hands down the best earbuds I’ve ever owned. The BASS is Astounding !!!!
0,The sound with music is good but voice is hard to hear.  The batteries do not last nearly as long as advertised.  Overall not overly impressed with this product.
1,The sound is amazing on these headphones!! I'm am 100% surprised and happy with the quality of these headphones for such a low price. I did get the 3 year warranty just in case but I'm already in love with the headphones!
0,To many wires
1,"the sound is superb for the money and the small box is full of goodies, that make really happy :D<br /><br />you get more stuff for the money.<br /><br />:D"
1,Great sound quality but really easily affected by wind; earbuds stay in place well
1,"Easy to get hooked up to Bluetooth, the instructions were very good. The ONLY negative thing I find about them is that the earbuds don't fit real well in my ears. I am an average female, and changed to the smallest buds, but the fit is not great. The angle that they fit in isn't quite right for my ears. The sound is awesome when I press the earbuds in really well with the palm of my hand, but that's not a real comfortable way to go about my business."
1,"I like the packaging, the charger is equipped for android & iphone. I dont care for the design of the headphones the string could be more adjustable also the headphone part that goes over the ear is very flimsy. The sound quality of the headphone is loud but doesnt drown out noise all the way."
1,Excellent sound and easy to pair and use the buttons. I was surprised at the quality of the sound. Ligth and soft in your ears.
1,Just got these yesterday. Syncing them was easy. Very comfortable and great sound. So far I'm very pleased. Now I'll see how they do when I work out.<br />Update: I never got to wear them while working out because I guess my husband liked them too and he stole them.
1,pretty good.
1,Great bluetooth headphones. I would buy these again.
1,Awesome product. Four types of ear pieces to ensure fit.
1,these are very comfortable headphones.  I usually find earbud type headphones quite awkward but have no problems with these at all.  Also the sound quality is very good.
1,"I ordered these to use this summer because my $150 over the ear Bluetooth headphones can get to hot. I thought I was trading sound quality for comfort but I was shocked at how great these sound. They actually sound better than my other headphones. Plus there are lots of extras in the box. A nice carrying case, charger, etc. I am going to get another pair to use when I am exercising. I highly recommend these because they are well worth the money."
1,"Sound quality met my expectations,  but the fit was very loose and lacked sufficient structure over the ears. The cord between the two ear pieces is especially long with no way provided to rein it in, so I used a twist tie."
0,Does not work well with my new Dell laptop.  Works okay with the iPhone 6 though.
1,"I use them for the gym, I love how they stay in place and are not bulky."
1,"So far I am please with my purchase, that I ordered another for my wife.  To my surprise, the headphones are extremely light and comfortable to wear."
0,I have ordered two senso Bluetooth headphones two my family members .. out of two one is not working as expected right ear was completely not auditable I have raised a concern about this but no response .. product I liked it . But only concern is one headphone is not working ..
1,Do not like the fit - keeps falling off.<br />Audio is good.<br /><br />I would not recommend.
1,Great Bluetooth headphones for the price. Good noise cancellation especially with music on. Controls are very intuitive and easy to use. Charges fast and lasts.<br />Accessories provided are great and definite bonus.
1,Talk about quality. These headphones can survive. Accidentally put them through the wash. Work just fine still. Great product
1,Better put on the phone on the right side to keep a better connection
0,"I'm reviewing these headphones in regards to 2 things:<br />1) sound quality: I am by no means an audiophile, but the music quality on these are a 3/10. It is not just a little bad, it s VERY noticeable bad quality.<br />2) Comfort for working out: The buttons to go next, pause, raise volume up and down and the fact you can talk without the phone in hand is very nice. When lifting weights it works fine, but when it comes to any form of high intensity movement such as jumping or running, the headphones become very loose. The strap that goes around the ear does not do a good job of serving it's purpose. I will be buying a new different set of headphones."
1,"Very happy with the product, it manages to stay secure while doing high interval Fitness training. Great sound quality and easy to use. My only issue is the charging port, the part that closes up the charging port feels very tight and hard to maneuver out of the way to plug the charger in.  The part feels like it is going to break off. But again overall very happy with the product.  I would definitely recommend this product for anybody who's looking for a good Bluetooth headset at a very affordable price."
1,The sound is very good and the battery life long.<br /><br />The customer service was outstanding. They took care of a problem I had very easily and quickly.
1,"So far so good. Great sound. Fits well. I do wish that I could call specific phone numbers via voice command, bit that is something I can live with.  If there is a way and someone knows how let me know."
1,"Excellent quality, easy charging.  Get 2 pair if you are a constant listener so one can be in use while the other is charging."
1,"Not much of a difference in look or feel from the Beats by Dre.  Comfortable and fit well with plenty of different ear bud fittings.  Great product, and would make the purchase for yourself or kids who want Bluetooth earbuds."
1,Exactly what I was hoping for.  Well packaged with clear instructions.  Paired easily with the smart tv that we wanted the headphones for.
1,"Very good product for the price. They might not  be the same quality as bose or beats,  But they are definitely the best bang for your buck."
1,"For the price it's pretty good. However, what I absolutely hate about it is that when the device needs to tell you something, it does so at maximum volume. For example, you are in the middle of a call and *BATTER LOW* interrupts at 5 times the volume of the call, its enough to make me jump sometimes. It then continues to do that every 30 seconds until you plug it in, rendering the earbuds useless for the rest of the charge. Also, if you are using the volume buttons on the headphones, and you get to the top or bottom of the volume range, it lets you know by delivering a shrill, piercing beep directly into your inner ear. It's extremely unpleasant, to the point that I am reluctant to use those controls at all.<br /><br />The sound is ok, bass is punchy as mentioned by some other posters, and I like that, but it's nothing special. Call quality is pretty good if you are planning on using these to talk to people often."
1,"First off, these are the best Bluetooth headphones that I've ever owned. They are superlight and comfortable on my ears and great when I wear them on my long cardio workouts. The pairing with my smartphone was a snap and my phone easily recognized and paired with the Senso headphones. I've owned several brands of headphones in the past and none paired as easily as the Senso did. The controls are laid out nicely and the sound is excellent. This company cares a lot about their product and their customers and you can tell not only by the superior quality of the headsets, but the packaging and extras in the box are topnotch. They include a nice large case for the headphones, a pretty cool cable that is dual use to charge your headphones or iPhone. It is a nice touch. You know you're getting a high quality product when the cardboard box is thick and opens easily. When a company takes the time to design packaging that delivers their precious cargo, then you've got a great set of headphones in your hands. I'll definitely will be buying another pair."
0,wont turn on or charge 4 months in
0,El producto ya no me funciona. No se que paso. Tiene la luz que dice que esta cargado pero no logro encenderlo
1,"First off, the good - the sound is very good.  Now the bad - the ear plugs point downward, don't know anyone who has ear canals that point directly down; no matter which extra covering I try the ear bud does not like to stay in, and the very floppy ear holders just are too floppy.  I had wanted a set to wear when I work on my farm, in the rain, snow, sun, etc., these just won't be those."
0,Worked well for 3 months and now it doesn't work. it turns on and stays on for about 15 seconds and turns off. same thing happened to my last wireless earbuds (not this one). just bought airpods and those should be good for a while.
1,They work great! Don't have to worry about the wire from my Ipod to my headphones.
1,"These are some great headphones in my most humble opinion, they feel great in my ear, they fit snog around my ear, the sound is great and clear and is even better that i can change the sound with the equalizer on my music app. I can't wait to see how they hold up while in the gym. I am happy with this purchase."
1,So far great!
0,These worked for 5 visits to the gym.  Then they no longer would connect. I returned them.  You get what you pay for. I'm planning on getting Beats that will last more than 2 weeks.
0,"Sounded ok, but the constant drop out of the signal was terrible"
0,"This thing, suck's it worked perfectly until it came...it said low battery so I go to put it on the charger it, said in the instruction's the light should turn on if it's charging but that didn't happen.... and I left it for 2 hour's and took it off the charger and it still didn't work."
1,I just started using these and I love them.
1,Price is great but on a long run I noticed I'm adjusting them in my ear quite a bit...can get annoying.
0,These are OK headphones and would probably sound good if the left side had bass. The left side has been defective since day one. The right side is about twice as loud as the left and actually has bass.
1,"Works great, nice case but everything does not fit in it. After first recharge will not pair to device. Contacted customer support and they schooled me on how to resolve the issue. Works great again. Thanks."
1,"I have used these for 2 weeks and so far I am pleased. Great sound and ENOUGH VOLUME! I hate getting a new set of earbuds, trying them out, turn them up and they just aren't loud enough. I am mixed on the soft silicone earpieces, I would like for them to be firmer. Of course time will tell.  I think there are many versions of this same headset out there. I had a set very similar to these that only lasted 3 1/2 months, just past the return expiration. We will see how these hold up."
1,As the headline says the second headset (bought it in December) failed in about 3 months. I also did not like the over the ear hangers of the second set. The material is softer (comparing to the first one) and wasn't holding its shape.
1,"well built, long lasting battery"
1,"The echo on the other end of a call made me return it.  Noise canceling worked as advertised.  Music sounded great, so if you want to use this product for listening and not talking on the phone, it's a great deal."
1,"no need to spend the extra $$$$ just to get a &#34;b&#34; on them unless you have money to blow!<br />I just gave the earbuds to my son for his 14th birthday yesterday and he is THRILLED with them!  Every time he puts them in his ears he says, &#34;WOW...I didn't know they did that!&#34;  Lots of cool accessories came with the earbuds too!  Great buy!!"
0,"These worked semi-okay for several months. There were a few instances when it would not pair with my phone (even though I had it saved). I am mostly disappointed in the fact that I barely had these 6 months before they went out on me. They have a full charge but are unable to turn on, even after I restored them to factory settings. They will not respond unless plugged in to charge. Don't buy unless you want to spend $30 again in 6 months for a new pair."
1,Very good sound.
1,I never write reviews but I had to for these. I've spent over $200 for headphones that don't sound even close. I like all the nice little perks but sound is my main goal for headphones (go figure). I literally have them on right now and I've gone through all my Spotify genres from heavy metal to techno.  Classical to ambient and everything. These things are blowing my mind. When I first put them on I thought they sucked. THIS IS KEY-- SET YOUR EQ TO THE DESIRED SOUND!!!!!!!  If you have the wrong eq on your device they won't sound good at all!  Eq it to your taste and you will not be sorry. And for the price???? I mean come on.
1,just got these in the mail and used them at the gym. overall Im very satisfied with them. great fit in the ear good sound and they are not in my way when i do squats. the piece that fits around you ear seems to be a bit flimsy but i have only wore them once so i do not know if they will hold up over continued use.
1,it comes in a very nice carring case.  I really like the 3' charge cord with the dual function.  thats a very neat idea.  it works great and I am very glad to have it.
1,"Very good headphones. Running or working out, these didn't move at all. Stayed in place very well."
0,The sound was great but it stopped charging after two weeks.
1,These headphones are inexpensive but very good quality. I have used them for a week and already love them. They don't fall out of my ear and have amazing sound. I would recommend them to anyone!
0,"Kept falling out of my ears, had trouble making a call"
1,"great product with amazing sound. I was on the fence on whether or not to get more expensive headphones, but I decided to try these out instead. was not disappointed. the sound is great and does cancel out all excess noise at the gym."
1,"I bought one for my use; it is clear and sounds great! My husband has used one from a competitor for 5 years, but after hearing mine he asked me to order him an exact match. Highly recommended."
1,It lasted about a year now it doesn't want to charge any more. Need to find mb other brands...
0,The headphones stopped pairing with any of my devices after only a couple weeks. Very disappointed that they only lasted this long-I will be switching back to Anker brand as those had much longer lifespan for me.
1,Use the product during cardio workout and quite satisfied until charging problem develp[ed. Contacted customer service and was very impressed with prompt resolution
1,Works great. I had to wait and extra day for delivery due to Hurricane Matthew.  Love them so far.
0,"This is not what I want, those headphones don’t fit my ears. I would never buy them again."
0,"Doesnt properly stay in my ear takes a while to attach it to my ear, it gets annoying also I cant connect the earphones to my laptop."
0,Worked well for the first month. Now after around 30 minutes there is static noise. Also sometimes it is hard to connect to iPhone 7plus.
1,"I purchased this headphone with $36. The performance is okay for the price. However, the original price $160 make me feel bad. It can fool customer get a great bargain. I can't believe it was such a high price before. Also, I couldn't find the original price info from other website.<br />Thus, my three star was because of the suspicious original price. If someone show me the proof of the $160, I will change my review."
1,"&#34;My kids love these headphones, They say that the sound is great and they are so comfortable. The seller made sure they arrived on time and in great condition.&#34;"
1,"Great product, ordered FIVE so far.  Will order more for other people in the office.  GREAT SERVICE ALSO."
1,"I bought these for use on vacation. I have a long flight in a couple months and I wanted small, lightweight, noise-canceling headphones for the trip. These appear to be what I need. The setup was easy, I paired it with my iPod and the music sounded fine.  My only concern is whether the headphones will be comfortable for an 8-hour flight."
1,"So far, I love them. They are comfortable and loud enough to play my drums. I was tired of a cord head set, so these are working great so far.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Will Dillard"
1,Got my headphones yesterday.  Sound is excellent and they are very comfortable.  Great value for the money.
1,"Bluetooth headphons are easy to set up.  Sound quality is great.  Very comfortable on the ears without falling off.  Does not have much bass though.  Perhaps, that's the same for all earphones with this size."
0,Everyone complains about how I sound when I talk to them and everything cuts in and out. Didn’t last more then a few months.
1,"Shipped crazy fast.  Packaged perfectly.  Comes with everything you need.  The headphones are comfortable and for the price, you can't go wrong.  Would definitely recommend."
1,Great sound and fit. Excellent quality. Very durable. Also got a pair for my son.  Also great customer support.
0,Ive had these several weeks. I used them once and they worked great. Then I skipped a day and by the next day they were dead. I recharged them. 6 hours later went to use them. Dead. The charge does not hold even when powered off and charged within a day. I'm incredibly frustrated with these and want my money back.
1,"I like these headphones a lot, they are comfortable and work well.  They also have a lot of nice features many others don't.  I wore them to the gym today for the first time and simply walking from the car to the gym I couldn't hear the music at all due to all the wind noise that I was getting.  I tried all three of the ear pieces and it was the same for each.  They are comfortable and I would purchase them again, just be aware they are not for outside."
1,Excellent battery life and sound for the price! My boyfriend is a mail carrier and uses these every day.
0,"These earbuds have no range, only work if your phone is in front pocket, connection is frequently interrupted, have underlying hum while connected, do not stay in ear during running workouts despite multiple sized inserts. In general they do not perform as advertised. Company did their best to resolve issues by replacing with a second pair, but both perform in the same manner."
1,I love these! They're a great price and the battery lasts a good amount of time and they charge super fast. Would definitely recommend!
1,Great product and even better warranty service. I had these ear pods for about 10 months when they developed a short and the left side stopped playing. Sent a message to the seller and tried a reset. When that didn't work they sent out a replacement unit within the week. Easy no hassle thank you for supporting your customers!<br /><br />I will mention this for you runners out there. This set of ear pods only problem is wind noise. If you are running into a headwind it can be pretty loud and drown out your music. Just FYI...
1,"Hello Mr. Backstrom: I sent back the first order because I did not see the wire tie. I reordered the ear phones again and unless I,m going blind I did not see the wire tie in this order either. No big deal. I can go without it. Have a Magical Day! *@*. Carol"
1,Great product.  Perfect for my workouts. And when I did have an issue with one earbud not working the customer service response was fast and accurate resolve the problem and I'm back on my bike I love these earbuds
0,"Overall, I was looking for a decent set of bluetooth headphones that would stay in my ears while running and doing activities. I learned that the hooks over the ears are super flimsy and almost pointless. They don't help much for keeping the headphones in my ears - I have to wear a hat with them in order to keep them on.<br /><br />Bluetooth distance - up close with your phone, the connection is great but when I get about 10 feet away, things start to break up a bit.<br /><br />For the sound, it's not bad. My big gripe here is that when I'm doing an activity with a lot of background noise (mowing the lawn), the volume doesn't go high enough. I can barely hear anything.<br /><br />These headphones are ok for now but I'll likely be getting some different ones in the near future."
1,"used these for the first time yesterday, it was easy to setup and easy to use, love them!!!!"
1,"Just got them 2 days ago and have used them everyday, without needing a charge yet. They fit well, sound great, and stay on without falling off! I love them."
0,"An excellent bargain for the money. I would give it 5 Stars if it would tell you the condition of the battery when you turn it on. You only find out it's about to go dead when it tells you the battery is low. If I had known earlier I would have charged it, wouldn't I?<br /><br />UPDATE:  Not much more than a year later, the left ear piece intermittently goes out. No way to fix it. obviously only manufactured to outlast the warranty by the merest amount of time. Don't bother."
1,Great sound quality. So far no problems with the Bluetooth connection. I have pretty small ear canals so I have to use the smallest ear buds that come with the headphones otherwise the sound is muffled. Otherwise no problems.
1,Great product. Using it to work out.
1,Great quality sound both playing music and good mic pick up for phone calls (a lot better than I'd thought it would be for calls).  As a result I ordered a second pair -- one to keep in my workout bag and another to use at home in our hot tub or sometimes I use them at my desk too.  My 4 vs. 5 star is the cord is long (which is fine) needs a small rubber grommet to tighten up around the back of your neck.  Obviously I have made it work which is why I ordered the second pair for my use (so I have them available in different places).
0,These are for sure the worst headphones I’ve ever tried. I am a long distance runner and not only do the earbuds pop out every few minutes they are very heavy and bulky over the course of a long run. I tried some of the recommended things other reviewers have posted here to see if I could somehow get these to work for me but they are going back. There is no wind reduction with these. The overall sound is heavy muddy bass with a small trace of upper range. The only thing I liked about these was the easy and reliable Bluetooth paring with my I phone. I am going back to my trusted  Rovkings.
1,"This is the second set of Senso earbuds that I have purchased.  The sound quality is very good, and the over the ear fit is very comfortable.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone considering the purchase of a Bluetooth wireless device."
1,The headphone have a great fitNd fabulous sound. I just purchase them and love them. The are great for new iPhone 7
0,"Work less than a month I bought this on March 9, and stop working! I DO NOT recommend this product."
0,"This is my second pair after the first set stopped working after a year.  This set reluctantly connects and then will drop the connection during various activities.  Apparently, I just ran out of support for this item even though it is only a few months old.  I will be looking for an alternative to these for my next set.  Even though they are inexpensive, they should still work.  I am also looking to process a refund or a replacement under the warranty provisions and will update if/when that occurs."
1,The sound is amazing. I was looking for headphones for a while and reading reviews of course. I love everything that came with them as well. These are definitely worth the money and to me they sound just as good as the expensive ones. I got pretty excited when I heard them the first time. Easy to connect and charge quickly. I'm very happy with them.
1,"Review after approx. 6 months ownership:<br />Pro<br />- Battery lasts ~5 hours<br />- No problems after running for 2 hours in full rain<br />- Audio quality is fair enough for sport acitivity<br />- They are not noise blocking / cancelling. When listening to audio books you can still hear shouts / bells of overtaking bikes.<br />- Can be charged with many USB cables (had issues in the past on smaller devices, where USB cables with a bit more plastic wouldn't fit)<br />Con<br />- There seems to be a distance where connection issues are more likely. E.g. when I place my phone in the pocket of a light jacket, I get frequent interruptions. However, no problem if it's buried deep in a large backpack.<br /><br />Overall: worth every penny."
1,after using it they work well but at first the light is not visible that indicates it is on or off
1,"Good sound, not great."
1,"This headset works as described.  They work well.  The only issue is they are big, the ears buds have 3 sizes.  I same is to small and the medium is to big.  I use the small and at times have to push the earpiece back in place.<br /><br />I wear hearing aids, but when I work out I use the SENSO because they are waterproof.  The mic on my hearing aids pick up wind noises, you mic does not. My one telephone call while I was using the SENSO when well."
1,I do not leave many reviews... much less many 5 stars. Why? maybe im not a fan of the costumer review system as i feel it stears me wrong sometimes. I will perhaps say that i want to leave reviews that reflect customer service interactions. IF the product goes in that review then that is ok too! So... i had a pair of these headsets that i bought 11 months ago. They have a year warranty. Thinking the company was going to blow off my request for a replacement i just went ahead and bought these. I didn't even give them a try to make it right. Except the second pair that i ordered came with a software defect that was quickly fixed with a hardware reset. When i informed them that i bought the new one just to replaced the old one the immediately offered to replace the old pair. Now this i did not ask for. They offered! These are the things that i give 5 stars for! Good customer service! Read other reviews to see how good these headsets are ( they are loud clear and have plenty of base!) If you are looking for a great pair or behind the neck headsets at a bargain price these are it! But what makes you come back is a company that stands behind their products! THis felt like an Apple kind of response but this is a small company that wants to build its reputation! IM convinced! Good job ! Very impressed!
0,"Had them for a few months and they worked well during that time. I thought the sound was good and they fit well. After a few months, they just stopped working. I've learned not to go cheap on earbuds, you are better off getting a reliable pair for more."
1,Love them.  Do not fall out of my ears and very comfortable to wear. Sound is great and using to answer the phone not having people tell me that they cannot hear me.  Someone mistook them for the really expensive brand...so for the price a great buy.
1,I have been struggling to find earbuds that would fit in my very small ear canals did a search specifically for that and this was one that came and it was my last resort but I'm very happy with them they fit my ear just fine the earloop helps to hold the the tip in sound is good I'm very pleased overall with them
1,The sound is very impressive and connection to my cell phone was easy. The flexible ear loops work well over my glasses ear pieces.
0,Good looking headphones but often would not connect to Bluetooth.  Just stopped working after only a short time.
0,Had these for just about two months. We're excellent for the gym. Put them in my ears and they stayed put. Took them down to Virginia on vacation. Found one of the ear buds slightly ajar and tried to snap it back into place. The volume control disappeared in the process. Was hoping for something a bit less weak on the quality side.
1,"Great earbuds! Very good sound quality and it fits nice even to my ears, what is really rare."
1,Bought this for my husband and he loves it. Excellent quality and sound.
0,"The ear hooks fit weirdly/didn't really do anything, and I'm not a fan of this type of in ear headphone that relies on suction on the ear canal to stay in."
1,"I enjoy wearing these earphones around the house for my phone calls and also when I am listening to audiobooks while I take walks in the park. Comfortable and easy. Love the round box that they come in, as I also store a few other tech items in there as well. Bluetooth makes it a dream, rather than plugging in traditional earphones to my cell phone."
1,"Little bit hassle to plugbon ear, but you will get used too. No complain so far."
1,Great earbuds!
1,Great product better than my bose earpiece love it and battery last long too.
1,"They can be a bit staticky at times, but mostly work well. They stay on my ears unlike most other buds ive used and the sound is nice and loud"
1,"The quality of the music is good enough if you’re using it only for working out. I would not use these as your main headset. They begin to hurt if worn for more than 2 hours, and the wire that connects the two ear pieces is freakishly long. I cannot run with them as they flap around and disrupt the music. Basically you’d hear this “rubbing” or thudding sound as the wire hits your back. I have since got a hair tie that I used to knot the long wire and it isn’t so bothersome. Battery length is dependable."
1,Great headphones for the price. High quality sound.
1,much better that the powerbeats3 when it comes to battery life.  It connects with iphone without any issues.  The powerbeats died after 4 months however this piece of art is still working.  Updated 5/28/2018.
1,Nice product good quality
0,"I bought these Senso Bluetooth Headphones in January 14, 2020.  This month (August, 2020) they quit working.  At first the functionality to adjust the volume and song selection quit working and then a few days later they completely died, and would not charge or power up.  I called the service phone line (888-683-4941) and they attempted to assist me in resetting the headphones, to no avail.  They recognized that they needed replaced and told me they were referring the problem to the warranty department and I would be contacted in 3 days. . .NOT.  I have called the service line 3 times and sent 3 separate e-mails to the warranty department (2 thru there web interface and 1 directly from my e-mail account) and HAD ZERO RESPONSE TO MY REQUEST FOR REPLACEMENT!<br /><br />If you want a headphone with a warranty DO NOT BUY THESE HEADPHONES!"
1,These are pretty good ear buds for the price. There was some issue with the ear buds cutting out or static being heard.
0,"I bought these for walking and working in the yard. The Bluetooth connection was fine when standing upright, but as soon as I was kneeling or bent over in the yard the connection was horrible. I tried for over an hour before giving up. Unfortunately, I will be returning them."
0,"They sound great and support is fantastic during the warranty period, but I just had my second pair die 11 days out of warranty and they denied the claim.  I'm looking for something better.<br /><br />2 other pairs in the family are doing fine, but reliability seems to be a crap shoot."
1,"I was hoping that these would work under my motorcycle helmet, but they stick out too far to fit.<br /><br />The zipper on the case broke on day 2.<br /><br />On the plus side, the pairing was simple, the fit is comfortable and the sound is not bad for earbuds.  Full sound, maybe a little bass heavy to convince people that they're better than they are, but overall Im impressed with the quality."
1,"&#34;     I am truly impressed by the sound quality. Just now listening to: Beethoven, Diabelli-Variationen, a complex piano recording, and it is so crystal clear as to be almost scary. Now, I am sitting down, and have not gone running, but sound quality is important to me. At his price point, I am very comfortable recommending these to even the most discerning listener. &#34;"
0,"They stay in your ears almost no matter what, but they are bulky. The size creates that good bass sound. They draw attention they are so large. Unfortunately one pair I bought has already developed a circuit problem when switched ON. It creates a terrible noise then shuts off right away. Into the trash it went.<br />Now the second pair quit and won’t even turn on. It charged overnight and is shot.<br />Going into the trash again."
1,The products works really well and it’s an affordable alternative for anyone that wants to go unplugged while practicing activities or talking on the phone
1,what i do not like about is the warr.
0,They work fine but the right earpiece wont stay in my ear. I switched to the largest earbud but it still wont stay in.
0,The customer service is a call center and all they do is read from a book.Do not waste your money on a piece of junk.....They have the nerve to ask me if I want to buy another one...Really!!!!
1,"I work in a very loud noisy setting, these headphones do a great job with noise cancellation. By far my favorite pair I've owned. I bought another pair for my girlfriend once I seen how much I loved mine."
1,"These are better than I expected!  I have difficulties keeping headphones in one of my ears and these stay!  And the sound quality is pretty legit too. I wish they maybe went one notch higher on volume but at its highest, pretty much drowns out most of the gym noise. Happy with my purchase!"
1,"Nice headphones, great for working out."
0,"At first I really liked this product.  Ordered additional for friends and family as presents.  The sound started fading in an out and one ear didn't work after a few months.  Contacted the seller and they assured me ""they would take care of it”but asked that I try resetting it.  This worked for a few weeks and then the problem resurfaced.  I recontacted them and now they say its out of the warranty period and won't stand behind their product.  Frustrating but you get what you pay for I guess.  Just beware that these will work well for some time but be prepared to buy new ones after a year.  Not bad I guess for $30."
1,So far i have any problems They were nicely<br />Packaged arrived very  fast.  I'm happy with my<br />Purchased
1,These are great ear buds.  the price for what you get is absolutely phenomenal..  If it was safe I would use them while riding my  bike.<br />They are great!!!!
1,Love this for running because it stays in your ears.
1,"These are the best headphones I have ever bought and paid I paid much less for them!  Sound is loud and clear, highly recommend."
1,EDIT: I contacted customer support and they were super prompt and helpful<br /><br />I was really impressed with these headphone when I first got them but I've have them for less than a year and the left ear peiece isn't making sound anymore. So I guess they are okay as long as you plan on replacing them :/
1,"They were working fine, they did cut in and out a bit but for the bargain I wasn't too bothered. They just died on a run in about 40 minutes into a fully charged battery. They make a '2- boop' tone when trying to turn them back on, plugged in or not. It also shows a blue indicator light for fully charged as soon as I plug them in. 2 weeks outside of the return window too. Pretty frustrating. I wouldn't recommend these, very highly.<br /><br />Edit 10/19/17 (next day) if your headphones just poop out mid use.. **So while plugged in, hold the button for seven seconds and that will initiate a factory reset, then unplug and attempt to re-pair to your device.** this did in fact reset the buds and they work again!  Customer service got back to me super fast with help and asked for my Amazon info to get me into their warranty system so that was a relief too!  I see these things are 20 bucks now instead of the 35 I paid a month and a half ago.. Lol I'd say go for it but get them registered with senso and read a few of these reviews to get an idea of what you have in these.<br /><br />I'm just glad I can put off getting a new pair for another bit and I might actually get another for only 20 bucks. I get sweat all over these things so I gotta wonder if they eventually get a little in there but oh well. I see reviews on much much more expensive sets and it's exactly the same as these bargain brands so idk. Good luck ear budding out there!<br /><br />Edit #2 10/19/17 customer service is definitely worth a 5 star. I think I said in here it looks like reviews are similar for these no matter how high the dollar amount.  So I'd have to change my mind and highly recommend these with the caveat of them being definitely what you pay for. Decent. Customer service, to notch."
0,The volume is horrible  You can not turn up the volume to any reasonable level to hear. It does not go ups whisper no matter how you adjust your phone or the head phones.
1,"I've been looking for a pair of wireless headphones for a while, and after a Kickstarter not delivering on their product, I started looking for a cheaper alternative. For $30, these are definitely worth the price. While they look a little bulky, they're really lightweight and the sound/connectivity is surprisingly great! At a medium volume and the correct sized earbud, they block out a good amount of sound. I have smaller ears and my daith pierced on each side and these are really comfortable sitting in my ears for some time on end."
1,"Absolutely the freaking best. Took a month for them to die the first time. Makes my workouts sooooo much better. Don’t have to worry about them coming out of my ears. Can’t say enough good things.<br /><br />update 6/24/22: guys. guys. these headphones. they’re still my headphones. only just now is there a small short in the left ear, so i have to wrap the cord around my ear for it to play, but damn. 5 years with no issues. Small issue now, but still extremely good buy. 10/10 would recommend"
1,I have never had such an awesome  experience  with bluetooth  ear buds.
1,"Love them, great sound & very easy to set up & use."
1,Good bass though highs are a little flat. But overall really good for the price
1,Great fit and sound.
1,"I work outside doing underground powerline work, so these headphones are exposed to and put through quite a bit, and hold up fantastic. Recently I wore them in a heavy rainstorm during a job and they didn't get messed up. And they sound great and battery lasts forever. Very happy with these, they exceeded my expectations! If I manage to wear them out I'll definitely buy another pair!"
1,"I have been looking for a pair of reasonably priced Bluetooth headphones for a very long time. This pair popped up on my reccommended items and I'm so glad they did! I've had a lot of trouble with bass in headphones but these pick up everything! I did a test of about every song and YouTube video I would listen to and watch and I couldn't be happier. I have not done a running test, but I have done multiple sessions at the gym and they haven't fallen out as of yet. I also have small ears so I run into a huge problem when it comes to ear bud size but these come with replacement buds and the smallest fit perfectly. The instructions pamphlet is easy to understand and thorough. I really couldn't be happier with these, and I couldn't recommend them more.  I've also attached pictures of what came in the box."
1,Great sound and louder than my LG headset I paid twice as much for at Verizon a couple years ago.
1,As an old man (60 yrs of age); I'm still old school and I'm slowly getting into the 20th century.  Two years ago my son recommended I get a Smart Phone and in some way my world expanded.  However I still used a MP3 player for my music and was reluctant to use my S5.  Well I finally caved in but wanted to get wireless bluetooth headphones.  Well my son naturally sync the both devices. I listed to my music on the S5 and it was GREAT!  Answering calls was very easy.  Purchasing these Senso Bluetooth Headphones was well worth the money.  Outstanding Product!
0,"I really liked these headphones and used them for just over a year. I work from home and enjoyed using these to listen to music and seamlessly answer calls as well. The range was great, I could leave my phone in the office and walk at least 30-40 ft away without losing signal. I had switched the ear pieces to the foam pieces that came with it and after a month or so they were hurting my ears so I wanted to switch them. One ear piece came off fine, the other actually broke the headphone instead of coming off. You can see in the picture that it broke at the seem. I owned these approximately 15 months when this happen and since they didn't break from my own abuse, I sent Senso an email. They responded with a mere 5% discount code and advised it was out of the 1 year warranty. Had this been my fault I would understand not wanting to offer further assistance, but this appears to be a weakness in the product. While I enjoyed these headphones I will not be purchasing another pair."
1,Great sound quality & superb noise cancellation.
1,"Brand new these earbuds lasted about 3 hours on a full charge. A year and a half later of moderately heavy use, they last about 20-30 minutes on a full charge."
1,"Great quality and value.  I was really impressed with the sound these headphones deliver, and for the price, I can't see how they can be beat.<br /><br />Update:  One problem I have found with these headphones is that on my IPhone 7, I have to delete them from my Bluetooth settings after each use and then restore them when listening to books on Audible.com.  If not, I get intermittent reception when listening to Audible.com books.  It doesn't seem to be a problem with other Aps.  Since I mainly use them for books, it is a bit of a nuisance. It may be an Apple issue for all I know, but I thought it worth mentioning.<br /><br />About 3 months after purchase, the unit failed.  Contacted vendor and replacement sent right out.  Can't beat that for service."
1,"These are great. Just charge them, then them on, and let your iPhone do the rest.  I have fairly small ears (I guess...) and the clip around my ears feels a little loose, but the earphones have actually stayed in place perfectly while I've worked out. The sound quality is great and the controls on the right earphone work well."
0,"Pros: Low cost, functioned as advertised.<br /><br />Cons: Sound quality is VERY poor, I'm not and audiophile by any means, but the treble is harshly muted and base is pretty much non-existent with obnoxiously tinny mid-range. No control over EQ with the music apps I use, and the general EQ on the iPhone has zero effect on the way these sound. These SENSO headphones are some of the worst I've ever used.<br /><br />The biggest downvote is they won't stay in my ears while I'm running, and I've tried every variation of ear plug that came with them. I attribute this to their bulky and awkward design...they stay over my ears just fine, but won't stay in, and it just further reduces the already sub-optimal sound quality.<br /><br />I'm not sure what I expected at this price point, but don't let the other reviews fool you. These are low cost, and very low sound quality. Pretty disappointed with my purchase"
1,"Just got these the other day to replace a broken pair of Jaybird headphones.  I was obviously skeptical due to the price being so low but after seeing all the reviews I figured they were worth a shot.  Wore them for the first time today and love them!!  I can't believe how well they work and fit for such a low price.  No issues connecting at all and I LOVE the ear pieces that came with them.  I have tried Beats headphones and I can't ever get them to fit right in my ears.  I was worried as these look the same - but the ear pieces worked amazingly well.  Tight fit and that helps block out the outside noise too.  I wear these during crossfit so lots of running, jumping, etc.  They stayed in great and there were no issues with sound.  Don't be afraid of the price - these are a terrific buy."
1,Great product. Bought these for my husband. He's been so pleased with the quality of the product and the sound. I've been impressed by the longevity add he tends to be hard on anything he uses frequently. Would recommend these to anyone in the market for wireless
0,"I bought these so that I could listen to podcasts and audiobooks while I take my dog for a walk.  I've used these everyday for the past week that I've had them and these headphones are a major disappointment.  Whether I keep my iPod in my pocket, in my bag, or even in my hand, the sound cuts in and out constantly as I'm walking.  It really only stays connected if I am perfectly still.  It even cuts out if I'm standing still and just turn my head to the side.  It's also difficult to hear the sound on a mildly windy day.  These headphones would only be satisfactory if you were indoors sitting down, had your phone/iPod lying flat on a table within 2 ft of you, and you kept your head facing in one direction the entire time.  I'll probably keep these for when I travel on the train or in a plane since that's when I'll be stuck in one position for long periods of time.  And I'd be totally fine if I lost these while traveling."
1,"So far these headphones are amazing.  They have great sound and were very easy to pair with my iPhone.  The controls work great and it has 2 charge cords, one which works as an iPhone cord and charging cord for the head phones. I have only been using them for less than a week but have not needed to charge them yet.  They come with a car charger but unfortunately it does not have a wall charger.  That is the only draw back, but again you can just use the phone charger.  Really pleased with this product."
1,best headphones ever
1,Great product and the price point is attractive too.
1,They work great!  Very satisfied!
1,"Comes with a headphone case, spare plugs and charger cable. Battery lasts forever! Charges very quick. All positive aspects for such low price!"
1,"Great headphones. They are comfortable, sound clear and have great range at my office and home."
1,I bought the dre beat wireless headphones that look exactly the same and they malfunctioned after two months. I got these at 19.99 and they come with all the extras and even more accessories than I could imagine including an extra fastener for the wire band!! what a great value! has everything you need and stays perfectly in your ear while intensive running
1,"Very easy to pair with other devices, easy to use, great sound"
0,After 2 weeks will not turn on.
1,"Looking for wireless gym headphones? You found them. I love these earbuds (for the price). They came with a really dope charging cable that accommodates the earbuds and my iPhone in the same cable- something I haven't seen before. They charge fully in about 90 minutes and will last me about 5-6 gym workouts that vary anywhere between 40 and 90 minutes. In addition, they include a dual port car charger and another mini usb charging cable. Excellent value for sure! I cannot speak to the longevity of the product, I can however say that for the price they have excellent sound quality and stay in my ears while playing basketball. Kinda creepy how easily/clear the calling is. Probably better than actually using the phone by itself. Unless you're looking for very high end headphones, I can't see anyone being unsatisfied with their purchase."
1,"Great fitting earbuds for running. Much better than a pair that cost me 5X as much and didn't fit as well.<br />Sound for me is great, but I am admittedly not an audiophile.<br />I had a problem with the Bluetooth connection that quit working after using for two months. However, Senso customer service was very responsive and helpful. A new set was mailed to me the day after I first emailed them.<br />Very happy overall"
1,"I will give five stars if this product could fix this one issue: when battery is low, stop repeating to me frequently (per 30sec) and loudly (this volume is not controlled by you - it's default at loud) that battery is low! I got the message! It's just low, not dead, but keeping yelling at me &#34;battery low battery low&#34; could either give me a heart attack or kill my hearing someday. If you want to buy this, don't ever forget to charge it. The battery state of  charge stays at max for a long time, but once it drops a little bit it drops fast."
1,"Love these headphones. I have had these guys for over 6 months. They are fantastic. The battery is great. I accidentally washed them in the washer once, and they still work. I use them for running, and I never have to fidget with during my run."
1,"Pair easily, sound quality is good.  Can use as wireless headset to talk on the phone.  Holds charge for long period of time."
1,These headphones sound fine. They don't fit in my ear as well as I want. I've tried changing the rubber ear pieces (different sizes) as well as adjusting the over the ear piece. Maybe it's just me. I wear a headband over them to keep them in place when I'm exercising.
1,For the price these are great quality. Bought them for my spouse in 2018 and they still work great! I ended up buying a second pare to give to a sibling.
1,I love these headphones!
0,Stopped working after limited use. They would not turn on after only about 5 uses.
1,"the product works very well, connected easily to my Apple devices without the use of PIN/Activation codes.<br />the items were also packaged nicely and professionally as to protect the product during shipment."
1,"Great price..pretty good sound. However, the Bluetooth connection is spotty. If you don't mind the intermittent loss of connection, then this is a great buy."
1,"Great range from connected device. Can walk at least 30 feet away from phone or ipod and still have clear sound, but the distortion quickly builds after the previously stated distance. Long battery life thus far. No signs of battery memory issues from charging thus far. Great bass and volume level for the device. As it is my first Bluetooth headphones purchase and use, it is not a bad introduction to the technology or particular brand."
1,"These earphones rock! (literally) - water resistant, noise cancelling, and they stay in your ears during vigorous work-outs. GREAT PRICE! Already ordered another set for my wife A+++++++++"
1,"Very good headset, I enjoyed better than my iPhone headset"
0,"After looking at the reviews, I really had high hopes for these. After receiving them today I am very disappointed. I've tried messing with them, and kept questioning that maybe I wasn't wearing them right or it wasn't fully charged or etc... but it got down to the clearity of the sound is just awful. It cannot handle mid or high volume. The base is decent but pretty much everything sound like crap at mid to high volume thus making a buzz to the audio I've tried listening to. I even took the time to play sane audio from different device and from different sources but the result is still disappointing."
1,Use these everyday for working out or just when I want to hear music it’s great for it all it doesn’t cut off and it doesn’t get annoying when the battery is low but if you r bothered by the wire on these what I have done to make them feel better is put the wire on my head and loop the earbuds around the back of my ear so it won’t be moving around everywhere when I run
1,I must say that these ear buds are the best that I have had for several years. I work in a area that has a low noise level that will drive you batty.  These buds have done the best job yet of providing great sounding music keeping me sane.
1,"Buy these, for the price you cannot help but be thrilled.<br /><br />Are they the nicest, most refined or best sounding headphones I've ever laid my paws on? Of course not.<br /><br />At $30USD are they an complete bargain? Absolutely.<br /><br />I read reviews before buying pretty much anything, and went with these over a different brand due to the higher 4 star rating. I cannot say how thrilled I am, they pull double duty as a Bluetooth headset in the car and as the most convenient headphones I've ever owned for the gym. They sound great for the price, and I don't have any worries about sweating or showering with them. The car charger and dual lightning/microUSB cord are just a bonus with an already great product.<br /><br />If you want something that just works, and is way underpriced, buy these and don't look back."
1,"The Senso firstly, looks very masculine, which I like, i'm also somewhat hearing impaired and Infind it guite comfortable so far."
1,As expected.
1,Used them at home and they worked perfectly but on a plane with a screaming child in front and in behind me not so good
1,Works
0,I received everything in my package but Wire Tie. It would have been great to get everything I paid for.
1,"I'm have been surprisingly pleased with the quality of the sound and ease of use, only thing I would recommend is the strap that ties them together is a little stiff and would have like to have one a little more flexible."
1,"So far so good! I've only used them a couple times, but they were easy to pair, the sound is fantastic, and they stay on my ears. I have very small ears, so that's always been a problem. I used the memory foam ear bud cover on my left ear and left the other medium one on my right ear, and it seems to be working well. I would recommend these! For the price, they are great!"
1,The fit well in my ears and have great sound. Very reasonable price. Would buy again.
1,"I dig my new headphones! I just wish they had a toggle for the cord, rather than that little black piece."
0,From day 1 lasted less than one hour during long runs.  Bought in late June. Quit taking a charge at all in late October.  Now junk. Would also lose connection and skip or miss sometimes at minimal distance (i.e. my pocket).
1,"These work fine when I'm at the gym.  Good sound compared to other Bluetooth headset I've had however when at home using the same phone, they do not work.  Continuously drops the connection to the point I can't even use them whereas my other headsets work fine.  The include car charger is a nice bonus but rarely stays in and continuously needs adjusted"
1,"So far they work great!  Got them for my husband as a gift, he sweats a lot and goes to the gym every day.  Good long charge, perfect fit.<br /><br />Update, stopped working, requesting a refund.<br />Company sent out replacement earbuds asap, no hassle at all. Thank you very much!!"
1,Paired easily. Decent sound and fit. Imagine their price and imagine how many expensive headphones you'd lose to break even. I'll take cheap this time.
1,For the price they seem to work just fine.
1,Really superseded my expectations. Decent quality for a nice price- the case is convenient.
1,"""For the price this has been a great set of headphones. I have not worked out in them yet to test the waterproof/sweatproof of the ear pieces yet. Sound quality is good and the ear pieces are comfortable."""
1,Absolutely wonderful quality
1,Bought it back in 2017 and it still works. Battery holds charge pretty well. Sound quality isn’t comparable to Apple Airpod but it is significantly less. I would buy again if it fails.<br /><br />I did get it replace once. They stand behind their product. I got a replacement without any questions.
1,Great headphones! Loudest I've had
1,"I used these with the Lantoo 2-in-1 Audio Wireless Adapter. To save time I'll paste what I wrote below. Very nice product, came with accessories and a carrying case, simply plugged into USB and charged an hour or 2. I watched an entire movie, listening to the audio on my computer in these headphones, acrosss the room. I recommend!<br /><br />On Transmitter Review:<br /><br />&#34;I bought this Bluetooth Transmitter to send audio from my laptop (which is attached to a bigger monitor) to a SENSO Bluetooth headphones. I was able to lay in bed and watch from across the room. Pairing was surprisingly easy, just had the headphones close and held the button on the transmitter until it began pairing. The audio dropped a couple times when I was first getting comfortable in bed, I think it was because I was resting my head against the wall?? I simply put a pillow more between my head and the wall and it was fine. Using the Senso headphones, I could walk around freely in my room and hear it the whole time. It's a simple to use product that's effective for the purpose I mentioned.&#34;"
0,"I was excited to purchase what sounded from reviews to be really comfortable Bluetooth headphones. I could not wear these for more than 10 minutes before I got a headache. The sound quality is very good, though, and it was easy to pair with my Samsung Galaxy s6. I like the hard case it comes with, too.<br /><br />My ear openings are too big for the small buds and too small for the medium buds. I can usually work around this, but for this set, the ear hooks and the main electronics part add a weight and rigidity that was instantly uncomfortable to me. So, my search continues."
1,i love these things....they are not over powering with bass but other then that they are kind of perfect i wear them from biking to weight lifting and i do not have to adjust i i forget to charge them and they still work hours for me they connect to my phone (Samsung galaxy edge 7) and with my ipad air 2 cant say that about most.....i highly highly recommend you try them for yourself
1,The bluetooth headseat works great with a good sound.
1,My ears are really sensitive so I wish they were softer but I made some adjustments to the size of the buds so that has helped a little. It covers all of my other needs however!!
1,Surprised by the noise cancelling effectiveness.  Comfortable and fits my small ears!
1,"Love these headphones, they are the only set I’ve found that will stay put while I run. No readjusting or moving around. My only complaint, the audio doesn’t work when I receive a phone call. Everyone on the receiving end says they can’t hear me. If not for that, I would give 5 stars."
1,Excellent!!
0,Disappointed. Takes at least 15 seconds to pair and sometimes it takes multiple attempts. Sive had to try 4 times to connect more than once. Doubt seriously these ever really cost the full price
1,Not sure if they are 100%... the right ear bud is static-y when jostled..
1,"Great so far, especially for the price. The only issue is they require a slight adjustment while you're running. They are still much better to run with than a pair of apple headphones"
1,"So far so good!  They fit very nice and have great sound quality.  Only have used twice so far, but I have no complaints!"
1,I have tiny ears and these fit great. The music is very loud even on level one through my phone.  So if you like loud music these are a must.
1,"Great sound, comfortable and long lasting."
1,Love them<br />!
1,First off just want to say I am not being paid for this review. These headphones are fantastic. I bought them to replace a set of lg tone pros that I bought back in November that went out. I use headphones everyday at my job and the design of these are awesome. I never worry about them falling out. And it's great to know that they will last me through the winter and spring rains. And the price was a lot cheaper than the LG's. A must buy!!!!
1,Has held up to daily use (and daily sweat) for over a year with ZERO issues. Best quality sound and durability for the money.
1,"Not only was the sound quality really good, but it truly canceled out all sound.  I would highly recommend these to anyone."
1,"The feel, fit, sound and quality is great. Love them! I am fully charging them right now and will use them at work and see how long the battery holds up, it says 6 hours and if they don't hold up close to the 6 hours I will be back to update my review but for now they are awesome!"
1,"My son introduced me to Senso.  Very nice, quality sound, easy to connect with Bluetooth to all my devices.  I recommend this product.<br /><br />The only downside is when I am connected to two devices and I leave the area of one of the devices, there is a slight disruption.  Problem easily solved by disconnecting the Bluetooth in the device I am leaving behind."
1,"Just had my first workout with these on and they are awesome. Here is my feedback. If you are looking for inexpensive Bluetooth earphones for your gym workout, go for these. They are cheap and they sound really good for the price. I use them for my 1 hour long runs. Usually my ears pain if I use earphoned for that long. Nothing like that happened here, sound quality was good and they fit really well. As soon as I got them I got an email from the company where they just wanted to check about their product, so 5 stars for customer support as well.Cant really say much about durability and battery yet. But sound,fit,price and customer support all aspects call for a 5 star review."
1,"Ordered two sets of these and they turned out to be much better quality than anticipated. Set up was not as intuitive as you would think and forced me to consult the directions but once I got them going they spent an hour with me on the treadmill streaming videos from my android phone.<br />No drop out the entire time in use.  Bass response for their size was good, but of course not as good as full ear covering headphones as you would expect, but audio is crisp and speech very intelligible.<br />The extra accessories supplied kept me from looking for things to make it work, everything needed is in the box with a nice carry case, I like that!.<br />A side note other things that produce blue tooth signals do interfere with setup and you should move to a blue-tooth dead area for an easier set-up experience."
1,They are ok just not as good as promised
1,Absolutely the best Bluetooth headphones I've owned! Cannot beat the quality for the price! Awesome battery life and amazing bass and noise canceling! 5++++ stars!
1,"These are comfortable earbuds, have good sound and noise blocking ability and joined easily to any of my blue tooth devices.  They came with three additional ear pad sizes as well as car charger with 2 USB ports and a USB iPhone charge cord.  It also has a nice zippered hard case to carry them in.<br />I have used these a lot and just recently bought an additional pair to keep at the computer.  Everyone will judge things like this differently according to their own expectations, but I found them handy and reliable with good sound quality."
1,The fit and sound of the headphones are great.
0,Sound was good for about 2 weeks then one side stopped working
1,"They are pretty decent for the price, the bass isn’t as good as I would hope but for price what I expected."
1,So far so good. .. sound it terrific
1,Nice pair of headphones. The ear clips are soft but still firm. The sweatproof feature is great. Comes with 3 different size buds for your ears pleasure and are super easy to clean.
1,Great sound at a great price. Very comfortable.
0,"I needed these for voice calls not music and either way they are not as loud as you would want them to be. Trust me . You need complete silence to say they are not too bad .. The charger stopped charging on my 3rd attempt as well. Had to use a different one. Other than that I still use them and they are only ok. Oh , and battery life is not too bad either . Hope this helps"
0,Won't stay in your ears once you start sweating.
1,I bought these two years ago to the day and they’re still rockin! I’ve put them through many sweaty days and rough b-ball pick up games. Impressed 😌
1,clear sound
1,works great with my Android phone
1,Only used them twice but so far I love them. I use them for the gym and they seem to drown out the background noise pretty well. The best part is they’re a little heavier than my last few pairs which makes me think they’ll stay in place better
1,Amazed at the performance of these at this price. I must have odd shaped ear canals because I have a lot of trouble with fit. I was able to easily find one of the tips that worked in my ears. Great sound!
1,perry good headphones would recommend buying
1,"When I bought these earbuds I wasn't expecting them to last more than 6 months. It has now been almost 3 years and I am still using them. They have literally been run over by a truck, submerged in a mud puddle, and worn in the shower (I do not recommend this)  and they are still going pretty strong. The only reason I'm ordering another pair is because there is a connection issue occasionally. Very impressed. Ordering again."
1,These are easy headphones to put on and stay on during workouts.  They have clarity and connected to the iPhone easily.  It was a good purchase.
1,"These actually stay in place during a full workout and battery life is amazing, from what I've experienced.  My dog got a hold of my first pair and I just had to buy again!"
0,terrible connectivity but what do you expect
1,Seriously one of the best in-ear bluetooth headphones I have ever owned. Sound quality for the price? 10/10. Bass sounds responsive and the comfort level is fantastic. Don't think about this. Just buy these. You will not be dissappointed. These are the best headphones you can get for the price
0,"I just received this in the mail today spent 40 dollars on a well used product thinking ill get the same results. Needless to say, the first thing i spotted as soon as i opened the package was how flimsy the ear strap was. Theirs no way in hell you can run with these ,work out with these, or even lay in bed with these or these will even stay in your ears. The weight of the of the headphones in how bulky they are with a ear strap that wont hold them in place or give them support in any way is horrible. i will never buy this brand ever again."
1,ABLOUTELY LOVE
1,These are the best deal for the money hands down.  They sound and work great.
1,"invotek and actual product was great,  just make sure you research the seller before you purchase.  Amazon was helpful in resolving issues.  I will buy fro this seller and recommend this product again.  The reason, i gave it 4 stars, i feel it is good for moderate activity levels.  I need something for trail riding, or running.  this works great for using for leisure bike ride, or working around the house.  I am getting a pair for my son, who wants one wen working at the golf course."
1,I was a little hesitant to buy these because the price was so low. To my surprise I love them! They fit perfect and stay in place while I'm running. Was easy to sync and have great sound. Very impressed! And a year warranty.
1,Work great!  Seem to hold a charge decent amount of time.  Comfortable
1,"Their battery life sometimes tends to be a bit short, but in the overall these headphones are good."
1,"When your looking for a product like this, unless you know somebody that owns this product, so hard to know, so hard to know (Trumpian).  SO you take a risk after reading the reviews that this product will work. Apple makes Bluetooth wireless earbuds, but OUCH! Expensive.  This set of buds works great. The fidelity of the music is very good for the price you pay.  You can answer your phone with it and people can hear your voice clearly.  Isn't that what we're looking for in a product like this?"
1,Excelente más de un 100 padrisimo. Buen sonido
1,Great headphones! The audio is crystal clear and I don't have any issues with them while I work out.
1,excellent sound!!
1,It’s a good product for people working out!
1,Quick delivery! The headphones sound great ! They have a heavy base which is why I bought them.
1,The earbuds were easy to sync to my iPhone and sound great
1,These are fantastic! I've ordered several different pairs of wireless bluetooth headphones and these are by far the best I've owned. The sound quality is excellent and they fit very comfortably in my ears. Well worth the price. &#34;
1,Love these... can work out in them without them cutting out like my Powerbeat 3’s
1,"These were some of the longer lasting bluetooth headphones I've had.  Sweat will kill them pretty quickly though.  I got about a month of running with them 5 days a week before they died.  Not great, but better than most in the price range."
1,Good quality.
1,They couldn't have been easier to set-up and they work extremely well and the sound is of good quality. A great bargain - highly recommend!
1,Amazing stuff! I did not expect the bass to be that deep
1,"These are my favorite wireless headphones - so far. High quality sound and very comfortable. With the ear loops, they stay on. The issue that prevents me form a fifth star is that the rubber cover that insets into the ear (the red piece in the product photo) falls off very easily. I lost mine within the first month or two."
1,"I have a problem with this... I'd love to love them and keep them but, the power of the BT reach is too weak. I mean, you cant go into the next room without losing connection. Yesterday, on my way to the GYM I put my phone under my armpit and the BT set disconnected. Sorry, but I need something with a little more reach and power. Sound it's OK, but don't expect too much. I use my BT to listen to Audio books and movie reviews on YouTube and that's ok for that."
0,My last pair proved wonderful; people I'm talking to currently with this pair are asking me to call them back when I'm not using my Bluetooth.  My work is over the phone so the only time I ever make phone calls via Bluetooth while driving.
1,I bought these for my son and he loves them.
1,"Quality of the sound is great, and I loved all the accessories that came with it, however the over-the-ear concepts doesn't work great as it's really more so just to make sure they stay on your ear and not secure in your ear. I have another pair of wireless headphones by another brand and I prefer those by far. The charging cord that came with was actually broken when I received it as well. I will be returning them because of this."
1,"These make exercising so much more enjoyable! They come in an excellent case, and are perfect for listening to music, especially when lifting. So glad my wife found these for me!"
1,"Great sound for the price, highly recommend !"
0,"While I wasn't expecting much for $37, I still returned them. I use them while riding my bike on a bike path. There is a constant wind noise coming from what sounds like the microphones. It forces you to turn up the volume to compensate. That in itself may have been OK, but the connection kept dropping out while riding. The phone and headphones were no further than 4 feet apart.  I never had that issue with my previous Bluetooth headphones (Plantronics) which finally gave up after 4-5 years. Too annoying to keep"
1,These are some of the best headphones
0,Doesn't stay on. Constantly adjusting to fit better.
1,"Good product. Very good quality. But it did not conceal all the noise of walking or jogging against moderate wind. Fits great, sound was good. Good value for the price. I ended up returning and buying another set of headphones for almost the same price."
1,I was looking for something I could use while not only running but lifting weights as well. They fit snugly in my ears and the clips allow me to keep the cord out of the way. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for an affordable option in headphones.
1,Nice in budget
1,Have used the headphones for  running and cutting grass. Worked great!  Going to order a pair for my wife!
1,"These are awesome. Simply cannot beat the price of these for the quality of product. I had a pair of powerbeats wireless2 before these that I loved, but they only lasted 6 months before they completely stopped working. I would go as far to say that, in my opinion, these are better than the powerbeats wireless2 that I had, especially since these are so affordable. I use these in the gym 6/7 days of the week and have had zero problems so far. I convinced my sister to buy these as well and she really enjoys them too. Would recommend these to anyone looking for a pair of Bluetooth headphones that are affordable and of good quality."
1,These earbuds are amazing! The sound quality and comfort are just as good as all the reviews state.
1,Great set of head phones for $30. Only gripe would be the silicon that goes around your ear is not as rigid as I would like and adjusting volume on headphones is sometimes not responsive when connecting with my iPhone. Over all it's a good set of wireless headphones.
0,"These got returned. They looked great, were comfortable and came with a wide range of accessories. My biggest complaint, and deal breaker, was that they wouldn't stay connected. I either had my phone in a string bag on my back or in an armband case. Either way, it was never more than a couple feet away from the headphones. I'd be out walking the dogs and they'd constantly be cutting out. I tried to put up with it and gave them a full week to grow on me before I had had it. It was dissapointing"
1,"Well made, packaged nicely and the sound is excellent. My only negative is rmthe placement of the volume controls. Hard to find them and I keep hitting the on/off pause button. Otherwise I am very happy with the ear buds."
0,"I often rely on customer reviews before I buy something; seeing that these earbuds had great reviews, I decided to try them. I wasn't really expecting much, just for them to work and have decent sound quality. I was very disappointed; the sound quality is not as the product described. The earbuds don't really have that deep bass that it advertises, it more just muffles the rest of the music. Vocals sound very muffled and the highs and lows aren't really there. Ordered these with one day shipping and I returned them as soon as I got them. You can find higher quality earbuds at BestBuy for the same price or lower (I have better earbuds that I got for $25). An obvious red flag that I ignored was all of the additional items that came with the earbuds; if a product's not great then manufacturers throw in extra stuff to compensate.<br />PROS:<br />- They work<br />- Small and lightweight<br />- Power on and connect quickly<br />CONS:<br />- Bad, muffled sound quality<br />- Feel very cheap and flimsy<br />- You can find better quality earbuds than this for the same price"
1,Bought as a gift to a friend and they loved them.
1,These are awesome! I use them for my workouts and enjoy them.  They are easy to charge and take care of!
0,"I am in love with this, so good"
1,thank you for your message. they were gift for my son and he says he will try them this week and let me know. I look forward to telling you he loves them......
1,Good for listing music. The microphone it's not that great.  My interlocutor have problem understanding my words.
1,"Exceeds expectations.  Lost first set, so reordered.  It would be good to mark ear pieces to identify left and right sides.  I use colorful moldable glue on the right side."
1,Fit is average but the work better than normal earbuds
1,"I like the comfort but audio can get lost with interference and create painful static. HD is high frequency sounds, not really any bass/low frequency."
1,"Excellent fit, quality, and great sound!"
1,"Comes with different sizes of ear pieces, which is great for small ears like mine."
1,big fan so far. lightweight and wires dont get tangled like many other headphones.
1,I'm seeing roughly 8 hours off of a charge which is perfect for 5 days at the gym for me. Nice case and decent enough sound for the price.
1,Had these recommended by a friend and was not disappointed. They are a great product and an excellent value.
0,"Girlfriend bought these for me back in May. I use these when I go to the gym and right when I first turned them on I wasn’t impressed with the sound quality. I’ve had cheaper bluetooth headphones that sound way better. But, I kept using them since I didn’t have another pair. I noticed that the range was poor. I couldn’t go past 6 feet without it cutting out. Then during my workout the music would cut out during my workout after awhile. I think it has something todo with the wiring or when I’m drenched in sweat. Not very waterproof I guess. Overall I’d recommend saving your money and buying a cheaper version."
1,Fast service. No problems whatsoever!
1,good sound for the price
1,"These work wonderfully, fit nicely and have options for different ear canal size. You can't beat them for the price."
1,"Overall, I'm pleased with these headphones with regards to the quality of the sound and battery life. As I have only owned this product for less than a week, I cannot comment on its longevity. One minor disappointment is the advertised noise cancellation, which is non-existent apart from that which is naturally created by virtue of just having something inserted into the ears."
0,"Nice sound quality, but it literally stopped charging after two weeks.  Sadly, that seems par for the course with this company as my last set made it approximately two months before the same thing happened.  Also, not much of a battery life."
1,"Overall good headphones that function well.  Fit is good and comfortable.  Only issue is wind noise.  Even with very little wind the ear piece design transmits every bit of wind vibration that hits them.  Besides that, these are decent headphones."
0,"For whatever reason, I was unable to charge these headphones after 7 months of using them.  Now, they are useless.  Save your $ and buy elsewhere."
1,light weight
1,"These are amazing headphones. I use them when I work out on a rowing machine and all I hear is crisp, vibrant music. They produce the best sound I've ever heard through earphones and they block out the noise in the background almost completely. They're lightweight and comfortable and were simple to pair up with my phone. When I bought these from Amazon, they were right at $35 dollars which is considerably below their list price and the price of other similar big name headphones. I've tried the big name headphones just like these and couldn't tell any difference. These appear to be of a similar quality, so if they hold up, I think I will have made an excellent purchase."
1,"Overall I'm very happy with these headphones. I normally find earbuds really uncomfortable in my small ears and these are the most comfortable I've ever worn. I don't use them for running or anything like that so I can't comment on whether they'd fall out but they seem very secure. The sound is clear, they're easy to use, and the case is convenient."
0,"After about the third charge, the receptacle for charging cord dislocated, making it impossible to recharge. Totally useless after less than 10 hours of use."
1,"I love them, sound is good stay on my ears while running or jumping rope... working out or just walking around... would have given them 5 stars especially for the money but the multi-function button is in a bad spot.... I sometimes hit it and shut the headphones off.  Will definitely recommend to friends.<br />Ok I have used them for a while and if I am doing a standing leg stretch or anything where I am bent over and my phone is more than 4 feet away the ear buds cut in and out.  If I have it in my pocket it is fine but if I put it down on the ground next to me it cuts in and out.  Not sure if I would still recommend them...<br />Update... inside my gym I can be 20+ feet from my phone and I still have Bluetooth... great buy would highly recommend buying them and will be buying another pair"
1,"They have great sound quality, are very comfortable to wear and have a long battery life!"
1,"So far this is a very good product.  The only thing that I have had a minor problem with is hitting the button accidentally while trying to adjust the buds in my ear.  But it is ok if I am careful.  I really like the changeable ear clips.  You can mold them around your ears.  Not a one size fits all thing. So that if you ears are unorthodox, you can make it work with this product.  I use them now every time that I go to the gym.  The sound quality is excellent.  I also like the case.  I have a lanyard that I attach to the zipper and I can keep my earbuds attached to my belt so as not to lose them.  This is a solid, well made good quality product.  And the price was very reasonable.  I would recommend them to anyone."
1,Works as promised.
1,Best headphones I ever owned.. my husband gave me his pair at first and just purchased another.. very good quality for the price and long lasting battery!!
1,"Super simple to use, and great battery life. The cords also do a great job at not getting tangled."
1,"As expected, as discribed, comfortable, great sound"
1,"I purchased these earbuds for myself and my girlfriend when I was in a long distance relationship. The sound quality is great, and they've never made my ears sore; however, the mic was nothing to write home about. The sound quality was good enough for talking but definitely not great. We also occasionally experienced some sort of interference while on the phone/Skype. I continued to use them fairly often without issue, but my girlfriend rarely used her pair.<br /><br />More recently, I've been using them to listen to music while running on the treadmill. They don't give me any issue at paces over about 7:30 min/mi, but when I'm running faster than that, they will quickly slide out of my ears. My sister showed me a pair Beats that she uses when running, and the ear hooks are much more rigid on hers. Although I haven't tried, I imagine the Beats would stay in much better. The Sensos stay in just fine as long as it's low impact, but I imagine you would have issues if you tired to use these for high intensity workouts, such as Crossfit.<br /><br />If you are looking for a pair of bluetooth headphones to wear around the house while listening to music, I don't think you can go wrong with these. I would give them five stars for music listening and four for Skyping/talking on the phone. Falling out during running is an issue for me though, and I am currently looking for a new pair that won't slide out."
1,"Great fit, high quality sound, fast charging, long lasting battery- I listen for 4-5 hours a day and keep it on standby for the rest and battery keeps going on for more than 2 days! I love them. Still early days but so far so good."
1,"Love this product have had it for so long and it still works like a charm.  Couldn't have bought anything better and cheaper this this product.  In the gym, on the rail, at home or at work this product is good to use."
1,These are the best!!! The sound is very loud and clear good bass as well. They are light weight and actually stay on my ears without any problems. Would definitely recommend for anyone wanting an excellent sound experience while connecting via bluetooth during activity ie: working out or yardwork.
1,"-lasted well over a year!<br />-sometimes the exterior facing ""plate"" of the plastic shells can fall off, but the boards and electronics you see can be easily put back correctly into the piece and the plastic ""plate"" clipped back on.<br />-computer on the right, battery on the left<br />-music quality is definitely a step above cheaper wired earbuds (I listen to extreme metal nonstop.)"
1,"These can get loud. Love them. They came with a lot of extras. The carrying case is nice. I use them while working in the yard, while on the mower and in the garden. The sound comes through clear past the loud motors."
1,Very very very nice
1,Love them. Work perfectly fit working out at the gym.
1,Perfect item! Works fantastic
0,The volume was barely audible. Likely defective pair. Returning.
0,"After two months, this product only holds a charge for 15 minutes.  Horrible that you spend the money for a product that is well recommended and fails so quickly."
1,Ordered these Headphones with low expectations and they have exceeded all my preconceived ideas.  I actually have another pair from a far more expensive company...but these SENSO outperforms the others overwhelmingly.  So glad I purchased these new SENSO headphones.
1,Most Bluetooth devices I've owned are a pain to connect so I really like that these headphones connect quickly and effortlessly every time I turn them on. The sound quality is also great and better than some of headphones I've bought in the $60-$100 range.
1,"I thought I’d wear these while jogging, walking the dogs.  The distance between my hip pocket/ears is too great for these “wireless” headphones.  They only stay connected if you’re sitting still, and in close range.  I switched back to a more expensive apple product.  Sometimes you get what you pay for."
1,"almost perfect besides the fact at least once every time i use it, the sounds gets muffled and after an hour or so it really hurts my ears, even with the smaller covers. other then that they are a great pair of earbuds💞"
1,"So far I am beyond pleased! Not only was the cost much better than  other comparables on the market my Senso Activbuds are exceptionally clear! I don't know what I expected I guess because the cost was reasonable I just assumed they would work crappy. Honestly I could not believe how easy these were to install and how well and comfortably they fit around my ears, plus I love that these came with three separate sizes for the ear inserts, not to mention all the little gadgets - like an additional charger for my iPod - fantastic! The truth is I usually don't even like to give reviews unless a product is exceptional and thus far this one is so I will just say don't bother wasting hundreds on the larger name-brand competitors because Senso works perfectly!"
1,"I bought these after my Sony headphones were stolen, and these definitely aren't as nice of quality but that's probably expected. They do the job though and I'd probably buy again, especially for the perks they come with. It is kind of annoying that the power button is on the side instead of the top of the ear bud because I have to push it against my ear drum or brace it awkwardly when I want to turn it off."
1,Great headphones. Stay charged a long time. Get really loud. I love rhem
1,"The customer support is excellent, the ear buds fit good(there are three different sizes that come along), a car adapter is included which is great, the volume level is perfect and can be adjusted accordingly. The battery life on this item is great! It lasted for two hours 40 minutes and it is still going. The package says it lasts for eight hours! Be sue to charge it at least 12 hours before using it the first time. The Bluetooth extends for a long distance(30-40ft). I can walk all over the house and stay connected while the cell phone stays in one place.. Pretty sweet. Two thumbs up!"
1,Good product and price.
1,"Sound and quality is great, but they do not fit in my motorcycle helmet due to how far they protrude out your ear, and that’s the only reason I bought them."
1,Awesome sound quality. Good Quality Product.
1,It's very great I like it
1,"They don't have the highest quality sound for music, but I did used to wear them in the gym and they were adequate. Now I use them at my desk for Zoom meetings and they are perfect. Cuts out all the background noise in the office and the microphone works great too. During meetings I can turn my camera off, get up and go stretch a little, get a cup of tea in the kitchen, stand on the back steps of the building, all without losing the conversation. I've just bought a second pair for my daughter as mine are still going strong after 3 years!"
0,I really thought this was the perfect bluetooth headset for me until it broke in less than 3 months. Perfect fit. Comfortable. Great audio. So disappointed that the earpiece broke apart.
1,These are the BEST bluetooth head phones! They are everything they say they are.. I wouldnt trade them for anything..
1,"I purchased these specifically for watching TV late at night when others in the household are asleep.  They work flawlessly, bluetooth connection is very strong and sound quality is stellar compared to several other high-end expensive bluetooth headphones I have.  Compared to my Jaybird X2's, these are far superior in every way.  They're so comfortable, I forget I'm wearing them.  Highly recommended."
1,The best headphone I've gotten.
1,Nice
1,Best wireless headphones for the money.  As good as Beats.
1,great
0,"These earphones were OK out of the box. They sound OK and they look kind of silly. All fine considering the price. However, one side completely stopped working eventually. Tried to reset the earphones and they still didn't work. Disappointed. In fact, the multifunction button doesn't even work anymore. The earphones are charged and they don't turn on."
1,Excellent headphones. I have been using the them to workout and they have performed as advertised and flawless. I am not an audiophile but the sound is great and I can bearly tell the difference between them and my son's beats.
1,I have bought a few Bluetooth headphones the first costing 160$ That lasted five months and these are by far the best. I didn't expect much at this price but I am very happy with my purchase. After 7 months they are still going strong.
1,This is my 3rd pair of Senso BT headphones. I broke the 2nd pair prematurely as I crushed it when I closed a car door on it. The first pair lasted a very long time too. The sound quality if pretty good. This headphone does not have noise cancelling but does a good job isolating the outside sounds.<br />I use it primarily while I run.
1,Very nice fit.  During exercise the headphones stayed in place perfectly.  I have tried several different types of wireless headphones and this is the best set I have had.  Great value for the price!
0,"These worked initially but will no longer sync with my phone.  Very disappointed.  Would like to return but it appears am out of return window.  Received as Christmas gift, worked for a couple weeks."
1,"You have a good product, just not me. I like the sound, functionality, and quality of them, but the ear loops are just too flexible for my ears and consequently they keep falling off my ears when I walk. I tried the three different ear buds, but to no avail. I need to find buds with stiffer hoops and/or has a wire embedded in them to shape around the ear tightly, but this may not be possible. For the reasons I stated above I will be returning the ear buds.<br />Not to worry about a negative review, I won't be giving one. The problem is just as much as my ears, as it is your ear buds.<br />Thanks for your concern.<br />LV & David Schisler"
1,"For the price you can't beat this, I've had them for about a year and are still working as if they were right out of the box. Very durable, good sound quality. As for battery life i'm not sure but i'm at the gym 3-4 days a week 50 min and gone without charging for about 2 weeks, so I must say that pretty good. Save yourself a lot of money and don't buy Beats, Bose or other big name brands. All junk at high prices. Way to go for small business, you have my support!"
0,"Fits in ear well. Bluetooth signal is very weak. It will cut in and out while holding in hand. If device is more than 4 feet away from headphones, It will not stay connected."
1,Amazing sound quality and such a reasonable cost. Bought 2 and recommended to several friends.
0,"I had these previously and the sound, both treble and bass, were very good for something in this price range. The wire connector  was about to break, so I decided to reorder the same thing. I put them on and the sound quality was terrible. Since my original set was not completely broken, I was able to switch back and forth just to be sure I wasn’t being too critical.  Treble was very tinny sounding and bass was nonexistent. I returned them for a refund."
1,I purchased these 3 years ago and they are still going strong.  The battery has held up well and they still sound great.
1,"Sound was good. Materials felt ok. 👌🏻<br />1. Main thing I did not like was the feeling of them around or in my ear. I feel it is mostly just the shape of my earI. I tried all the different ear adapters and none of them felt secure. It just felt like they were going to fall off my ears. The cord that connected them did not feel secure when it draped around the back of my neck. It slightly tugged at the earpieces.<br />2. The Bluetooth connectivity is not great. If I am playing music, I can stop the music with the multifunction button and restart music if it’s nearly immediately after I stopped it, but if the music is stopped for greater than 5 seconds the music will not restart and I have to take my phone out of my pocket and push play again on my phone. Optimally it should just stay in audio mode and start and stop the music where you left off unless it was a phone call that interrupted the music. Software issue.<br />3. When running, the bounce of the cord connecting the earpieces make a transmitted sound ‘thud’ with each step.<br /><br />I’ll continue to use my corded earbuds that feel secure in my ears while I run.<br />Thanks for the ease of the return though."
1,"I love these buds , A great price,great clarity,great volume,easy to use and comfortable . I use these in my van ,which has blue tooth in it but is too noisy<br />the seller was great ,and the product was great too"
1,Mic portion sucks
0,Quit charging after three months
0,"Worked great, then stopped charging after 2 1/2 years"
1,"Great sound !  Great price !  But really overwhelmed me was , they were so comfortable I forgot I was still wearing them after watching TV for hours.  Thank for the headphones, Ron."
1,Met my expectations
1,So far so good. nice fit and functionality
1,I received my headphones the other day and I love them! I recently used my son's Powerbeats and was impressed so was worried that the Senso wouldn't be up to participate. I was wrong they are a wonderful quality and sound stay in your ears and are easy to use. I am very pleased!
1,I love the quality of the sound and the bass that the headphones have. Also how great the headphones are with cancelling out all distractions and outside noise.
1,Very happy with these headphones!  Had a minor technical problem and customer service was fast and helpful.
0,"They are okay. Deep bass, which is good, but the sound comes out somewhat muffled and lacking the crispness of Senso's other Bluetooth headphones. This may be a result of noise cancelling technology (they do eliminate a lot of outside noise) but it leaves a lot to be desired. Senso's ActivBuds S-300 have a super crisp sound, which I much prefer. Not a bad product but I will be returning and be opting for the 300s instead."
1,It was great
0,"They pair easily and stay on my head, and the sound quality is decent. The negatives are even the lowest volume setting is very loud, the design hurts my ears, on the lowest setting text tones and keyboard sounds are unbearablly loud, and there is this incessant beeping that occurs when switching apps, sending messages, and randomly that replaces normal audio feedback. I will not be keeping these."
1,great sound  for the price and quick delivery
1,"Good sound quality, phone audio is pretty clear. No issues with the Bluetooth audio for music or talking on the phone. The cable could be a little stiffer. It seems to fly around my neck when I turn my head. A little annoying but not a deal breaker. They are light and fit my ear canal well with the added extra sizes of silicone ear buds adapters. I would recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable pair of Bluetooth headphones. The included case is nice and sturdy, and the included adapter is a nice freebie. All in all good product for the price. Lots of extras. Lost one star for the minor annoyance of the cord on my neck, but that is me just being fussy 😭"
1,"The headphone is good and sturdy, I really enjoy the quality of it's output. The range seem average. It is a quality product for the price."
0,"There’s a lot of distractions every time I play a song, I didn’t like it it was my worst choice ever."
1,Absolutely great. I work in small machine shop and these things block out most of the noise around me (with foam ear buds on) and sound pretty damn good. So far I've got 9 hrs out of them easily. Charge quick and phone functions work great! Trust me I've bought a lot of these things from other companies.
1,Overall quality is pretty decent. Ear hooks have great adjustability. There is a bit of maneuvering to get the right fit though.. can’t just pop them on. Only real complaint is that if your looking for something with good bass these are horrible!
0,The sound quality on these is terrible. Any time the music has deep bass notes they get distorted and clipped. Have not had this problem with any other headphones. Totally useless for the gym.
1,Work great
1,"Really good earbuds, no complaints."
1,Wish the battery life was longer. Needs to be recharged fairly often. Fits my ears wrll though
1,These are great!
1,Great Product
1,I really like them. I’ve been against wireless headphones because they are usually poorly designed and break easily. This pair is light enough to allow me to use them running but yet delivers incredible sound.  I’m definitely happy with my purchase. Thank you senso.
1,My boyfriend loves these!
1,"Nice crisp,rich sound. Better than expected for the price. Only in use for a week now but work great,hardly know they're in my ears , plenty of volume control , easy to pair up. Between the 1 year warranty, great sound , water resistance and price , this is a no brainer."
1,"Lightweight, comfortable, easy to use.  Sound quality great both playback and microphone for phone calls"
1,"Delivered promptly. Charge quickly, fit well. Sound very good. Easy to use"
0,USB pin is broken. I am unable to charge now.
1,"For $35, these Bluetooth earbuds are a decent buy.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Easy to connect to your Bluetooth-enabled mobile device or computer.<br />- They won't fall out of your ears while running.<br />- Comfortable to wear.<br />- No excess noises when running (like footsteps), blocks out noise somewhat well.<br />- Easy to turn on and off, and change songs / volume / pause music.<br />- They come with a ton of accessories including charging cable, other earbud inserts, carry case, car charger.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Sound: The main con for me, an avid music listener, is that they don't sound optimal and crisp at first. There is too much muddy bass on these and musician vocals are too low. However, you can fix this! Tweaking some sound options on your phone Equalizer in settings, or using an Equalizer program on your Mac will let you get a great sound out of these. They have potential, but it takes a little work to make it sound nice. But if you're someone who doesn't need perfect-sounding music, then consider these 4/5 star earbuds.<br />- Apparently the battery life isn't extremely long on these, so just charge them when you go to bed after heavy use. But if you use it for an hour a day, like me, you won't even tell.<br />- I'm personally not a fan of the 'shape-molding' ear inserts, so I replaced them with the rubber inserts from the AmazonBasics earbuds, perfect fit.<br /><br />Overall, 3/5 Stars Earbuds"
0,"Stopped working after a couple months. I purchased these headphones in January (2017) and they worked really well until they suddenly stopped working in March. I contacted customer service, who were incredibly helpful and sent me a replacement which also worked well until it suddenly stopped working a few days ago.  Both times the headphones simply died and cannot be powered on.  Truly frustrating.<br /><br />Update: I wish I had read the one star reviews as this seems to be a very common issue."
1,The sound quality and comfort is amazing. They’re perfect for bike rides!
0,"work well but, not really comfortable, maybe good if  you are dumbo with big ear.<br />all accessory show , not exist , replace by BS  accessory .<br />i m kind of desapointed ."
1,I have used the ear buds for running races and they work quite well. Good sound quality. Easy to operate and good battery life only down side is the long white charging cord was not the correct one. In defense of the company I have notified amazon and am waiting on a reply. The small black charger cord works fine.
0,Noice cancelling if that’s what your looking for these are not it! When I talk to my husband he says they are worse then the last pair:(
1,"Great product, battery last long, sound great!"
1,"The headphones are easy to charge, easy to pair, and comfortable to use. Their sound quality is okay at best. My very old Asus laptop, my bare-bones Lenovo laptop, and my Nexus 6P phone all have better audio quality than these headphones. The range is not there, and everything seems skewed too much to the high range (no matter what I do with an equalizer the sound is too high and tinny, with anemic low ranges). And the volume control is pretty wild -- either it's rather quiet, or (one click up) deafening. There is no in between.<br />I use these for listening to music while working out. They stay on my ear (though not always in my ear, even with the correct tips, but that's likely because I'm sweating like a monster), but the sound quality is pretty rough. So they're adequate (barely) for working out, as long as you don't care that the sound quality is rather poor. If you care about actually hearing your music or feeling the beat, these are not for you.<br />If I could, I'd give them a 2.5/5."
0,Update since  last purchase 2 yrs ago.<br /><br />The left ear piece of my existing senso headset stopped working which caused me to buy another. However the clips to place over the ears are extremely large and so very uncomfortable to use. I like the senso headset but very disappointed over this 2nd one.
1,As good as Beats at a much more attractive price point.
1,I have only used the set three times. they seem to work as they said they would because I can only streamed 3hours total is the reason for the four star . I will use the headset some more then I will update my review.<br />F. Lyons
1,"Good quality. I was surprised by the sound, I have had other Bluetooths &the sound was crap. It doesn't break up, cut out like other Bluetooths. The earpieces gives me a little bit of trouble sometimes, to get it around by ear.  That is just me. Never had anybody I have talked to on it complain about it. I think the battery could last a little longer. I would purchase it again. Best one I have had yet. the only reason I didn't give it five stars is that I think they could improve the battery life"
1,Great product but the charger cable only worked for the first few charges. Now I have resorted to using another one. Quite upset as I had hi hopes for the product as it came so highly recommended.
1,These are by far the best wireless headphones I've ever owned/bought. They are comfortable and the quality of the music is amazing! I let my friend try them and he is a huge Beats by Dre fan. He couldn't believe it. He was listening to a Katy Perry song and said the quality is so good it sounds like she's standing right next to him and singing her song. These are definitely worth the buy!
0,"Sad, I saw how much high reviews and best seller status this Bluetooth headphones had, but when I tried it out at the gym yesterday, it didn't hold well. It's difficult to run and hear the music, as the earbuds wouldn't stay in place, making the sound of the music become a tapping noise of your ears as the buds pop in and out. Also the loop that latches on to your ears are so flimsy and doesn't have enough support. The USB Lighting Cable that comes with it is also no use, therefore do not invest in this cheap product, yet being more expensive than its competitors."
1,"Great value but i ultimately returned them. But they could work for you.<br /><br />pros:  very good sound, great value. really nice amenities including a dual-usb cigarette charger, i really cool charging cable that could charge your iphone along with a micro USB for an android device (which the headphones).  Nice hard shell case. very comfortable fit.<br /><br />Cons: the only reason i returned them is that i was using them for work and they were causing an echo on our webconferencing software. if you're mainly getting for tunes and will just make short person to person calls, ya can't beat the value."
1,work good and good battery life.
1,"These buds are awesome! They fit great with the choices of earpieces.  The sound is spectacular and the setup is easy, Bravo!"
0,These worked ok for a few months but then I started to experience a lot of static and skipping to the point of not working. I wouldn't recommend for running.
1,Worked great for just over a year then died. Still 5 stars though bc company still honored warranty - no questions asked. Really appreciate this kind of customer service.
1,"Good wireless headphones. I wish the volume was just a tad bit more loud, and the over ear hooks are a little loose/flimsy. Still, you can't beat the quality of the product for its current price."
1,"These headphones worked fine in the beginning. The main problem I had with these were sweating. As soon as I started sweating (in the gym) one side was constantly slipping off. It was extremely frustrating. Then there were a few times when the sound didn't work. Again, they worked well in the beginning but over time some flaws were revealed. I feel like the classic big headphones are the only thing that would work best for me in the gym."
1,They seem like good headphones so far....only had them for one day. I do wish the hook that goes over the ear wasn't so flexible. It would hold on to my ears a little better if they were hard plastic.
1,I liked the way it sounded and easy to operate. Also very reasonable in price. I use them at work and home.
1,"I had a pair that the charging post broke within two months of purchasing them and I contacted Amazon, and Amazon was very helpful with returning them.  I purchased another pair because I liked them so much.  Great sound and comfortable.  Will get them again."
0,"Worked great for a month, then stopped working completely."
0,Had it only for 5 weeks before it died on me.<br />Now it doesn't even turn on or charge.
1,I like the fact that they Fit. I tried other headphones and I had trouble getting them to stay put. I love the sound as well. Overtime they don’t last for 8hours but the other qualities make up for that. Great headphones!
1,"Purchased these headphones mainly for mowing lawn and to listen to while I do woodworking.  Headphones I've purchased in the past never had a battery life to last very long.  These are perfect!  The sound quality is great, I don't need to turn the volume up very loud to hear music over the lawn mower or any of my power tools.  They are very comfortable, I hardly even notice they are there.  Only used them a few times to answer calls and have worked like a charm.  I'm not sure how long exactly the batteries last, but I have listened to music for AT LEAST 6 hours on them with no problem while mowing.  And with dust, dirt and anything else flying through the air, they have held up great and have no problem keeping them in my ears.  They have also worked great for keeping all of the dust and dirt out of my inner ear.  For the price, you will not find a better wireless headphone."
1,Worked great unit I washed them..
0,"I use these for every single one of my workouts. They’re lightweight and they sound great. The customer service at Invotek is incredible, too!<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />I loved these headphones. The first pair stopped working, but customer service was great and sent me a replacement. Then, the second pair stopped working. Customer service was not forgiving this time. So against my better judgement I bought a 3rd pair. This pair stopped working as well. I only used them about 3 times a week for an hour or two at a time. They were stored in the case otherwise so there was no possibility of physical damage. It's ridiculous that all 3 pairs died in about 1 year's time and the battery life is DEFINITELY not 8 hours. Don't bother with these headphones, they're a waste of money."
1,For the price these headphones do the job. The shape of the headphones doesn't fit my ears and is not adjustable.
1,Husband ;oves it
1,Amazing product & customer service. I was pleasantly surprised by the sound quality. Best value for your dollar!
0,Broke after the second day of using them. I was highly disappointed.
0,"Hurts the inside of my ears after about 20 minutes of continuous use. The gel inserts are way too thin, you can still feel the hard plastic in your ears."
1,It's ok. The problem is the vinyl strap that goes between the earphones - it's plastic and sticks to your neck (especially if it's sweaty during a workout) - so turning your head will pull one of the earphones out of your ear. Unpleasant feeling.
1,"I am still fiddling around with the earbud sizes, but so far so good!  I am not giving it five stars (yet) because they do keep popping out of my ears - but again, I believe it is a sizing issue.  When I get a moment, I will attempt to fix it.  I do like how they gave a car charger - pretty nice :)"
0,stopped working/charging after a few uses.  Really poir quality and hoped they would work
1,"I have used these headphones about 6 times since I received them.  I usually use my Bose ear buds which are wired on my tablet to watch movies and listen to music,  but these sound better and are more comfortable, they connected to all my devices easily, so far I am very happy with them."
1,"Great headphones, much better than the previous ones I had.  Comes with all attachments in a cool case."
1,"Just received these and have used for a few days.  They're lightweight and sound quality is very good.  Really appreciate that they turn off automatically when not in use, battery life is good so far. One item of somewhat a concern is that they are so light and flimsy, they probably wouldn't work for active use but I use them for sitting, listening and/or walking. I'm very glad I bought these."
1,"Thank you SR.Kenneth Backstrom... Your products are very nice...Good look, exellent quality. I hope to use this Headphones a lot of time... Thank you..."
1,Amazing sound quality! Great headphones! Don't even hesitate buy a pair for yourself!!
1,"I love them. The sound is great. I tried pahiser which works excellent but stop working so i decide to try this ones, i use them for work, if i have my phone on charging i can still listen to music even if i get far, and if i lost connection whenever i get closer will connect automatically, that didnt happen with phaiser...The only thing that I don't like is that they keep falling off from the sides, if I had only one on the other one will pull it down. Wish it comes with something to keep them together, other than that I would recommend"
1,Clearly a value for the price. Connects quickly &amp; has decent sound. The fit is good &amp; the charge time is fast.
1,"I bought these 3 months ago. They have already stopped working. I charged them and they won't turn on.<br />Before then, they were great. They canceled noise well, they held a good charge, and they sounded good. They also fit in my ears well.<br /><br />I hope Senso contacts me to repair or replace my headphones. I'll update this review if Senso contacts me.<br /><br />UPDATE: SENSO immediately made this good. They sent a replacement pair. Updated from ** to ****. I docked one * for the failure in the first place, but they are a very good value."
1,"There was an unfortunate delay in the delivery, as two days turned into 10. However, once I received the earbuds, I was definitely satisfied. Good sound for a reasonable price. Several choices for earbud size included. Would have been 5 stars if they were delivered as promised for an Amazon Prime member. Not sure if it was Amazon's fault or the manufacturer."
1,The first one I order the left side was not working so I had to order a second one which is working great hope it continue to be good thank you
1,"I love these headphones. Long range, long battery life. Stay on really well while working out. Recommended."
1,Outstanding value!  These are comfortable and lightweight. Sound is clear. This pair comes with some nice accessories also. Oh and the shipping was very speedy!  Thank you.
1,Very pleased with muy purchase. They have great sound and last all day with music playing.
1,They are just as discribed. Work great and sound amazing. That was my  initial concern when buying being they weren't as expensive as others. I would  recommend these to anybody who is a little hesitant on the quality.
1,"Easy to connect, lots of extras not expected, g4eat sounds, control volume on headset or cell phone. I used it on my work outs and watch Netflix so much better than wired headset.  Talking on the phone is also very good, I like instructions spoken on the headset tellint me when on/off and connected, no guessing!!!"
0,"Sound quality is good but they are very difficult to fit, especially adjusting the ear loops. It is a struggle every time I put them on."
1,"Very good quality sound.  Very comfortable wear.  Stays on ears l!  Good bang for your buck, but be sure to purchase the warranty.  They normally wear out with the first year!"
1,Great product and some of the best customer service I have came across in a while... I recommend this product highly... Don't waste you time searching around of you are looking at this product don't second guess and purchase now... I'm going to get everyone some sort of Senso product for birthdays and Christmas...
1,"Just got these earbuds this week, but so far so good.  Easy to pair, and the audio is good.  No complaints so far!"
1,"Great headphones that came with a travel case, extra ear pieces and charging cords. I'm pleased with the sound quality and the headphones."
0,The headset charger didnt fit the headset
1,"Good sound, very good battery life, fit on ear is good but not excellent."
1,"Good, but when the power is less than 40%, the background noise is pretty large. the voice that says battery low is veryvery loud, which scares me and wakes me up from sleep so many times"
1,"I've been using this for a couple of months now and I really like this product, meaning that I would buy it again if I lost it.  See below for detailed review.<br /><br />Sound Quality: pretty good, not great.  Obviously it won't be like listening to a Bose or Beats type.  But still really good for working out and working at the desk.<br /><br />Battery Life: Battery lasts about 6-8 hours.  It charges fairly week, 1 hour should be enough for a few hours of use.<br /><br />Fit: I use it when I'm at work in front of a computer and while working out. It stays in pretty snug and secure.  It's actually so secure it gives the illusion of noise cancelling headphones.<br /><br />Connectivity: the bluetooth connects just fine at the office when working.  At the gym however, for the first 5 min, it cuts in and out.  Probably due to other Bluetooth devices nearby.  That's the only reason it has 4 stars instead of 5."
0,All good in left ear but no sound at all in right ear.
1,Love them! Great sound quality!
1,Great product with two bonus items (vent car attachment for cell and cell card holder)  which were a nice touch. One of the owners emailed me directly to make sure there were no problems with the order.
1,"These things rattle so much, very bad sound quality. The sound comes off as if something is loose inside this device."
1,Super easy to pair. Comfortable for long wear. Good battery life. Great sound
1,Great ear buds for the cost. Easy to setup and sound quality is very good<br />Would buy them again.
1,"Easy to use and sound good too!  Works perfect for me if I'm doing chores around the house or working out at the gym.  I read all the reviews and purchased based on them and they are so accurate.  For the price, these can't be beat!!"
0,"These don't stay in my ears and can't be adjusted to do so. Because they don't stay in my ear, the sound quality is severely lacking."
1,This is my 2nd Senso. My cat chew the first one which I loved and used constantly.
1,Love my new wireless headphones for my workouts. Very comfortable and great sound. Good Bluetooth range and battery life too. Highly recommend at this price!
1,"Really like the Bluetooth headphones. For the money they work  reallywell, pair easy and produce good sound. I would like to see the ear piece seal a bit better, though this is personal preference."
0,"These wont charge. They worked well for 10 months and last week just stopped charging. I troubleshot different cords and chargers but no luck.<br />I hoped spending almost $40 on ear buds would mean a quality, lasting product; not so in this case."
1,"I usually never leave feedback, but I feel I need to this time. These headphones rock! Work amazing, sound quality is great, amazing bang for your buck. Telephone microphone works great. Comfortable to wear and don't fall out like other earbuds. Easy to pair with blue tooth and the controls on the earpiece work great. Battery life is really good and all the extras it comes with are a real bonus. I am extremely satisfied and highly recommend this product."
0,not what i thought but you get what you pay for. they sound ok and connected up to my phone without issue. they just dont stay in my ear on runs for more than 30 sec. i am constantly having to put them back in. so annoying.
1,Very happy with this product I buy another pair if I need them
0,"Had the head phones for about two months, and now they won't even turn on. Worked great up until now. Won't be buying Senso again."
1,"First set broke quickly, but I was able to get them replaced under the warranty. Great product and service."
1,"The headphones work great, the sound is clear and the Bluetooth reach is awesome."
1,"These sound surprisingly good?  And they were super easy to pair, and charge, and figure out the controls.  I'm impressed."
1,For they money you get a lot here. Easy to set up. Listen time is strong and buds are comfortable. That all said the sound quality isn't great. It's good but they lack a decent bass note and even when I change EQ on phone it doesn't help. Would not compare them to noise cancelling devices I typically use on the plane. I'll use these when outside and save my Bose for air travel.
1,I bought these as a gift for my boyfriend and he says they’re the best headphones he’s ever had. He loves the way they fit and the sound quality is incredible.
1,They are okay for the price. The sound cuts out quiet frequently and the battery life is not that great.
1,"I personally have powerbeats3. However, i wanted to buy 2 for mom and dad since i seen those have good reviews on Amazon. I tried them on and I really liked how comfortable they were to my ear. Right now as i am typing i have the powerbeats on and i feel a little uncomfortable of the way it's hanging on my ear, i feel their a little rough comparing to the ones I received for my parents. Senso headphones are pretty light and comfortable to wear and the sound is great! Good product so i would recommend it to my friends and everyone out there for such a price! Thanks."
1,Great
0,"I've had these headphones for more than a year now. I use them extensively because I spent $30 on them and I want my money's worth out of it. They're also my only wireless headphones. Anyways, on to the review.<br />Running with these headphones are uncomfortable because the buds slide out of the ear despite the device being wrapped around the outside of the ear. When running, wind noise is a HUGE problem and drowns out the music. I have not found a way to fix this -- different sized buds do not help. I did not expect it to be noise cancelling, but it is not noise reducing at all. As for the sound quality, it is garbage. It is muffled and the bass and treble I feel are what I expect $10 headphones would be. It connects to Bluetooth pretty easily, but sound cuts in and out at random times making me stop my workout to fix it. I personally do not think this device is worth the money, nor would I gift it to others. I'll be using this until it breaks or I can't bear the poor sound quality."
1,I ran a half marathon wearing these and they lasted and did not fall from my ears.
1,Really good sound quality. Good range. Well done over all.
1,"Simple to understand instructions. Decent sound quality but that comes with the price point, in my opinion."
0,"I am a runner. I have been looking for a pair of Bluetooth headphones to replace my wired Skullcandy Methods for what feels like forever.  The Methods are great but I don't care for the in-line controller bobbing up and down when I run. I have not and cannot find a pair that hits on the two key factors I'm looking for: comfort and connectivity. After checking the reviews for big dollar earphones like Beats, JayBirds, etc., I decided to give these &#34;no-name&#34; headphones a go. The reviews were excellent - much better than the really expensive brands. So I figured, what the heck - have at it.<br /><br />To me, there is no in between review on a pair of Bluetooth headphones. Either they work well all the time or they don't. I don't want to be on a 10 mile run and at mile 4 the connection cuts out or the battery unexpectedly dies. That's the worst case scenario for me.  So, to that point, the Senso ActivBuds S-250s get one star. They didn't work - right out of the box.  Sure, there's a lot of bonus goodness in the package but if the headphones don't deliver, what good are the extra comfort tips? If the signal cuts out, who cares about the extra charging cable?<br /><br />Testing the headphones in my office, they seemed poised to deliver. Bass was a bit heavy but I simply used the Bass Reducer option on my ipod to get the sound the way I like it. Inside, at my desk, the headphones worked as expected. But hey, these are SPORT headphones. I need to get them outside and test them on a run. So, today I did just that. And before I could even take one step down the sidewalk, the sound started cutting in and out.  As I moved, so did the audio - like a skipping record. The connection seems to work inside but outside it's a no go. There was no way I was going to start out on my run and &#34;hope&#34; it worked as expected. If it can't maintain a solid connection outside, while I was walking around my driveway (with my iPod on my arm, mind you, inches away from the headphones), how is it going to handle a run?<br /><br />So, since the headphones can't pass the connection test, they're going back. And I'm still searching for a pair of Bluetooth headphones/earbuds that can stay comfortable, connected and will stand up to a half-marathon distance on a consistent basis.  If you're a runner and if you're looking for the same thing, these are not the headphones you're looking for."
1,"A bit bulky, and had bit trouble of getting them to stay in but the buttons and sounds and cord length were good"
1,"Great headphones, great customer service!!"
0,These worked well for a month or two.  Then would not pair with anything and wouldn't hold a charge.
1,"These are really great little wireless earbuds, and I wanted to really like them.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Long battery life, long standby time, quick and fast charge<br />- No problems with fit, multiple pieces are provided by Senso so you can adjust them to get a good fit<br />- Comes with a combo (USB and USB-C) style charging cable, and an additional USB charging cable (don't remember the last time a company included 2 different charging cables with their product).<br />- Definitely sweat-proof - just remember not to charge them right after a workout, instead let them dry out before charging them.<br /><br />My primary reason to buy wireless earbuds is for outdoor cycling, and for that purpose the product under delivers.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- At speeds greater than 20 miles / hour, you get wind noise (and even though I tried to get used to it, it bothered me even after 5 rides)<br />- Phone is in my pocket while cycling (approx. 3 feet away from earbuds), and it kept dropping connection (this really gets annoying). Initially I thought it might be due to streaming, but the connection issue remained even while listening to offline music.<br />- The connection issue doesn't occur if you are standing still - I'm not sure if it is the phone movement due to spinning crankshaft, or movement of bicycle itself, but the dropouts keep happening."
1,These are the best Bluetooth headphones I've purchased yet. Great fit and sound quality.
1,very happy with these wireless headphones
1,"These are a great set of budget earbuds. I can't bring myself to spend too much on an item that I am going to drench in sweat and just throw in my gym bag, but these exceeded expectations. The packaging is great, and they come with a 2 output car charger, a universal usb charging cable, and a carrying case. I have bought several pairs of skullcandy wireless earbuds that never seem to last, but these sound just as good and seem very durable. Can you find earbuds that sound better? Yes, but be prepared to spend an additional 100 dollars for only a marginal increase in sound quality. The bluetooth pairs quickly and maintains a strong connection. I would recommend these to anyone looking for an inexpensive set of earbuds."
1,"Great sound quality, however I did have an issue pairing after the headphones were turned off for a day. Also, the cover on the usb charging port no longer stays flush with the earpiece (this was after opening the cover for the first time to charge the headphones before my first use)."
1,I love the freedom it gives me. I'm online listening hours per day.
1,"Fantastic bluetooth headphones. I run a lot and tried other brands that just didn't work out, but these headphones are wonderful. The sound is great. I love the big button on the side to pause/resume the music. They are very comfortable. I've worn them on 20+ mile runs and don't even know that I'm wearing them, other than the music. The battery lasts for a long time. I love the storage case that came with it, and the bonus charger and cables were a nice touch.<br /><br />Only complaints:<br />-I think it is a problem with all bluetooth headphones, but if your phone is on the left side of your body (I wear mine in a running belt on the front) and you turn your head too far, the connection drops out momentarily because the bluetooth signal doesn't pass through your body well, even though it is like 2 feet from the source.<br />-Once the battery gets low, there is a warning that plays every minute or so. You have less than 10 minutes from the first warning to completely dead. I just have to remember to charge them up every few days."
1,GREAT PRODUCT
1,"I'm giving 5 stars based on the price. I'm not sure how you can beat it!! They fit the best out of any bud I've had....no more falling out of my ears when I'm mowing!<br />Needs more treble in my opinion, so I just adjust the EQ in Spotify to match my taste."
1,"Buen sonido, buena duración de la batería 6 horas sin problema, cómodos, controles accesibles. Realmente muy buenos auriculares de propósito general."
1,"These are one of the best headphones I've ever had. the sound is great, very clear. The volume, WOW. They are LOUD. The downside is that the bass is a little to much for me. Luckily I have a media app where I can adjust the equalizer. So if you can consider that. As far as fit, they don't fall out at all. Of course unless you pull them but even then the hook will catch them and you can just pop them back in. Another downside is the media button is right in line with your ear canal so somtimes you'll push it in further than you would like, but that's compromise for not having anything on the cord. Overall very satisfied with my purchase. The only reason this is a 4 star is because the bass was too much. They need an app where you can adjust the headphones them self. Then they are 5 stars!"
1,"I was reading some comments about these. I wasn't sure about them but so far they are great and easy to set up. I had bought a earbuds from a gas station hoping they would be good. they didn't last a week and I always had a problem with then either getting tangled or falling out which I hated. Once I got these I loved them, I'm all over, I listen to these. I'm not a huge sweater but I'm sure they will be fine as long as u don't throw them in a lake. great choice I think, not only that but they are cheap too. U cant hear sound when u got them off unless u turn it up to max on ur device and the headphones, but even then u can barely hear anything. perfect for me."
1,"I had issues at first getting the headphones to pair with more than one device. Reached out to the company via Amazon, and they were QUICK to email me with instructions that worked perfectly!<br /><br />I've since been able to pair the headphones with my work iPhone 7+, my wife's iPhone 8, and my Amazon Fire 8 for when I travel & want to watch movies.<br /><br />The headphones aren't going to be as great as studio cans, but for in-ear buds, I've been impressed thus far, and knowing that the company behind them has such great support, I would likely buy again."
0,I brought these a little over a month ago and they stop working no longer takes charge now I cannot return it.
1,Fine Experience.  Haven't used yet as they are a gift.
0,"Fraud, I had to ask for a refund"
1,My son received these for Christmas and he likes them so far.
1,require frequent pairing... Sound quality is just OK
1,Senso's customer service is fantastic.
1,"My first experience with wireless earbuds, glad it was with Senso. First impression: everything was packed efficiently. There are extra earpieces and even a car charger. Second: the instructions were printed on quality paper and written clearly and concisely. The activating with my two devices took under 30 seconds total. I'm a near senior citizen and approach some new tech with a little trepidation, but Senso made it so easy. Now I'm rockin' wireless headphones! They're lightweight, with comfortable, flexible hooks to go over your ears (but don't interfere with glasses), and are intuitive to use. So far, the music is well-balanced and not bass-heavy, and the podcasts are clear. All this and a year warranty, too, at a very reasonable price. Highly recommended."
1,"I bought these in September 2017 and they sound great. Everything was fine until they quit working recently. I contacted the Senso customer service since they were still under the one year warranty based on the purchase date and I had the order number, which you can find in your archived purchases. I tried to reset them as advised to see if it was a Bluetooth issue, but that wasn't the case. I contacted them again and they made sure my address was correct and they quickly shipped a free replacement that I received in a couple of days. Since I have worked in retail before, I know great customer service when I experience it. I'm very happy with my experience. Thanks, Senso!"
0,They slip and fall off and out of your ear to easily.  Have tried all of the ear bud pieces.  Not good for running or sweating.
0,"Top quality sound, noise canceling earbuds.<br />Only issue is that they are not rechargeable more than once or twice.<br />If you're in the market for really good fidelity earbuds that you plan on throwing away in about six weeks, these are right in your wheel house.  On the other hand, if you'd like something that lasts, maybe two months, steer clear of this product."
0,Works fine 1 ft away from phone. any farther than that and the audio breaks up. Did the 7 second reset . that didnt help at all.
1,"I tried Bluetooth a few years ago and wasn't a fan.  I decided to try again and selected the Senso buds because of the price.  I found them easy to connect and charge.  They are comfy and produce a quality sound, easy to adjust without interrupting my workout, etc.  If you're also &#34;mature&#34; and a hard nut to crack, I recommend these. Not frustrating at all."
1,"has good sound and feel around the ear, just has shorter battery life the more used."
1,Nice
1,Excellent headphones for its price. Very comfortable.
1,This is a good product at a very good price.  Includes additional inserts to allow precise fitting.
1,"Making the connection to my iPhone was Avery easy. Sound is much better than the Apple headphones. Best of all, they don't keep falling out like the factory ones!"
1,"These bluetooth headphones are comfortable, and work perfectly paired with my iPhone 7 plus."
1,"These are the best I have tried,  after trying many different brands to find some that we're good,  the sound is amazing,  the fit is amazing and you can tell it is a quality made product.  They are very comfortable.  Just to add I have never left a review before on my Amazon purchases and this one I had to because these headphones are impressive!"
1,So far I'm very pleased with them. Easy to operate & perfect for what I needed.
1,"They seemed to work fine for the two times I used the, but the plastic part that wraps around the ear was too large/heavy and they kept falling off when I jogged. Also, the parts that go into the ear were too long, so they never really felt secure."
1,Light and easy to use. A great gift!
1,"I was about to spend $150 for a pair of name brand wireless headphones when I found these listed on Amazon.  They had great reviews and were much less expensive.  I got them to use during gym workouts and they perform fantastically.  They stay in my ears, handle the sweat and workout vibrations, provide sound that seems perfect to me.  I can hardly believe I was about to spend so much more on another brand when these work perfect."
1,"Excellent sound. Pairs easily with iPhone. Between all the tips, you will easily find a size that fits your ears and stays put while exercising. I love the tangle free cord with the slide to really tame excess length. Highly recommended."
1,Stopped charging
1,"This is the second pair I purchased so now I have a pair always close by. The sound on these Ear buds are the best especially at this price point and I have purchased many brands, both wireless and wired. Great product."
1,My son loves them.
1,Nice for the price. However the instructions on how to turn on are too small and complicated.
1,"Though the rubber that wraps around your ear seems very flimsy they do their job perfectly and I actually like that they are. The ear wraps are super comfortable and once you have them wrapped don't expect these to fall out. I've tried all sorts of work outs and head banging and these will not fall out! Just what I wanted with also very very very perfect sound clarity for ear phones. I'm borderline audiophile from my collection of headphones and interest in sound and tech. I have a pair of Audio technicas ath-m50's and sennheisers 363D. These sound nothing like those but they aren't suppose to. These are ear phones not studio quality headphones; also don't believe any company that says that their ear phones have added bass. There is no where that is possible because added subs aren't possible, I would believe if a ear company said that they had added tweeters before I did added bass. Your phone has a sound card just like anything else and even though you may have a 1000 dollar iphone whatever they just came out with. I'm pretty positive that the sound card inside your over a thousand dollar phone isn't any better than the sound card in the past 3 to 5 generations. It's a gimmick much like dpi for gaming mice.<br /><br />But I'll let you in on a little secret many of you don't know about. Do you actually want quality highs and lows and even mids with soundstage? Download poweramp! You will have to spend about 5 after the trial period but you can even make your very own equalizer setting! How insane is that? Poweramp is literally your only way of having added bass which so many of you care about so much for some odd reason. Please please please stop falling for the Gimmick of &#34;added bass&#34;.<br /><br />I will say though the sound quality of this bluetooth to the thousands of other wired earphones I've used over the years trying to avoid bluetooth is little to none. I actually wish I bought these sooner for the price of 40 over the hundreds of dollars for wired ear phones. I popped these babies in and not only did they seal in the sound which is also another issue I've been trying to eliminate but Nine inch nails Me I'n Not sounded so good that I tried Retro Wave, Trance, DnB, Metal, etc and all of them performed past my expectations along with my personal settings for poweramp."
1,"Great product, work as well as any other wireless headphones I've used. Thought the over-ear portion would be better for running, so far so good. But, the over-ear portion is a soft rubber/silicone or something, not as rigid as I'd hoped. Seems to work, regardless."
1,"It is amazing, the sound quality, connection and battery life are outstanding, highly recommend."
0,Stoppped working after a month. They will not turn on
1,"Shipping and delivery were fast; design of headset makes them lightweight, easy to put on; price was very reasonable in comparison to similar headsets; quality of sound good; would have given 5 stars but too early to tell if headset was good but; only had them 2 days"
1,"I have purchased this before - over two years ago. My previous Active Buds worked great for me; worry free. I used them for yard work, late at night for audio/video so as not to disturb family members, riding my bike, Pickleball, and for golf. These are easy to operate and maintain. I like the part that goes over the ear - flexible and easy to adjust. Cost is very reasonable. I would recommend for anyone to purchase."
0,I only give these a 2 because I had another pair for a while that worked well. This time I gave these as a gift. The button broke within two weeks I emailed seller 2 times and no response. So disappointed :(
1,Great sound quality and comfortable  to wear.  Easy to pair.
1,I am very happy with these. The sound is very good and I never lose the connection. They stay in the ear well. Can't comment on range because I always have my phone in my pocket when I am using them.
1,"I love these headphones. The cost is very forgiving, as I keep losing them and rebuying them. Great for running and the gym as well as phone calls for work in a loud cube farm. One criticism: they sometimes turn on in your bag if you just throw them in there, which depletes the batteries and potentially routes calls through headphones unexpectedly. If you use the case they come in for storage this will not occur."
1,"great product. made well, works great."
1,"I set it up to charge and over night still no blue light, after checking it out made no changes but in the next 8 hours it was charged now just getting familiar with it."
0,These work but they fall out the second you start running or after approx two jumping jacks. Wouldn't buy if you are using them to work out. There are similar priced alternatives that have worked better.
1,"Big sound without the big price tag.  Lightweight ear buds that don't pull out of your ear. Everything included charger, 3 of ear buds, carrying case and more. Comfortable and light ear strap.  I would recommend these ear bud over higher priced buds."
1,Learned that you have to put them in the case they break easy if you don't would buy again tho
1,These things are AWESOME!!!
1,"They are great, easy to use headphones with a really long battery life! I highly recommend!"
1,Absolutely love them. Stay in my ears at the gym. Long battery life
1,"The headphones have great premium sound alike other brands they are not expensive. I use it for gym as they are sweat proof. It's perfectly fit into my ear, and don't fall off while running or doing exercises."
1,Works well.
1,"Just got these in yesterday, and so far they're great.  Easy to set up and use.  Sound quality is great.  I used them walking outside and the wind sound didn't seem to be an issue (but it wasn't a super windy day), and ran on the tredmill with them-  they stayed in place, didn't have to adjust them at all.  I'm really happy with my purchase and would recommed these to a friend."
1,Very pleased with this purchase - very comfortable - easy to pair with Bluetooth - awesome sound quality!!!
1,Lost the last pair... best headphone i ever had!!!.<br />had to buy a second one because it is that good. even better than the one that came with the ($1500 Samsung phone disappointing)<br />Bough this product back in 2018 it had amazing quality!!!<br />1. Quality- 5 Stars!!!<br />2. Sound-  5 Stars!!! (bass sound great! )<br />3. Sound cancellation? - 3 Stars ( not great but it does it job! better than some over ear headphone )<br />4. Battery- Last 1 months without charging on bike ride from home to school about 30 minutes each way.<br />5. New model have shape-able ear hook!<br />It does not come with extra  FREE stuffs anymore... which is sad but nevertheless bought this because of the headphone not the extra lol.<br />6. Durability? - 4 stars!!! pretty good used it for work out nothing match it. but only time can tell if it break down.<br />7. Bluetooth 5.0 is great better sound then the last one i had which is big plus!<br />8. 30k review for a reason!!! because it worth it!!!<br />9. $16.97??? worth every penny!!!<br />10. Recommendation?- 5 of 5! for the price ? cant beat it !
0,I purchased these just over 4 months ago and they've already stopped charging.
1,One of the best Bluetooth headphones
1,I love these headphones! The only thing that could make them better would be on board music storage!
1,Battery life is goid. But this headsets has a beeping problem. It be charged and beeps all day
0,"Maybe I got a bad one. Maybe it hates iphone 6s. I don't know.<br /><br />All I can say is these things were horrible. They created a super echo with anyone that called me, and the microphone was horrible. I had to yell to get it to pick up my voice at all. Returned for a refund."
0,DOES NOT WORK IN WATER
1,Great product. Comfortable and very functional.
1,"They are inexpensive Bluetooth headphones, so the bar isn't incredibly high.  The sound is ok.  They stay in place ok.  The buttons are hard to push, and they have trouble connecting sometimes.  If you are expecting greatness look else where.  If you are expecting an almost average experience for a cheap price point.  Then you have found your headphones."
0,I loved these earbuds while they lasted.  They stopped working after a few months.
1,Bought for my wife she loves them thanks a million
1,"I needed a cheap BT headphone for when I am out cycling. I didn't want to spend too much on a unit because I always end up loosing my headphone. This is why I don't like to bring my $100 headphone on the ride.<br /><br />I had this for about a week now and I am surprised at how great it sound.  The sound quality was very good and clear. I am a bass junky and have specialty headphone that is designed to bump. This is not a bass heavy headphone but well balanced.<br /><br />The fitment was really good as well. The default one didn't fit too well but it came with a bunch of other fitment that worked well for my ear. The trick to get the best sound quality is that you need to find one that fits snugly in your ear so you won't get any air leaks.<br /><br />The battery life on this headphone is really good as well. I've had it for about a week and I haven't had to recharge it yet.<br /><br />The built quality seems pretty solid as well. It is hard to say how long it will last but this looks just as well made as my other headphones that are 2-3 times the price.<br /><br />Overall, I am very happy with this headphone. For the price it rivals something 2-3 times the cost in terms of the sound quality."
1,Great Headphones easy to use as well
1,Low cost = poor sound
1,Over the years I've tried a number of bluetooth headphones and there were always some glitches. This is the first product that I've found it to be easy to connect to any device with excellent sound quality.  I highly recommend this product.
1,Decent headset
1,"Had trouble pairing and contacted their customer service. WOW, almost immediate response with clear directions on what the problem may have been. Paired with my Ellipsis Table and Samsung S6. Sound quality is great. So far, so good!"
1,"Great cheap earbuds, I would like to see the units slimmed down but they still work just as well as the day I got them 4 months ago"
1,"I loved them when I first got them a year ago, but they have recently stopped working."
1,Awesome product!  Great for running. Thank you for the great product Senso.
1,They are excellent!!!! The charge lasts long and the sound is great!!!!
1,Works and sounds great
1,Great product
0,The sound was very good. The bluetooth however is horrible. I couldn't get 5 feet from my phone before the headphones lost signal completely. I only bought these because they're &#34;wireless&#34; and that feature is pretty dismal if when in my pocket I go to stretch my legs and lose bluetooth reception.
1,"I cant say i am an expert on headphones bt any stretch, im 30 years old and probably have owned less than 5 pairs (i take care of my things) this is my first bluetooth set and they work great!! Awesome sturdy case, and east to connecet and disconnect. Totally worth the money, great sound too!"
1,Worth the price.  Good sound only thing which may be an issue over time is the soft ear wraparounds.  The earpiece fits snug in my ear pretty much without relying on it.
1,"Used the Bluetooth Earbuds for the first time on my 4.0 Mile run. Previously using the iphone provided wired Earbuds. I thought the SENSO Earbuds were great. The instructions were very easy to follow and the Earbuds function as advertised.  I did not have to continuously readjust the position of the Earbuds due to sweat, jarring out of position or catching the wire with my hands. The SENSO Earbuds eliminated all of those issues. I simply placed the SENSO Earbuds, turned them on and took off. I didn't have to mess with them until I completed my run. They are hardly even noticeable on the ear.  And the music plays flawlessly with great sound. So far a great product."
1,These are awesome headphones and the mic works great for hands free calls!
1,Our daughter gave us two of these headphone sets. They are great! They are very comfortable and come with several ear covers. The active noise cancellation is wonderful (tip: if you want &#34;noise cancellation&#34; then make sure it says &#34;active noise cancellation&#34; because some over-the-ear headphones claim &#34;noise cancellation&#34; just because they are over the ear).
1,I tried my headphones as soon as they arrived. The blues never sounded so good! Now my wife complains that I am not listening to her when she talks. They work great!!👍
0,The Bluetooth cuts in and out if I have my phone in my pocket. Don't really understand how this product has such good reviews.
1,Absolutely great! I got them for my husband just for the running time but now he is using them all the time. They are very comfortable
1,3 days using them and I love them!!
1,"These are a WIN/WIN! Super quality and doesn't cost an arm and a leg. Plus, I have always had difficulty finding a pair that stays put. Cannot say enough about these!"
0,"1) First thing that I noticed was that the short charging cable was missing - not a big deal I thought<br />2) Then noticed that the long charging cable (3 ft) was not a USB charging cable at all, but an apple charging cable<br />3) Next - decided to charge it with another USB cable. The little piece of rubber that covered the charging port was really difficult to remove, my husband couldn't remove it at all - took me a minute or so.<br />4) Tried charging with a couple of different USB cables, according to the instructions there is an LED that should light up. It didn't<br />5) I hate sending things back to Amazon ( printing the label and remembering to take it to UPS is just a drag). I usually just put up with imperfect products, but this will have to go back."
1,"First, I understand that not all products are perfect.  So as I had feared, it appears that I received one that had a defect.<br /><br />But I am still rating this product as a 5 star because customer support was very responsive and pleasant to communicate with.  I received a replacement immediately and it works perfectly as I had initially expected!"
0,Won't work after second use. Such a bummer and a waste of money.
1,Still going strong a year later. Great sound. Great price.
1,I got them within 5 days and I'm in Afghanistan. The work great and their customer surface is awesome
1,"I'm 66 years old and workout at my local health club 5 days a week.<br /><br />I recently signed up for Apple Music and purchased the wired Bose Soundsport ($79). After about a week, I decided that I liked the quality and sound of the Bose and purchased the wireless Bose Soundsport ($149). I've worn the Bose wireless for 2 weeks of active workouts. Very pleased with the wireless quality and comfort.<br /><br />Ironically, last week Amazon sent me a typical email which included the Senso HD wireless earbuds for ($35). Spent a day surfing the wed reading about the Senso product, so for only $35, I thought, let me give them try. Recieved in 3 days and to my surprise, after 3 workouts, I really can't tell much of a difference between all 3 pairs of earbuds.<br /><br />And believe me, I'm not disappointed that I now have 3 pairs of quality workout earbuds.<br /><br />But if prospective buyers are considering earbuds that are comfortable, sound good and have all the basic bells and whistles of the higher priced earbuds. Try $35-$45 wireless earbuds before spending $100-200 for name brands. They are truly worth trying.<br /><br />Amazon has a number of producers that make these high quality low priced wireless earbuds.<br /><br />And I would be surprised if here is not a considerable price drop for the Bose Soundsport and Beats 3 in the next 3 months."
1,I love the product. Good sound quality
1,They sound amazing! I love the noise cancelling ear buds.
0,Waste of money this wireless (beats) look alike headphones are garbage
1,"For the cost, these are great. I bought them as a replacement for my wireless Bose earphones, which were having issues with the rubber housings. The SENSO headphones don’t come close to the quality of abode, but it is a fraction of the price. And something that I couldn’t find before I bought the SENSOs, they can pair two devices at once. And unlike the Bose headphones, the SENSO headphones don’t have a problem deciding which device cuts over the other. The SENSOs play sound between the two without a problem. No app required. It’s a good buy."
1,The headphones seem to work really well and stay in place. The company seems very eager to help if anything we're to go wrong. Very impressed.
1,Great service and great headphones
1,A good earphone for the price and work very well.  I have two pair now.
1,"Wish the around the ear part was adjustable. No matter which insert I use, my ears must be small as they hurt. The sound is good but between the ear inserts and the around the ear guard too big it doesn't work for my needs. However the battery last forever it seems so maybe with someone with normal ear canals and larger ears it would be perfect."
0,"Not sure if I got a dud, but I will be returning these headphones.<br /><br />In comparison to my previously owned, now lost Plantronics Backbeat Go 2, these headphones -<br /><br />WON in areas of<br />1) Pairing/Control Functions - I like the fact that the controls are on the earbud. The separate console on my Backbeats often weighed down one side of the my earbuds<br />2) Price - my Backbeats were $20 more expensive when on sale at Costco<br />3) Comfort - would stay in my ear longer when jogging<br /><br />LOST in areas of<br />1) Connectivity - my biggest gripe. These headphones did not have the range that my backbeats had and would even lose connectivity while in a clear plastic sleeve attached to my arm. I'm probably dating myself when I say that it sounded like a skipped CD player<br />2) Fit - I would hear wind whistling through the earbuds while on a jog...thought that was a bit strange and the over the ear wraps were too large for my ear.<br />3) Sound quality - was pretty terrible compared to my backbeats. I'm not a big audiophile, but I could easily tell the difference in quality between the Senso and Plantronics. I would have kept the earphones otherwise, but with the lack of connectivity, the earphones had to go back.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this product on the connectiv"
0,"old version is very suitable for running ,but this version it very bad it cant balance on your ear"
0,"Nice sounding but if you lose or wear out the ear pieces after a year then you can't get replacements from Senso without buying a whole new headphone set,"
1,Quality made and sound great.  Long lasting charge and easy BlueTooth pairing.
1,"I like the fit of these headphones a lot, I use them to workout and they stay in my ear unlike a lot of headphones. The noise quality is also good. I am giving it a bad review because they constantly disconnect and reconnect, I have tried to troubleshoot many times but the interruption of sound is pretty annoying."
1,These are fantastic. Great fit - they stay in place and the audio quality is as good as it could be anyone's aging hearing. Easy to operate.
1,comfortable.  connects readily to my devices.  good sound
1,"This product is great for the price! Keep in mind that you're buying a $30 Bluetooth earbud set. The fact that it is sweat proof and that it's Bluetooth would be enough to warrant the price alone. The sound quality is alright. If you're used to using high end products you will notice a difference, but these still sound good.<br /><br />Where this product shines is in the fact that they went above and beyond what they needed to. In your package you will get several replacement ear buds, and a pretty slick case. but to boot, you get two charging cables for the device. And to top everything off they include a two port car charger. all of these additional goodies gave me good enough reason to leave a full 5 star review. Great product, great value!"
1,Listening to audio books.
0,"Super loose around my ears, wouldn't stay on."
1,"Great product, outstanding sound!  Works just as advertised.  Wish I had bought this earlier."
1,The silicon ear hook is a great idea. Very soft and comfortable especially during longer workouts. The fidelity of sound is superb and the noise cancellation is excellent as compared to other ear buds. The sounds of wind while walking or running does interfere but it is a minor issue at best. I would recommend to other users to give this product a try. You will not be disappointed. 👍🏻
1,Very impressed with your product. Used while in gym don't here the other noises . They are comfortable easy to use. My previous one was worn around neck and we're annoying when working out.
1,Great earbuds for the price.  Pair easily and good sound quality.
1,Favorite Bluetooth set ever! Bass is fantastic and the set stays in place.
1,"These are great headphones - they work well and are very comfortable! The price is great, too!<br />I couldn't be happier!"
1,"Great sound, reasonable recharge time, very comfortable fit. You can choose how deeply you shove these into your ear canal for either near total isolation or mere presence in the field of ambient environmental sounds, and this also enables you to avoid ear fatigue when you need a lighter physical pressure on your ear canals. The red-to-blue charge LED is very useful. The buttons on the right earpiece... meh. They work, but mostly I use these ear goggles whilst sitting, for privacy reasons, and so use the host computer's volume controls. I've no experience using them during strenuous physical activity. Physical range for full function is limited to about three meters, but that is more a feature than a problem with unsecured bluetooth devices in my opinion."
0,I’ve bought these headphones twice now and both died to my sweat within a year. Product should read sweat RESISTENT not proof.
1,"My new Senso Bluetooth Headphones are the best ever!  Crisp clean sound from this tiny headset.  Connects to my phone seamlessly without any problem.  They sound fantastic!  Going to buy four more for Christmas gifts.  Worth twice the price, but don't get any ideas Senso!"
1,"Wow, I love these earbuds. I have been going other brands because of sound quality, comfort, battery life. But these will be my last stop, they have all the mentioned qualities.  And for the price I paid they are an absolute steal!"
1,"bought a pair because i'm now using an iphone 7 (the earbud jack no longer exists.)<br />my brother has a pair of powerbeats 3 and i wasn't willing to drop $100+ on wireless earbuds so i went with senso instead.<br /><br />these earbuds literally have the same sound quality as the powerbeats 3, but senso somewhat sounds a bit better. they last pretty long and charge up pretty fast as well.<br />been using these for about 2-3 weeks now and i haven't had any issues.<br />i only use these for my workouts so using these for phone calling/voice calling might not be the best."
1,Easy to set-up and so far sound is good.  Great for workouts.  Good value for the price.
1,I love the headphones for listening to music but I've used them a few times on phone calls and the person that I'm talking to says that it sounds like they are in a cave and they can hear an echo of everything they are saying. Pertaining to the listening of music a 5 star rating but for calls 1 star
1,Excellent sound quality!!!!
1,great
0,Stopped working on one side.
1,Service was fast. Love my headphones and love the 1 year warranty too.  Good job and keep it up!
1,"I love these ear buds!  The sound is good for me (not an audiophile).  I wear them on walks to help motivate me.<br />Based on the photo in the User Guide, I thought the &#34;Wire Tie&#34; was larger than in reality. I contacted the seller by email, and got a response the next morning, including photos to describe what it is."
1,These are OK.  The sound is actually better than the Mifo brand I bought that were a lot more expensive.
1,"Easy to setup, good fit, good audio quality for a non-audiophile.<br /><br />Minor criticisms:<br />A: Noise cancellation is not noticeable, not sure if there is anything beyond a snug fit of earbuds.<br />B: Doesn't work well with the Google assistant if you're not in a very quiet location.  Any road or ambient noise ruins the &#34;OK google&#34; experience."
1,"I bought these Senso earphones based on the reviews here to replace a<br />different brand (Letsfit) I had used.  There are several earphones of the same<br />design on Amazon.  I verified by phoning Senso that they all come from the same<br />factory in China.  However, there are some small differences.<br />I found the volume of the Senso to<br />be inadequate for me (poor hearing) to use them on a home treadmill; noise canellation was<br />not evident.  Also, the ear hooks are made from a fairly soft material so they are<br />too floppy and tend to come off easily.  Otherwise, the Senso worked fine: decent<br />sound quality, good battery life."
1,"Great product until it stopped connecting to my phone. I have an iPhone 5c and it was working fine until I charged it, then it stopped. However, the phone connects to my speakers, so I think that it is the headphones. Other than that the sound was great and it cancelled out noise."
1,"Sound quality is real HD, incredibly easy to use! Love the wireless feature as well. Would highly recommend it to everyone especially for the price!"
1,"I bought 3 different brands(yet similar looking) Bluetooth headphones. This one lasted the longest. The other 2 died after 6 months to a year, this I have for 1 year and 3 months. BUT, I bought 2 of this, one for me, one for my gf- my gf's died after 3 months. So I guess it is a hit or miss. If it works, it works great. If not, well... Amazon did refund me.<br /><br />Battery life is around 4-5 hours."
1,"I bought SENSO ActivBuds S-250 for listening to audiobook while exercising. I currently have a Bose Quiet Comfort headphone, and this Senso ActivBuds noise cancellation cannot be compared. On the other hand, the sound is quite good. The earbuds are comfortable and stay in ears quite well. The hook is soft and effective, even while I wear eyeglasses. Pairing is quick and easy."
1,"These have been great so far.  I've primarily used them for when I'm in the gym to avoid hanging cords.  They do well with (maybe tmi, but a LOT of) sweat, and don't get in the way at all.  Very comfortable to boot.  Not sure how much continuous usage you'll get (haven't tried it myself yet), but I've yet to have them die on me mid-use, or only plug them in every couple days when I bother to remember.<br /><br />One caveat is there does seem to be some possibility for interference on the bluetooth connection.  There's one corner in my neighborhood where the connection always seems to get spotty, and I can only presume some local phenomenon is causing it, because by the next block it's fine again.  Might be a nearby cell tower or some such."
1,"They are great, but battery life is not as described in the website. They don't last more than 4 hours at best."
0,"Buy these+ ONLY if you need them for 3-6 months.  I've had 2 pair to stop working after a few months.  Both pair were well cared for.  Both times I followed the recommendation for factory reset and it doesn't work.  The quality for the price is excellent, with the exception that they don't last. The manufacturer sent me a replacement for the first pair.  I'm not so sure I want to go through this every few months.  Time to look for another brand."
1,Great sound. Fit well
1,"First, the quality of sound is amazing for the price. Ease of Setup, that's an understatement. The set was fully charged out of the box, I turned on Bluetooth on my phone and connected effortlessly. Great quality of sound, great volume. Mic works great too. They are built with durability too.<br /><br />And to show how much they believe in their product, you open the cool little case that holds the ear buds and peripherals, you'll find some really good quality charging cables, a car charger that doesn't look like something they got free bit rather very nice quality, and backups plugs sitting on top of a pamphlet that says call this number 24/7 if anything goes wrong. Wow. I got an email shortly after saying the same thing, 1 year warranty. I was blown away. It took my son all of 2 Days to see how happy I was with them before he needed his own set. Cool color options, I got him his own color, because these are mine! 😀"
1,"Comfortable, neat, affordable, and super fancy.  I've only had my headphones for a few days but I enjoy them."
1,"It's great for what price I paid!! Comfortable and looks awesome. The sound is very nice but the only con about this product is the battery life as compared to my other wireless Bluetooth headphones. It will work for like continuous 7-10hrs but soon you have to charge them. Overall, I will definitely recommend them."
1,I’ve learned that I can fast forward or rewind to the next music track
1,"This is the best ear buds I ever bought.  It blocks out  surrounding noise. Easy to use, also comfortable.  I like that it has different size ear piece cover, small, medium and large.  I don't turn it up because it's loud just halfway."
1,Gave it as a gift and they loved it
1,Go 4 it
1,"This headset is damn fine for the price.<br />Good volume, clear and crisp, good bass.<br /><br />Highly recommend these for those looking for a good pair of wireless headphones."
1,"a lot of my prior headsets became useless (not useless, but harder to connect due to the need of an adaptor), so finding an alternative solution to get headphones connected FAST became a priority. i use this at work to make calls/listen to music and it's been working out great!"
1,"They work with my tablet, but I don't know how to get them to work with my laptop. It is likely the laptop's fault not the headphone's fault."
1,Seem to have good battery life. Bass is a little heavy and sometimes makes the overall sound quality worse.
1,Sounds great and connects fast and easy.
1,"Love the look and feel of these. Unfortunately the bluetooth lag on these make them only ideal for music listening, not streaming video content."
1,Got these for my boyfriend who has had 3 pairs of Beats wireless that have broke in the past and didn't want to pay that kind of money again. Very 'look a like' in style and texture and great battery life for the price. Very loud just a little high on the base. With a warrantee included for the price whats not to love. Save your cash from beats and buy these instead!!
1,"Excellent product, especially for the price. I have owned comparable beats by Dre headphones and these are better hands down! 10 month's after purchase I did have an issue where headphones got wet and stopped working. After emailing company i got a response right away and a replacememt pair. The customer service was top notch! I look forward to giving these guys my business in the future."
1,"These are good headphones that are easy to use with an iPhone. My one complaint is that they aren’t aerodynamic. Therefore, when I wear them while running, there’s an irritatingly loud whooshing sound the whole time"
0,"Save your money and buy something else! First, they arrived without the 3rd set of ear inserts, second they were missing the wire tie, third the battery showed it was near full when received and dropped to almost zero after 15 mins of use. Fourth, they sound absolutely horrible, sure there is bass but at even a quarter volume they sound like the mids and highs are blowen. I've bought Bluetooth headphones in this price point before from TaoTronics and was blown away by their sound and quality, unfortunately they broke after 6 months and possibly someone stepping on them! Finally, the fit is not good...the over the ear part is almost worthless for me and I have average sized ears."
1,"The best wireless headsets? Not even close. The product is and does as advertised. The out of box experience is first rate. I wear this item when I am working out in the gym. The earbuds are big, heavy and the ear holder thingies wrap around the front of the ear, not the back. As a result, the ear buds are not very secure or snug. The ear buds do not fall out but I find myself constantly pushing them closer to my ear. Some would say that's a good thing. Personally, I like to corkscrew the ear buds in to my noggin' and these just don not allow me to do that."
1,"Just got these.  Easy to pair, feel comfortable and good support. Impressed so far and recommend them even prior to realizing that these offer superior value all round."
1,Only had them for a short time. So far they are the best heads I've  used. The sound is awesome.
1,"works and sounds great, fast bluetooth connection.<br />just one problem, the usb connection has failed after a couple of months of use, it will not charge, and now it is useless."
1,Excellent bang for your buck! I would highly recommend them!
1,"I used these for the first time yesterday and they sound fabulous! I was a little worried because in ear headphones tend to fall out of my ears a lot.  Not these! Finally found a great pair of headphones I can use for lounging around but more importantly, headphones that will stay in my ears while I do my workouts.  I tend to do a lot of HIIT workouts where I am moving a lot, up and down on the ground and lots of high impact.  These don't seem to budge.  So far, totally worth the money."
1,Excellent phones; great price.  Using them over the phone connection is clear as can be.  Fit well over the ear and are not prone to coming out while exercising. I've tried other headphones that cost twice as much and these are equal to or maybe even better than those I've tested.
1,"""I have purchased 3 of them, my kids and wife love them. My kids have used them for about a year now, and they don't have any complaints."""
1,Comfortable and decent sound for the price. I use them at the gym.
1,Broke within 2 months and haven’t heard back from customer service regarding replacing it considering it’s STILL under warranty
1,Bought them for my son who seems to love them. :)
0,they suck don't last bad deal!
1,Best wireless headphones ever. The battery life is great.
1,Very comfortable to wear for running. Sometimes it doesn't sync right away with my cell but it is okay.
1,"Have used several wireless ear buds and usually disappointed with the sound quality.  These are, by far, the best sounding ear buds I have found.  They were out of the box, charged in about 45 minutes, paired and I was off to my first run.  Great, deep sound and the connection with my phone was fantastic.  I even took a call at the end of my run and it was very windy - the person on the line couldn't believe I was using wireless ear buds outside.  I highly recommend."
1,"What can I say, I’m a very picky person when it comes to headsets.  I have tried a lot of them, and a lot have been disappointing.  Either I can’t hear the caller, or the caller can’t hear me.  The sound is to loud, even on a quiet car ride, or I sound muffled.  I have tried the stereo inner ear, I have tried the one ear mono, I have tried even the round the neck hanging retractable ear piece headset.  Now there are a couple of those I tried that have been good, tolerable, even a nice sound on both ends of the call and when listening to music.  So when I went looking for a new pair, when my old one broke, I ran across these and read some of the reviews.  They sounded nice, so I decided to try it.  Got them, tested them in a few conditions, even went to the store with a call on the line, and normally it would be over powering loud on the other caller’s end that I would have to hand up and call back when I’m in more of a quiet environment.  These, they remained quiet.  Yes, they heard the background noise, but it was not over powering that they could not hear my voice clearly.  As in my end, the sound quality is really good.  The earbuds provide a nice noise canceling that I can hear the stereo quality nicely as well as any calls that I may be on.  Bottom line, these are a really good pair or headsets and I would recommend them to anyone that is like me, wary on buying headsets because of the sound quality.<br /><br />Pros:<br />• Call quality is good.  Both on my end and the other caller’s end<br />• Music quality is great, stereo sound is crisp and can be adjusted well if you have an app installed.<br />• Great for exercising, the loop fits on your ears nicely to prevent any slippage when you’re working out.<br />• Charging is quick for those always on the go<br />Cons:<br />• Battery life is good, but can be better.  After an all-day of listening to music and a few calls, it needs to be recharged. (There are some out there with a good 10-12 hours of usage)"
1,"Great for the gym because I can move freely away from my phone and still follow the workout videos I use. I don't like that once it gets close to running out of battery it starts repeating &#34;battery low&#34; every minute until it dies. I had to get different headphones for more every day use, but I'll continue using these for the gym. They're also a little difficult to wear with glasses, but it doesn't bother me too much.<br /><br />I've had some difficulties getting it to connect smoothly via Bluetooth on my devices. I've found that removing it from my Bluetooth settings and then adding it on again solves the issue but I've had to do it a few times."
1,"I have had these earbuds for a few days.  I was pleased with all of the accessories that came with them  They sinked to my I-Phone instantly and the battery seems to last and last.  I fly for work a lot and am excited to use these during my trips.  The one year warranty is great.  I hope not to use it, but a nice plan to have.  They are comfortable on my ears and the buttons are easy to get to.  I had been shopping for a pair of buds for a long time and reading the other comments made these SENSO Earbuds an easy choice."
1,I only have a positive things to say and that is that they work beautifully they wrap around my ears and allow me to not have to hold back while exercising.
1,"The fit is great. Over ear pieces are not firm, which I thought would be a problem. They are very soft and mushy which is good because they don't irritate my ears after long wearing time. I have other headphones with the same design and they hurt after a while. The in ear pieces fit well. The weight of the ear units is not noticeable and actually helps keep them in your ears. The usability of the headphones is great. Easy to pair, and very loud. The controls are simple and easy to use. However the sound quality is meh. They are very muddy, they have no high end. I like a bright, crisp sounding headphone that has a lot of upper end. These are lacking in that area. The do have good mid and lowered sound, so vocals and bass is strong. The weight and style are great. Plus all the extras that come with them."
1,"Great fit, amazing accessory bag, still working after a week. Year warranty (that hasn't been tested) if you are reading this just hit &#34;add to cart&#34; if you don't like it give it as gift, price is right."
1,I workout out with these headphones and my 7 years old son use it also and it’s been a month now and I find sometimes under the couch or on his neck while his asleep and still works and sound like brand new. Who need the apple AirPods when you have this one 🤷‍♀️😍👌
1,"I’ve had them for several weeks now, sound quality is really good the bass is way better than I thought it would be, phone call are clear battery life is a lot better than my LG headphones,the sound quality is as good as my wife’s $200 Beats, I drive a truck so a lot of time they are hanging around my neck, they are not easy to just put on when a phone call comes in, I don’t like that the buttons for the volume and to skip tracks are the same buttons and it won’t back up multiple tracks it will skip multiple tracks though and it’s a pain in the butt to get the dust cover off of the charging port, that’s really all that I can say that I don’t like about them.  If you’re buying them for your work outs you will LOVE them you really get a lot for the money, if you’re buying them to use for phone calls they do the job very good but ease of use is about a 6 out of 10. I give them 5 stars because of the sound quality, that’s ultimately what I bought them for and they are the best sounding headphones you’ll find under $100 I promise you!!!"
1,Primarily used for workouts.  Workout 3 hours a day.  They sound great and only have to charge after every other workout.  Depending on ear canal size you may have trouble getting them to stay put.  However thet included some foam tips that work great for me.
0,"I'm very particular when it comes to sports headphones. I'm a long distance runner and need headphones that will stay put, which means I usually go for the wrap around style. (running for 60+ minutes with earbuds just doesn't work for me)<br /><br />I recently upgraded to an iPhone 7 and quickly realized that all my headphones won't work with the new phone. I got these bluetooth headphones to try, ran 8+ miles this morning and I couldn't have asked for better headphones. The sound was amazing, they really did block out other noise and most important, they didn't move at ALL! I'm buying a second pair to keep as a spare because when you find something that works like these do, you stock up!<br /><br />UPDATE 3/1/17 - I'm updating this review because the product went from great to basically trash since my first review. Simply put, the headphones don't hold a charge. For example, after fully charging them, I used them Sunday for 85 minutes and Monday for 50 minutes. I went to turn them on today and they were dead. Completely dead. I barely got 2 hours of use on a full charge - that's really disappointing and wasn't happening when I first starting using the headphones. At this point, I would not recommend these."
1,"The senso headphones are great! The sound is very clear, the distance is pretty far, and the 6 hour charge is amazing! The only thing that would make them perfect is if the part that goes around the ear was a little smaller, or maybe I just need bigger ears. But I would definitely purchase another pair!"
1,"If i could give it 4 1/2 stars I would. The sound quality is great and they are light.  I love the case that came with them. Also they include a car adaptor, a short and long charger, which is great!  I have only 2 minor complaints. The rubber  Cable Management Clip, used to adjust the length of the connecting wire, comes off easily. Also, when wearing while doing yard work the buds tend to come out a little too easily."
1,Excellent headphones. I bought them for my husband and he loves the fit. And I love how great he sounds while I'm talking to him.
1,"Great fit, sound and comfort. Easy operation and setup. Package arrived on time and as shown."
1,These are great.  So worth it.  Working out just got easier.  Great great product. Highly recommend to anyone wanting a wireless Bluetooth headset for working out.  The price is right.
0,"I purchased these off of the Amazon recommendation, and I should have read more reviews.  My ears are small and these are just too big.  Even after putting in the smallest ear bud, they don't fit well in my ear, the ear loops are way too big and therefore useless, and they are heavy and keep falling out of place.  As a female, with apparently small ears, I just cannot recommend these."
1,so awesome to be wireless!
0,The reason of the 2 stars is because I had a defective battery life unit that do not hold charge for stipulated time
1,"work great for the gym. The vol adjuster could use a little tweaking, the volume does not get low enough before muting."
1,outstanding headphones
1,We love the clarity of the some and comfort in the ears and it stays in place. Love the product.I purchase 2 more  after this purchase.<br />Unlike other headphones where after some time it starts to hurt the ears.
1,"I misplaced my Beats Bluetooth headphones an d was thinking that the replacement cost would be high. I was pleasantly surprised to find the SENSO headphones that work at least as well as my prior phones at a much lower cost. Even better, the ear pieces are much more comfortable so I am totally pleased with the SENSO unit."
1,I followed directions. I can listen to music and to downlloaded movies. They fit great! Sound is clear and you hardly feel them. Lightweight.
1,Clear sound and easy to wear
1,"These are amazing! Worth every penny. Hold a charge for a long time, connect easily to my phone, sound quality is good, come with lots of accessories and different ear pieces, the case is a nice hard case which protects them well."
1,Great headphones! Easy to connect and good sound quality.
1,These sound pretty good.  I have owned these headphones for almost 4 years and they have gotten some use. I recently washed them in my HE front loader and they survived! And they still hold a decent charge! I am super impressed and give them my highest recommendation.
1,I love this headset. I used them for a few months and then they stopped working but Senso customer service was great and they honored the warranty without any hassle and shipped me a new pair.
1,Great headphones for gym use.  Do not buy these thinking they are noise canceling because that is not the case.  I often hear the music from the gym speakers in the background at times but for the price these are a great thing to have.  It is very nice being able to just tap the right ear bud and pause the music that I'm currently listening to.  This definitely comes in handy when someone is trying to talk to you with your earbuds in.
1,"I needed Bluetooth headphones that were comfortable and ideal for working out in. The ones I have had in the past, although very good, were very uncomfortable behind my ears and I couldn't workout in them because they would fall off.  I had also changed jobs where I no longer had my own office but was now in a cubicle on an open floor.  So most importantly I needed noise reduction, not cancellation because I still need to hear if my phone rings or someone calls my name.  These so far have checked all of my boxes. The quality is really good! Not to mention the battery life. I rarely have to charge this. My only issue is that it can only pair with one device at a time.  My other Bluetooth headset can pair with two devices. I have two phones, one personal and one for work so it's a bit inconvenient sometimes that I have to switch it from device to device.  That's the only reason so far that I didn't given it all 5 stars. I have and would recommend it to others.<br /><br />Update: I am disappointed to report that these headphones just stopped charging one day. There is no explanation for it as I put it to charge the same way I always have. So I guess it's not a long term investment. But while it worked it worked very well so I would not change my rating."
1,"Overall amazing product and service. The audio is amazing and the volume at half the max is already loud enough for me, the sound quality is very clear. I use these to work out and being sweat proof they are perfect for the gym or any other indoor or outdoor activities. The price is right on, and they're better than some $100 or $200 Bluetooth headphones that are almost the same as these headphones. This product is worth the money, it is less expensive and as durable for being almost the same headphone as other $100 or $200 headphones. You need to have this if you want better sound, durability, and comfort."
1,"I love the concept & the product, good sound, easy to use. Only one BIG problem - the ear hook would not stay around my ear (ear to small).  So I had to return. Hope they can figure out a way to make the ear hook smaller or something. I'm so disappointed as I really liked them = just couldn't move with them on."
1,"Pretty good headphones ,"
1,Great product and customer service!
1,"Love them! Easy to use and are comfortable on my ears, sounds are terric."
0,"It says WATERPROOF, do not believe it.<br />I had mine for a couple of months. I little water killed them."
1,much! much! better then I thought they would be for the price( which is great btw) the sound was crisp and clear with decent amount of bass to them<br />and pairing was simple and not dropping connections. Quality seems great as well and the delivery was very speedy. Battery life was the stated 8 hours for me. I would absolutely buy them again!!
1,"Received my earbuds yesterday, paired them on my Iphone 7 in under a minute and took thim mountain biking with me. The sound quality while listening to music is great for the price. The sound quality while making a phone call is not the best but then again i was mountain biking! For anyone who is looking for a budget pair of earbuds i definitely recommend these."
1,"I like the headphones, its sound, its price. But I do not like when the sound keeps going up. I have to keep turning them done and they go back up during the same usage."
1,Bought as a gift. The person really likes these for the gym or working out in the yard.
1,"What a great head set! I'm really enjoying them. There light weight, easy to use,  wear them for hours! Often forgetting I even have them on when the music is off. They focus the music directly into my ears so much so I feel like the orchestra is in the middle of my head! Never experienced that before with normal head sets! The base is fantastic . The voice quality is  superb. Watching a movie I heard people talking off screen! It was so convincing that I turned around thinking there was someone behind me. I'm very pleased. Battery life is great and the indicator on the phone keeps me informed of how much power I still have. Going on 10 hours now and still 3/4 charge. Great packaging love the extras"
1,Great headphones!
1,"great headphones, i would buy again"
1,I've had them for a week and so far so good.  I use them for running on road and it's winter so I usually wear a hat that aids in holding them in place on longer efforts.  They come with multiple buds so you can use the ones that fit best.
1,"I've gone through 4 pairs of earbuds that supposedly were guaranteed not to fall out of your ears. They all did. I finally decided to try these just because they are so inexpensive in comparison.<br />I'm so glad I did. I've done several runs in these, the longest being 13 miles. They never once fell out or even felt loose. They are comfortable enough that I didn't feel the need to adjust them at any point.<br />I think the sound quality is great. I have a galaxy s8 and didn't need to adjust anything on the sound settings. I had them down relatively low. I can't imagine ever listening to them at full volume.<br />The controls are very easy to use (pause, play, ff, rewind, answer and hang up calls). I had no problem pairing them and they immediately connect as soon as I turn them on.<br />As for battery life, I've never tested them beyond probably about 3 hours, but had no problem with that.<br />The box comes with several different size ear buds, a wire holder, a dual car charger, a USB port with both micro USB and lightning connectors, and a carry case. I love the case because it's small enough to easily pack away but keeps them protected.<br />I'll update this review if I find anything to complain about, but so far, I really love these and highly recommend them."
0,too much bass. connection not so good.
1,"Amazing Sound Quality, For The Price, Don't Go Buy Expensive Priced Ones For The Big Names, I Guarantee These Will Stand Up To The Test of Time and Then Some, Like Mine Have For Less Then $40.00 and Free Fast Shipping Can't Be Beat, I Was Recommended These and I Will Recommend These and Buy More As Well! Fast Free Shipping! Awesome Price! Great Sound, and Quality! Will Recommend! Thank You Again!"
1,"While I like the sound quality, batter life, and general usage of these phones, I ultimately have to ding them for being uncomfortable to wear. They annoy and eventually start to hurt both the inside of my ears as well as the top of my ears."
1,I had ordered these headphone in the past - and they lasted forever.  Ordered them again.
1,"I was impressed with your product. It was attractively packaged and it felt, even smelt like quality. I appreciate that there was also a car charger included for both the device and a cellphone. My only issue is when I jogged, for some odd reason the left side kept coming off of my ear. Other than that I have no other issues with your product. Last but not least the sound quality is amazing! Pairing the device was also easy and quick."
1,I really have no complaints visit been perfect for me I have now purchased three pairs one for myself and one for each of my teenage boys. They’re comfortable and they sound good and they have different fittings for Different ear Comfortability
1,"Work pretty well and dont get in the way when Im working out. The buds do hurt my ears after a while, but other than that its a great product and a good buy."
1,I love these. I've bought three pairs for my family. The base and treble rival my Beats at a fifth of the price.
0,"Be warned, they worked great for 6 weeks and then they will not hold a charge.  Eventually no matter how long you leave them charging they just won't power on!  This is really unfortunate as the deign, fit and sound was great for the 6 weeks that they worked.  However, since 6 weeks is after the return period, they are now just an expensive paperweight to add to my fitness items.  I guess because they are not the higher priced headphones, the quality of their construction/durability is subject to &#34;luck of the draw&#34; as I see many people have left positive reviews (which was one the reasons I bought them in the first place).  However, I guess I fell into the group that experiences the problems with the battery/wiring (should have read more of the less pleased reviews).  Please keep all this in mind if you decide to order these headphones!"
1,I was shocked with the quality of the headphones and even more shocked at the awesome custom service from sensor. Highly recommended. Good luck finding better at this price point.
1,I've had these headphones only about a week but I already love them. I hope that they last. I wear them to the gym all the time. I have only had to charge them when I got them and have got about 4-5 hours out of them already at the gym & no low battery warning. I can also leave my phone in the locker when I shower afterwards and wear them in the shower without worrying that they are being damaged. I am very impressed so far.
1,"The headphones work well enough if you are into indoor workouts, but if you run or bike outdoors, the form factor has such a large front surface area that all you hear is wind resistance.  If you like outdoor workouts, look for something with a much smaller footprint"
1,Wonderful headphones. Every run I have went one with these they performed well and have never fallen out (fyi I have small ears). There have been times where I left them on and threw them in my bag and sometimes while Im on the move a button would accidentally be pressed and they would recall the last person I had a conversation with.
0,"I used them for a couple weeks okay, but then they just stopped holding a charge.<br /><br />And heck if I know what they are talking about when their directions say ""multi-function button"" in instructions, there are only two buttons I can find, up and down volume."
1,"I really like these, the sound is great the only thing is when running they start to slip off the ears a little so you have to adjust them. But if I’m not running and just doing some workouts then they work great"
1,3 month life span
1,Great headphones and cord for 35$. However the wind is quite annoying with these headphones. It whistles if you are facing the wind and can get quite loud. But for 35$ they're great.
1,These are great! Sound is good the battery life is long and most important to me they are totally comfortable! Mile after mile when I am running they provide music and I barely feel them there. My previous pair was a lot more expensive and was forever falling out or causing pain. These do their job and stay in place! Couldn’t be happier
1,"Very impressed with these earbuds. After receiving them, I got them charged up fully in about 20 minutes and then after a quick pairing it was time to test them out.<br /><br />The fit is good and the sound is also good. Way better then some cheaper ones I purchased a couple years ago.  I did need to adjust the equalizer on the phone to turn the bass down a bit but that was a personal preference.<br /><br />I completed a decent 90 minute workout and they stayed on the entire time. Jogging, tire flips and some weights. I wear glasses so there is a tiny bit of movement but nothing that interruped my workout.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend these earbuds.<br />Bonus points for the extra Iphone charger and Dual car charger."
1,Great sound and very comfortable in the ear.  Loved that they came with all the extra perks!
0,"Great noise cancelling, good battery life but just stopped staying on for no reason so now they are no good"
1,"So far so good! I am extremely happy with my purchase.  I could not commit to a Bluetooth headphone set until my husband was given this as a gift, he raved about it so much and let me try it to test it out and immediately I made my purchase on amazon and received it two days later.  It comes packaged beautifully with a charger and an added iPhone charger also. It has a great case to travel with and the sound quality is excellent for both noise cancelling music and for phone calls.  Even with a hard workout session at the gym I have not experienced any issues with the earbuds falling out or being uncomfortable.  Highly recommend. Also they just notified me there is a 1 year warranty as well.  Amazing bang for your buck. Couldn’t be happier."
1,"Great sounding headphones...the little rubber arch that goes over and behind the ear it's a little too soft and flimsy for me...probably not the high fidelity sound quality from more expensive brands but it's adequate, decent highs and lows and they also do a good job at isolating the noise....and very loud!!! Plus all the extra that comes with it...great value, you can't go wrong! 👍👍 Senso!!"
0,These work find for music but they have a very prounounced echo with phone calls - and that's was the main thing I bought them for.  I've tried them with phone calls numerous times and always have to switch to another mode.  Very disappointing.
1,SO FAR SO GOOD. COMFORTABLE.
1,I am very happy i order from this company delivery so fast item perfect i recommended to my friends.Thank you so much
1,"I am not experiencing the symphonic low bass sound quality that I read in other reviews. I have the highs but not the lows. When I put my phone in my back pocket, while connected, my blue tooth connection gets interrupted. I have not experienced this with other blue tooth devices."
1,"I got this for use during my gym workouts and outdoor runs. Worked good for about 2 months, then I noticed spotty connectivity issues when playing music. It would skip beats in even slow playing music quite frequently. Since then it has been consistently getting worse. Now even while walking normally with the phone in my pant's pocket, the connectivity is very poor. The sound would skip for about half a second every now and then. I have tested this with multiple devices and it is the same. Would not recommend this product to a friend. I guess that is why it was so cheap."
1,Great base great price and comfortable definitely a good buy.
0,"it worked ok but after few weeks, the sound started to break for whatever reason i could not figure out. and it's not about charging or having it far from the source"
1,Super Bluetooth Headphones. Works as advertised.
1,"Nice Headphones, excelente customer service"
1,They work better than expected.  Am able to up the phones added base and these handle it.  I am so happy and for the price they are better than expected.
1,Perfect fit and can’t complain about the price. Sound is really good.
1,"Excellent earphones. They arrived quickly and they work great. They are somewhat heavy on the bass but I am using them with Napster, which has a great equalizer built in and once I adjusted the bass down, they sound excellent."
1,Just what I needed for cycling and mowing the lawn.  When riding the bike wind noise can be so bad that you cannot hear other headphones but the good fit eliminated that.  Similar situation when using a riding lawn mower.  These block out enough ambient noise that you can enjoy the programming/music at a reasonable volume.  Comfortable enough that there is no lingering feeling after wearing them like is the case with some.
1,sounds great and works well. easy to use.
1,"These have a much fuller sound than other bluetooth headphones I've tried, they stay in well while running also."
1,Awesome sound  Quality highly recommended
1,My husband loves these headphones. Thank you for such a great product and a reasonable price.
1,Excellent during my walks for weight loss and exercise. I can listen and keep my hands free.
1,keeps slipping off my ears...
1,"So far so good, love the sound, people can hear me when talking.  Thanks"
1,Great product!!! 100% recommended!!!
1,Sound quality is awesome! Comparable to expensive earbud brands. Would definitely recommend.
1,Love my new earphones! I read the reviews and went for it! I'm so glad I did. The sound is amazing. They are comfortable and very user friendly.
1,Finally found a set of earphones that actually fit good and have decent battery life... Not real impressed with noise cancelling...
0,"I have had mine for about 2 months and while I was at first really satisfied with the quality, they are no longer syncing with my device."
1,Love these headphones right of the box. They are nicer then Power Beats I had previously Better sound and accessories for far less money.  BUY THEM. You will love them
1,All is well
1,Love these. Very good ear buds. I have used others in the past that suck. I like the attention to detail that Invotek paid to everything from packaging to including a cable and car charger as well.<br /><br />Are these the greatest sounding not really they are very bass heavy but I still love them for working out.<br /><br />Overall great product get these now if you are thinking about it!
1,Gave as a secret santa gift and they loved it!
1,Better than I thought they would be.
0,too late to return.
1,"I love these earbuds, I exercise in a pool and they are perfect because they are waterproof. The sound is great and they fit well. This is my second set, the first just stopped working so I contacted SENSO Customer Service and they tried several things to have them work but they failed. I sent it back to Amazon and received a full refund and bought a new set which is working great. Fantastic product and outstanding customer service makes this company worthwhile."
0,"I bought them for a small trip I was taking and I needed them for the flight. They worked great and they were packed away for a couple of months until I needed them again. Now they won't charge. They worked once and that was it. Because of the time in between use, I can't return them. So disappointed."
1,great device
1,I love the no cords to get tangled as I work around the house! I also enjoy being able to answer the phone with just a click of the button while listening to a book.  I wish the ear bud portion could be adjusted to point either straight into the ear or slightly to the rear instead of to the front.  I have tried reversing them left on right and right on left but this does not work well.  If I am missing something please let me know as I love everything else.
0,"I loved these headphones and wanted so much to love this company, too! Talking quality for phone calls wasn’t great, but worked like a dream for listening to music. Imagine my disappointment when theu started having a crackly static that showed up every time I used them!! I contacted Senso with hopes they would provide support, and customer service was very responsive with troubleshooting until they determined the problem was actually with the headphones, not with my use of them. Immediately, the customer service department “mysteriously” stopped all communication with me, and refused to provide any offer of repair or replacement—or even a discount for future use! I am so disappointed."
0,terrible range songs cut out at arms length from my phone or in my pocket I plan on returning
0,These worked fairly well for my son for about 2 months and then they just fell apart. These are his second pair - we should have learned with the first pair. Don't buy if you want a pair of earbuds that will actually last a while.
1,Great for the price
0,Bought these headphones in January and Bluetooth no longer working.  Product description states there is a one year warranty
1,"Great value for the price, I highly recommend it, I like all the goodies that comes with, very handy. Battery life it's been good so far"
1,Work and fit great. Good sound for a pretty good price. I have used them for 2 weeks and haven't had any problems
0,"The molding that is supposed to go behind the ear does not fit snug around the ear to hold the headphones in ace which affects the sound. If you stand still in one place they won't fall out, as soon as you move around I'm constantly having to put them back into place."
1,"Living in a snow belt, I spend a lot of time outside to remove the snow from my driveway, sidewalk and roof.  I use my iPod with the corded earbuds, which I have to thread through my coat with the iPod in my jean's pocket.  At some point, I usually inadvertently snag the cord and have to stop and put it all together again.  Well never again!  The iPod is still in my pocket, but no cord connected to it, and the music sounds phenomenal! The price is real value and it was a snap to pair it with my Bluetooth devices - and I'm not tech savvy.  It's almost a pleasure to go out and shovel - almost😉."
0,"After using 3 month my headphone is turned off after pairing with any device, please advise to solve this problem."
0,much cheaper material than my prior one.
0,These didn't last 6 months. Not worth the money.
1,Absolutely a great value compared to other high priced name brand.  These are perfect for sweaty boxing & gym workouts!
1,"I love these!!  They come with car charger, extra cords, a great carrying case (wish I had the Sense on the plane last night), and extra ear buds.  I'm really impressed.  Charged quickly and the first use was great - if they hold up, they'll be the best value for wireless earphones in our house (2 pair of BackBeats).  My son asked me to order him a pair."
1,Stay stuck in my ear well and dont jiggle like some brands i've tried.
0,Good earphones with good sound.<br />Problem is they didn't work at all after about a month.<br />I am not sure if I got a bad pair but they never lasted longer than two hours at a time while in the gym. Last time I used them I had just charged them and about 30 minutes into my workout they quit working. Now they won't even turn on. The charging light wont even come on when trying to charge. I would try them out again if the company tried to make it right and send me a different pair to try. If they won't then I would look elsewhere.
1,"I have a hard time getting buds to stay in. Maybe my ears are weird, but these work for me so I have purchased these as replacements. I like the brand. I like that they always include a little surprise extra thing in the package. . I’m am fine with the sound and the price is good.  I accidentally bought two and a good thing too because one set got tangled in my hair and the curved part got straightened out. And it would never hold a curve and fit over my ear again so the pair was useless. I’ve learned my lesson, and won’t do that again, but it is very irritating."
1,Reliable and nearly indestructible....had beats and they broke TWICE. Price point and quality are superb.
1,"Sound is really great, took a while to get used to the floppy ear hooks but now I use them all the time on my commute to work and when I run or workout"
0,"Used these a few times and then they would not connect at the gym (where I need to use them and why I bought them.)  I contacted SENSO and they recommended resetting to factory settings.  I tried it with no luck.  They then said that they would follow up on these &#34;defective&#34; headphones and arrange a replacement pair.  There has been no follow up and no responses to my emails since that promise.  They talked a good customer service story, but apparently do not honor their customer service promises.  This will be my last SENSO purchase."
1,These are very secure and sound quality is excellent
1,Great quality and they stay in your ears easily because of the comfortable clips. Comes with a full on car charger for your phone/headphones. Great buy.
1,My husband got these headphones and he absolutely loves them.  He can walk around the house or outside working on the car and he has great reception.  He also likes that they are noise canceling. He would order again.
1,I purchased a set 4 + months ago they worked well with music & with my phone batters lasted 3+ hus. only small issue was the cord attaching the head sets needs a clip I work construction and move my hands allot but you get use to them ;I bought another type with no cord connecting the set but they disconnected and shut down allot so I bought another set IPX7 due to how well the first set worked the only thing with these is over and over telling you they are connected
1,"I have only used these twice, and they seem to work just fine.  Took a few minutes to figure out how to get my phone to 'discover' the earphones, and the controls are very small, but once you get used to them, they seem to work just fine."
1,"Great, I bought some wireless Bluetooth earbuds for three times the price and they were crap. These for under $40 are awesome."
0,Here's a crazy idea: make a version WITHOUT a MIC. Whenever I am running outside or riding a bike all I hear is the static from the wind.
0,"I want to know how these got such a raving review!!??? I bought 2 pairs, and BOTH stopped working after 2-3 months.  Both pairs!!!!!  How have I somehow managed to attain the only two pairs of garbage, while everyone else received the best headphones imaginable.  Not happy.  Really not happy."
1,"great headphones!  Takes a little time to get comfortable ear placement. Sound quality excellent, comes with a case different ear pieces for ear comfort."
1,"Update: the company quickly responded and immediately rectified the problem. They are a reputable company and their customer service is OUTSTANDING! Don’t hesitate to get these well priced headphones. I previously owned Bose headphones which cost 3x what these cost. When I had a problem, they did not resolve it.<br /><br />I bought these headphones a little over 1 ‘month ago based on the great reviews. The headphones have stopped working and it looks like they are melting at the connection point were they charge."
1,"I have used these for a few days now, great sounding ear buds,  can't really comment on the battery life , as I am still on the first charge!"
1,"My daughter has the name brand that starts with a &#34;B&#34;.  She cannot believe thati paid about a 1/4 of what she paid for what she called as good or better sound.  Great base, great battery life, I can go 25 to 30 foot before loosing touch.  Awesome 🎧 headphones.!"
1,"I love it!  Sounds great, ear hooks soft and comfi."
0,"It is not comfortable to wear..it keeps falling off. I have tried several sizes, it all keeps falling off."
0,Bot these in February and they have stopped working and will not charge. Used outdoors and in occasional light rain they worked intermittently till giving up the ghost. Won't buy again
1,Comfortable and just as advertised!!
1,Good sound and fit but not enough low volume control with iPhone 7. Lowest volume is still pretty loud and I wish it could go lower...
1,"I like everything about these ear buds comfort,sound and the battery life is the longest I’ve ever had. They last 10 hrs or more. I listen to books on my kindle. I would recommend this item to anyone. This is my 2nd pair they have a great warranty so if something happens they replace them."
0,Used it a handful of times and threw it to a corner.... never to be used again. Sound quality is lower than any $5 set of earbuds I have used before. Doesnt sit well in the ears and is not as comfortable as some users are claiming. This review is based on the pisted price of $35.0
1,"Move over Beats! There is a new Bluetooth Headphone in town!!<br /><br />Holy smokes, for the price and quality these are FANTASTIC!!  Bought them first for my husband.  He loved them so much we bought two pairs for my kids. They loved them so much we then bought a pair for my mom for Mother’s Day!!<br /><br />Buy them for yourself or buy them<br />As a gift, you cannot go wrong!"
1,"I use these for running, work great; no bouncing and haven't come loose once. Also very easy to change volume and tracks just by reaching up to my ear for the button, great product!"
0,"Horribly uncomfortable design, buttons are unsecured and rattle while you run"
1,"I have had these wireless Bluetooth ear buds for 2 weeks now and they have very crisp, clear, louder than most for sound. The only thing so far that I find disappointing is the distance range that they lack; it seems less than 20ft from where my phone is set down. It is a little bit of a inconvenience if I need to walk 21 ft from my phone, the buds will beep out and &#34;hibernate&#34; until I walk over to my phone and hit the play button again, they will not automatically play again until this is done. Otherwise they are very comfortable to wear and do not fall out of my ears like most do (even my bose for high impact sports & runners fall out) when I am doing high activities such as running, jumping, etc."
1,Fairly happy. I alway push the bottom on the right earphone on accident when I'm putting them in my ear and I wish there were a few more varieties and sizes for the ear cover things
1,I am very pleased with my headphones.. The price was very reasonable and the company I bought them from has excellent customer service follow up. I highly recommend using this company
0,"Broke in 2 days. Won't sync and won't play music.<br />Quality is not worth the 40 dollars it's on sale for either.<br />Too bad, I was actually needing a sporty bluetooth head phone :/"
1,"The ear buds are so comfortable, stay in easily and sound quality is great! I've had mine a over a year..love them. Battery lasts forever, now wear or quality issues. Bought a pair for a gift.bgreat product!"
1,"The SENSO Bluetooth Headphone is a great value. The unit pairs easily with cell phones, computers, and other Bluetooth devices. The sound quality however appears to be to the base side. There is plenty of volume and the sound is very clear. There were no dropouts as far away as 30 feet with no walls in between. Wearing comfort is better then most units of this type. It comes with a variety of headphone tips to fit big and small ear canals. They are made of a soft rubber material that conforms to your ear canal in a very comfortable manor.<br />  The controls for volume, phone, track ahead or behind, and on off, are easily accessible on the right headphone. The phone functions appears to be adequate under most conditions.<br />  I haven't had a chance to run the unit at length to determine run time before battery recharge. I have used it probably 3 hours at one time and it still appeared to have charge left. Other then the sound being somewhat to the base side, the unit operates well, is comfortable, and clear sounding.<br />  I would recommend this unit to a friend."
1,"For the price,  these are a really good pair of headphones.  I work out in these regularly and the stay put in my ears really well.  They stay in place better than some of the more expensive brands.  I would recommend these to anyone.  I am also getting better than 8 hrs of battery life."
1,I have only had these a couple days but so far they work great. I am very pleased and would love to rate them again later because I have had several similar items(other brands) that didn't last very well. These seem very well made. Great for working out and will be great for mowing grass (and cancelling the noise!)
1,"I bought these headphones to replace a pair of Taotronic earbuds I had lost. First off the sound quality was less than I hoped it would be, but by no means bad. With such high reviews I just expected a little more.<br /><br />I've owned three different sets of bluetooth headphones/earbuds and I have to say these were the worst at keeping a signal. For example I used to be able to leave my phone in my room and roam the house with very few places where I would lose signal, and these could barely make it to the hallway, let alone say the kitchen. But the real kicker was the first time I took them out on a workout. If I put my phone in my left pocket while wearing these, just moving my leg would be enough for the signal to cut in and out.<br /><br />Now with those complaints, why give it three stars even? Well, if I was playing by &#34;its&#34; rules, as in keeping the phone in areas closer, or in the opposite pocket, they worked just fine. Not really any complaints. But it has gotten to the point where it's just enough of an annoyance I am looking into other brands."
1,"Reasons for my rating:<br />- Great sound quality<br />- Quick charge<br />- Good packaging<br />- High quality Bluetooth headphones for the price<br />- Easy to use<br /><br />One issue:<br />- ear piece is quite light, not always stationary"
0,"I've used them twice and the second time it plays about 10 seconds, double beeps and loses connection with my iPhone 7 right next to me. Terrible! Wasted my money!"
0,"The first pair I bought started out great, then the charge port ot messed up and would not allow me to charge them. I bought another pair<br />with intentions of returning the first pair, and ended up gving them to my daughter for her birthday. So, I then bought another pair and<br />after a month, the charging port is falling apart, and I am having a hard time charging them. Beside the faulty charging port, I just love them to death. If you send me a return label I will send both pair back for a replacement pair.<br />Julie Spradling<br />636 399 0892"
1,"I've been using these for weeks now, music and video sound great. Using the medium sized earbuds, they hurt a bit coming out after extended use, but much more comfortable than the other 3 options. Would buy again!"
0,"First pair stopped charging within 5 months. Sebastian at Senso as many ppl have mentioned in their reviews was great and they replaced the unit after weeks of waiting. Those burned while charging. I thought it was my wife who was cooking on the stove  too close to them.. assuming it could have been human error I ordered them again because you can’t beat the sound volume and charge time for 20 bucks. This new pair lasted one charge that they came with and then one more charge at home. As soon as the battery was dying I charged them again and when I went to use them again they had not charged nor could not be charged. Completely dead. Tried everything. I contacted amazon who listened to my experience and are shipping me a new pair overnight even though I’m passed the 30 day return and I told them that Senso take weeks to replace them.... i get it... 20 bucks or so is not that much and so we can only expect so much, but now every pair so far has stopped working well within the first 6 months... it would be better to just advertise them as the 20 buck Bluetooth headphones - you will most likely get your 20 bucks worth.... it’s crazy how many they have sold and how many reviews there are .... I assumed that so many positive reviews and qtys sold they would work and would be happy to buy a pair annually as I use them for the peloton only... it’s a sad world that all this fancy marketing and the amazon algorithm creates false value. They are just junk guys.... so what’s the answer? Spend 50 bucks, spend 70 bucks or spend 150 to 200 and get a branded name to which there are too many to list.... I don’t want to damage my AirPod pros or lose them while riding outdoors but will a pair that costs somewhere in the middle last longer than these ones? In the end rather attempt to find out with a slightly more expensive pair than this because as much as I want to see these work on the 4th pair something tells me they won’t.... you get what you pay for.... simple as that...."
1,"Very comfortable and they stay in. Sound is very good. I have Bose Soundsport and they don’t stay in as well as these. I would highly recommend, especially for the price I paid for these."
1,Lasted two months. One earphone stopped working.
1,Great sound great fit and great price.  Very easy to pair. Highly recommend and seller was very helpful.
1,"This product is best money you will ever spend in your life.<br />Pros<br />1.comfort is best in class<br />2.quality is top notch<br />3.sound is  very good<br />4. Pairing is easy and fast<br />5.battery life is very good and range is very decent .<br /><br />Cons<br />1.distance of range could be better<br />2.the pause button can be accidentally touched ,however not a real problem<br />3.charge time is a little slow .<br /><br />Bottom line run ..dont walk to amazon n get this product ...it puts beats and any other $100+ earbud to shame ..."
1,Amazing headphones! I've never used bluetooth headphones before and these were terrific for running.
1,"The headphones work very well, are comfortable and just as advertised. After a few months, they stopped working and customer support was excellent: first with suggestions on rebooting, and when that didn't work, replacement headphones sent out instantly, all with very quick email response. The product and customer support were both admirable."
1,Gift for my wife. She loves it.
1,They have good sound quality.  So far so good.
0,I used these almost daily for about 3 weeks until they stopped working. They would not turn on which is an apparent issue. I did enjoy them when did they work. I am a sad panda because I am unable to return the now unworkable pair back to the seller to get my money back for such a defective item. Grr.
0,"the design is great. they stay on my ears and feel very light. the sound quality is very poor, however. very tinny, and the bass rattles in your ears like old speakers in a car. i expected a little better for $36 headphones. i can only really listen to podcasts or audiobooks with these, the music sound is just too aggravating."
0,I liked these very much for the year i had them and they worked properly.. Now they will not connect to blue tooth on my phone or any device.
1,"when I first threw these on I realized they weren't going to fit my left ear (stage one microtia on my left ear ) but I threw on the large ear bud /eartip and just wrapped the ear hook a little farther back and it works better then the one for the right ear :) (you get three ear tips small, medium and large). I went from upset because of my funny ear to ecstatic because in the end it all worked out and the sound is great.  I'm able to run with them on and the sound is great. I'm listening to Paula Temple at Berghain which has a lot of bass and it sounds really awesome. Im not worried that one of these will fall out since they are connected by a wire. I'm very satisfied with this purchase, coolest toy I've gotten this year so far. Thank you for making a great product :)"
1,Reviews were not so good on more expensive brands. Reviews were great on Senso wireless earbuds. Senso was less than 40$. Beats were 200$. Thought I would give Senso a try. Ordered on amazon. Two days later I was enjoying my new earbuds. I like them a lot. Good sound. Easy to set up. Works great with iPhone or iPod. May order another for spare. Would highly recommend.
1,"Bought these for my college daughter. She LOVES them. She runs on the treadmill - or other equipment at the gym. Her phone doesn't have to be on her and the headphones pick up her music great and the sound is awesome. They stay on her ears, she doesn't mind the wrap around the ear, because it keeps them in place. I'm going to have to get myself some!"
0,The Bluetooth connectivity was absolutely terrible I had to hold my phone no more than 2 feet away from the headphones if I even attempted to put my phone in my pocket I lost connection completely
1,"Purchased these in headphones 8 months ago (3/8/17). Have logged hundreds of miles of pavement and trails with these in my ears. Great sound quality for all music types, as well as podcasts and audio books. Never had any issues with battery life.  With 20 mile training weeks, I get a few weeks of time per charge. Once the battery life beeping starts, you have less than a mile before they shut off. I always ensure a full charge before a big race in preparation for my uninterrupted motivational needs."
0,Unfortunately the unit I received must be defective compared to the other glowing reviews - there is some noise in the left earbud and the people I call say I sound &#34;far away&#34; or &#34;in a fog&#34; -  even after I made adjustments to the volume control on both the bluetooth earbud and my iPhone 6+.  Sadly the clarity is just not there.
1,The sound is great.
1,Good product for the price.
0,Volume buttons broke within 4 months. Should be still under warranty. Hope company provides free replacement.
1,"Not bad, but feels a bit bulky. I was actually expecting the wire that connects to two earbuds together to be round but instead it was flat because I brought another brand that had the flat wiring but eventually lost sound to one bud due to the flat wire being easily bent at the connection point of the earbuds when I work out. But other that it's not bad because they came with many extras like a magnetic phone holder for your car and a credit card holder sleeve for your phone too. Fingers crossed that this headphones with the same type of flat connecting wires will hold up for my daily gym use."
1,"Incredible headphones, especially for active people. I use these at the gym and on my runs (lasting over an hour) and they don't slip or come loose. Their sturdy but very comfortable to wear, Bluetooth that easily pairs, and they have as good or better sound as any headphones I've tried. Great Buy!"
1,"This is the third headset by this manufacturer/ brand/ model that I have purchased and it keeps getting better!!! The sound quality is amazing, the receiving quality on the other end is great , and the latest headset allows me to form the earpiece around my ear in lieu of it having a set shape. So, it becomes customized to my ear. Battery will last the day.<br /><br />I listen to a lot of music at work and audiobooks/ YouTube videos in addition to phone calls. You must recharge the battery daily.<br /><br />Bottom line, the best $30 wireless headphones I have purchased (because I have either lost or my kids have eaten the others!)"
1,These work well and the controls are simple and responsive.  Very pleased with purchase
0,"Muddy sound and a volume level that goes from nothing to high instantly. The sound these headphones produced is far from &#34;HD&#34;. I listen to indie rock, electronica, the standards, jazz, etc... all sounded muffled and heavy. A number of reviews said these were a much better buy than Beats. Well, I've never owned a pair of Beats headphones but just about everybody knows you buy Beats as a fashion accessory to wear around your neck and not for superior sound. So that's a bad comparison to make.<br /><br />The only positives of these headphones is the design which is perfect if you run, jog or whatever excercise/cardio you do that involves a lot of body movement - they will stay in place. Headphones with the controls on one side of the cords tend to jostle around.<br /><br />The quality of the materials is very good as well as the packaging. But in the end, if your headphones sound horrible, then it doesn't matter how good everything else is. I ended up going with a $15 pair that may have a more hollow sound but at least it's tolerable."
0,I had a pair of $150 beats headphones that these look like and the Senso headphones are really good and well priced alternative. I did have and issue with the battery. Fortunately they got back to me quickly about it and are sending out a replacement.
1,"These headphones are just what I need.  When I workout at the gym, what I need is a headphone that doesn't damage when I sweat.  I'm looking forward to experience this today."
1,I love these! They connect immediately everyday and fit great!
1,+Good battery life<br />+Perfect for small ears<br />+Stays in my ears during long runs<br />+Good sound really cancels out sound!<br />The only negative was that I would hear the wind blowing against my headphones on windy days. Other than that they are great.
1,"I needed a pair of inexpensive waterproof Bluetooth buds so I could listen to music in my hot tub and hear the music over the jets and not aggregate my neighbors with my choices of music late at night.  These are perfect and will serve my needs. Sound quality is very good, obviously not like my Bose headphones, but my Bose can not accompany me in the hot tub.  Ccol additional goodies that came with,  3 pair of ear tips so you get that perfect fit, obviously the charging usb cord, since little carrying case, a wire tie, a cellphone card wallet and last but not least a magnetic cellphone car vent mount.  I’m actually really impressed with the sound quality of these headphones  at this extremely reasonable price!"
0,"These headphones will not hold a charge after a handful of weeks.  First 2 weeks, they would hold a charge for about 5 -6 hours of use.  Thereafter, the charge quickly dropped to about 2.5 hours.  Only 6 weeks after purchase, they will not hold a charge."
0,Poor sound quality. Bulky and uncomfortable. Not what I expected from the reviews.
1,"Buds are comfortable and have great sound.<br />They are a little bulkier than I thought they would be, but they're light.<br />With the exception of my ear-covering headphones, these are by far the best headphones I've owned."
1,Good sound and grips the ears really well when I’m working out or doing projects around the house
1,Love them but the mic is not as clear and echos a little.
1,"Love the product and works as advertised.  Customer service is prompt, professional, and very helpful!"
1,"Only used them twice and very happy with these headphones. Great sound, easy to use, more functions than you'd expect from headphones, fit perfectly, I can't imagine that I'll have any complaints in the next few years."
1,OK
0,Not understanding all the positive reviews. I wanted to like these so much and the sound quality is great and they fit great too!  But I cannot even put my phone in my back pocket without the Bluetooth cutting in and out. And I know it is the headphones because I connected to previous headphones just fine and other items like a speaker.
1,Running on treadmill they do not skip like other headphones.
0,I received unit yesterday. ON-OFF button stop working same day. Bad product
1,These are awesome. The sound quality and battery life are excellent for a value-priced pair of buds. I work out with them daily (and sweat all over them) and still never have a problem. Will absolutely own a second pair for the gym versus home workouts.
0,returned it
0,headphones wont turn on any more. I only had them for 3 months.
1,"These wireless headphones with mic are great.  They're great for listening music or podcast.  They are also very  good for use one conference calls, the mic is much better than others I've used."
1,Battery lasts for hours and the sound quality is great.  I've worn them in the rain on long runs and still work great.
1,"Just opened these and will let you know more once I use them at the gym. The sound seems reasonable for what they are.  Comes with two different chargers, 3 different size earbuds, well written instructions, and a Nice carrying case.  Super easy to pair with the phone."
1,I just received my ear buds and have used them for a couple of days and I'am very pleased so far. It came in a beautiful package and I love the ease of use and the water resistance of them. Thank you!
0,"These headphones are AWEFUL! These headphones are a total gimmick. They give you a lot of accessories to distract you from the overall poor quality. First, the sound quality is awful so they compensate with extra base. Second, none of the ear bud sizes fit. Third, the over ear loops were so big and awkward they didn't even touch my ears or prevent the head phones from falling out. Fourth and finally, they broke in less than a week! Getting these headphones was a waste of time."
1,Great price. The sound quality is pretty good.  Haven't had any trouble with the battery life. Use them when walking/exercising or working in the yard.  Would buy them again.
0,"I had to return, they did not fit my ears and they fell off easily."
1,"Got these on a humbug and they turned out to be excellent. Fit great in my ear, and I have owned expensive Jaybird's and all. As a matter of fact I believe in my review history I have purchased Jaybirds from here. Anyway.....These sound great. Bass is hitting and it's loud enough to hear while mowing the grass. I'm definitely feeling these!"
1,After a brief learning curve I was pleasantly surprised and the quality and output of these speakers. I will give them a test by working out but can see they are pretty damn great. More than likely would give them out as a nice gift.
1,"It's currently September 2019, I bought these in November 2018. I bought these to use at the gym and running. They still work amazing after using it everyday and holds up to sweating. Haven't loss any quality in sound and hardware. The earphones stay in my ear without having to adjust. The battery works great. I work out for an hour and I can use these for 5-6 consecutive days in the gym. Since I use it only for this purpose, it's a great product for me and for the price. For relaxing, I prefer wired earphones because of the amazing quality that you just can't beat. Hope this helps someone."
1,I've had these for a year now. They still work great and hold the charge for about two days. Other wireless headphones I owned in this price range died within 3-6 months. Highly recommend these!
1,Stopped working after one year.  After one year warranty it started to have a bad connection and to shut off automatically. They were good headphones while they worked.  Now trash.
0,Looses connection constantly
1,These are great earbuds for the price. I've used them quite a bit now and they have great sound and are very rugged
1,Like these a lot
1,5*
1,Best tou will find for the price
1,Works great!
1,Very comfortable I have used them for about 6 hours and really do not feel any discomfort. The sound is very good.
1,Great headphones. Not too expensive either. Would recommend.
1,Just completed my first run with these and they worked flawlessly!  The sound is a bit bass heavy but throwing the iOS &#34;flat&#34; EQ on cleaned up my rock tracks nicely.  They don't really hold a candle to my Shure ES215s but for wireless sports headphones at this price I really can't complain.  If you're used to running with 215s you won't really notice a huge difference in sound while running...and if you do...run harder :D
1,"Sound, price, customer service and comfort are awesome. My wife has a set of beats that cost 4 times as much and she is always trying to steal mine. My first pair had connection issues. Customer service tried to help fix the problem and when that didn't work I had a new pair delivered two days later!!"
0,"I bought my first pair and they were ok. Paired with macbook pro and iphone just fine. Calls were terrible as described by others, the people on the other end of the phone couldn't hear me at all, so do not use these for calls. Then after a bit the left earbud started buzzing. It was a constant buzzing that was super annoying. I contacted the seller and they were nice and sent me a free replacement. After a few months the right earbud started being super quiet compared to the left. I tried factory resetting it and unpairing and repairing and also fully charging several times. No change. These are just horrible quality earbuds. If you want to get these cheap ones, there are much cheaper options around $10. But just get something nicer or name brand. THESE ARE HORRIBLE"
1,This ise my first wireless earphone. Seems to be a pretty good wireless earphone at this price. Sound quality is at par but could have been better. It does a pretty good job at noise cancellation. Yet to test the battery backup. Overall a satisfying buy.
1,Great pair of headphones. Setup was very easy. The extras that came with it went great. Unfortunately I didn't get the wire tie in the Box so I'll need to reach out on that. But I would highly recommend
0,"I thought I loved it, until it stopped working six months after purchase."
1,"I got these as a gift for my boyfriend. He loves them! They have good sound quality, charge quickly, and the soft ear pieces are awesome."
1,"Awesome product!<br />Excellent while running long distance - very comfortable, light weight, and these have incredible sound quality.<br />very pleased with this purchase."
1,"As a Bose Snob, I have to say I am so happy with my Senso wireless headphones, I just bought a pair for my husband and a second pair for me. I finally went wireless when I discovered the iPhone 6 jack has a problem so that my $200 Bose, noise cancelling headphones had a lot of static noise and didn't work on the right ear. I love that Senso lasts eight hours as I listen to White Noise or sleep music all night long to block out my hubby's snoring.  But, it only takes 90 minutes to fully recharge.  It's also easier to exercise with as the wire doesn't get caught up and I can put my phone in the pack when I ride my bike vs my pocket where it occasionally falls out.  Senso is also inexpensive enough to buy more than one pair so while one pair is charging I have another pair ready to go for my early morning exercise sessions. Next generation: waterproof for swimming please and a bit more noise canceling."
0,"I had reviewed these head phones probably after having them a few weeks but by the 3rd month i had to have them replaced becaus they wouldn't hold a charge.  The company was very responsive and good about replacing them.  However the second pair only lasted a month before it completely stopped working.  So I am retracting my previous review which is below:<br />Headphones are pretty good.  Sound quality is great, they don't tangle and they fit comfortably. Only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because I never know how much battery life I have left.  I wish when you either turned it off or on the voice would inform you. Otherwise I love them."
1,"I bought these just for the gym thinking if these cheap headphones break soon, no big deal. I have had these for some time, the quality is surprisingly great. Cant believe that for 25 bucks I god such good quality. awesome case, looks like a very expensive pair of head phones. Again I'm was blown away by the sound quality. will definitely buy these as presents."
1,Great sound!!
1,I'm really impressed with the quality of my new Senso Bluetooth earbuds.  I use mine for working out and the music quality is crisp and clear.  The ear loops keep them in place and the different tips make for a comfortable fit for me.  The buttons on top are small but I set mine up and use my watch to control songs and volume so that's not a concern for me.  I noticed Senso has another model with a larger red multi function button which you might consider if this is a concern for you.  I love the carrying case that I can slip in my gym bag and protect my earbuds when I carry them.  Also appreciate getting two charging cords and a car charger.  My friend told me he uses his Senso earbuds for running marathons because the battery doesn't die.  The only thing I wonder about is the rubber cover over the charging port.  It seems a bit flimsy and I wonder how it will hold up.  I'm very happy with my purchase.  I never expected this quality for the price.
1,"Decent earbuds but unfortunately won’t stay connected to my Apple Watch Series 1, especially in the gym where there’s lots of other people using Bluetooth in close proximity. Returning."
1,"OK.  So I have used another company for wireless headphones that is popular on Amazon.  The other brand seemed to break most of the time.  I would contact the company and they would replace the product. Their customer service department is great and always makes sure the customer is happy. I do applaud them for that.  It seemed strange that this seemed like a normal cycle for that company.  I even wrote an email to the company asking why their products fail most of the time.  After the last wireless earphone break I decided to go another route.  I love to run and needed dependable headphones that would not die on me while on a trail. The SENSO earbuds had good reviews and fit my needs.  They are wireless and do nat have the control hanging on a cord which is important for comfort.  The flexibility of SENSO buds is great too.  The only minor downside is the bass is high and there is some wind noise.  I corrected this by just going up a size with ear pieces.  Now the bad part....I wanted to go for a run yesterday.  I get ready to go and wham, headphones will not turn on.  I made sure they were charged (which they were) and tried again.  The headphones would not cooperate.  I am very frustrated at the level of quality of the headphones.  I thought I had a winner and I had invested in a good product until yesterday.  I will be contacting the company in the hope that this can be remedied."
1,"I have tried all types of headphones to workout in. Some are too heavy and fall out of ear while running and some are horrible in sound. This is the first time I purchased this brand but so far am satisfied with the feel, the weight, and the sound. Fits snug in the ears for cardio workouts and that is what I was really looking for, along with quality of sound."
1,Very affordable for the sound
1,They were a gift for my son...he loves them.  I bought two more for gifts :-)
1,"They work pretty well. The voice saying &#34;on&#34;, &#34;off&#34;, and &#34;connected&#34; is a nice touch when they work.  However, if on power up you don't get the &#34;connected&#34; voice note, it will still pickup the audio after another 5-10 seconds."
1,I was surprise of the long lasting battery this product has. Very decent sound. Comfortable ear fit. This headphone are probably one of the best value-for-money in the market.
1,"Very easy to use, and they sound much better than my last headphones.  I'm very happy with them."
1,These were great until one side of the phones stopped working.
1,These are lightweight and dont bother my ears. great sound quality. Very user friendly for changing volume and pausing the sound also. Syncs quickly with my Ipod.
1,"So far so good, they're more comfortable than I thought, nice sound,but a little bigger than I thought"
1,"High-class product, recommend!"
1,I love these!!! Great sound quality and they fit comfortably!
1,My friend had a pair and I loved them. So I bought two pairs. One for myself and one for my daughter.
0,Had to return two pair.  First one audio cut in and out so bad there was no point.  Second pair worked twice the third time same thing audio in and out.  Only used them while walking for 30 minutes each time.  Am going to find a different brand for a third try.
1,good headphones.
1,"great product for working out and running"""
1,"I did not have much expectations from these headphones, but surprisingly they are awesome!!!<br /><br />Highly recommend!!"
1,Headphones work great. High quality at a low costs.
1,Love my headphones
1,Better than my powerbeats!!!!! Hands down. Louder!!  Thank you for the fair price
1,"I've used these twice so far and they are doing great. They stay in my ears when I run and when I use them to talk on the phone, the other person can clearly hear me."
1,I used them in the gym for the first time today.  Fantastic product and great value.  Well done Senso folks!
1,Fantastic value!
1,"I really like these I have bought some other ones off amazon before and didn't last very long I hope these will last longer, other than that great quality, awsome sound the bass on these is amazing, very good material even came with a longer chanrging cord and car charger so far the best ones I've purchased."
1,"These Senco wireless headphones are really good, easy to set up, very good sound and fit my ears perfectly! I have no problem highly recommending for everyone!"
1,Good sound on the speakers.  However while on the phone most people could not hear me well.  I do not recommend them for a phone
1,"Music sounded good most of the time, but the Bluetooth connection wasn’t great with a new iPhone 8.  Using it as a phone headset was about the same."
1,These headphones are exactly what I was looking for and more!  I listen to music from the time I get to work to just before I leave so I needed headphones that would last for the whole day and these definitely fit the bill.  They charge quickly (fully within an hour and a half) and while listening to music and taking multiple calls throughout the day.
1,these are fantastic wireless headphones have enjoyed them very much
1,Work very well. Good battery life and easy to use
1,"These headphones aren't bad for the price. The reason for 3 stars is they are not adjustable to fit around ears, which I has small ears so they don't fit well. The bud that fit in the ear are great. I love the memory foam ones. Only other downside is I loss connection easier then I would have thought. I just turn my head and it drops out. Also the cord behind the head gets snagged on my shoulder and pulls the other side out easily while biking. But like I said they are not bad for the price. Sound is good."
1,"Great headphones, great price.  I had to use different sized earbud caps in each of my ears to keep them from falling out, but at least these came with several sizes to choose from.  The piece that fits over your ear is very loose, but it isn't an issue.  The volume is loud though, even when it is on the lowest setting."
1,These headphones sound great.  I had others and they don't compare.  Definitely recommend these!!!
1,"First time using these earbuds at the gym today. So far, so good!! No complaints!!"
1,"TOTALLY AWESOME!  I'm blown away by the quality and sound. Tremendous bass, I use them everyday. One note I haven't​ seen;  I thought there was an issue with connectivity until I realized after 3 days that I was connecting in my house when I leashed my dog for his daily walk and when I got about a hundred feet away from my house and lost my Wi-Fi signal I heard temporary connection loss<br /> until until I connected to a mobile network​. That's definitely a technology issue, and definitely not an issue with this product!!!"
1,I have tried many different wireless earbuds and for the money these are really good. Sound is good and they are quite firm won't fall out easily
0,Multifunction button to hard to get a work and the most uncomfortable ear piece. Not good for long periods of wearing. On the other hand it's sweat resistance makes it great for my sweaty morning walk. I would not buy another one.
1,"After reading the great reviews I bought 2 pairs since I knew husband would love them too. We are both very happy with this purchase. On some songs the base seems a bit gritty but it's not a deal breaker by any means. We are very happy. I switched to the smaller removable earpiece and it fits like a charm and stays in place while I work out. Happy with them and the value, very nicely packaged. I recommend."
0,"These are extremely uncomfortable but function very well.  Unfortunately, because they are so uncomfortable, I can't stand to wear them long at all."
0,Horrible product.
1,received them on time and they are just as I expected.
1,Love them for working out. Holds to ears during any activities
1,Fit perfectly. Great sound.
1,Fit relatively well but do occasionally fall off the ears.
1,"For the price, these headphones are great. Good sound, sweat proof and are perfect for accompanying me on a run or at the gym. I would have given them a 5 if it weren't for a couple of things. The loops on the ear are a bit too tall for my smaller ears, so I wish they could be adjusted in some way, as well as smaller ear buds. They do come with different sizes, but I have really small ears, so I struggle with most headphones. This is not a knock on the brand at all. The other thing is that after about 7 months of use, the left earbud went out. Normally, this would be very frustrating, but I used these bad boys hundreds of hours, and abused them. Like, I would just wad them up and throw them in a pocket or bag, so I would expect even the best headphones to make it through that. But where they absolutely receive a 5-star rating is their customer service. These headphones are covered under a 1-year warranty. I told them that the left headphone went out, and they first tried to help me fix the problem myself, but after that didn't work they replaced them no questions asked. So, if you need some good workout headphones, you won't find a better product for the price, and I've tried more than a dozen different headphone (both bluetooth and not, over the ear and in ear) and these were by far the best for the money."
1,Great headphones and great customer service!
1,I could not believe the symphonic quality I am getting from these SENSO Bluetooth Headphones.  It is truly amazing.  Thank you SENSO
1,"I love these!!!! I am big into running, and I've bought numerous ear phones. I've tossed earphones that have been cheap and stopped charging, or they continued to fall out of my ears during runs.<br /><br />The biggest issue is finding earphones that STAY in your ears during runs. These stay and I don't even notice that they are there. If you're a runner, or you casually workout or just need something for the yard then these are a must have. You can't beat the price and the quality of sound they produce!"
1,"Lightweight, good sound, easy to pair the the bluetooth"
1,"I was hesitant to buy these because I have terrible luck with in-ear headphones, but gave these a shot. Went for a 3 mile run the day I got them and was very pleased with the overall performance. In the beginning it seemed like there were some connection issues as some songs skipped a bit, but that went away after a few minutes and has not happened since. Very glad I purchased these headphones!"
1,These are the best headphones ever! I purchased them for listening to music while stocking at work and they are exactly what I needed. Basic ear buds hurt my inner ear after a while and these are super comfortable. I wasn't expecting them to be so great for the price but they exceeded my expectations!
0,Item worked well for 2 weeks. Then earbud piece broke off from the rest of the left earphone. Will try to return the item even though I no longer have the original packaging.
1,They are better than you expect for sub-$50 headphones. Everything works as advertised. So far I have used them for weightlifting and some light cross-training. The earbuds haven't budged when sweating. I'll have to update the review the next time I jog but They seem pretty stable in my ears so far. I also haven't tested the call quality as I try to ignore calls while working out.
1,"Sound is as good as they said it would be. Matter of fact, these earebuds have worked better than expected. The negitive is mine is still under the 1 year nanufactor warranty, plus I bought an extended 2 year. I am unable to get in touch with the shipper or Amazon for help. Shipper says go through Amazon, and Amazon said go through shipper. Crazy!"
1,Been using for approximately one year at 3 to 5 times a week with only a few weeks off.  Still works great.
1,"I've been using these for more than 3 years, and I haven't found a better pair! For the price you pay, it's a great deal. Great sound quality, pairs easily, good battery life and device lifetime. I'm actually going to buy another pair now, and decided to review them after having such good use over the last 3 years. One slight minus is that the chord is a little long and the right ear fitting doesn't seem to be as good as the left ear (but maybe that's because of my ear, and not the device?) . Regardless, still an amazing purchase and good value for money!"
0,"Disappointed for sure. I had considerable trouble keeping these in while running. The bend around the ear is exaggerated (I don’t think my ears are that small), which only helps to pull the headphones out when moving around. Still worked as decent, noise canceling headphones at my desk during work. Recently on a trip to Japan the headphones broke while in my backpack along with some notebooks and work supplies."
0,"These Senso wireless earbuds had surprisingly good sound for such an inexpensive item. They were so loud, in fact, that I actually kept the volume on my iPod turned down to the minimum while I used these for working out. That said, I always found the flat cable between them a little awkward, as it would never lay flat and always seemed to want to move to one side or another. It also, because of the nature of it being flat, would hold the shape from having been in the (nice) hard case, which also prevented it laying flat.<br /><br />The most disappointing thing was that, after less than a year of use, it suddenly started just skipping songs randomly. A song would start, and just a few seconds in, my iPod would jump to the next song, as if I had pressed the button on the right earbud. It would sometimes do this multiple times in a row and then stop on its own. As well, the volume up button on the earbud now seemed stuck (and I don't abuse these - just normal use during workouts) so that it doesn't press in or click like the volume down button does. Unfortunately, customer support was even more disappointing. I contacted them in November and they promptly replied apologizing for the trouble and asking for pictures to be passed on to the warranty department. I sent the pictures the same day and have not been able to get a response from anyone there since. Needless to say, I will not be recommending nor buying any Senso products in the future."
1,Great set of wireless headphones!!! I've only had them for a couple of weeks but so far i am very pleased with my purchase!!
1,"Easy to charge.East to put on your ears plus they come with,different size of buds.i love my buds. They are the best ever for me"
1,These are my second pair of these headphones and they are the best for the money hands down. Great distance with the Bluetooth and security around the ears means no problem running with them. Excellent customer service and speedy problem resolution. I highly recommend them.
1,Bound with the transmitter fine. Not bad comfort wise. Sound is good.
1,Great product for the price. Sound quality is great.
1,"Headphones with great sound quality that worked well for a couple of months. Unfortunately, my headset started to cut out while my phone was in my hands or to the side on the floor while I would bench press. Fortunately, their customer service is absolutely superb and have sent out a replacement! I'd highly recommend the company as they hold themselves accountable for their products."
0,I got it but it doesn't work didn't even come on think this one is defective 😕
1,"PLEASE READ ENTIRE REVIEWSo I'm purchasing my second pair today. Not because there was anything wrong with the first pair, I just rolled over them with my desk chair yesterday and although they still work, I had to glue a piece back on so I'd rather just go ahead and buy another pair. So the review, before these headphones I owned a pair of Bose, and 3 pair of Beats by dre... all of which broke or shorted out within 6 months of purchase. I use headphones primarily for the gym and I cycle to and from work. I am a VERY heavy sweater and that has been a major problem with other headphones ( BOSE, BEATS, Panasonic, ect) because the volume control and microphone  for those were on the cable connecting the two headphones so all of them ended up shorting out after a few months of use. With these the controls are on the side of the eadbud itself. I used these from the end of May 2017 until yesterday (Oct 3 2017) and I never had a single issue with them, EVER. the sound quality is as good as BOSE and the BEATS were. That is why I am buying a second pair."
1,Excellent sound quality. Comfortable to wear.
1,"I purchased these in 2018, used them at them gym 4 days per weeks, washed them 5 times by mistake, lost them and didn't charge them for a month and they still performed flawlessly.  The 6th wash in hot water with bleach finally killed them but got them for $15 in a flash sale so got more than my moneys worth and will buy these again"
1,I bought these in 2017 and still use them every night at work. They don’t last 8 hours anymore die after about 6 1/2 hours but still 100% better than beats. I will definitely buy them again.
1,"I am over the moon. It's been many years, but I've finally found comfortable earphones for my TINY ears. No matter what other earphones advertised, they always hurt after a few minutes. But these are comfortable and clear -- over an hour walk with wind and exertion, I didn't have to adjust the earphones once, and even with wind making sound on the outside of the earphones, the podcast was clearly audible. Excellent."
1,"Great battery life, sound quality. And a great price !!"
1,"Love these headphones!  They work great while I run and are light weight!  I had an issue a few days ago where they stopped syncing with my phone.  I contacted their customer service, they responded very quickly and gave me step-by-step instructions to reset them (super easy and quickly solved the issue)."
1,My daughter likes them and glad she doesn't have to get tangled in wires leading to her iPhone.
1,Very good sound and very comfortable. I like the ear clips as they stay in much easier than just plain ear buds.
1,"I needed to record audio to a slide deck course I am selling, and these headphones worked very nicely. I had to drop the blinds in my windows to lessen the reverberation of my voice, buy after doing so, the recording was great.<br />As such, not only are the ear buds good for listening, but the mic is first rate too!!!"
1,"Fantastic warranty and customer service.  I wear these all day, every day.  I had a button failure from so much use.  I received a replacement set very quickly.<br /><br />I love the 8 hr battery.  I have other Bluetooth headsets with far less battery life. Excellent call quality and easy integration with phone."
1,Comfortable fit and good price
1,Love them :)
1,"Great purchase so far so good. Comfortable fit, Easy to connect and clear sound. That's all I asked for. Still early hope they last long."
0,"The ear pieces that wrap around your ears do not fit very well at all. I bought these because of the great reviews, but they are not worth the $30.00 that I paid for them. They are inconsistent being paired to an iPhone 8 plus - many times they have to be turned on and off in order for them to pair to the phone. I was hoping for something that would fit better. I am using the largest inner ear pieces and those are comfortable. But the rubber ear wraps were bowed towards the outside and do not wrap around my ear."
1,These are great headphones.. Love them!
0,These headphones will not hold a charge anymore. They worked great when they were alive but they're dead now. I've tried different cords for charging and nothing.
1,"Bought a set 6 months ago, lost them on vacation this summer.  Bought another brand at big box retail store for almost 50% higher price.  Noticed a big drop off in sound quality and fit.  I went back to Amazon and ordered another Senso set.  Very glad I did.  This headphone is a tremendous value"
1,Arrived on time am very satisfied
1,"I have been using these for a little over 2 years and I love these things. I'm a fan of bass in Bluetooth headsets and these definitely deliver that. Enough bass to make the two Bluetooth earbuds I've bought after these feel like they are just weak.<br /><br />Even with the two earbuds I bought after this I still come back to these. I use them for the gym and I prefer the convenience of wrapping these headphone around my neck vs needing to put them in my pocket with earbuds that are not connected.<br /><br />Great battery life, I believe I get around 6-9 hours on these things. Can't beat this for the price. Its not professional crisp sound quality, but has more than enough force to be used casually and focus in the gym."
1,Great job and wonderful customer service.  Love the earbuds and the price.  Thanks for a great product.
1,Love the headphones!
1,Guys these headphones are great worth the 30 buck or whatever u spent on these but my thing is the warranty I bought a 4 year warranty e these things and idk how to get a replacement for these can anyone help me out
1,"Great headphones! They're very light, and they fit perfectly. They even came with a car charger that works with my iPhone."
1,pretty good wish the ear thing was not as flimsy cause it just dangles.
1,Fits comfortable and sounds awesome
1,He loves them. Thank you.
1,Very easy to sync good sound quality.  Fits well.
1,"So far so good... have used my new SENSO headphones 3 or 4 times with no issues. Their volume, connectivity, and comfort are excellent."
1,"Great value, easy to use."
0,"The flap that goes over your ear is so flimsy, I wish i would have known that. I wouldn't have bought it."
1,Order these earbuds for a new phone that has Bluetooth only. I tried two other types of earbuds and neither were the quality of these. I'm very happy. Don't hesitate to order!
1,These sound great even while I'm mowing my lawn.
1,"These are hands down the absolute best bang-for-buck earbuds under 40 dollars.<br />They have a plethora of great features(including the ability to use in the shower as well). I participate in the repossession of vehicles, and these got stepped on, and seemed ok. Later that week, I went for a run, and sometime during the run, the volume rockers fell off. I messaged senso, and the same day, a new pair were on the way!<br />A great purchase with a great warranty!"
1,Great sound for the price. Use them at the gym no problem with falling out. Delivered quickly as promised.
1,"Great price, quick delivery, can't beat the quality for the price."
0,"I was first attracted to the price of these bluetooth earbuds; however, upon the first listen, I knew I was 100% dissatisfied. The audio is poor and has little to no bass--mostly treble tracks are heard. On top of it all, there was audio feedback/white noise during moments of no audio playing (i.e. between tracks, while on pause, etc.). Purchase returned same day."
1,"The headset ear supporters are too large for my ears, and when attempting to return there's a return fee. It's cheaper to keep them, overall quality is great, just tends to shake loose when I am doing cardio."
1,Work great. good quality sound and fit in my ears wirhout loosening up.
1,"Loved them, but laid them down and they walked away....sticky fingers now love these instead of me"
0,"Sound- Comparable to Beats.<br />Fit- In ear fit was great. Over ear hook was very loose. Still, stayed on during running.<br />Wouldn't adjust volume on my Galaxy S8, or let me answer calls. Meh, annoying but not deal-breaker.<br />Cost-effective alternative to Beats, but after 2 months the earphone completely broke off. Since I can't be sure how it happened I don't want to leave 1 star, but still seems like I didn't get $30 worth of wear."
1,"They stay on, sweat resistant, have great sound and the battery life is fantastic. I bought two pair, one for home and one for work."
1,"The sound is excellent for the price, no lag, fit well.  I would recommend these for those who want a great set of ear plugs for a down-to-earth price."
1,Love these.....flew on plane and listened to movies as well as clear calls when I landed.  Works great.
1,"So far so good. The accessories alone are worth the bargain price for a bluetooth headphones. The sound is good, fit is nice, and is comfortable, too."
1,Best value for product
1,"Great headphones for the price!<br /><br />All things considered, this is a decent pair of bluetooth headphones. I don't have any issues with them falling out when I run; I barely notice that I'm even wearing them.<br /><br />The sound quality is good enough and the build quality isn't bad. It does a good job of cancelling most noise out.<br /><br />The manual said it was supposed to come with a 'Wire Tie' (see attached picture), but mine didn't. No big deal since it's not necessary to use the product.<br /><br />I'm very happy with this purchase!"
0,Terrible product. It worked fine for first few weeks and then started having connectivity issue with my iphone 7+. I bought it considering it had great reviews but may be they are fake reviews. Now it is probably too late to return these. Sellers like Tekatron are fleecing amazon customers by selling sub-standard products and getting fake reviews.
1,"The instruction guide is a little hard to follow. not a big problem, but it's a little confusing"
1,Great battery life. Comes with a good selection of accessories.<br />But the audio quality is really underwhelming. A $6 panasonic wired earphones sound leaps and bounds better than this.
1,"Really easy to use, and very comfortable to use. They block out the noise, and the sound quality is great."
1,It's been three weeks now with no issues! I am happy that I could fin these for under $50!  I used to have a pair that hung on my neck which drove me crazy now I feel free :-)
1,Good sound. Good value at the discounted price. Batter doesn't last as long as I would like  I would recommend them.
1,Excellent fit and quality material & sound.
1,"The fit is great, I have very sensitive ears and this one is so comfortable I can wear it for hours and no pain or discomfort. It really is a good product. The battery life is also very good, so far I haven't had a problem with it."
1,Excellent sound and fit.Appear to be well built.Highly recommended.
0,"I bought this ear phone after reading all the reviews and with a lot of expectation. The product I got is faulty with only the right ear piece working and left one is faulty, no sound from the left ear piece at all. Very disappointed !!!"
1,Great product own 3 sets
1,"I've had these for a month now and they are definitely worth the money.  Fit is good and the hooks keep them on my ears where other buds fall out.  The sound is very good, also.  I'd buy another set without a second thought"
1,"my dad will love them! sleek, easy to use, good for working out!"
1,These headphones  are great especially for active people. They are waterproof and work well. The sound quality is amazing and the noise cancellation is excellent.<br /><br />The problem lies within the engineering of the earplugs themselves. After 4 months of owning these there was a shortage in the wiring. After receiving a replacement there was a problem with charging them. The light wouldnt turn on so I was unaware when they were fully charged.<br /><br />This company has received over $35 of mine. If I don’t receive my new replacement than I’m moving on to give another company business.
1,I really like these and how they fit but is it normal for the left side volume to be lower than the right?I've tried settings and the left side volume just doesn't equal out with the right.
1,"best headphones i have ever had, great for sports...delivered quickly and I love the packaging ...I got 2 pairs"
1,"Nice headphones. I looked at several different pairs of headphones and decided to get these. I’m glad I did so far.<br />Pros: good sound, easy to connect, comfortable with many different tips, great charging cable and case, the over the ear piece is moldable.<br />Cons: the buttons are challenging at first, the charging port is hard to get to and the little plastic piece broke off the 2nd time I charged them, the led indicator is hard to see(a pro & con) and there is a special code for the blinking lights that you are supposed to remember.<br />Overall they are a great pair of headphone. My favorite part is the red cushion tips provided. They are great for fitting in your ear and then expanding to block out noise."
1,"Actually I was more than pleasantly surprised by the quality of these earbuds. I purchased these for myself after Christmas as I had purchased very expensive buds for my sons, and knew I did not need Beats or Jaybirds for my needs. I really expected less due to the price.  Do not hesitate to purchase this item. Crisp clear balanced sound, very comfortable (I am a woman and I have small ears) the fit is good, super easy to pair with one or more of your devices. It took less than 5 minutes to pair to both my iphone and my ipad.  I have not received a call while wearing them, so I really cannot comment on the quality of the mic, the noise cancellation or ease of accepting calls. I do expect it to be equally as good as the sound quality."
1,So glad that I purchased these headphones. They are just what I was looking for. They are very easy to operate and the Bluetooth is easy to connect as well. Going to purchase another pair as a gift for Father's Day to give to my hubby.
1,"I am brutal on headsets.  I average 40-60 hours/week using them with phone, text transcripts and audiobooks.  My headsets usually break or lose functions w/in 3 months.  I bought this Senso waterproof headset w/ my 1st additional warranty on July 10, 2017 expecting it to die.  To my surprise, in addition to regular work related use, it lasted over 9 months of heavy outdoor use in rain, pools, rafting, jogging, etc.  It still works great for listening to audio.  The only intermittent issue is that its microphone was coming in too faint for people on the phone line to hear well on some phone calls.  Since most of my work is done over the phone, this wasn't good.  I emailed Senso and they sent me a replacement.  I still have the old one for a back up and am using it now.<br /><br />It is by far the most resilient, comfortable, multipurpose headset I've owned of at least 15 that I've used.  The range is about 15-30 feet which is the same as other headsets and likely a bluetooth limit.  The over ear fit is great for running, lifting, rafting, etc.  Unless you want to strap on a water resistant or bagged phone, the lack of range makes swimming with it impractical.  That said it's been a great headset for me."
1,Great headphones for the price! My husband wanted Beats but couldn't justify spending that much money when he primarily uses them during workouts and mowing. He has been very happy with the sound quality and was impressed with all the features and extra parts in the box.
1,"I bought this item to replace another brand that would not stay in while I was working out. The Senso definitely stayed in my ears with no issues. The packaging and accessories were great. Came with a carrying case, and both mac (lightning) and mini-usb charger. It was easy to connect via Bluetooth to my iPhone 7 plus.<br /><br />With that being said the sound quality is terrible and that is why I am taking away 2 stars. I almost went with 2 stars but it does do its job. The sound I would describe as muffled and almost sounds like a recording made in 1920 or on AM stations. I am not an audiophile and have bought many inexpensive speakers and headphones with no complaints. This one though takes the cake. If the sound quality improved this would easily be a 5 star item."
1,very good package..the sound quality is good..but still room for improvement...but perfect for the price and the goodies that come with it
1,Other than having connection problems their great.
1,"Good stuff , good price !"
1,Good fit / durable/ great sound nothing negative to say about them . Use daily at gym
1,Was exactly as I expected and impressed me so much I ordered one for my girlfriend :)
1,I was pleasantly surprised with this purchase.  For the value these headphones are a great buy.  The hang perfectly on the ears and remain secure when working out.  The sound is great and the hands free feature is just what I was looking for without spending a fortune.
1,"These are pretty good. Good sound. Only sound issue is when I’m running and there is wind blowing. I have small ear canals and these are a little uncomfortable. Not as bad as others I’ve tried, but I’ve had better also. One issue when pairing is when i go from WiFi to cell they beep and the sound goes on and off and I have to turn off pairing and re-pair. Kinda annoying."
1,Get what you pay for great for abuse tho!
1,"So far so good! They stay put with the activity I do. Even though they’re bigger than other Bluetooth headphone,  for their price they’re exactly what I need!"
0,"Ear hook doesn't do its job, ear piece still falls out once I get moving, if it was a malleable ear hook then it would alot better.<br />The music portion is alright as for voice calls I have to disconnect and talk the regular way because the sound is a bit muffled."
1,"Here's the bottom line, these Bluetooth headphones work great! Was tired of the old headphones getting caught on things. I have an iPhone 7 and when apple switched from the aux port to the lighting port, it now works like S**t. The lighting port makes it sensitive when I bump the bottom of the headphone jack and will pause my music. Bluetooth was the way to go. They fit very nice and there are different size pieces to fit in all different size ears. They hold around the ear well too. The sound quality is top notch, even at its lowest volume setting. There is a dual charging cable that comes along with which is awesome. If you have an apple lightning port, you can charge your phone and headphones at the same time with just one cable. Only downside is that the cable will not fit into my otter box case but that's not a huge deal. Overall I am very happy with these headphones. They were easy to pair and connect to my phone automatically when I turn them on."
0,Stopped working after 3 weeks. Had to return
1,These earbuds have a great noise canceling feature. I use these earbuds for the gym and I noticed they block out almost all of the noise . I'm also very pleased with the quality of the sound as well as the comfort. I would order these again.
1,"I have tried various headphones and earbuds.  I have had several fall out while working out, or the sound cuts out.  These are rock solid!  They stay in, have great sound, and the battery lasts a long time between charges."
1,These work very good. Don't waste your money on the Beats headphones!! I was very surprised of the quality of the sound that these produce!
1,"Well made, great sound, very comfortable and trouble-free."
1,Senco Bluetooth Headphones are the best compared to other brands that I purchased.  This is  my fifth pair of bluetooth headphones that I had within two years.  I really like this product for gym workouts because when I sweat the earbuds doesn't fall out of my ear.  The next best thing is that the sounds when I'm particular listening to my exercise music.  The rhythm of the music come through very well.  I would differently recommend this Senso Bluetooth headphones product to my friends.
1,Great for work; really blocks the sounds around me and able to have a clear conversation
0,"My big complaint is that my pair has a slight ringing sound on the left side whenever they connect. I also don't love that it audibly says &#34;battery low&#34; quite frequently when the battery is low--I feel like telling me once is adequate, I'd rather let the battery run down in peace than have it constantly interrupt my audio to remind me. They have a decent range and quality otherwise. They are my first bluetooth headphones so I can't say anything about them relative to other products."
1,They are well put together and easy to connect to your phone. They have great sound and are comfortable. I would buy them again for sure ... great for running and road marching.
1,"Bought these to replace a set that I had for almost a year; they were great but I didn't use the carry case that was included (instead just stuffed them in my pocket when I went to the gym) so eventually a wire wore out.  I'll use the case with these new ones!<br />These headphones give very good sound quality and have outstanding battery life. Pairing is a snap and the connection distance is very far - I've had times I left my phone on an equipment and walked almost to the other end of a large gym building before I lost connection and knew I had left it.<br />The only negative I have, and this may be true of any earbuds, is that when walking outside, wind noise almost overcomes the audio being delivered by the earphones."
0,Did not fit well
1,Works great.
1,I like the sound but it doesn't really stay on my ear especially when I sweat. It keeps falling off.
0,"I've had them for a while now and have tried using them in several locations and situations. As headphones they're great but the microphone is pretty much useless in a noisy environment, which is why I bought them. I work in various data centers with computer background noise, and conversations are pointless. I can hear my caller just fine but I end up disconnecting the unit out of frustration with customers and contacts. So they're collecting dust right now."
1,"They're not the best, but for the price, they do a great job. Strong believer in getting what you pay for, and this was a deal, particularly with the accessories that came with it."
1,Much better than expected.  Way better than freedom sprint earphones.
1,"Ear hooks help the buds stay in place, which was the main thing I wanted. Sound quality is good. I sometimes have to power cycle a few times before music from my iPhone will actually play through the ear buds, which is a little annoying, but once they're properly synced, no problems. The mic is too far away to make phone calls, though; it’s hard for me to be heard unless I speak quite loudly. Battery life is good, although when you get the low battery warning, you’ve got at most 15 minutes of play time left."
1,Great range easy pairing and really good sound quality
0,"very little treble, connection troubles"
1,Only had them fro a few days and I have used them twice. They sound great and do cut out noise from the gym while I am spinning. Comfortable and easy to connect. They also stay connected to my iPhone (unlike my previous pair). My only negative is that the little cover for the charging port does not close properly after I charged them. Just won't stay in. Other than that they are a good pair of headphones.
1,"The wireless senso Bluetooth headphones are pretty amazing and very convenient. I use these at work and home. If you’re looking for some hands free headphones for your phone, computer or mp3, these are great."
0,"The sound was great and the battery life was great, but after about 9 months they stopped working properly. I’d be using them and they’d just turn off after the first few minutes of using them. That’s why they received 2 stars"
0,I ordered a pair of these back in October 2017. Now they won’t turn on at all. They’re fully charged and I’ve tried resetting them to the factory setting. Nothing. I loved them so much cause it’s hard to find anything to fit my small ears. So I ordered another pair. NOT THE SAME AND FALSE ADVERTISING!!! They changed the earpiece so it’s not flexible. It’s just a piece or rubber plastic and doesn’t custom fit to your ear. It’s waaayyy to big and the loop barely even touches the top of my ear loop with no way of moving it down. Soooo disappointed. Returning and never purchasing again.
1,"The headphones are my first pair of wireless/bluetooth device. I found them easy to use with a comfortable fit. They are extremely affordable, look nice and make workout time good so much faster. High recommend."
1,Very good value
1,"These have fabulous sound, but in the end I returned them.  They're a bit bulky for me and I had a hard time keeping them seated in my ears while running."
1,Great Sound... Seamless Bluetooth Pickup
1,"works perfect, sound is very good."
1,"I had a pair of Apple Airpods, which are awesome in many ways, but they stopped working after 1.5 years and Apple wouldn't service, only replace for $69. So I figured I'd try this highly rated product at the other end of the price spectrum. I'm really impressed with these little earbuds. Very nice sound (nothing like my old corded Sures, but very respectable), decent noise cancellation, easy to pair and use, comfortable, and I like it that they're connected to each other. I use them mostly at the gym and they've been pretty perfect for that. I ran into a pairing issue and the company replaced them quickly and painlessly. Would definitely recommend if you're looking for good, comfortable, easy-to-use, but not audiophile-level earbuds."
1,The sound quality is average.  Bass sound is not too good.
1,Love these. They last for hours and more importantly they stay in my ears during my half marathons.
0,"Am I the only person here who used those headphones in outdoor environment  ?<br />You simply can't run with those headphones due to the fact that there is a constant back ground noise from the wind in your hear  while you run or even when you stand still when there is a wind outside.<br />The headphone is probably configured to play back whatever the mic picks up, which would create a constant background noise."
1,"Maybe it's just my ear canals, but if I use these for a long time my ears get sore. The sound is the best I have heard of 3 different styles I have used. Would be better if they were more open ear type but still great for my usages."
1,Fit well and stay in place during a run.  Good sound quality. Great product!
1,works well---does tend to cut out--not the best circuitry connections I guess.
1,So far so good!  The sound is great and they are very comfortable!
1,I bought these so I wouldn't have to wear my pricey over the ear headphones I gotta say they're ok. For the price you get great volume. Nice bass and a unmatched comfort. For the reason I gave 3 stars the description  promised HD sound and 8 hours of playback. While the headphones are loud it's definitely not HD. The quality isn't clear. It sounds muffled and if you turn it too loud it feels annoying on the ears I find keeping it below half is a comfortable volume. I listen to audio books on audible and while listening the game of thrones series the guy sounds like he's mumbling at times which before he hasn't. If you have a Samsung Galaxy s phone the clarity is somewhat fixed with adaptive sound. And while playing music I got about 3.5 hours of playback before the lady kept telling my battery is low. This was more annoying than helpful. The play button while big and easy to press seems good it's not like. I found myself pressing the button to pause only to have something slightly bump it and press play again. This is a small con but it can cause battery drain and listening to audio books you can easily loose your place. Overall these headphones are good enough. They get the job done and they don't cost much. If you're used to clarity in your headphones you might want to for out the cash.
0,"Good initial quality, hurt my ears a a bit at first while wearing. I've had these for a month or two and they functioned well up until today, they proved quite durable but as of today the multifunction button failed completely, will not power up at all."
1,"These headphones are pretty amazing! At first I was apprehensive to buy them, but I am very glad I did! My boyfriend bought a pair a few months back and uses them on the daily so I decided to invest in a pair. I have had them for about a month and the sound quality is great I normally have to keep them on the lower volume setting because they work so well. The battery does not last 8 hours like some people said, however, I use mine for at least 5 hours of constant use before charging them. They take about 1-2 hours to charge. Calls work well too. I would say they work until you are around 50ft away. Also comes with a charger for Apple and Samsung phones and a car adapter. Well worth it for the price!!"
0,I was unsatisfied with the performance and function of these headphones. I would not recommend anyone to buy this
1,Very good headphones! Noise canceling & great sound
0,"These headphones worked for a little over 6 months with daily use outdoors while walking around on a college campus. Sound quality is average, battery life is surprising good. Its a good buy of you lose headphones or don't really care about sound quality. I got on a lightning deal for about 10 bucks  cheaper so may be good to wait until then."
1,Like them
1,Great product for this price point.  They fit well and the sound is good.
1,I had some issues with it not syncing right so I contacted the company and they made everything right by me.
1,"I love these Bluetooth ear buds!  They charge quickly, have great sound for music and speech and are light weight! easy to fold up I zippered case.  Great product! 5of 5 stars!"
1,"When I initially purchased the head phones I misread the description and assumed they where fully waterproof headphones that I can use for the pool. I figured because of the great value the quality of the sound would be decreased but I was shocked in how great they sounded. After taking them into the pool I realized they weren't meant for it and assumed I had damaged them. Fortunately, after they dried the sound quality stayed great."
1,"Nice headphones, good extras in the box"
1,Awesome product.
1,They work great and they are a great buy!
1,So far so good
0,"Sound is ok if you are standing still or walking with no breeze, but running with any wind and the sound of the wind cancels out music. Also do not like the floppy ear loops- flexible is good but these hardly keep the things on your ears."
1,"I bought Senso Bluetooth headphone, and I love it.<br />It reduce noise from outside. So, you can enjoy the music without disturb.<br />The sound is great.<br />Recommend this items for everyone."
1,"Me gusta mucho el sonido, y que se conecta rápido"
1,These were a gift for my son he's really pleased with them he says they work really well and the charge lasts.
0,hulk smash
1,"I've had these for a week now and so far I'm quite impressed. For the past year prior to these I was using the Jaybird X2's and try as i might, they just weren't working for me. No matter what tips and fins i used the X2's just wouldn't stay put in my ears. Trying to workout while constantly having to adjust the buds just became too frustrating. I've not had this problem with the Senso's...once they're in, they stay put. The fit and feel is more than comfortable. As for the sound, I'm no audiophile but to me, they're every bit as good as the X2's. The X2's may have a little more bass but that's it. At 1/3 of the price of the X2's I could not be happier with this purchase. Time will tell as to the durability but if they even only last me a year, they'll have been plenty worth it."
1,Lasted 9 months They no longer turn on. Not sure if it even accepts a charge
1,"I was using similar headphones by Beats for the last 1.5 years but they recently broke.  These ones sound exactly the same to me and are actually quite a bit more comfortable.  The piece that goes in your ear is SUPER soft and the part that goes around it is, too.  I have tiny ears so the Beats actually would hurt me sometimes.  These ones do not.  My ONLY issue with these is that the piece that goes around your ear is a little TOO soft and doesn't feel like it's really holding on.  HOWEVER, I was able to workout as usual (including jump squats and plank jacks) without any issue whatsoever.  Perhaps the rigidity of the outer earpiece doesn't matter as much as I thought!  I would buy these again and feel like for the price it's a way better purchase than Beats."
1,"I was very happy with the quality of the entire product. Packaging is terrific. Love the protective case. The set up was a snap. So far, very satisfied."
1,"great sound, easy connection.  Great buy for the price."
1,"Great sounding, comfortable headset. They are alittle big for my ears ( which are smaller), but they don't fall out even when I jump rope and do handstands.  For the price you can't beat them.<br />Responsive customer service is a bonus."
1,"Honestly not bad for the price. Would NEVER pay anything over 45$ for these. I've tried many high quality headphones/earbuds and really cheap ones. For the prime day price, these were not a bad purchase. On first reaction I thought they felt a bit like cheap plastic rip offs but when I started to work out in them I started to turn around. The sound actually isn't that bad, a bit flat and the bass is a bit wonky but it surprised me quality wise everywhere else.<br />Call quality wise it works, but everyone hears popping sounds, like a pen tapping a notebook on my end, and everyone's voices sound very flat to me.<br />For the price, it's not bad. I would still buy it again.<br />PROS<br />- Comfy, I can wear these for awhile<br />- Workout wise, good deal<br />- Battery is great! Lasted all day<br />- Appearance is slick<br /><br />CONS<br />- Feel is bit cheap, but the appearance isn't bad!<br />- Call quality was terrible, couldn't understand what my friends were saying on their phone some of the time<br />- I can't use Siri? :("
1,"I got these for my son, he loves them. They are comfortable, they come with a case with extra accessories, Very happy so far"
1,Good Bluetooth headphones for the money.
1,"I just got them yesterday, so I've only used them for a few hours.  Here are my initial thoughts...<br /><br />The ActivBuds are okay. There are a few issues that I have with them though:<br /><br />1. The sound isn't as great as I expected. They're only my second pair of Bluetooth headphones, so maybe I'm expecting too much, but the bass seems a bit &#34;muddy.&#34;  I'm not sure how else to discribe it. Instead of crisp, thumping bass it seems a bit muted.<br /><br />2. It would be nice if the ear hooks were a little more stiff. Not much.  Just a little.  I think they would stay in place better. It would also help my wife get them on. She has long hair and the hooks are so floppy that the they get tangled in her hair easily. Because of this, she wont be getting her own pair.<br /><br />3. The part of the ear bud that flairs out just after the tip (the part that goes into your ear) isn't far enough down.  I can't insert the tip as far into my ear as I'm used to. Because of this, it doesn't seem as secure. I think I'll get used to this, though.<br /><br />The positives:<br /><br />1. The hooks are comfortable<br /><br />2. The buttons are easy to use<br /><br />3. The instructions were pretty easy to understand<br /><br />4. They stay put pretty well;  much better than my previous ones<br /><br />5. They come with a car charger, a couple charge cords and a case.<br /><br />Those are my initial thoughts so far.  I'll update this if my opinion changes after using them a bit more."
1,very good sound quality.
1,"For the price, these can't be beat"
1,Sound is good. Fit is good. I use these at the gym and they hold up well during workouts. The Bluetooth signal is pretty much garbage. I use my HTC One as a music player and even in my left breast pocket music will break up during workouts. I though it was my older mobile having the issue but when I use my Galaxy 7 Edge or the wife's iPhone the signal is still garbage.
0,"I have used these earphones in the past and they are great.  starting with the design and the sound. the design because all the controls are in the earpiece and that makes it more comfortable and not like the other brands that have a volume bar that is swinging all the time.  However, this time the earphones did not work well.  it was very hard for me to get them connected to the phone and the battery life was very short.  I was in the middle of my workout and the ear set just got disconnected without any reason."
1,"Sound is great, power lasts long enough.  Not a 4 or 5 star because I really can't get the buds to stay in place.  It's very annoying when you're on the elliptical and you have to push them in every few minutes.  I'm open to suggestions on how to fix that one problem."
1,Nice
1,I have been having them for more than 4 months and they work still fine. The sound is just what I was looking for...just smooth
1,I was very surprised at the sound of these headphones. I have paid 3x the cost for others that do not sound this good. Well worth the price and I use them daily at the gym.
0,Stopped working after few days
1,"I just listen to Pink Floyd and space out, man. Like I can walk all around my house in my fur pajamas and just jam."
1,Very easy to use
1,"I really love these headphones but, have not had the chance to figure out to link them to the new mp3 player i received  In the meantime my computer automatically linked them  Great quality sound they have"
1,"I loved this product. The only problem is the battery, oh and the noise cancellation has 4 stars because I was watching a youtube video while my mother was playing a soap opera and it WOULD NOT cancel out the baby's cry."
1,&#34;Purchased as a gift. Giftee extremely pleased and the SENSO bluetooth headphones are working exceptionally well on the daily runs.&#34;
0,"This price vs sound quality seems unmatched.  The lower end of volume control could use more resolution.<br />I used the headphones 4 to 6 times a week during various workout types like outdoor running, indoor treadmill, and weight training.  Unfortunately after 6 months of use, the charging connector on the headphones physically broke and now the headphones are no longer usable."
1,"Seems like a quality item after ~ 1 week of use, especially for the price."
1,The sound it great but battery won't stay charged after turning it off. You have to keep it plugged in.
1,They are not well suited for my ears and are uncomfortable.
1,Na
1,The only headphones I’ve purchased that actually fit my ears without popping off every time I move!  Love the fit and the quality of sound.  Great value for the money!
0,"I don't know if is just my headphones, but the sound is really distorted, and the bass sounds really scratchy."
1,Works great and good price
1,They are ok.  The support relies mostly on the inner ear peace. Switching over to a phone call is horrible the person hears them selves echo. BUT listening to music they sound great.
1,"So here's my review on these red SENSO Bluetooth Headphones/Earbuds that I’ve owned for about a month now that were purchased for four primary reasons.<br /><br />The main reason above all others is so that I don't continue to be interrupted by the front desk girl at the gym, who constantly follows me around the gym and talks to me as I work out.<br /><br />Now don't get me wrong, I'm a very social kinda guy. In fact, I have well over 10 good, real life friends with an additional couple hundred who are either real and/or imaginary/online friends on places like FB, TWTR, and so forth..<br /><br />When I'm in the gym however, it's my time...my time to meditate and think about the day ahead, look through my stock portfolio, check out motorbikes for sale online, or do whatever...with her practically following me around the gym as she cleans, mops, and blabbles on about her life...it's just too much for me to handle. I felt enough’s enough, and it was time to shut it down - hence the need for these earbuds.<br /><br />The second reason is that my gym plays the same Internet stream of EDM/electronica music every single day. Now the first few days when I joined the gym years back, it was ok, but after the first week, I just can’t take it anymore - and I have no clue why I didn’t use earbuds much sooner.<br /><br />The third reason is because one of the personal trainers in my gym counts the repetitions of his clients performing the latest, greatest, butt-blasting, ab routines, so darn loud that it throws off my own mental count when hitting the weights. I’ve tried to be in sync with his counts on occasion, but I just can’t do it, man...<br /><br />And finally, the fourth reason I purchased these is because I didn't want to ruin any of my existing good pairs of earbuds. I've spent a ridiculous amount of cash on other buds and full headsets, and didn't want to ruin any of them with sweat, or damage that the gym may bring on.<br /><br />So overall, I believe that each of the four criteria above have been accomplished with these Bluetooth earbuds.<br /><br />As an aside, I've lost track of how long the battery lasts, but I can easily say that they go strong for at least 5 hours of solid use, but more toward 6-8 hours if I really think about it. And they do charge pretty quickly - I want to say that within 2 hours or less they're fully charged.<br /><br />The cons to these buds are as follows:<br /><br />1) I often have one heck of a time initially connecting these to my iPhone 6. And this is probably my biggest annoyance with these and the reason they get four stars. Yep, everything is up-to-date on the phone and I don’t have any issues with it overall...I've triply checked. I have tried every imaginable scenario - turn Bluetooth on the phone first and wait a few - turn earbuds on first and wait a few - switch from airplane mode on and then off - forget the SENSO device/re-find and attempt to connect - restart my phone. The most successful method that works just about every time is restarting the phone but that drives me up a wall to have to do that. If any of you have a cheap, dirty way of connecting, I’m all ears...literally!!<br /><br />Now once they are connected, I don't recall ever losing a connection, aside from walking away from my phone by a good 30+ feet or so...on a positive note, when I attempt to connect these at the gym, it sometimes takes a good 5+ minutes to establish a connection - which is good, because I completely lose track on the treadmill and it makes the cardio portion of my time really fly by - so in an odd 'turning lemons into lemonade' kinda way, kudos to that. :)<br /><br />2) For under $40 and change, I wasn't expecting the quality of my Bose, Beats, 1More, Klipsch, Bowers & Wilkins, Shures, and the countless others I have....I canoodle on guitar a bit, so I like to listen back to my recordings using a variety of headphones/buds to note as wide a range as possible for dynamic purposes. My ears are pretty good and adept at distinguishing quality characteristics of low, mid, and high frequencies.<br />With that being said, it is essential that your earbuds fit properly if you want to experience all ranges. I’ve read time and time again that people don’t hear the bass. You have to select the proper fitting nubs for your 'ear holes' when it comes down to it or you'll completely miss out on a majority of the ranges if there isn't a proper seating and seal of the buds in your ear canal...and a side note, being that I am wearing these primarily in the gym, or out back by the pool in the hot Vegas sun, I didn't want my sweat or god forbid, ear wax, damaging my other sets of buds - hence why I also purchased these as I may have mentioned.<br /><br />So back to the ranges with a good fitting. The bass is there, but depending upon the gain/distortion/bass in the music you listen to...it will clip at certain decibels. It’s almost as if I hear the digital distortion of on/off, almost solid state sounding distortion as compared to a warm continuous tube amp flow of bass - if that makes sense. Now it isn’t there all the time by any means. Just certain songs on rare occasion. I’m sure it would be there more frequently if I drop some death metal in, but I’m getting to old for that kinda stuff...long live Sepultura, Manowar, and the likes.<br /><br />Moving on, the mids are adequate but can be brightened up a bit, and the highs are acceptable overall that don't overwhelm the ears with any screeching, tinny tones. Now granted, I can tweak the settings a bit to my liking with equalization, but I'm a lazy SOB so I listen to these stock, as is.<br /><br />So overall, I am happy with these earbuds aside from having one heck of time connecting them to my iPhone 6. So a four star out of five from this reviewer."
1,"Superior quality sound FOR THE PRICE, that's key to know when buying these. I just hope they hold up. The entire package was well thought out and put together by folks who truly understand the needs of people. Thanks."
1,"Sound is a bit bassy and lacks mid range, but they are good considering the price.  The battery seemed to go dead quickly and the range isn't spectacular, but it is good.  I found another popular brand had better mid range and treble response, but cost much more.  It feels weird to have them in the water."
0,"If you are in the wind/biking/running at pace you have to keep your phone on your right side for a decent connection.<br />With profuse sweat/wind the connection will hurt your ears and drop....<br /><br />Sound is on point for the dollar... but the blue tooth is fickle....<br /><br />randomly stopped working, will fix review when the warranty is honored."
0,"These are comfortable and stay in while running. They were easy to pair and use. and the battery lasts quite a while.<br />However,<br />The sound quality, at least in the pair I receive, is quite bad. The bass completely overpowers everything else, with the mids and treble extremely muffled."
0,"Stopped working within two months, terrible product"
1,Loved these so much that my husband took mine and I ordered a second pair!
1,"Very affordable, works well, easy to use. Sound quality is good for the price point."
1,"Just got them, highly recommend! Make sure you charge it before use.<br />They are nice and loud to blow out your ear holes.<br />Would buy again if I need to."
1,Great inexpensive alternative to the Powerbeats. Why pay more for the exact same product just because of the brand name? Would definitely recommend to others.<br /><br />Headphones broke and customer services was very accommodating and replaced them ASAP.
1,Excellent item
0,"Would not purchase again.<br />The quality of sound is good, but my problem is with the Bluetooth. They do not connect well when switching between devices. I have to have my computer forget the device then reconnect if I am switching from being connected to my phone, and vice versa. It will say &#34;connected&#34;, but it's not.<br /><br />After a couple months the battery WILL NOT last 8 hours"
1,"Its comfortable, clear voice and clear sound."
0,The product is big for my ears...  ..I would like to return it.........
1,"I love these earbuds, but one earbud always goes out on me in 8months"
1,very satisfied I am
1,I am so impressed that I got an 2 emails from SENSO to see how I liked this product and to offer assistance.<br /><br />I would definitely purchase these again!
1,great buy
1,"This is what I tell my husband.<br />This is my second pair of Senso bt headphones. I tossed the first pair recently, after about a year and a half of use, because I lost one of the ear cushions. Now, my husband and I are very careful about budgeting for miscellaneous purchases that are around the $50 or above mark. After I told him I needed a new pair he asked me what would be more important on the Wish list we have going... New running shoes or new headphones. HA!<br />Darling, my headphones cost $20.<br />To which he responds, ""Nooo, you should get the new Apple ones, they're great!""<br /><br />Here's the thing friends... These headphones.. I've never had an issue with them connecting. I've never thought poorly of the sound quality. The new ones I just got, MOLD TO MY TINY EARS. Tiny ear people, hi - I see you. Regardless, until the Apple headphones last as long as my $20 Senso headphones for the same value... i e. When you're $159 headphones last 7.95 years.. and you've never lost them, they've never faulted and something better didnt catch your eye in that time... then Screw Your Apple Headphones... respectfully."
1,Dope headphones !!!!! Great quality and price
1,So far I am loving these headphones sounds great and fits perfectly and stays on while I run! I also have no problem connecting to my phone or watch. Great product I also love the case!
1,"Good sound. They stay in your ears pretty good while running. Battery life is good, 4-5 hours.  Only knock on them is sometimes when the right ear bud starts to come out of your ear and you try to push it back in you'll hit the pause/power button. Other than that I like them. Easy to pair with phone."
1,Great gift.  I bought these for my husband for his workouts.  He found them to be comfortable and sweat proof.  He likes his music loud and only had the volume up half way.  Now I am considering buying a pair for myself.
1,Excellent for running and gym
1,My husband loves these and uses them every day!
1,"So i was ready to pull the trigger on a pair of Powerbeats and spend the $200, I'm glad I didn't and decided to buy these at the last minute. For $20 these headphones are AMAZING, they have good bass, good volume, and a great value. I use them primarily in the gym and they work great. No issues with bluetooth connectivity, worked perfectly. Before you spend money on overpriced headphones, give these a try, if my pair ever die on me I will be buying another pair."
1,"My first wireless pair of earbuds.  I like these overall.  They struggle a bit with loud and deep bass, but mostly they sound and fit good.  Just what I needed for a great price."
1,"These headphones are awesome. What's my second set but the last set lasted for 2 years. I use them 7 days a week for 2 1/2 to 4 hours a day in the gym. They stay in place, sound great and they are unaffected by sweat. they are also a great price."
1,"Get these they are wonderful! You can talk on the phone and the sound is great. Perfect for walking the dog and listening to music without worrying about them popping out of your ears. Used them when working out and running and they stay on your ears just fine and not affected by sweat. Great to just drape around your neck when not in use and you wont lose them. The battery lasts for hours when in use and for weeks when not in use. Shows the battery level when you connect to phone so no guessing how much battery is left. Ive had them 5 years and they are still working like new. For the price, I cannot believe how well they've held up. Id give em a 10!"
1,Delivery was faster than expected. And the headphones are a lot louder than other headphones I own. Great for working out and mobility.
1,"I'm not very tech savvy but I set these up very easily and quickly.  They sound amazing!!  Having music while I work out is a definite motivation, and having it be wireless is even better!  Thanks for the great instructions!"
1,"I bought these in May and they have been great for exercise in all weather. There are three things I love about these headphones. 1) The sound is great! I didn't really expect the nuances I get from these wireless earbuds. I feel like I'm at the recording studio. 2) The controls are easy to use. When exercising it's important to be able to quickly pause the sound (crossing a road), adjust volume, repeat a song, or skip a song. It's also easy to answer the phone and the headphones make an awesome phone headset. 3) Customer service is great. I've had two small issues I wrote to them about and they responded within 24 hours with a fix I could implement myself. Not only did they offer the fix, but reminded me of my warranty coverage and assured me I would be taken care of if the fix didn't work. I highly recommend these headphones and this company. They actually know what customer service means."
1,I purchased a set in May. They stopped working in September. The company quickly responded to my warranty claim and sent me a new pair at no cost.
1,"This was my first pair of bluetooth headphones so I do not have anything to compare them to. They have excellent audio quality and good battery life. The case and multiple sized ear buds included are nice. My only complaint is that there is sometimes issues with the connectivity. A quick reset usually fixes it but its not exactly ideal. However, for the price these are a very great product and I will gladly put up with the minor issue. 4 stars."
0,"I was excited when I bought these, the sound quality is actually very good.  That being said, the Bluetooth is horrible.  About every 15 - 20 seconds the music is interrupted with two short beeps, then it is silent for a few seconds just to have a voice say &#34;Connected&#34;, the silent for another 3-5 seconds then the same voice says &#34;Connected&#34;, this time it says it with a very broken voice.  After that, I get to hear my music for another 15 - 20 seconds."
1,"Great sound quality. On my second pair now. First had to send back because they straight up stopped working. Which, yes, was an inconvenience. But the company was very easy to work with. I think they even discounted my second pair or something. Would definitely recommend based on battery life/design/sound quality. Btw I use them at the gym and they’re fine."
1,Very pleased with the quality and performance.
1,"I love my new earbuds, the sound is great. I love the fact that a voice tells you when they are powered on and then powered off. The only suggestion for improvement I hv is to include extra-small ear pieces. Apparently I hv tiny ears, your smallest buds fit but a smaller pair wud n better."
1,"These ear buds work great, easy to operate, have great sound, plenty of volume, and are comfortable to wear. I wear glasses, so the soft and flexible ear wraps work nicely for me. I can listen to music &amp; with one tap, answer a phone call. Then my music starts right back when the call ends."
1,"Very affordable headphones for working out, used it while listening to podcast, music etc. So happy with this purchase!"
1,So far so good. Used them 1st time this morning run.
1,"I love them, I like how they hang around the ears. Excellent sound! I like the storage box, the several size spare parts of the silicon hubs...<br />Good extras! Nice and useful cable<br /><br />Easy to recommend!!!<br /><br />But I lost them, I am really sad....😭😭😭"
1,"Beautifully packaged with lots of extras included such as car charger,6ft. charging cable,etc..<br />Sound is crisp and the fit is wonderful.  I would definitely recommend this product!"
1,I love these. They have great sound and block out the noise. The only problem is they are a little bulky
1,"I am on my second set of headphones, not through any fault of the headphones. I was getting out of the car and they got caught in the door, the charging mechanism was crushed though they did still work until the battery died. They work well and have good battery life. I bought 2 pairs to replace that one so I will have them if I make another mistake. The new ones have a slightly different over ear piece though they are the same model. That being said it seems comfortable and the sound quality is just as good as the last pair!! I would definitely recommend these headphones!"
0,These were great until I bought some real headphones lol. Than I realized how bad the sound was. Cheap and better than wires.
1,Nice hold charge great
1,I have had these for almost 2 months. They’re pretty great. I had a pair by another maker and they lasted like a month. These are a lot better and charge up fairly quick.
1,great price and very comfortable to wear.  Does not seem to have a great range as I was getting interferance with my phone in my left pocket and wearing earphones while walking. I placed my phone in my right pocket and all was fine.
1,"Great product, clear sound"
1,"This SENSO Bluetooth Headphones are great. It only took seconds to connect to my IPhone 6 and the sound quality is great. I use it while weight training and running. It doesn't need constant adjust while exercising. The ear buds stay put thanks the ear piece and the hook that goes behind your ears. It took a little getting use to the controls being up on the ear piece instead of on the cord, but I set my volume and music playlist before I begin my workout. It also includes two small wire ties you can install on the cord to secure it under your chin or behind your neck. The car charger is convenient just in case I forget to charge the headphones over night and it has two USB so you can charge your phone at the same time. I've only had this headphone for about a week so if anything changes I'll update my review."
1,Terrific and I highly recommend them!
1,"Excellent package, build quality, sales support and follow-up response by Invotek. Unlike the piles of throw-away electronics out there, there's some care evident with this company that shows in their product."
1,Great product. Love all the accessories that came along with it too.
1,Take a while for the headphone to connect to your phone. The bluetooth delay is quite noticeable.
1,"Just tried these out yesterday and they worked great! They didn't slip at all even after being exposed to sweat. You can still get a little bit of wind noise, but it's hardly noticeable. The sound is fantastic!"
0,It sounds good but came up broked...... Very disappointed.....
1,"Cord feels short at times. Sound quality is decent - worked will on my recent flight and battery lasted as long as I needed, although my ears did hurt after a couple hours."
1,"Just received these last week and have used them a couple of times, so far I am very satisfied with them. I switched out the ear pieces so they fit comfortably for me and the sound quality and ease of use have been very good. I use them for spinning and they stayed in place even with a lot of sweating. I do recommend them."
0,I disliked that they died after two months. Will no longer charge. I tried everything senso suggested to no avail. Their warranty is useless. Contacted through website as that is the only way. Never got response. Product has already changed to version 255 so you probably won't be reading this review. Don't buy anything from senso.
0,Very poor sound. No base at all
1,This is my first set of wireless earbuds and very happy and please I will highly recommend these earbuds to my family and friends thank you for the good service
1,Bought these for my son  that runs track and cross country - hasn't taken them off since - if he can get away with it. I take it he loves them!
1,Great sound quality with lots of extras.  They fit well which is wonderful for me as most earbud style headphones just fall off when I exercise.
0,connection not good appears to have a short in the wire when I turn my head the sound cuts off.
1,Satisfied with the quality for the price.
0,"These headphones are very comfortable. The problem I am having with them is they keep cutting in and out. And it's not just a random cutting out here and there. Its all the time and for long periods at a time. I can't get thru even half a song without it cutting out multiple times. I have tried turning them off and on, making sure that they are close enough, and charging them. Nothing seems to help. I will be looking into returning them. I'm disappointed because they are so comfortable to wear."
1,"Bluetooth, sound quality and comfort are all good.  The on/off and volume controls are easily accessible."
0,Earphones will not charge. Can you please assist?
1,Great headphones in door. Not as good outdoor.
1,"The sound quality is good and they were easy to set up.  I also like the sound volume on the headset.  I bought these, because when I take my dog on a walk, she sometimes gets excited and jumps on me and knocks the earbuds out of my ear.  With these, I don't have to worry about that.<br /><br />My only complaint is they cut out when I turn my head to the right. When I turn back to the front, they work again.  Wish I knew how to fix this."
1,Brought this product in November it was great for a few months now the left ear is cutting off and on all the time. It will give out completely any day now I want buy another one but afraid that the Same thing will happen few months down the road again.
0,"I returned these after one use.<br /><br />On the plus side, they stayed in my ears as I jogged.<br /><br />However, they felt cheaply made. The ear hooks were about as structural as a wet noodle, which gave me little confidence that they'd stay on. Also, the ear bud silicone parts were so flimsy that the sound quality would change dramatically as I moved my jaw. Speaking of sound quality, they basically only have bass. All the higher frequencies were tinny.<br /><br />I have since purchased a cheaper pair from a competitor and been much happier."
1,"I've been putting off getting wireless Bluetooth headphones until now because of a variety of problems and frustrations I heard about the technology and didn't want to get frustrated by. I'm so happy that I chose these senso buds for my first pair. They were listed as the top Amazon recommendation and for the price I figured what the heck.<br /><br />I've had them a week now and used them about 20-25 hours. I wear them at my desk and also on long walks at night with music or audiobooks. They synced right up with my Moto G4 phone and played music within seconds of turning them on. Good start. The buttons on the side make it simple to control volume, play, pause, and tracks while the phone stays in my pocket. The charge lasts about 8 hours is guess based on my first few charges. I will say that there's no battery indicator and the system only gave me 5 minutes warning before it turned off. I couldn't figure out how to charge and play at the same time but the questions on the site indicate it works. They are super comfortable for hours at a time.<br /><br />Easily the best buds I've ever owned, my first wireless pair, and I'm never going back to wired."
1,excellent product
1,fine
0,It worked well for 6 months but now it frequently gets disconnected from my devices I connect it to even at the arms distance. I still have it covered under warranty not sure where to get it exchanged. I bought it in US and came to India with these.
1,Good.
0,They come off easily I have a feeling I will be losing these..
1,One side doesn't always stay in when i exercise no matter how much i try to manipulate it. Overall I like them but can fall out if i do burpees and other jumpy activities.
1,These were the first Bluetooth headphones if used but compared to the ones that come with my iPhone the sound is incredible and very  comfortable to wear while working!
1,"Great product but the battery life is misleading. Mine will say 30% and then a few minutes later they'll say battery low and it will be 10% and within 5 minutes, they will die. Can get at least 5 or 6 hours off one charge, just remember to charge them."
1,These headphones have exceptional sound quality.  Setting them up for pairing is very easy. I used them with my Alexa echo and it was very simple to pair. I am sure it will be the same with the phone. Very good value for the money.
1,I work outside for a living and these are great they cancel out noise and work great with music and talking on the phone
1,Love these.
1,Using them at production shop job. Like most buds they tend to drop out of my ear don't know why. At least they have a good adjustable behind ear holder. Battery seems to last quite a long time
1,Product arrived on time and performed as advertised.  Its a good product for the price.
1,Love these!! I am using them at work in an office space with multiple coworkers and these are perfect.
1,"Great sound, easy to use, great price.  The one bad part is the ear bud is a little flimsy over ear. For the price can't go wrong. Only had them about a month if they hold up they will be great. Sound comparable to jaybird, and other high end ear buds I have if not better."
1,"I tried it out to see what kind of range it has by putting my phone in my dresser.  After closing the drawer there was no loss in signal and I was able to control my phone no problems.  I walked out of my bedroom to see what kind of range it had.  I got 20 to 25 feet away before I started to notice in loss of signal.  I also walked outside and the signal penetrated my block walls for 20 to 25 feet before signal loss.  This thing is very impressive on range,  I can't imagine any issues putting my phone in my backpack when I go hiking for control of the songs or signal strength.  These headphones do a great job.<br /><br />The rubber piece that wraps around the hear is very soft.  It might be too soft for a jogger or anything with a lot of impact and fall out of the ear but I have not tried it out yet for anything that puts that kind of strain on the rubber to see if they stay on my ears.  That being said they are very comfortable.<br /><br />Overall the sound was great; loved the ability to go back and forth on songs on my phone; and most importantly the signal strength was very impressive."
1,"Great sound, long life battery, easy bluethoot pairing. Best choice at best price"
1,I'll come back here if they disappoint me. But they're pretty great right now.
1,"so far these are exactly what I was looking for.  The sound is great, I like the little case for storing them."
0,"Briefly dropped a pair in my dog's water bowl, dried off and they stopped working.<br /><br />Ordered another pair and they changed the over ears to a more stiff uncomfortable material.<br /><br />Blu tooth &#34;Battery low&#34; yells at you even when the sound is low."
1,Bought for my Girl Friend to wear while mowing grass etc... So far she is very happy with the fit and sound quality.
1,I bought these about a year ago and they sounded great but would not charge. A friend recommended I try them again and I’m very glad I did! Probably the best sound and fit of any headphones I have had
0,"This is the second pair of these Senso headphones ive bought. The first pair came in September of 2017 and i was actually very satisfied, the sound quality on those first pair, the ease of use, fitment, packaging all left a great first impression. Through wear and tear they ended up breaking and thought hell, why not get another. This second pair is NOT of the same quality of those that i purchased a few years back. The sound on these sound muffled, terrible in fact, theres no EQ or anything that can help them either. The physical product is all the same, but unfortunately times have changed and so did the quality of sound on these."
1,"These ear buds are exactly what you hope they would be. They are comfortable and do their job great for their price point.<br /><br />Pros: LOVE the soft cord to go around the back of your head. They are comfortable on the ears and you don't have to worry about adjusting them mid-run.<br /><br />The buttons are easy to find and clear instructions for how to set them up/work them.<br /><br />They come in a nice, hard-shell case to keep them safe and to find quickly in your gym bag or purse.<br /><br />Sound was crisp and clear!<br /><br />Cons: You get what you pay for. I'm super pleased with these for the discounted price of $30 when purchased through my Prime account. They do not cancel outside sound so in the gym (I think you'd need full headphones for that quality) I did need them up to the second from max volume to hear what I was working out to. I think they will be perfect for outdoor running though.<br /><br />Overall, whatever can make my working out easier and more enjoyable so I want to go to the gym or go for a run, is awesome. These are great little buds!"
1,It is without reservation I give t his product 5 stars! The quality of the sound is amazing. Can't say enough about this product. It has so many pluses I can't count them all. Just buy it!
1,"I love this item, the ear bods stay in and are easy to control. Also, the price and sound is ."
1,"Good sound. Stays in my ears while running. The band between the two earphones is not as flexible as I'd like, but it's okay. Overall, it is a good product."
1,"The sound is decent for the price, but while running they tend to fall off if you have smaller ears. The ear piece that loops over isn't adjustable."
1,"The multiple sized ear bud options were great as my husband found the right size. The quality is really good, esp. the bass. The are not hard plastic, so they are comfortable, but do not fall off the ear."
1,"I have only had these for about 2-3 weeks. So far so good. Came with extra cables for charging. The sound quality is what i expected for the price. Out of the box they fit my ears fine, but also had plenty of spare ear buds that were different sizes. Overall, working great!"
1,"I like the way these are built. They stay in your ear very well. They charge up quickly and the battery life is good. I played them for hours at a time and haven't let them go dead, so I don't know how long it actually takes to drain the battery. I'm quite pleased with them."
1,"I took a chance on these because I got sick of my earbuds falling out on the treadmill. So far these have been great. This is my first experience with bluetooth headphones and I am loving the lack of a leash. Yeah, I'm not technical, but they do the job and the price was reasonable."
1,"I received my headphones and used them for the first time yesterday. They are very comfortable, but cut out occasionally. I've decided to try using them again today to see if this problem persists. The quality of the sound is excellent for this price point."
1,"This is John Ward. My wife is Kim. I recently purchased the Senso Headphones. The reason for the purchase: I recently acquired an Apple Watch. I wanted to run and listen to a Podcast. I will say the Headphones were easy to pair with the watch. The sound was crystal clear! The only suggestion that i might make is a tune up in the bass output. I am familiar with some wireless buds that command a higher price. Honestly, at a moderate price, the Senso headphones are a much better value. I plan to purchase more as gifts."
1,"Have not ran with them yet. But tested them out, good sound, fit comfortably, and seem durable."
1,"They sound good, but I would not say they have great base. Depending on type of music these can sound great to mediocre. Mid range is really good but sometimes highs sound crushed.  Great on sorrund &#34;3d&#34; sound as well, they are good for the price.  If you like rap music they will sound ok but music with less base will sound pretty good."
1,"These headphones are terrific.  I have never had earbuds that would remain in place while I exercise and these do!  Good quality sound, too,  Extraordinary value!"
1,Best set of headphones I had. Even better than my JBLs I had before.
1,"Love this product.  Love it.  Sound quality very good.  I can work a physical job without these falling off or catching on clothing.  Perfect product, packaging, fast delivery."
1,Stay in great during workouts and sound awesome. Battery life can last me 3-4 gym visits!
1,These are pretty darn good!
0,"Unfortunately after doing a warranty exchange for a blue pair I bought a red pair. Hoping they were different and worked better. I gave the red set away to a family member prior to even trying them.<br />For a gift last week I was given a new pair from another brand. The connection was amazing and I could venture around my whole house. easily 20""-30"" away with this other brand. I asked my cousin how he liked his sensos and he said they never worked right and had 0 distance.. I never bothered to contact them again for either the red or blue pair . I believed it was just me even after the magic reset.. apparently not."
1,Wow these were so worth the deal. So far 100% satisfied. Sound is great. Holds a charge for a long time. Fits perfectly and stays on no matter what level and kind of workout you doing.  And the package comes with a cool assortment of other items. All in all I couldn't be happier right now
1,It’s the older version. Good quality headphones . The s-255 are my fav
1,Easy to use....great sound
1,Phones calls are difficult on this but its not why I bought it. Everything else is perfect.
1,"I am a first-time user of blue-tooth headphones and these far surpassed my expectations. I needed them because I do a lot of physical therapy exercises in a pool and it's just so boring without being able to listen to music or audiobooks. These are just perfect - sound is great, controls make it so easy to use. I would definitely buy again. Easy to set up too."
1,"Ear buds came fast and they sound pretty good!! Good clarity, pleased with the purchase."
1,"Works great. Delivered on time. Would definitely order again. Update, did order another set."
0,"Literally cannot even have the device in my pocket for two minutes without a 10 minute episode of static, stuttering, and disconnecting. Sound quality is decent when it does work. Not nearly as good as everyone in the reviews made it seem, but definitely worth the $30 or whatever AS LONG AS IT STAYS CONNECTED."
1,"They play music, but it's not a very robust sound... at all.  The ear loops are also a harder plastic and are not at all adjustable and from what I saw for selections, it did not come in other sizes.  The ear loops sit close to a 1/2 inch above my ears."
1,"Love them!! I have dropped my phone on the treadmill so many times when I jog!! These are perfect!! Fit great, easy to use and comes with everything you need to use them...even arrived charged so I could use them immediately!! Thank you!!"
1,The service and guality is awesome. Love my Senso. Thank you do much
0,I bought many headphones senso problem is that one of its ear stops working. I dont like complaining but last one came with one side of headphone not working.
1,"Excellent product easy to where, connected easily to my device in seconds. Take and place calls from my cell phone, this a sweet Bluetooth setup. Love it and it works flawlessly out of the box. Charges up headset in about and hour, thanks for making a truly great headset."
1,After few months of usage maybe only once or twice a week. This headphone will not charge anymore..
1,Wonderful sound and noise canceling ability.  Shut out the whole world except for what you're listening too.  Love this product. I like it more than the Beats other family members have.
1,Very good sound. Somewhat disappointed with the sound canceling.
1,"If you're like me and love baths, you've undoubtedly burned through multiples of headphones that got just a itty bitty bit wet from being dunked in the bathtub by accident. The headphones are usually fine in water, but if the headphone port gets wet while the jack is in it it's usually over. With their water resistance and blue tooth feature, these headphones solve both issues and sound nice to boot."
1,Excellent quality. great sound
1,The sound is fantastic and the buds stay securely on my ear. I've tried several wireless headsets and this is absolutely the best one I found where the cost is excellent.
1,The ear tips fit me very well. I was surprised at how clear and good the sound is. It's great to not have to plug into my phone. All at an affordable price
1,I really like everything about the headphones except for one minor issue. At the lowest volume setting it is still a little too loud for me when I’m trying to relax at bedtime. Other than that they are great.
0,"Updated review: My original pair of headphones died before the 1 year warranty. The company was great to deal with an exchange their customer service is A+ all the way. However the new pair of headphones barely holds a charge. They don't last for more than two hours at a time. Would not purchase again.<br /><br />They headphones have been good so far. They are easy to use and comfortable. However, the battery life is nowhere near 8 hours. After using mine for 2 hours they died. Recharged them until it said they were completely charged and they only last about 3 hours. The sound quality is pretty good as well."
0,After I month the ear bud price pooed and the return window is closed so not buy even though the sound goid they will not last
0,They were amazing for a month or two. I was shocked by the quality of sound. However now after two months sound no longer comes out of the left headphone making the headphones useless.
1,Wow... Just hooked them up... And they sound amazing haven't worked out in them yet but definitely looking forward to it... I've tried all the brand's and I'm always looking for a great deal....! I like alot of volume and these did it amazing... Can't wait to give them a real test run..!!! I'm not a verified user.. if you love your music loud get these!!!!<br /><br />UPDATE: spoke too soon right ear is shortening out they lasted 2 months.... They were great for that time. gonna try and contact company and see if I can get more. Gonna drop down to 2.5<br /><br />Update talked to company about replacement they are sending one right out!!! Thank you senso!!!!
1,The BEATs died again. Bought these on Amazon and the rest is history. My wife like them so much bought another pair for me.Now to see if they will withstand the test of time. If they last 3 months that is cost effective for us.
1,Great Product
1,"JUST RECEIVED THEM ABOUT A WEEK AGO. SO FAR, THEY APPEAR TO DELIVER AS DESCRIBED IN THE POSTING. I RECEIVED THEM AHEAD OF SCHEDULED DATE AND APPEAR TO HAVE A GOOD QUALITY WITH BOTH SOUND AND MANUFACTURING. HOPEFULLY, THEY'LL BE DURABLE AND PROVIDE TROUBLE FREE SERVICE FOR GOOD WHILE."
1,These are incredible especially at this price. I would expect the same quality from 150$ headphones.
1,Fantastic sound! very comfortable! They work great!! Im really happy with them!!
1,"Worked for two years, then died. It's take it for $20."
1,These things are awesome and the price wow
1,"I purchased these for use at work. Battery life is good. The charging cord is short (1 ft). I've had them about 6 months and the left bud is losing connectivity. It's not every time i use them sometimes it works, sometimes it is soft and sometimes it is completely off. The noise canceling/suppression is pretty decent, oftentimes my coworkers have to shake me to get my attention.<br />If they lasted more than 6 months I'd recommend these...since they did not I would look elsewhere."
1,Very happy with these headphones. Produces as promised. 3 different sizes of ear tips to provide best fit. Sounds great. Easy to sync and easy to charge.
1,Love my headphones. Just as advertised! Only wish the charging cord was longer.
1,"These fit well; I’ve got smaller ears so having headphones fit is always a bit scary. With a bit of bending, these guys fit great. The sound quality is perfect. My only advice is to adhere to the half-full (or half-empty depending your life view) battery symbol. Instead of thinking the headphones have another day or so before you need to charge them, I’d charge them that night."
1,they work well enough for what i paid for them. Sounds ok. Travel case is great. Mainly bought them for the gym. Something inexpensive so if i break or lose them i'm really not out of much $$$.
1,Great product
1,"The sound is great with these bluetooth headphones.  They are extremely comfortable and totally stay in your ear, even while exercising.  They are a fabulous deal for the money, and in addition to the headphones, you also get a case, charger, car charger, additional ear pieces, etc.  These were an amazing deal for the money and I would highly recommend them."
1,always connects via bluetooth - nice sound - good buds  and controls - no bulky inline pieces - very light. great price.
0,After a year of using this product died. it’s not worth.
1,pros. Sound is very good. Case and accessories great for the money. Customer support is excellent.<br />Cons. Ear hooks could be more comfortable for me.<br />Overall I would definitely buy again
1,Good stuff Works great happy the way it works
1,"Still somewhat undecided. They are comfortable to wear.  But I give three stars so far because I don't like the weird high pitched background sound that occurs when you turn them on -- and although it say &#34;up to 8 hours&#34; of playback, I think it's more on the 6 hour range, they are also bulkier than I thought they would be.<br />I don't get that high pitched background sound with my other blue tooth head phones.<br /><br />The price is good and I am interested to see how durable they are with burpees."
1,Best headphones ever bought. They sound great and are better than other headphones used.
1,"Before even using the earbuds I was impressed with the packaging (it made me think of Apple's packaging), plus all the extras inside.<br />The instructions are well written and easy to understand. I got the ear buds easily synced with my iPhone first and then my iPad.<br />I've never had Bluetooth headphones before, so it was such a treat to be able to answer all around a room and do things not tethered to anything to listen to my audiobook.<br />The quality of sound was wonderful for music. I played the Hallelujah Chorus as the trial piece and the ear pieces passed with flying colors.<br />I next used them for a phone call and it sounded a little muffled. The caller could hear me all right, but said I sounded a little muffled too.<br />These fit comfortably in my ears and I wore them for two hours without a problem. I flipped the connecting cord behind my neck and know one knew I was listening to music.<br />Overall I'm extremely happy with these and plan to buy a pair for my husband."
1,Thank you! Great ear buds.  Arrived as promised.
0,"These really are not great headphones for a woman. The ear hooks extend half an inch over the top of my ear, which means they don't do anything to help keep the buds in place. As a result, the earbuds keep sliding out while I am working out. Since the power button is right where you would push them back into your ears, I keep accidentally turning them off in the middle of a workout while trying to keep them from falling off."
1,"Buena calidad, tiene buen volumen. Y son practicos a la hora de hacer gym. Los recomiendo."
1,I love the sound... they could stay in ears a little better though
1,"The fit is great! I have really small ears, so I was worried but these are very comfy! The only thing I DONT like is that when I have my phone on my arm and running, they cut in and out. Not sure if that is a phone issue or a headphones issue. Its kind of annoying, but nothing I cant deal with."
1,Was very skeptical about these but it’s been almost a week and they are great!
1,"These lasted about 6 months for me before they stopped holding a charge. Sound quality was better than expected, never had any issues with them falling out of my ears during runs or anything. Would recommend on the whole. Currently trying to see how the 1-year warranty holds up, so I'll update if that turns into anything, but even without it I'd still say this is a good deal for earbuds to do a job."
1,"I had Jaybird X2 before which I paid $70 for, and after couple month they kept disconnecting and now doesn't connect at all, so I bought these Senso headphones to replace mine. These are really good wireless headphones for the price!! They stays in my ears, the sound i great and they are really comfortable. I really recomend them!!!"
1,Had these for a year and these work better than the high priced headphones that I had in the past!
1,"Nice headphones, very comfortable, great sound ,easy to use. connected to my iPod on the first try. I've only used them for yard work and had them in my ears for about six hours with no problems you can almost forget you have them on."
0,Used it once and then it stopped working. Tried every which way to make the Bluetooth connection and it simply refused to pair. Very disappointed. Not recommended.
1,"My dog chewed up by Beats 2 wireless headphones so I tried these.  I like these better.  The cord that goes around your neck is a bit longer which provides more comfort. The ear loops are softer and more comfortable.  The on off button is much easier to use, and the charging port is more accessable.  The sound quality is as good if not better.  Comes with a very nice convertable charging cord.  Excellent value!  It also comes wit a high quality USB car cigarette lighter adaptor.  I wonder how many people still use that type of connection in their cars?"
1,"After trying multiple headphones, this one seems to get the job done. I cannot speak of reliability as I have had it for just few days but these headphones are ergonomic, stays in your ears even when I am training vigorously. Sound quality is good and volume is good. Though I am testing the battery now and see how long it lasts before I can give it 5 stars. Overall satisfied"
1,I liked the product but sadly it had the tendency to fall out of my ears a few times as I began to sweat. This last time it fell out it ended up getting stepped on while running and I'm no longer able to use them.<br /><br />After getting a response from the company and seeing I may have needed to change the buds for better fit I adjusted my review to 4 stars. Would consider purchasing these again.
1,Sounds great and fits well for me.  Love the case so everything can be carried together.
1,Cheap quality
1,"Great ear buds.  Sound is exceptional. Buds very comfortable, Function buttons easy to use.  Fully charged in less than 1 hour."
1,They work great and they were easy to pair with my iPhone.
1,I really like these headphones. Super easy to control.  I find them pretty comfortable as well
1,"Great headphones. Great sound, stay in place while exercising, long battery life and quick charge."
1,Great headphone for the price. Easy to connect to iPhone and reliable. This is my second pair. I had my first pair 1.5 years before it was destroyed by my 1 year old. I use these headphones ~3 hours a day.
1,"Sound is good, comfortable. Great for the price."
0,"Look I know I can be hard on my headphones it's why I went with bluetooth headphones in the first place wires are my nemesis. When my first pair broke I knew it was my fault. Then I lost the second pair, I still have the third pair and they work, gifted the fourth, however the last two who boy. The fifth and sixth pairs both broke in the exact same way. They just stopped charging. I have told so many people about these headphones. I can't believe I did. The fact that the warranty is a joke and they keep telling me I need to reset them. Sorry that doesn't work they won't turn on or charge anymore. I won't be rebuying or telling people about them again. At least not until they can figure out how to actually make their warranty worth it. Ordered May 2018, broken by September 2018; ordered October 2018 broken by January 2019 lasted less than 6 months for each pair."
0,"Biggest pieces of crap headphones. I never get a good signal from these headphone, constantly breaks in and out of signal with the phone in my pocket. Will never recommend buying these headphones ever again. I wish I could zero stars for this product"
1,very good sound with full bass. The noise cancelling feature doesn't seem to do a lot when on a call.
1,I got these for my girlfriend so she can use these to make calls while driving and they are perfect. Great sound quality for her and great microphone quality as well.
1,"Update: After several years of reliability the charging indicator lights no longer work. I thought it was no longer charging but it still is. I have read other user reviews complaining about the same issue or it doesn't charge at all nor has charging indicator lights. This is annoying because I have no way of knowing when they are charged or if they are charging at all. So just a heads-up<br /><br />These are really well made. You can tell a lot of quality and thought went into these. Right down to the packaging. Even the box was well thought out and sturdy. Has a pull-out drawer design with a cloth tab to open it with ease.. It even smells nice. Right down to the clip ties, which there are two of seem well designed and easy to use.  Plenty of extra ear pieces of different sizes, car adapter, and a charging cable for both regular android devices and for iPhones. The battery lasts quiet a long time and charged rather quickly out of the box. About 2 hours. But they had some charge already in them. Once you get a feel for the controls which are located on the right ear piece it's quite easy to use. The mic works well. Friends say they can hear me loud and clear and I can here them loud and clear as well.  the ear pieces go in rather easy and when in they stay put tightly due to the over ear design really helps. So what about the sound? It's got a nice smooth lower end, but these do not delver deep punchy bass. Just a nice smooth lower end, enough bass to be sufficient for most users. But music that relies on a lot of bass response like Hip Hop or anything with dancey beats. This will not be for these kinds of music . Mids are very smooth and the higher registers are quite crisp and clean. You can tell the sound is very good. It doesn't sound in any way cheap, but take into account the limitations involved here. These are tiny little speakers. They don't sound quite as pleasing as my ear cup JVC headphones which can handle a lot more bass and a little more high end. Those JVC's are not that expensive but they do sound better than many sets of headphones I have used. My dad has some $200 Bose headphones that do not sound as good as these Senso's or the JVC's. I think a lot depends on taste if you will like these more or less than I do. Also when one is used to one kind of sound and earphones it can take time to adjust to another. My only gripe is people described these as being able to get really loud. With the volume all the way up on my Samsung smart phone, they do give plenty of volume, but not quite as loud as a cheap $25 set of wired earphones I did use before I got these. All in all though these sound very good, they are clearly made well and even the carry case is not only attractive but built solid with a circular design and zipper function. I don't know much about Senso, but if they keep making excellent quality products like this and are able to sell them at bulk at and very deep discount, I think they could be one of the better makers of reasonably priced high quality listening devices out there. Very impressed thus far for certain."
1,"These were great for the first few weeks, but then there were intermittent connection issues which<br />became frustrating. However, I finally contacted the folks at SENSO and they got back to me in lightening fast time, on a Sunday no less!!<br />Anyway, they gave me instructions on how to re-set  them back to factory settings-and all is fixed, and also I know what to do in case the same issues arise"
1,If i run and start to sweat these fall out of my ears which is a pain.
1,Very happy. Easy to sync to iPhone 8plus .<br />Great sound. I’m able to walk away from phone a good distance and still have them sound like I was next to my phone
1,"I used these headpones to listen music for outdoor running, Amazing sound quality, very good noice cancellation and holds good"
1,"These things are really great. I actually accidentally stepped on them and bent one side a little, but they still play like a champ. Best bang for your buck on Bluetooth I've had. Great for the gym. Over a year and going strong.<br /><br />Update: I accidentally dropped one side of these in a cup of water. Nothing happened. Didn't miss a beat. I've accidentally stepped on them, slightly pushed in and nothing happened. I'm convinced they are indestructible."
0,"I can no longer recommend these. The battery is dead & will not take a charge. Also the indicator light will  not light up when plugged in. Same cable charges my phone so I know the charger works.<br /><br />See new comments above. (I usually do not like earbuds because of he feeling I get when I insert the earbud into my ear, however these SENSO ActivBuds are comfortable and easy on the ears. The soft rubber earpiece loop is hardly noticeable. They paired up to my Note 5 the first time.  Would recommend these.)"
1,"They have paired with every device so far, great product."
1,Seriously! I have spent almost $100 a pop on those Beats on 3 different occasions and they have broken all 3 times within 2 months. These Senso buds are quality craftmenship and they are sturdy. For the price these are hands down most voted eat buds. Buy them with total confidence.
1,I love the base on the headphones I did not anticipate that.<br />They are also very comfortable and light to wear.
1,Bought 2 of these. One is good but the other is not that good with the sound when listening to music but it’s still good
1,Senso customer service really stands by their product. My headphones stopped charging about 5 months after purchase. I contacted Senso and performed the various remedies they suggested but was unsuccessful. They are sending me a replacement headphone now. Great service.
1,These were a gift and they are great
1,This was one of the best purchases I've made.  The charge will last for 8 hours and the sound quality is good.  They stay in the ears doing moderate exercise.  I'm buying more as Christmas gifts this year.
0,"Was working fine but some cracking off and on during connection. Now during calls and during Skype or Google hang outs. Video and voice calling cuts in and out when I talk. I think I got a junk one from the factory because everyone else I know their works fine. I loved it while it worked but I had a hard time contacting, so 2 star...so hopefully someone from the seller or Amazon contacts me to help me get a replacement."
0,"Have bene through two pairs since January now. Both just suddenly stopped working and refuse to turn on. The company replaced them when the first pair went out but will not be contacting them again to exchange one more time. Going with a different, hopefully more reliable brand that has a longer life than 3 months."
1,It is amazing. It is exactly that i wanted. I use everyday and it is work as new!
1,Just as good as Beats 2
0,Won't hold charge
1,"Great pair of Bluetooth headphones. Have used them twice for a run, they stayed in place and have great sound and volume. Easy to use. My only suggestion is to have another type of wire tie. As a female with long hair up in a pony, it is hard to move up and fell off a few times. I wound up just not using it and had no issues with the connecting wire. Having the one year warranty will be helpful since I trail run at least 4-5 times a week, they will be used regularly."
1,Got these for my husband for Christmas and he loves them! He previously had a pair that cost $160 and he said these are better.
1,"Wow, greaT sound quality, has a high volume capacity, great fit and really love all the extras! Case, extra ear buds for sizing, and even cellphone car accesories. Such a great BUY!!! Most definitely understand why it was in the top 10 wireless headphones. I HAD powerbeats 3 wireless for 3 years until they died, and this would definitely compete with those ! Crazy thing is the prices is NO WHERE NEAR COMPARISON! If you are considering this purchase, search NO MORE. Awesome, super ecstatic with them, had to write review.***"
1,"Excellent product.  doesnt slip off the ears, comfortable, great sound.  Excellent value."
0,The quality wasn’t what I was excepting but not horrible
1,"Excellent sound quality, outstanding noise reduction.  My son loves them!  I will probably buy a pair for myself and my husband as well!"
1,"Great sound quality, no issues connecting with bluetooth, I like that they wrap around the ear (keeps them on when I am lifting weights) and great price."
1,3rd pair will buy again.  Sounds quality really good blocks noise around you to a degree.
1,"Very happy with these headphones. Worn them running rain and shine. Great sound quality, easy to use. I'd recommend these to my runner friends."
1,"5 stars for value, quality, sound. Fast connectivity and amazing sound for around $30. Lightweight and seems durable. Very happy so far."
0,"sound quality was terrible, and the headphones don't sit behind your ear snuggly so they still fall out like regular earbuds. would rather spend more money to get something better."
1,"These headphones came with great value. You do get a dual car charger, a dual micro/lightning USB cable (Its one cable with 2 choices of input), different size earbuds, and a convenient case for the headphones itself. The sound on them is great, not the greatest I've heard but does the job and does it well with decent clarity through bluetooth. The headphones themselves are comfy and pretty much tangle-free. The charge on them is awesome as well since I use them for the gym (holds about 7-8 hours charge). If you need to take a call these do the job as well.<br />Honestly this was the best purchase of a decent affordable bluetooth headset I've ever used. Definitely worth the price and usage."
1,"Hi everyone.. just received my senso blutooth headset. I was so excited to get my first blutooth earphones.. Amazon packaging was good which dont have any damaged items.<br /><br />So far i tested every functionality  of this product and everything works fine. For the cost of 37 bucks i never imagined that we get this amazing headset. No pairing issues, easily paired with my phone. It already came with full charge.<br /><br />Blutooth range is around 20 to 30ft, after that you can here some descripency in the audio, which can be ignored.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Cost wise this headset is an excellent choice. Better than other popular brands in the current market. I am sure that you dont get disappointed.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Previous track was not working properly, which can be negligible.<br /><br />This is my first review. I wil post my full review after using at my workout."
1,Love the air buds. Not being tethered to your phone is terrific.
1,Comfortable. Great sound. So glad I purchased these.
1,Really enjoy this headset. I wear it while working outdoors and sweat heavily with never a problem.
1,They are Pretty comfortable good song
1,"The sound quality is excellent, and the battery holds a lot of time. Excellent !!"
1,"I bought them in March 2017. For about $20 these have been a good pair of headphones that remained in good condition for about 4 years. They pair fast with my smartphone, the Bluetooth has a good range of distance - close to 20 meters. Despite not having the best sound quality, it's not horrible for an inexpensive product. I mostly use them for the gym, the sound is ok and isolates the environmental noise. I only give it 4 stars because recently the silicon around the left earbud started peeling off the cables which are now visible. I am now trying to fix them with some Sugru but also thinking that they don't have much more lifespan left. For this reason, when window shopping for a new pair, I will also consider other brands even if I have to pay a bit more. I would recommend the manufacturer to improve the product's materials."
0,"They were great for a bit, but now they just won't pair. Maybe they arnt was waterproof as they say they are or the self life of these headphones are a few months. So yes, a few months of great sound then 3 months later...don't expect much after that."
1,lightweight and comfortable. Excellent for Anything outdoors.
1,Great
0,Only used for running about 1 hour a day 4-5 days a week. Sound quality was not great. Battery life was okay. Biggest issue is they no longer will turn on after only 6 weeks of use. Trashed em!
1,Perfect. My only complaint is a small one and that is they don't fit under my motorcycle helmet. Otherwise they are great.
1,Good quality for the price
0,While these sounded great the button used for power and volume broke before a month old. Returned!
0,"I loved this product BUT it has stopped working. I received it March 1, 2020, and it failed, quit,  completely kaput May 31, 2020. It no longer syncs with my iPhone. And yes, I've rebooted, etc...<br /><br />I’ve been dithering about trying with another pair because they fit my ears so well, but I don’t want to buy a new pair every 3 or 4 months."
1,paired quickly to cellphone.  comfortable and good sound quality.
1,"These are a great value. Comfortable, fairly stylish, and the sound quality is surprisingly good for the price. Haven't fully tested battery life, but already loving these!"
1,great sound work great stay put when running.
1,"Good product, lasted just short of a year of workouts/running when a wire came loose and rendered them useless."
1,"Decent build quality but the sound was horrible, box also stated it had noise cancellation, if it did well it doesn't work. I think i paid for all the accessories that I don't use rather then the headphones."
1,"I am so pleased with these headphones. So far of all the not so expensive bluetooth headphones I have tried, these have lasted the longest and worked the best, i use them everyday. They also stay charged longer, about 8 hours where my others were only 4 hours. I like being able to pair them with 2 devices which makes switching from one to the other easier. They  do not fall out easily and fit comfortable in my small ears.  I also must mention the awesome customer service I received when I had an issue with my headphones. Doing a factory reset takes care of most problems but if it doesn't just drop them an e-mail and they will respond quickly. So nice to find a company that treats their customers so well."
1,"I bought these for when I work out at the gym.  They stay in place on the elliptical and working with weights.  I have only had them a few days, so I cannot speak to how long the charge lasts.  I keep the volume low and it is just right for me.  They are comfortable and I like the sound.  I recommend them to anyone looking for an inexpensive but functional set of sport buds."
0,Base is good however the sound quality isn't clear. Looking at the good review I thought it would be great however you get what you pay for.
1,👍
1,These are just what I was looking for. They are nice and loud with great sound. I will use them for mowing the lawn. Very happy!
1,These are great headphones. Sound quality is very nice and the battery lasts for hours. I use them for phone calls and listening to music and audio books. Love them.
1,"This product is absolutly anwsome sound great cut almost all the surounding noise, i love so well i bought another kit for my daughter."
1,I bought these after I lost my power beats . I've had 3 sets odd the powerbeats and loved them however they're 199.00. Didn't want to spend that again sip I tried these.  So far I live them ( only day 2) but sound and battery life do fast are great
1,These are comfortable and so far sweat resistant. I've done four long runs and no issues.<br />The ear buds sync with no problems and don't have the audio lag that some Bluetooth head phones or buds do.<br />For the price I am impressed and recommend these for athletes and non-athletes.
1,"Loves first: sound quality and amount of bass is awesome, the multiple silicone sized earbuds, and the fast charge (usually in an hour).<br />What I like less: the hooks over the ears are a tad too flimsy (I’m pretty sure it’s a thicker wire than what it feels like but it feels flimsy to me) and you can’t walk more than 10 feet away before the signal starts breaking up."
1,They're good thx
1,phenomenal. they included extra goodies with the order--car charger with 2 volt settings--and the product is legit. buy with confidence. gym buddies for life.
1,These head phones are awesome! I use them all the time and have only needed to charge them once. They make it very convenient to change the songs with out needing to touch your mp3 or phone. I don't have many negative comments but one of my ears has cauliflower which makes it hard to put it in due to how they are designed to block out sound but I wouldn't say that's  a problem with the headphones just something to keep in mind if you have cauliflower ear.
0,Too big
1,"I got this for my son as a Christmas gift.  He was very impressed with the quality. Unfortunately, just a couple days after the return window closed they quit charging and started having a problem with the battery.  Do they think they can be repaired.  Tempted to order another pair, but afraid the same thing might happen."
1,Great sound quality for the price
0,"Save yourself the aggravation, and pay a bit more for Bluetooth Earbuds.<br />These are cheap, and they lose charge quickly, then fail entirely in a short period of time."
1,"I decided to try these after my LG Electronics Tone Pro HBS-750 Bluetooth Wireless Stereo Headset bit the dust. &#34;Bit the dust&#34; meaning I got tired of its tendency late in its lifespan to keep saying &#34;out of range trying to connect&#34; when it was 2 feet from my phone. This resulted in me snatching it off my head and breaking it into multiple pieces. (One can only take a females voice nagging about &#34;out of range, trying to connect&#34; so many times.) My Senso came in a nice box and nice accessories to compliment it. I purchased these as it had TONS of good reviews and its sole purpose was to listen to music while cutting grass. It came charged so I put them on, pairing was quick with no issues. Picked out a song to test the quality and clarity of the sound. Now mind you I only have my previous pair of LG Tone 750 to compare it to. All was fine until the song started and it was evident these were not as good as my now deceased LG set.<br /><br />Base was ok.. Highs were ok.... Mids were not there resulting in it throwing everything off and making it sound cheap. Now mind you its not an expensive pair, but neither was my LG as I checked the now lower price. Yes the Senso is sweat proof and probably make a good pair of workout earbuds. Good..not great. Will keep them to use this summer but will be going back to my LG brand later.<br /><br />UPDATE 5/21/17 Performed a calibration as suggested by Senso. Sound quality is still not up to par. Returning Item. Great customer service though."
1,Good sound easy to connect well worth the money
1,"These buds worked great for about six months.  No problems at all.  Exercised with them about 3 times a week.  Then one day, mid-routine, they just died--toes up.  Going to purchase another brand this time around."
0,"No better than the $9.95 pair I bought at FYE the other day on sale, although I will say these a comfortable to wear.  I want Bluetooth ear buds to use when I mow the lawn wile playing Mp3's on my Samsung 5S.  If you're sitting still they seem to work fine.  If you're moving they cut in and out all the time.  I would not purchase them again nor recommend them to a friend."
1,Sound quality is decent for the price. No problems so far.
1,"For this price, and for the purpose intended, these earbuds are perfect for me.  In short, I wanted something that worked for the gym:  stays in my ear while I'm sweaty and jumping, makes a good seal to block out external sounds, and something with no wires to deal with while lifting weights.  These do the job perfectly and for a great price.  Outside the gym I always use wired earbuds.  So this review is for one context.  I would definitely buy these again if needed in the future.<br /><br />I won't repeat much of what's been said.  I wanted to address a few concerns I had before buying these and one thing I read in some other reviews (wind noise).<br /><br />- Will that loop over the ear cause my ear to hurt?  I had earbuds with that loop many years ago and they hurt my ears.  No, the loop on these do not cause pain.  At all.  Of course, your experience could differ based on ear size.<br /><br />- That said, there is one part that can cause pain.  Look at my included picture.  For me, that part that sticks out right behind the earbud, circled in red, touches my ear.  And if I wear these for a prolonged period while they are dry and tight I get a bit sore there.  This has happened to me with many earbuds I've owned.  Perhaps I'm sensitive or my ear size is troublesome.  Overall I don't care because I just wear them at the gym and there they don't &#34;stick&#34; into my ear so tightly they cause pain.  Read on...<br /><br />- Will they stay in my ear during a workout?  Yes!  Absolutely.  Over many workouts that have included jumping jacks, burpees, sprints, and jump rope they have not fallen out once.  Now, as you sweat, they will get a tiny bit loose.  So you might find yourself repositioning a few times during a sweaty workout.  But I had no other expectations for workout earbuds!  If an earbud is so tight sweat doesn't make it wiggle a little, then they would have to be too uncomfortable to wear.  I think these are a solid middle-ground.  If I don't bother to reposition them, they do not wiggle so much they feel like they will fall out.  I never worry about that.  They still stay solid enough in my ear that the seal stays and music sounds good.  Getting the right tip is important.  I'm really just referring here to the way the body feels on my ear, not how the tip stays in my ear.<br /><br />- As others have said, battery life, fit, and sound is awesome.  Can't add more.<br /><br />- Wind noise:  Yes, if you run in these there will be wind noise.  Sprints make noise like crazy.  But this is basic physics.  You shouldn't have any other expectations for buds of this style.  They stick out to the sides and are not at all aerodynamic.  My friend with the Beats in this style says they do the same.  In another review, a SENSO rep states you should make sure they are sealed properly.  I have been wearing in-ear monitors for 14 years.  I know for certain I have mine sealed properly and am using the right tips.  That will not help.  Again, this is physics.  Those boxes sticking out from your ears WILL make wind noise and that noise WILL transfer to your ears.  This is unavoidable.  If you are primarily running, these aren't the buds for you.  In my experience, low-profile, wired earbuds do great for running.  Even if you get bluetooth for running, I can't see why you would need this much grip.  I have never once had earbuds fall out only due to running.  I need something like this for active workouts in a gym.  I'm not really sure there is a great single solution for both.  That type with the wing that goes in your ear might work for both, but I fear the wing will cause my ear to hurt."
0,"I have been through many sets of earphones used during workouts and had hoped this pair would stand up and last after reading such glowing reviews. WRONG the set initially worked well, paired easily, had good range but as in all others it no longer will accept a charge. Can't someone develop a set of bluetooth headphones that will last more than a couple of months???This pair lasted all of 2.5 months Big disappointment"
1,"Great quality. Much better than my old, wired, ear buds. These sound great, were easy to setup,  and came with a convenient case."
1,I like it so far... they are comfortable and they work like they say
1,Very high quality and functions very well- Very satisfied customer!
1,Great product and the best support- replaced my unit after it stoped working<br /><br />Well done guys
1,"Very good quality, seem to be waterproof even after they had a hard impact and the right earpiece cover came off; exposing the electronics underneath. Impossible to create a perfect seal now like it was before, and the volume rocker button is off set. Careful when dropping or catching them as the swinging momentum can make it hit the ground much harder than expected.<br />Sound quality is good, bass tones are pretty good with a good seal.<br />Battery life is great."
0,"Overall, I like these earbuds a lot - when they work. I've bought two now  - once in April of this year, they quite pairing and again in July and they quite pairing. I tried all the remedies recommended by the manufacturer (in an Amazon forum) and still doesn't work.<br />Too bad - otherwise I'd have given them a 5 star rating"
1,Good.
1,good
1,Good bluetooth earphones.
1,"These headphones have been great so far.  They fit comfortably over the earlobes, and the wide range of tip sizes means I was able to find a pair that fits snugly in my ears, which both keeps them from bouncing around and provides good isolation from outside noise.  The sound quality seems pretty good to me, but I freely admit that I'm not much of an audiophile, and I'm using them while exercising anyhow, so I may not be as discerning as some listeners.  I was looking for a good pair of workout phones, and I feel like these perform admirably in that role, so I'm happy with that.<br /><br />There are a few negatives, however.  The first is that the volume buttons are tiny and a little hard to locate by touch, so adjusting the volume or skipping a track while wearing them can involve a fumbling.  Also, unlike every other set of headphones I've ever had, volume up/track forward is at the back of the assembly, and volume down/track backward is at the front.  I'm sure I'll get used to it eventually, but for now it's the opposite of what I'm used to, and it's a little annoying.  Finally, the cover for the charging port fits very snugly and completely flush with its surroundings, which is good, but the tab for getting hold of it to uncover the port is tiny.  Even after a couple weeks of practice it still takes me several tries to get it open.  A larger tab and/or a thicker cover (i.e., so that it doesn't sit exactly flush with the housing) would have made getting into the charging port a lot easier."
1,Originally had a problem with recharging. Recipient operator error! They are currently working fine.
1,"I wish I had bought these before I went through 3 pair of cheaper headphones.  I've only worn twice so I will update this review if things change but my first impression is WOW.<br /><br />The headphones fit comfortably and the sound is great.  The cord doesn't cause any issues while running where others I've had create a bounce effect when running.  The headphones pair quickly EVERY time which seems like no big deal except none of my last 3 pair paired so easily, it was always a hassle.  They feel very light and you forget you are running with them.<br /><br />Minor cons (still 5 star product):<br />Slight hiss sound after bluetooth connected with nothing playing.  Gone when you play music and not noticeable between songs (it might disappear altogether).<br />The power/pause button is very easy to hit which is a good thing in one way but bad in another. If I move the headphone to adjust, I find myself pausing the music and since my music app is my background app when running, I have to open the app to restart the music.<br /><br />Positive surprises<br />The amount of additional stuff shipped with the headphones make you sure you will be happy.  I know the description says it has extra buds, dual cable and car charger with 2 ports but when you open the box and have all this it's really nice.<br /><br />Absolutely worth every penny so far.  My last pairs failed after a few months of heavy use. Will update this review if that happens to these.  H"
1,"We always runbafter big brands but expensice things,<br />However this product proven us all wrong !!<br />It is one of the most amazin m earphones i ever used if it is not the best !!!<br />Qjlite of material sound value of money every thing is imppresive diffeantly buy it !!<br /><br />The only draw back nowdays that they dont ship it internationaly any more.. all mybfriends want to buy it again but it dose not ship"
0,"For the first 3.5 months, the product worked great and I was very satisfied. Unfortunately, it just suddenly started turning off automatically thereafter sporadically for about 5-10 minutes of use. Would not recommend as a result."
1,"Comfortable, easy to connect, loud! love them. Only thing is that I use them a lot so I run the battery quite fast, not sure if that can be fixed since they are really small (which I like) so 5 stars!"
0,SQ is bad and Causes fatigue to my ears at high levels
1,Purchased for one of my sons. He said quality is great and sound is clear. He uses them almost everyday.
1,I like them!!
0,"Initially I liked these headphones, but the battery stopped holding a charge after about 3 months of use. Not made to last..."
1,"This headset is great, the quality is fine and battery life is very good. I like them except the fact the one I have received was not sealed and it is a second-hand item.<br />I contacted the seller and they are more than supportive. I return the item and received 10% off to order a new one. I'll for sure order more."
1,These work well for the price. Bigger than I expected.
0,"Definitely began to develop difficulties in connecting the earphones to my iPhone via bluetooth; would audibly say &#34;connected&#34; but not actually connect to the audio function of my iPhone for a good minute or two of turning off the earphones and my iPhone bluetooth, then turning them back on so as to restart the process. Also does not have a magnetic strip on the earphones so as not to lose or drop the earphones as easily (as my previous pair of Phaiser earphones did). Waste of time and money compared to other bluetooth earphones I have owned in the past."
1,Love them!
0,"This crappy headphone stopped charging after I used it two or three times. I tried to contact the seller, to no avail. Don't waste your money."
1,Great! My wife loves them. She hates earbuds but love these wireless.
1,"I love these headphones because they are extremely light and comfortable - a real plus for runners. Customer service is the best, too! Responded immediately to a concern and made things right without any hassle. Highly recommended!"
1,"So far so good, great sound, fit well and loud as hell. Can't beat them for the price!<br />Did my research and these were #5 on the 10 best earbuds list.<br /> I would definitely recommend them!"
1,"I started using these headphones 2 days ago--they've changed my life, especially my workout life. They are amazing to run with. Songs I've listened to so many times sound sharp and brand new. And the earbuds stay put!"
0,Stop working after 2 months.
1,Really happy with these headphones.  Sound is good and connection was stable for an entire half marathon.  Stayed in my ears the while time as well.
0,Im missing the wire tie and a refund has been made
1,The headphones work fine and have great sound
1,Doesn’t cancel noise that well but the sound quality and using for working out are awesome
1,They work great 👍
1,"this headphone is roughly 10$ more than most other adverage devices, but the value is so much more.<br />the sound is incredible, however it is a little lacking in bass...but for 30$ it sounds so so so much better than other devices that cost around 17-22$. I am comparing this to treblab, Mpow. I am very statisfied with this headphone."
0,these headphones only lasted 4 months i also bought the warranty for 3 years and when i tried to contact this company they did not respond. in April 2018 i would of had these for 1 year which would mean i still fell in the 1 year warranty that is given.
1,What a deal for these great sounding headphones. I have nothing to bad to say about these headphones.
0,"I used this for 30 mins, and it started to hurt my ears. I tried different tips and still have the same results. Also I tried connecting it to a different device, but once it is sync you can pair to another device unless the first Device​ is off."
1,"Arrived yesterday. Started using them today at the gym. Ran on the treadmill for an hour. Did some workouts. They never fell out of the ear. Not even sweating was a problem. I have couple different headphones(samsung, lg, iphone) and those always fell out of the ear, specially when working out and sweating. This are great, just perfect. Great sound and very loud. Noise cancellation is great, it works if you crank the volume up but at low still work well. Not the best producing bass but I love this headphones. This are the best headpones for the price I have tried."
0,"Sound quality is nice but these are cheap and poorly made. After very little use, the plastic casing of the headphones broke exposing the interior, i was able to put it back but this makes me question the longevity of this product. Buyer beware. definitely not worth the price, invest in a pair of beats."
1,Husband purchased these. He has no complaints and he loves them for working out.
1,Awesome! I love these headphones and great customer service!
0,It's not waterproof at all :)
0,"These headphones cannot be appropriately volume controlled on an Iphone.  Pick who to blame, Apple or Senso - but, you cannot differentiate volume control in apps from volume control attached to the ringer.  So, there is ALWAYS a generally too loud minimum volume."
0,"I bought these a couple weeks ago and after using them maybe 6-8 times they no longer connect to any of my devices.  I do not know if I just received a defective pair.  Will be looking to get either a refund or a replacement pair, as that type of quality is unacceptable."
1,"10/10 fantastic, battery lasts long, great sound quality, nice set of accessories came with it"
1,Noise canceling and good sound quality for the price
1,"Do NOT buy these if you want them to last the full 100% of power. They last until about 30% and then every 2mins it says ""batter low"" over and over again until they die around 20%. Most annoying thing I can think of is it repeating ""battery low"" as if I didn't hear it the first time..or 2nd..or 3rd..or 4th."
1,"Really working well for me, using them in my office and at home. Earpieces are very comfortable and connectivity is good. Haven't used them outside or working out yet but will be starting next week"
0,"Didnt get around to write a review until today. This unit, although it has great sound would work even better if it could filter sorroundinf sound.  The earpiece is very uncomfortable on my ear, the design is poor as that bubble looking plastic piece behind the rubbery ear piece that goes into the ear, preses too much on my ear an it irritates it. Cannot wear the ear piece for too sue to it irritating my ear, i wish I could have returned the unit for a refund but by the time I came bavk from my overseas deployment it was already too late to even borher. Hope they redesign the unit cause besides that the sound quality is great."
1,Bass
1,I've bought 4 sets of these headphones. The quality of the headphones themselves aren't the best as I've had 3 of the 4 break when dropped 4-5' on a hard gym floor BUT the seller has been great!!! I submitted pics of the broken headphones & they sent replacements in 2 days!  So make sure you register the product warranty when you receive them and be cautious when dropping them. The sound quality & functionality is fantastic especially for the price.
1,"This product is fantastic in so many ways.  It's clear, it has intuitive control buttons, and it has a nice case as well.  My only complaint is that it does a poor job of picking up a signal from my phone while it's in my pocket.  It would work fine if you have an armband holder for your phone I think.  I love it for listening when my hands are free to hold my phone though."
1,they work fine when they work. they require multiple attempts to connect. the cap for the micro USB connection is impossible to open.
0,these headphones worked great for 1 month. I can’t get them to charge which will not allow me to pair them or reset them again. This is the second pair that I’ve had the same problem with. Senso replaced the first pair and I was very happy but the exact same thing happens. To bad because I really like everything else about them
1,"I don't generally leave reviews but felt this product is worth raving about. Just received them tonight, took a few minutes to fully charge, and hooking to your phone is flawlessly simple (most bluetooth is). Once they're on your ears you can hardly tell you're even wearing headphones. The sound quality is actually pretty fantastic and they get PLENTY loud and I'm known for loving music loud. I actually cancelled my KANOA headphone order which is totally wireless in order to try these out, I think even though there is a wire that will make them harder to lose or only wear one if you're trying to listen to someone. Absolutely would recommend!"
1,solid head phones. very happy with my purchase.
1,"&#34; The item was sent as quickly as promised, arrived in great timing, and exactly as advertised. Using the smallest ear buds but they work great. Tested them out to make sure they wold stay in my ear while running and they worked to perfection. Awesome bass in music and sound quality for calls is amazing. &#34;"
1,Nice battery backup and sound quality
1,Excellent
1,Just have been wanting wireless headphones and these are perfect for me.  The sound quality is great!  They are so comfortable and easy to use.
0,"Have been using these earphones for 4 months, primarily during workouts.  Sound is decent, however I've had 3 issues:  1)  Battery charge doesn't last longer than 2 45-60 minute workouts.  Have to recharge to frequently.  2)  When connecting bluetooth, 50% of the time it does not connect and you have to go into Android connection settings to turn on &#34;Media audio&#34; which randomly turns itself off.  Not sure if it's an Android issue or an earphone issue, it doesn't matter to me which one it is because it's a pain.  3)  The cord connecting the two ear pieces is a little too short and rigid.  Because it's so rigid, if you turn your head, it doesn't gently rest at the base of your neck, but gets turned around and hangs awkwardly on one side, or pointing up at the back of your head.  UPDATE:  Since writing this review 3-4 weeks ago, the volume up/down button is broken.  The volume is stuck on low with no way to increase it due to the broken button.  I revised down from 2 stars down to 1."
1,Loved. Me encantan
0,"Worked amazing up until now. I always leave it in the case, when I took it out this morning I noticed one of the buds was starting to break down. I figured I would be ok for one more fun, but no totally broken now. Haven't even had the headphones for 3 months yet."
0,I purchased this item based on reviews. After receiving it I begin to think if the reviews were written by Senso. These headphones are very rigid and do not conform like others I have. The sound quality is what pushed to me buy but isn't near what I imagined it would be. I'm a  disappointed and now stuck with them.
1,"I bought these after trying a few different pairs of regular headphones for work. I work in a large open automotive shop and the shop equipment generates constant noise. The wired headphones constantly get snagged and caught on tools or parts of a car. My goal was to find a pair that was relatively cheap and was Bluetooth compatible. these pair of senso headphones were ones i chose out of a few different pairs on amazon. After about 1 week of use I am pretty happy with my purchase. these headphones have no problem lasting through a 9 hour work day and i have plugged them in at the end of the day every night. the Bluetooth range is okay, what i expect any pair of wireless headphones to be, I cant leave the building without it cutting out but easily get a good 40 feet of length before cutting out. the sound quality is okay but not great, which should be expected for any pair of earbuds in the $20 price range. The treble of the sound is great, just the low frequencies seem like they are muffled a bit and you can never really great a good bass from the headphones but the sound overall is clear. the noise-cancelling is the reason why I bought these headphones and I believe that they work great after spending some time to properly adjust the earbuds to your own ears. the comfort of these headphones is okay after taking some time to fit them properly, although I feel that comfort is something that is different for everyone and you would really just have to try them for yourself, they come with 3 different sizes of soft ear tips to get them to fit just right. overall I believe that these earbuds are great for anyone looking to reduce noise in a loud work environment and cannot deal with the extra wires on their person."
1,"So far so good, very happy with them."
1,SOUND AWESOME. .SOOOO COMFORTABLE. HAPPY DANCE..MAUH.👄
1,"Thoroughly impressed by these little guys, sound quality is great and bass is nice and strong. Could easily have charged more for these in my opinion. I have a pair of sennheisers and paid 5 times as much for them when the sound quality really isnt that different. Once again these where a great buy and if you are wondering whether or not to get these then wonder no more, from a fellow audiophile get them!"
1,"These are amazing. I love these and are comparable to my beets. Would buy again, and i love the smallest ear silicon things, they fit my ears perfectly.<br /><br />Thanks!<br />Ioanna"
1,"I have had these for a few weeks now and they work great!  I use them at home, at the office, at the gym!  Love them!  Easy to set up to and use.  My only critique is when they are running low on battery, it scares the hell out of me when it lets me know.  Last time I actually jumped.  But it is a good incentive to keep them charged, which I do."
1,"I own three pairs of Bose headphones, have owned Klipsh and Polk Audio, so I tend to steer toward higher end headphones. That being said, for the price, I would say these are very good.  First thing I noticed is they are extremely comfortable.  I've used them to run and they are comfortable to wear and don't slip out at all.  Immediately paired with my iPhone with no issues.  Sound wise, they are good.  Don't quite match some high end earbuds, but as I said, very good for the price.  The sound is a little base heavy and you sort of lose the high end just a little.  If you like Beats, you'll probably like these.  I prefer a more even sound, but they are still good.  Battery life is as advertised.  One big positive is the accessories that came with them, a nice hard carrying case, two port USB car charger, and a cord that has both a lighting connector and a mini-USB connector.  Overall, great quality for the price.  I've enjoyed using these on my runs and have had no issues.  UPDATE:  I had some issues pairing these with my Apple Watch 2.0.  Followed the troubleshooting instructions.  Reset the earbuds to factory settings, turned both the earbuds and the watch off.  Powered on the earbuds and then the watch.  Did the pairing process and it worked fine.  So, a little difficulty pairing with the Apple Watch, but the troubleshooting instructions worked."
1,"Easy to put on, good isolation, connection with my phone is a snap—all this, AND the price is amazingly low?!? I dig these babies!"
1,"I have not yet found a pair of headphones as good as these even looking for things triple the price. I have had these headphones for about four years now and they have never let me down. First, they sound amazing and have an impressive amount of bass, in my opinion, though it is not overpowering. Second, they actually work really well for isolating of cancelling out noise. I typically can't hear people speaking to me even if they are only a few feet away from me. I have used them on planes and they really get rid of the drone of the engine. I can't say enough how much I love these."
1,They work well enough and carry a good charge. The wire between the two is a bit annoying but it is good for safety. I do have to readjust often and there is a faint hiss. I’ll keep since I can use at the gym or before sleep and the price was good.<br /><br />I was able to pair them with an iPhone and iPad but couldn’t pair them to my Bluetooth computer.
1,"This headphones are amazing! They are a top quality build and have great sound cancelation. They are very responsive no lags with the bluetooth or delays when switching songs. All the things you get in the box, like the different chargers, extra earbuds and wire tie are a very nice detail, and they top all of that off with a one year warranty. I feel extra spoil. There’s honestly no reason why not to get this headphones if you’re looking for something that will last, they are perfect in every way."
1,Great for the price. Had them for a few weeks now and they hold a charge for 8 hrs still
0,When I got these headphones I thought that they would be great seeing that there were so many good reviews. In actuality they aren't very good at all. They  seem to be always disconnecting from my phone and the wind noise that they produce when riding my bike is awful. I will definitely be purchasing another brand and not use these anymore. The only plus side is that they aren't expensive and I can just toss them and it won't matter.
0,"I had the same pair, but we're branded differently.<br /><br />The wind noise when using them for cycling was unbearable, and I returned them.<br /><br />Even without audio playing they were unsafe to have in your ears while cycling.<br /><br />I'm only writing this review after seeing them reviewed/advertised by Bicycling magazine... and I felt their encouragement for people to buy these headphones was downright irresponsible."
1,I was replacing  a pair of Beats that only lasted a few years. Wish I would’ve found these first. Great product and a great price!
1,Very nice ear buds
1,Nice earbuds.
1,Son loves them
0,They worked well for about six months until they lost capability to connect to my desktop. They pair but they cannot connect. Everything I’ve tried didn’t work. I tried to get in touch with the manufacturer but it is impossible to contact them and/or to download a new driver!!! Their website is a dead end! There is absolutely no support! Very frustrating!
1,These work spectacularly for their function and price point. Great sound quality on the hearing as well as speaking side. I personally returned them because I purchased them hoping to pair it with ny conputer for web conferencing (which is not their intended purpose) and there was a bit too much of a lag. My error does not demean the quality of the earbuds though.
1,"It's an improvement on their previous models in regards to connectivity.  The sound profile now favors the high end so extra EQ'ing for bass, and making sure the ear pieces are snug is the key to get solid bass. Overall a great product."
0,Worked great for 5 months but then the charging port separated from the circuit board. Shoddy construction. Worthless now.
0,I bought these 5 months ago and loved them. They worked great and had great connection. Then out of the blue they just stopped working and will not start again. I bought the insurance as a precaution and find out that the insurance is a scam. Just going to stick with the more expensive kind in the future! Guess I got what I paid for! UGH!
0,"very easy to connect.  i had to download the manual which was easy.  no issues; Update: after using this for a while, I find that the battery charge lasts only about 3 hours, so I am very disappointed.<br />revising my rating"
1,"So far so good, meets all expectations"
1,These headphones work great. I use them for everything. The warranty even worked. After they stoped working 5 months later I called them (1-888-683-4914) and we could not fix the problem they honored the warranty and sent me a new pair. Great headphones and great customer service.
1,I'm EXTREMELY picky when it comes to music quality. I was astonished by the sound quality when I received these headphones much better than others I've tried. I like a deep bass sound and for the price these do great! I can't wait to try them while I work out (fingers crossed.)
1,Easy to blue tooth and loud . Just love the price didn't break me for a great product.  Would recommend
1,"Just received these today. Easy pairing. Great sound. Blocked out my pool pump. So far love these. Can't believe how much I got with these, plus sound quality for the price."
1,sound is good and easy to hook up
1,I like these. Sound good and it plays for a long time on a charge!
1,Teen son is happy.
1,"100% recommended....Very good headphones and very very good seller. The seller answered immediately to the doubts, provide support rapidly and changes the headphones by warranty immediately without objections. The new headphone works very well."
1,Amazing sound!! Fit perfectly. Great purchase.
1,"The headphones are top notch.  Unfortunately, there was a &#34;crackle&#34; in one ear.  After sending an email to customer support on a Saturday night, I received a helpful response within just 2 hours!  The quality of the customer service was excellent--responsive, quick, and competent.  After troubleshooting proved ineffective, I've just received a replacement set of headphones that work perfectly.  Would highly recommend this item--both for the earbuds, as well as in case of the unforeseen likelihood that you encounter any problems.  I've honestly never been so impressed with customer service--they take it extremely seriously.  I highly recommend this product (and the company)."
1,So good for the price! can't beat the quality to price ratio on this buy.
1,"Love this.  They are a little too big to wear under a full helmet but great in general.  The voice clarity is a great benefit as people on the other end of the line, they think im holding the cell to my ear.  Its great."
1,work great
1,Good functional item - I use it at health club. I like the ear holder style - pretty much normal to good sound as expected.
1,these headphones sound AMAZING. I'm laughing at the people who paid 200$ on basically the same headphones just with a different name. Wow these are great!
1,"I absolutely love how these fit and sound. I purchased two pair of these and gifted one.  One pair stopped charging after a couple of months and I contacted their support and had a response w/in hours and they shipped a new pair that same day.  I highly recommend this product not only due to the fit, sound, and length of charge but because if you should have any problems their support is quick, gracious and invested in making the consumers experience a good one."
0,"These are not good at all. The ear piece does not hold them in place. It's a flimsy piece of rubber that is too big to hold tight around the ear. Completely unacceptable.<br /><br />Sound isn't bad, but I cannot look past the ear piece."
1,"Purchased these about 8 months ago and they suddenly would no longer charge. It's not that they wouldn't hold a charge, it's that they would not charge period. I ended up calling their 24/7 365 tech support and they walked me through a few steps before confirming that they needed to send me a new pair. While I wasn't happy about the fact that they failed in less than a year, I WAS happy the customer support experience an treatment I received and that they were without question, honoring the 1-year warranty. Hopefully, these will last a bit longer than the first pair."
1,Great headphones for the money. I really wasn’t expecting the sound quality in these headphones. I just purchased them so it will be interesting to see how long they last. My only con at this point is the size of piece that goes over the ear as this is really large & doesn’t really wrap the ear.
1,Still working per a year later
1,"Excellent headphones! Amazing price! Phenomenal customer service, unheard of theses days."
1,Works perfectly. Haven't had any problems. Owned it for almost 7 months.
1,"These headphones have absolutely exceeded my expectations. They sound incredible, especially for the price. Crisp highs and heavy bass, generally well balanced sound. They can get very loud. They are very comfortable and the battery lasts 6-8 hours. I prefer these over my over the ear AKG N60s."
0,"I bought these to listen to audiobooks on my Kindle so audiophile sound quality was not my goal.  Good thing too since music production was mediocre at best.  I chose these because they were the ""recommended"" earbuds by Amazon for the Kindle.  Bad on you, Amazon.  When rating the stars I was unable to evaluate the noise cancellation, if any, because they were so ill-fitting and uncomfortable I could not wear them for any length of time ...ditto for moisture-wicking.  They were not worn long enough for moisture to accumulate.  I too am suspicious of the 5 star reviews.  I am currently in possession of MANY different brands and styles of headphones and earbuds.  While these are not the worst I have encountered, they are definitely in the bottom 3.  Look elsewhere."
1,Fast delivery. Item as described. Good sound!
1,Great sounding Bluetooth headphones at a very reasonable price. Easy to pair and operate. I would buy this item again.
1,"Sound is decent. About what you would expect at this price point. The build quality falls short in my opinion.  The ear hooks are very flimsy and upon dropping the set less than 2 feet, the protective outer cap popped off resulting loss of the volume control part.  No, I don't expect this to survive any and all unreasonable punishment, but for a device targeted to active persons on the move, it should, at a minimum, be able to withstand a drop of a very short distance."
1,Easy setup works just like described.
1,"An earphone deserves such kind of price. However, not a good earphone."
1,"Wow, very impressed by every aspect of these headphones. Great buy!!!!"
1,Excellent product and excellent experience
0,"These are NOT waterproof. I have a resistance lap pool and sound ceases the moment I dip my head under. They dried and worked again, but returned immediately. Should not be marketed as waterproof 7. Sound is good when they do work though. Would be fine for other exercise."
1,"My second pair of Bluetooth headphones.  I lost the first pair.  Bought Senso for a quarter of the price as the Sennheisers and I can't tell a difference in sound quality!  Easy controls, comfortable fit, good battery life - what more can you ask for?"
1,Just what I needed to ride my bike and listen to music!  They arrived exactly when expected and all was great!
1,"For the price, you cant beat these! The sound is amazing and when used as a handfree for your phone, you come in loud and clear. I would buy again!!!"
1,"Haven't used long enough tbh but so far so good , no big complaints just wish had a more ergonomic design, I gotta keep readjusting piece and first time setup scared me cuz it took like 8 trys like 15 min at the gym just standing there looking like an idiot. Sound is good, still feel weird with the sweat."
1,"Pro: The price on these is great. They work well for both listening to music and phone conversations. Pairing with the first service is quite easy.<br /><br />Con: These aren't very comfortable. The part that you put in your ear is quite large and hard. Additionally, while pairing the first service was easy, the second device want so easy. If the first service is in range, I can't get it to go into pairing mode. I had to turn off Bluetooth on the first service while I paired to the second device. After both were paired, I could turn on both and both worked as expected."
1,"Bought a 2nd pair, love these.  They last a long time, charge quickly, are comfortable, sound great, easy to operate, can do anything with them on.  Best I have had.  Best price for the function and quality."
1,Only con is that they feel slightly irritable sometimes and that they skip often. Apx 4 to 5 times a day. But they are good for the money.
1,"Very, very impressed with these, comfortable, stays in place and sound is amazing for the price!!"
0,This is my second pair of Senso wireless headphones. The first pair I had lasted quite awhile but unfortunately I lost them. I ordered a new pair in May and they worked fine until the last few weeks (August). They started randomly turning off while I was using them (no warning whatsoever). Sometimes I'd be able to turn them back on but usually they wouldn't connect to my phone after that. In the last week they won't turn on at all. I can see that I have a full charge and have tried a factory reset to no avail.
1,They work very good and I’m glad I don’t have to have my phone in my pocket while I’m working out. Battery last quite awhile before needing recharged
1,First pair quit after 4 months on the second set now.
1,"Daily use for 2 years for music, get at least 6 hours per charge, works fine. Range of 25ft from the transmitter in my house, so through walls, longer if there is line of sight."
0,Broken within a month. The charger port is sunken in and no longer accepts the charger. I want a refund! Don't buy these
1,Great product. Exactly what I was looking for: something to fit and stay in my ears that I can be active and workout in.
1,Great headphones great customer service brought two pair. Then did have a issue with the left ear but thank you for the warranty it was fixed.
1,These headphones do the job for the most part but malfunction fairly quickly. I bought them a few months ago and I am already having problems getting them to connect to Bluetooth and I have to hold my phone essentially at my neck for the connection to work (the music playing has poor connection and the song goes in and out otherwise). They work but the effort to make them work has been irritating
0,"Worst pair of earphones ever.  No base, design is terrible.  Cheaply made."
1,"Great sound, comfortable, bought another as a gift for someone else they were so good."
1,Great sound and long battery life. My only complaint is that if my phone is in my left pocket it will sometimes cut out and if left out it seems to fall a bit short of it's advertised range.  20 to 25 feet seems to be about how far I can go.  Otherwise simple to use and no issues.
0,"Lasted about 2 months, then stopped pairing with any devices."
1,These headphones are damn near perfect! Sound quality and bass are phenomenal! Better than 200$ Jaybirds and Beats.<br /><br />My two compaints are that the rubber around the ear could be alittle bit more stiff but they still stay in my ears very well!<br /><br />The other complaint is that the pieces that hold the extra slack of the wires are a poor design.
1,"I got these for my husband, he is very fussy when it comes to headsets earphones etc..He first tried them on and the sound was poor..the ear tips that come with them were to small..He changed them and placed the gel tips on and made a big difference. He loves the sound. Everything about them is explained very well in the instructions that come with them..All he can say is the they are awesome..You cannot go wrong for the price the warranty and the 30 day money back guarrantee...5 stars."
1,So far worked very well
1,"I’ve only had them for a couple of days so I can’t comment on battery life..otherwise there great headphones. One of the ear pieces is like a earplug, fits really snug..love it<br /><br />My 2nd pair because I broke the original ones when I stepped on them. Battery life was good..at least 6 hours of playback. 2nd pair didn’t come with the earplug type ear piece but I’m still happy with the fit"
1,"The product its good and more if you see the price the customer service its really good, i can buy it again, my only little issue its sometimes when i run i feel it little loose but not a big issue this is my third (i give the other ones and they are happy to) i buy and I going to buy another."
1,"Received and installed headphones the same day.  As far as pairing, they were easy compared to others I've had.  Sound, especially stereo, is surprisingly good. Fit is good,  I think the ear support piece could be a little more firm, but not an issue.  I would  recommend buying SENSO."
0,I read the reviews and had high hopes. The audio quality is staticky/crinkly and the microphone barely picks me up. I have other BT headphones that work great. Is my set faulty or is the quality this bad? Maybe that’s why they include the accessories?
1,"Excellent product, crystal clear, comfortable and well made"
0,These are the second pair I’ve purchased. The first were great but the second pair I purchased for my husband have this clicking noise that sounds like a record skipping. Since he never complains I’m only learning about it because I had to borrow them.
1,Gave these to our son for Christmas.  He seems to be happy with them...no complaints!
1,Per girlfriend who's been using them: Huge upgrade from previous apple blutooth headphones in sound quality and the smaller sizes fit her tiny earholes.
1,As good as Beats at a much more attractive price point.
0,I bought this bluetooth on December. Now the battery it doesn't charge any more.
1,"They were working ok for a while and then the side with the controls came apart and I no longer have buttons to press to control it, so it no longer works."
1,As previously said my daughter loves them. She shared them with her wife and she loved them so I bought another set  now everyone is very happy
1,Love to listen to music when I'm working.
1,"Ordered my first pair and they are awesome! Good sound, stay in place decently well. Ordered a second pair as a gift and they arrived at my door broken. Part of the panel was completely ripped off and the frame of the ear piece was bent. Totally disappointed with my second purchase. Sending them back, hopefully to get a better pair."
1,Very nice headphones. The battery life lasts very long. The switch to turn them on and off is a little awkward.
1,I was hesitant to buy this product because I wear glasses and any over the ear products does not fit correctly.  This is the exception.  You can form these to your ears (or glasses). The sound is amazing.  Great buy for a great price.  I would highly recommend these.
1,The quality of this product and packaging was impressive.  Pairing and sound was very good.  However; the ear loops do not hold the headphones in place.  I certainly could not exercise with them on without having to push them back in place.  I would suggest the manufacturer add more rigidity to the ear loops.
1,Sound quality is comparable if not better than the $150-$200 Dre Powerbeats.
1,"I walk about 10 mile a day.  I also have to be able to take calls at all times.  I've tried several options, ie bluetooth in ear for phones (I care TWO)  and body speaker for tunes, and it was just frustrating as well as not functional quality for either.  These allow me to listen to my music IN stereo without broadcasting to the whole world and they connect to my active phone at the same time.  They allow enough external sound to reach my ears with volume turned down to reasonable, which we all should do anyway to prevent hearing damage, so as to be safe to use in traffic. The automatic shift to phone is a big plus over messing with a second device as well."
0,"I ordered these headphones a month ago and the connector to recharge them has broken off inside the headphones.  I've had several pairs of headphones with this type of connector and have never had any issues with them.  So these are now useless as they can't be recharged.<br /><br />Additionally, if there is any slight breeze outside, all you can hear in the wind whipping in the  headphones.  You have to turn up the volume to hear your music, then you are blasting your ears off.  Also, after working out for about 20 minutes (I sweat a lot), the right earphone won't stay in my ear.<br /><br />Terrible headphones.  I would not recommend this brand."
1,I use these while exercising and for normal use.  I have never had them fall out without the cord being tugged.
1,"Only used them once so far just to see how they are, and they're good. Really nice sound. I'm totally happy with the value, price, and sound of it. I can't really hear the difference between these and the wireless Beats that I had on in Costco. A friend was here and listened also and he bought one out of my batch of 3 that I added on. I have one to my wife to use with her new iPhone 7plus instead of the $250 Apple Air buds. Works fine. And one more for a gift to someone down the road."
1,The headphones have a beautiful sound and are very comfortable
1,amazing sound... would definitely buy again!
1,"These head phones are bad ass for the price. Sound is awesome, comfortable. Use theses for crossfit stay in secure. I will buy theses again!!"
1,Love these
1,I purchased a set and was very very pleased with the outstanding sound they produce. After several months the headset stopped working and without any hassle the Senso company provided me a replace set within days of being notified! I am enjoying them once again.
1,They sound great and stay in place very well.  I have other bluetooth headphones that aren't connected to each other and one cuts out all the time.  No problem with these.  They're very comfortable to wear and I love them.
1,Great for working out or on the airplane. Would buy again.
1,"Great product but no matter how I adjust them, they don't sit well in my ears. They tend to fall out a lot."
1,Great coulity for the price and sound is just great
1,Pretty good headset for the prise
1,"Fit is good. Battery life is good. Sound quality is decent. Range is poor. Purchased for gym use, and they serve their purpose at a low price."
1,my cousing loved it! fits perfectly and was a breeze to set up!
0,"Easy to use and setup. Sound is fantastic.  Even though these are earbuds, they didn't cause that pressure vacuum in your ear that other earbuds create.  These are actually quite comfortable.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />I bought these around Memorial Day of 2017.  They quit working around Labor Day of the same year.  They stopped taking a charge and wouldn't turn on any longer, so I didn't even get 6 months out of them.  I only used them while jogging or bike riding so it's not like they were abused at all."
1,"I just received mine, it charged up quickly and works like a champ. I love it!"
1,"After reading other reviews I was quite excited to give these a try.  I've recently started using public transportation and wanted good fitting buds that would help reduce the noise and provide me with some musical isolation.  I usually have to play these with my ipod cranked to full volume and the buds at full volume just to hear decently.  My hearing is not as good as it once was, but I was recently checked and told I'm hearing just fine.  For whatever reason, these are in the &#34;just okay&#34; category.  Price is good and they function."
1,Good love them
0,They have a great sound but they don't last long. They are shorted out already after only having them for 2 months
1,Sometimes when I turn my head the blue tooth fades out for a moment.
1,EZ to pair Via Bluetooth. Decent sound quality. I use while at the YMCA.  Overall would buy again.
1,Excelentes
0,I can't get these to pair at all. I'll try again tomorrow..
1,"Initial impression is very good, Very complete with lots of accessories. Only reason not 5 stars is I haven't used them in anger yet"
1,"My son really wanted the Beats wireless wrap-around headphones, but, at $150, it wasn't necessarily in his budget. I came across these as an alternative. At 1/5 the cost, I thought they were worth the try. They are great! Good sound quality and comfortable to wear."
1,Received very nicely packed with all the charging cables including from Iphone port. I am enjoying the headphones. Very easy to setup. Just pair it using bluetooth.
1,My husband had been wanting a pair of Bluetooth headphones and had searched in various places such a Best Buy.  He ordered these and loves them!  He says they're very comfortable and clear and they were easy to pair with his laptop.  A very good purchase and a good value. Would buy them again or another pair for me.
1,works well
1,"Stay on during my workout no matter what I'm doing, sound quality is great."
1,"Finally got a chance to try these.  They work flawlessly.  If you press to ear, the bass is exceptional.  I will try the other bud options to see if they will go into the canal a little deeper.  But the buds stay in place well."
1,Perfect for running ...... it came on time and was exactly as described
1,"These were a gift from my girlfriend. Love these earphones, I've had them for about 6 months now and my girlfriend is jealous she spent all that money on her Beats. The sound quality is excellent, I wear them pretty much everyday when working in the wood shop, my work warehouse, or out in the yard with the mower and blower and the noise canceling is superb. The ONLY issue I have is that sometimes they initially have trouble connecting to my devices and I have to wait for them to pair correctly with my phone or ipad. But even after all this time they still last around 6-8 hours on a full charge and only take about 45 minutes to an hour to charge. Then my girlfriend lost her pair of Beats so I bought her a pair of these. We now both have a pair.<br /><br />Update: Been quite a while now and the headphones were still working great but my dog chewed them up.. so I just ordered myself another pair👍🏼 Hopefully these are the same quality as the last two pair I received."
1,"Love these. They are easy to use, have a pretty decent range, and keep charged for while. In fact, I use them at the gym for about 30mins 5x a week, and I didn't have to recharge them for over a month! The sounds is really good, and the ear buds mold to your ear. Also comes with a few other earbud caps in case you don't like the &#34;memory foam&#34; ones."
1,Product is as described and shipping was fast.
1,Got laid twice wearing these
1,Best wireless headphones I've owned. Wasn't about to pay hundreds for Beats by Dre and glad I didn't. These work well and sound good. Also double as hands free bluetooth for phone calls. Case and extra ear buds make this an excellent deal.
1,"So far so good excellent sound and connectivity to blue tooth was smooth. Still early just had them for a week bought two pair one for my teenage daughter, so will see what she thinks as teenagers will take them to task 🎼. The only thing at the moment would be cosmetic that the ear piece rap around were interchangeable from flex, flex medium or flex firm. They are very gummy for lack of description but do contour to your ear. Just hope they don't eventually tear off after the one year factory warranty.  price drop to 25.00 during ciber Monday shortly after I purchased for 33 bucks still a good price given the quality engineering and sound. You go Senso!"
1,Works well but I wish battery life was longer. I get about 6 hours before it needs to be charged
1,"I'm really happy with these headphones.  The bluetooth connected immediately, the buttons are SO easy to use (which I appreciate, because sometimes you have to hunt for the buttons), and the sound quality is great.  I'm pretty impressed considering the price I paid.  I thought they'd be more throwaway quality that I wouldn't worry about when (not if) I lose them.  They're good!  If I changed anything I'd make the ear hooks a little more firm.  Not that that they don't work well - they hang on well.  It's just that they're so soft that they give me the impression that they'll fall off. (So yes, I'm bringing up something that feels like it might be an issue, but isn't.)  :)"
1,"Update: I have purchased my second pair! Bit of a design change, button is easier to feel, charge port is easier to open, the part the wraps around the ear is now adjustable. They dont fit quite as good as the last set, but they are a great bargain.<br /><br />So far so good. Hope they last longer than 6 months. I used to have headphones with the neck band, and I like that better so that when I wear one headphone, the other doesn't pull on the one in my ear."
0,Do not buy there is a delay
1,"For the price, these headphones work great.  A key element for me was that they stay in place on my ears while working out.  They do exactly that and sound great too.  For the price point, I highly recommend these.  Additionally, they come with great accessories and they are super easy to function."
1,Comfy with great sound.
1,This is an ammended reviewed. These headphones are awesome probably the best I've ever owned. They are above and beyond the product review. I'm Reccomending them to everyone I know. Kudos
1,"So far it's okay. the sound isn't consistently good and range is not great.  However,  it's handy for not having to have hanging cords.  Nice car charger comes with it for use with android or iPhone plus headphones."
1,Have had for a year now. Around 8 months in the power button started to jam. Eventually the whole left bud cover struggled to stay on.  Connectivity has become spotty as well.
1,"I love wireless headphones but the ones I tried either fell off easily or the battery life was too short. Also one only connected with Chinese commands. I tried some sports buds but fell off when I did even minor exercises. Then I found SENSO ActiBuds and found that they were everything they say. They stay on your ears, get as loud as you want, and the battery life last all day or night of continuous use.  They quickly re-charge in a few hours. I am so happy with them I am ordering another pair for my wife!"
1,These are really good for the price and sound is loud enough for the gym
1,"Great set of Headphone---but-- they died after three month.  SENSO replaced the product, no questions asked.  That is top notch service."
1,First pair broke but that where in the one year warenty and are being replaced :) great quality this is somthin you should not pass up.
1,"I'm not a review guy but I wanted to leave one because after about 4 months of having and really enjoying these headphones the power button broke or stopped working. It seemed like it had lost the ability to make contact with the components inside. Anyway, I contacted Senso through their website received a response within one hour of submitting my claim apologizing for the problem. They requested my order number confirmed that they were still under warranty and shipped a new pair out the same day, no questions asked.<br /><br />This is what I consider great customer service and a company standing by their product. If you're looking for a decent sounding, comfortable pair of bluetooth headphones for a great price I recommend these."
1,"Great for workouts and sound was clear. The case is too narrow to fit them easily. So after so many times of trying to squeeze them perfectly up in the case, the part that goes in the ear broke. I glued it back with Gorilla glue, but it broke again. And of course it was after a year warranty plus not sure if it would have qualified. I liked them so much I brought 2 pair after I misplaced and then later found the first pair. The person I sold the 2nd pair to loved them as well. Bummer. So buy them but keep in the box not the case."
1,I've owned 4 different Bluetooth headphones (all under $60) and these are by far the best... hands down. The base on these bad boys is amazing. And they give you a car adapter and a cord that can charge iphones. If you are on the fence give these guys a try.
1,Found out about these from a friend. I ran 3 miles in these and they are amazing comfy and the sound is awesome. Training for my second half marathon and so far these are a dream. I will totally recommend. The price is great too!
0,"Updates (1/25/2017): Just got Anker SoundBuds NB10 and found it a incomparably better than this SENSO especially in terms of sound and hold. I STRONGLY suggest not getting SENSO. Choose Anker or LG instead. Many of the reviews giving five-stars are not trustworthy.<br />--<br />This is my third Bluetooth head set. It works for music listening and telephone conversations but I'm not very happy with the overall quality.<br /><br />As compared to my another one,  LG Tone Pro HBS-750, which is in the same price range as of Jan 2017, I would say<br />(1) The quality of treble sound is very limited<br />(2) The microphone picks up much more noise, making telephone conversations hard.<br />(3) It easily comes off when jogging outdoor due to against wind.<br /><br />The last point may not be a big problem for treadmill runners, but the hold won't be very satisfactory for most of outdoor joggers."
1,"Comfortable, affordable and as promised, stays put."
1,"Very comfortable,  perfect sound, just got another pair for my wife. Very happy!"
1,Great sound quality and nice carrying case.  Would order again.
0,I purchased these headphones as my wife's were very good. Within 5 days they wouldn't turn on after fully charging. I figured it was a fluke thing/bad pair  I reordered the exact same headphones and now they will not charge. Both pairs COMPLETELY useless. Very disappointed. My wife's are the S250 whereas both of mine were the S-250. This may be the difference in quality.
1,"My favorite headphones ever. While there are certainly headphones with better sound quality, there is no more comfortable, cost effective, and easy to use headphone. I wear them around the house, working out, out around town running errands, everywhere.<br /><br />There is the annoyance of running into the wind where the sound quality is diminished but other than that I can't fault the headphones."
0,"Purchased a few months ago, used sparingly, and already do not hold a charge."
0,Bluetooth range is not very good. Constantly disconnects if i walk as little as 3 feet away from my device.
1,The sound quality is amazing!!!!
1,"Stays in place when running.  You can change the ear plug size.  I wish they had a fourth, smaller size, but the fit is good for the price."
1,My husband really likes these and they are comfortable.
1,&#34;Husband loves them!&#34;
1,Works great.. very good battery life.. nicely fits to the ears.. I use for jogging.. for taking calls.. for a walk.. I just loved it..
1,I enjoy mine. Wear them on the local bike trails. Work great and easy on the wallet
1,"Have issues with the units staying in my ear ... shouldn't happen with the ear hooks.  Other than that,  they work and sound great."
1,It took 4 years of heavy use and abuse to garner a replacement. I wasnt even mad when they finally died. I WON. WE WON. ALL HAIL THESE HEADPHONES
1,I have had these for a few years now and they work just as good as the day I got them. Great value. Comfortable to wear and it comes with extra ear pieces.
1,"Beyond satisfied! My son has the Bluetooth Beats by Dre earbuds and these are highly comparable in terms of sound, maybe slightly better! AND at a fraction of the price!!!!"
1,"I love everything about the earpiece.The headphones work great. I have hearing problems and the still work for me.""<br />It connected to my phone flawlessly, and feels comfortable in my ear."
1,"Pros: fits well, good for running, comfortable fit, good volume range, connects to Bluetooth instantly, no audio/video lag when watching videos over Bluetooth, calls are clear, range is decent, and battery life is decent (about 8 hours and charges quickly with any micro-USB charger).<br /><br />Cons: audio/sound quality is just okay. Not a crystal clear sound. Too much bass (had to adjust the sound on my phone to have almost no bass and it's still high bass).<br /><br />I really can't complain for the price, it's a better product than I expected for the price. It's a good buy and decent product so far (only had them for 2 weeks).<br /><br />2 year update: they're still working well and holding a charge (about 8 hour average). I accidentally ran them over in my rock driveway.. they still work, but the audio quality is shot.. had to glue them back in place, but other than the fact they look like trash now... They still work.. not good enough to use as the sound quality is on par with a CB radio on a dirty channel. I think I got my $20 worth and would easily recommend these to anyone looking for budget wireless earbuds. (6/6/19)."
1,"I have tried a lot of headphones over the years (I am a musician/composer), and lately I've been searching for a blutooth set that will be durable, water resistant, and that will allow me to answer phone calls safely while driving. SENSO Activebuds do ALL of that. And aside from a slightly quiet mic, they EXCELL at battery life, water resistance, durability, and blutooth connection reliability. They stay in and on your ears, even if something tugs on them. They come with a car charger, extra cord, and foam ear pieces for ear protection/sound cancellation. They even come with a case to transport them. Out of over 6 dozen headphones used over my life, I am happiest with these. So stop reading this and buy these headphones before they sell out!<br /><br />#GEreviews on twitter."
1,"Good earbuds, does the job well, however, I do wish these had magnetic ends so it is easier to wear these around the neck. If I were to buy earbuds again, that would be a strong feature I would like to have. Other than that, these earbuds have been well. It is grease- resistance so the ear grease isn't easily visible, but I also keep my ears clean.<br /><br />The one thing you'll probably want to do (after you decide you're gonna keep it) is rip off the flap that covers the charging port. For me, that was just annoying<br /><br />The charge time is okay. I didn't time it, but it's not fast or slow, in the middle I would say. For the nerds, my USB amp meter says the earbuds take in about .1A while charging, but remember the battery is also very small<br /><br />Battery life is okay, but I usually have the opportunity to charge it before it's low.<br /><br />The earbuds do stay secure in my ear. I don't have to fuss them around to fit back in if I am going for a walk or lifting at the gym.<br /><br />The bass offering this gives out is fairly good. My girlfriend has the ANKER SoundBuds slim and the bass on the SENSO is superior to the ANKER<br /><br />The included pouch is okay. I feel like it could have been slightly more spacious because I do struggle fitting my earbuds in there with having the strand poke through, but it's not difficult; just a little annoying. The pouch itself is sturdy, not terribly weak or flimsy.<br /><br />Overall, good earbuds. Has lots of features that I don't make use of day-to-day, but I don't find myself complaining about the lack of features as well."
1,Great Product.  Enjoying it very much and great quality.
0,Didn't like cause to much trouble to synchronize with computer
1,"awesome, easy to access phone calls too"
1,"I purchased the wireless headphones for my husbands birthday. He loves them. He has used them for working out, travel and doing yard work.  We even purchased a pair for my brother-in-law for Christmas."
1,Doesn't slip off when I run. Great!!
1,Stay in place really well. Great volume and easy to use
0,"Look. They sound great, are comfortable and are inexpensive, but they don’t last. I actually have went through many more pairs of these then the three in the picture as these broke after the warranty period so I couldn’t exchange them. I just spent the money and upgraded to AirPods. That all said, I do sweat a lot."
1,Highly recommended
1,excellent product and price! thank you!!
1,"These headphones would have been perfect for what I wanted, but the ear hooks were too flexible (which did not feel secure) and the hooks sat too high and in front of my ears when the buds were put in securely. That's my only gripe about them.<br /><br />The quality and bass were very impressive, better than what I expected for the price. Because the sound was so good IMO with these headphones I am trying a different pair without hooks."
0,I have to agree with sooo many of the other reviewers here. I couldn't go outside with these headphones and you would continuously lose the connection with any movement. I wanted to use these as my workout headphones as I already have a pair of over the ear Sony headphones for everything else I do and I absolutely love those so I know it's not my phone or any other problem. But these Sensos !!?? I guess you get what you pay for but they are absolutely awful...
0,"While they were reliably good quality while I used them, they would not charge or turn on after a month of use. I'm disappointed, the only reason I'm rating two instead of one is that they worked for a bit before finally deciding to quit on me."
1,"I really liked the head phones while they lasted. Sound quality is good, they fit well and stayed in my ears, charged quickly and lasted a while. However the charger port in the R ear piece broke loose inside the unit at only 2 months old making them unable to be charged. I do use them 4 days a week in the gym, at work, and for hands free talking while driving, and changing every night, guess they just could hold up to the heavy use."
1,"I have brought many devices similar to this but this one wins by far. The sound quality is outstanding, I just love it. Looking at it I thought it will be uncomfortable but it was not. I missed and broke one of the ear pieces today and still works like new out of the box. I will have to purchase another as back-up. This is worth the buy."
1,"Only a couple of hours of use so far.<br />- Application: Phone calls & streaming online music from phone and tablet.<br />- Pairing experience - The button functions to turn the units on and initiate pairing are too similar. Must carefully watch for the flashing red/blue pairing indicator. However, pairing worked smoothly for two devices,<br /> - Usage - Comfortable fit and stay on well. Good sound quality. Text and other notifications come through clearly.<br />- Range - Exterior walls affect the 30' range, but generally good. Phones reconnect though as soon as they detect a signal.<br /><br />Have not used enough to need re-charging"
0,"Headphones won't charge after 3-4 months of use. You get what you pay for, I guess."
1,Awesome headphones with great sound quality.  Very pleased with my purchase
1,"The ear buds have been great. I purchased them for my husband as he drives a good part of the day for a delivery company, he has very much enjoyed being able to listen to music and have ease of communication with customers. The comfort level is pretty good, although he has complained of the right ear bud wanting to fall out as it doesn't seem to have as tight a fit as the left and there is no real adjustment other than the different sized ear buds that come with it. All in all they are great, I have been thinking of replacing my bluetooth headset with a pair of these myself."
1,"let me start with the fact that I have a pair of Powerbeats, but have never been really impressed with them. The sound is mediocre at best, they are uncomfortable, and you can hear everything around you as though they aren't on.<br /><br />I bought these for my husband as an affordable alternative to beats and couldn't be more impressed. The sound is spectacular and they are incredibly comfortable. The part that goes behind you ear is flexible and thus doesn't dig into the back of your ear. Least to say, the hubby is beyond happy and I wish I bought these instead of the beats first!!"
1,"Great headphones, great quality. Accidentally broke mine, and they replaced them within 2 days! Great product and great customer service!"
0,"Sadly I am not pleased with this product. I bought them because they specified &#34;Active&#34; and my only purpose was to use them when biking. However the wind noise across them, at any speed, is so distracting I cannot hear music. I tried using the different buds that were supplied with no luck. Worse, these were purchased as a gift in May and opened in mid-June for Father's Day which exceeded the amount of time Amazon allows for returns.<br />The product itself appears to be good quality, includes nice extras and a useful carrying case but otherwise useless to me now."
1,I like them there perfect for work good fit not to tiet not to lose good sound
1,"Amazing how good these sound. I am not a super audophile or anything, but I do strive to have decent headphones. These really sound good. Nice full sound. Very impressed considering the cost."
0,"Had these for a couple of months and they worked great, I was so Happy i ordered them.  After a few months the battery started draining faster and now they will no longer take a charge.  Awesome at first, no longevity."
1,This is a great product! I recommend it to everyone who needs quality Bluetooth earbuds.
0,"I have only had these for a little over two months, and they no longer work. They won't charge, and have essentially turned into a useless piece of plastic. The fit was medicore, and the sound was okay, but now no matter what I do they don't work."
1,Exercise
1,"I love my new earbuds. Could not rate for battery life, as I have only used them once."
1,"Bought for &#34;hard to please&#34; husband. He liked so purchased one more for me , wil see once got in my hands"
1,Had a little snag with my earbuds and senso quickly resolved the problem these earbuds are awesome and customer support is on point and great and I Highly recommend this product. Buy them you won't regret it
1,love it works amazzing
1,I am very happy with my Bluetooth headphones they are great I use them for work for walking for exercising biking I love them
0,Device stopped charging after a month of use. Less than 30 hours total usage.
1,"Good price, great sound. Good for use at gym."
0,They worked for 1 day after that they stopped working completely
1,"Works great, easy to link to phone, Tom of size options for ear buds, nice case, long battery life, great for the gym"
1,Excellent product that provides listening comfort and superior sound quality. I did not know what to expect from such an inexpensive pair of headphones until I started using it. I hope SENSO great success to come.
0,"Main red button stopped working day two. Tried multiple times to contact the company, never got a reply."
1,"I have been using these Senso earphones daily for two weeks now. Excellent sound, pairs automatically with my iPhone 7 Plus and I am very happy with my purchase so far. No complaints. I charge them daily simply because I use them daily on my commute to and from work while on the metro train."
1,These work great with my workouts. They stay in my ears and sound amazing. I don't even have to turn the volume up all the way like I do with other ear phones. The sound has good base too.
1,"good quality headphone, last a week of use of  1 hour a day. sound good. fit good in ear. a little bit bold out of ear to much"
1,"Love these. Good sound, easy to use, and includes several sizes of ear pieces. Really good value."
0,"They work so far, however, the audio quality is noticeably worse than most other headphones I've tried. The bass scrubs out easily on any modern recording, and That's very disappointing. Maybe if they focused on quality of the product instead of the quantity of the accessories, this wouldn't be a problem. Noticeably worse than most headphones of the same type. On button placement is on the side of the right, and is very easy to press when adjusting volume, and interrupts listening experience. I'm probably going to send these back for a different set, or keep this set as a cheap backup pair."
1,Sounds great. Feels great. Battery life seems to be long. Highly recommend.
1,"sound is above average and battery life has been 7+hours, very pleased with product thus far."
1,I love the way they stay in my ears during exercise. The bass is a bit much but all in all a great set of earbuds.
1,They have really good base!
0,Surprisingly bad connection when your phone is in your pocket. Battery life sucks
1,My second attempt at finding a good inexpensive Pair of wireless headphones on Amazon was a success!  These have good range of sound and the bass that was sorely lacking on the first type I ordered and returned is definitely present here. Beginning to think I was going to have to shell out 100 plus to get an acceptable pair and I am glad I stumbled upon these.  Now if they will just hold up. Time will tell but off to a great start!
1,"I like it,  very good quality, unique design.<br />Long battery life.<br />I recommend for others."
1,"Headphones came in very good order. I like the many options included in the package as it relates to the ear plug sizes. Sound quality is also good for the money. Very clear and you can also hear the different instruments. The small carry case is very useful too, compact and neat. Comfort level is good also. I gave 4 stars because I am taking note of the battery life. Overall I am getting a full day without charging but right now I'm using on 4 hour span. The lable said I could get up to 8 hours....let's see.<br /><br />However, I would diffinatly recommend this product to friends.e"
1,"Hi everyone.. just received my senso blutooth headset. I was so excited to get my first blutooth earphones.. Amazon packaging was good which dont have any damaged items.<br /><br />So far i tested every functionality  of this product and everything works fine. For the cost of 37 bucks i never imagined that we get this amazing headset. No pairing issues, easily paired with my phone. It already came with full charge.<br /><br />Blutooth range is around 20 to 30ft, after that you can here some descripency in the audio, which can be ignored.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Cost wise this headset is an excellent choice. Better than other popular brands in the current market. I am sure that you dont get disappointed.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Previous track was not working properly, which can be negligible.<br /><br />This is my first review. I wil post my full review after using at my workout."
0,You get what you pay for but pay some more and get a better one
1,These are amazing. They are super loud and the battery duration is great. They also have a built in speaker for taking calls. they’re light weight and stay on the ear. And super inexpensive considering all that came with these headphones and how well they work.
0,They broke after a month so time to buy some new ones. I hope I get some value out of the next ones I buy.
1,If they are not seated properly they can be somewhat uncomfortable but otherwise are great
0,Do not waste your money. The sound quality is horrible and the earloops are made of spaghetti.
1,Well i received the headset and am very pleased with the quality and sound. I was skeptical at first because of the price. But i am happy i made this choice. If your looking into buying one and are not sure.. dont 2nd guess it! Make the purchase you wont be dissapointed. A++++++ 100% satisfied!
1,Overall this is a decent Bluetooth headphone. The Bluetooth isn't amazing and cuts out if your phone gets blocked but overall it works good for the price. The other issue is the string connecting the two is excessively long but I just tie the end. Sound is good and fits well for long periods of time.
1,"Good for wearing around. Although when running in the wind, you can hear the wind pass over the headphones making it hard to hear the music or book you are listening to."
1,"Love the pause feature also, so I don't have to take them off to hear my trainer speak at the gym."
1,"I think these are too big for a womens ear. They are really big and I have a difficult time keeping them on, I am a 37 year old women with normal ears. Wish I had ran a few more times with these before the return window closed. It connects fairly easily to phones, just remember to turn it off when not in use. The battery does seem to last a long time which is nice."
1,Great Product
1,"The sound is good, and they hold a long charge.  They stay in place fairly well when I run.  It's a challenge opening the charging port. They are a bit bulky when I need to wear a cap over them for cold weather runs."
1,I bought a pair of these for myself and liked them so much I gifted a pair to my brother and he loves them just as much!  The extra bud cushions are great and the expanding foam buds are the best. They cancel noise really well and the volume and bass is just what I like when working out.
1,Battery lasted multiple gym sessions even though I kept forgetting to charge them. Could also go a whole day at work listening to audible after an hour at the gym
1,These are awesome. I had them for over a year without a problem.
1,"connect easily, volume true and sound good.  use for running"
1,Ordered these for my grown son and he just loves them.  Exactly what he was hoping for.
1,Very happy with this purchase. Highly recommend purchasing if you are looking for lightweight durable earbuds. Great product and well worth the money.
1,cool
1,These headphones were a gift for my nephew. He is very happy! Thank you.
1,"Fit great, stay in place while running, just what I needed!"
1,"If you have small ears keep looking. As great as they are sound wise, if your ears are smaller these will not stay on, AT ALL! I can only use them if I am sitting upright and still."
0,This headphone didnt charge
0,I bought these headphones after a more “prominent” brand just stopped working. I have used these a few times a week for gym use since November 2017. They worked great until...THEY JUST STOPPED. They have a full charge but simply will NOT turn on. Of course the warranty is expired and here I am AGAIN without wireless earbuds...
1,Just what I needed. Prompt shipping.
1,"Good quality sound in a compact package, work great."
0,"They are supposed to work up to 30 ft. away.  I used them for walking in the pool and the first day they cut out at about 20 ft.  The next few times they cut out 9-10 ft away.  I made sure they were fully charged, but no change.  These would be fine if you are jogging with your phone on your person."
1,"Fit nice, very comfortable. Work well and will work with 2 devices at the same time."
1,These are amazing! Very easy to set up and the sound quality is great. They are comfortable to wear at the gym and I look forward to years of use. Thank you.
1,"A little difficult to figure out at first ""mostly my fault"", these work great. I really sweat when working out and I have blown out headphones constantly from sweat. No issue yet with these headphones, good sound, good range from BT. I highly recommend these!"
1,I am torn on these headphones. The price is great. They appear to be made of cheap materials but they have held up well to my workouts. Battery life hasn't been an issue at all. My issue is with the sound. I haven't used them in a long time but I think in terms of sound they are comparable to a cheap $10 of wired earbuds. At louder volumes the sound of music is poor and there is a slight tin to it. Good for the price but I can't say these headphones could even remotely compare to even a slightly higher end model
1,Given the rating of these bluetooth ear buds I decided to purchase these. I'm very satisfied of the quality and easy of connecting these (bluetooth) to my phones music. I have worn these for hours with total comfort.
1,Works just as described. Good sound and quick to pair with my Sony android phone.
1,Very good headset.
1,My husband absolutely loves them. It's everything they said it was ... deep rich tones and clear highs. Would buy again and such a great price!
0,"Too many issues, background noise, bad reception from 1 ft away, save a bit more and get a good product instead."
1,They're comfortable and sound great.  The volume buttons work well and it holds a charge with my sparse usage for two full days.  I have a moto turbo 2 and the multi-function button doesn't start the phone listening like my hbs-800 would.  Very good for the price of the item.
1,For the money they are a very good product. They work in the gym.I use them while I  drive tractor trailer for phone calls so far so good. My wife wants a pair. I
1,Amazing headphones and the connection and it's durability. I use this daily. It holds the charge and charges fast as well. Ready whenever.
1,This is a great product and the customer service was amazing.  I trained and ran a marathon with these headphones.  Recently they stopped working.  All it took was a quick e-mail to customer service and I have a new pair on the way.  Very worth the price.
0,Sound was great when they worked.  I had the product about 60 days and stopped working completely..
0,The headphones may work very well but they do not have options for smaller ear canals.  We had to return them.
1,A little bigger then  expected but a good product and they work great
1,What I like most is the fact these fit my ears and won't fall out like the Apple pods.  They also have the added security of the hook that goes over your ears.  Great product
0,The headphones worked for about a dozen uses then would not pair with my Bluetooth any longer. Sent back.
1,Awesome headphones
1,They are good headphones
1,"I've purchased ""high end"" wireless earbuds in the past and most worked/sounded pretty good. Now let me say.....these wireless earbuds absolutely rock! The bass hits low, the treble is high and they STAY IN YOUR EARS! For the price you would be hard pressed to find a better sounding,longer lasting battery and to me most importantly, they stay in your ears. Great product! DONT BE FOOLED BY THE PRICE PEOPLE!"
1,"I am happy with my purchase, sound of quality is  music is really good, baterry last up to 2 days without charging..."
1,So far so good. Just received a few days ago and used in the gym today for the first time. Very comfortable and stayed on throughout my workout. Easy to pair with different devices and the sound is great. Definitely would recommend these instead of paying over $100.
1,"Early review, but a coworker has had a pair for a few months. They'd been on my list for a couple of months before I noticed he had them. He gave rave reviews, so I made the order. They are great! Comfortable fit, no noise from movement transferring through the cable, and great sound. I used my phone's equalizer to &#34;turn down the bass.&#34; I actually used them for 2 hours immediately right out of the box as they were charged. (I wore them for a run and weightlifting.)"
1,"These are literally the best bluetooth headphones I've ever used. I was amazed by the price and the quality. I've had these for several years now, and use them anytime I'm running or working out at the gym. They don't slide out of my ears, regardless of how sweaty I get, or if it's raining outside. The battery life seems like forever. I've only charged them a handful of times. Couldn't even tell you where their charger is at this moment. Highly recommend!"
1,"The earbuds are great for general use, NOT good for sport.....<br /><br />I use these usually when I'm going around town shopping.  I also used them at the gym when I am lifting.  They are excellent for all of that.<br /><br />Any sort of obsctruction gives these problems though.  When I am riding around on my skateboard, with my phone in my pocket, I get bluetooth interference.  Music keeps cutting out for a second every 10 seconds.  After awhile it gets very annoying.  When I am working out outside doing pushups/pullups with the phone just about 10 feet away, same thing.  Even if I am just walking around.<br /><br />I don't know what it is about just still and inside that makes these work but not outside with minimal movement.  This has happened on 2 phones, so the only constant are the earbuds.  I don't know why walking around the grocery store is fine but walking in the park is not.  I have tried other earbuds and they do not have that problem."
0,Dead after 3 months. The left spkr went out for about a week then both just went dead
1,"Just what I was looking for. I wanted wireless headphones that didn't cost $150+, fit comfortably, and sounded good. I thought the Powerbeats were the solution but man those things are expensive. My girlfriend and I ordered a pair of headphones and they are amazing! They fit really well with the original ear pieces. There are two other sizes for different sized ears. I ran on the treadmill and felt it was very secure.<br /><br />The sound is really great! I don't have it at the maximum setting and it's still very loud.<br /><br />If you are thinking of getting headphones that are inexpensive yet high quality, buy Senso!"
1,I am thrilled with my new headphones!  Easy to set up and I wore them at the gym yesterday and had the most energized workout I've ever had.
1,"Absolutely the best sounding headphones I've ever used. Bass very strong and highs clear, these have, along with an equalizer, brought me new clarity to my listening.<br />I've had no problem with durability. Lots of outside bicycle riding, hours each day, rain and shine with no issues.<br />Totally satisfied.<br /><br />UPDATE: A pair of these, out of two owned, have just quit working three and a half months in. No response, no lights, no charge, no nothing. Really sorry about this because these are hands down the best inexpensive headphones I've used. We will buy another set they're just that good. The other set, much older, much harder used, still works fine so maybe a sun flare hit the dead ones, who knows."
1,"I ordered these headphones about a month ago and like the sound and fit.  I've always had trouble getting Bluetooth Headphones to stay securely in my ears while running.  These are the best fitting Bluetooth headphones I've tried.<br />Unfortunately after about a month the cover on the earphone broke off.  Things happen, I get it.  Sometimes you knock it just right, or there is some flaw that wasn't detected on inspection.<br />I contacted the seller about an exchange and they responded within 10 minutes of my original email.  After a couple of emails back and forth with some follow up questions they had a new headset shipped to me that day and two days later I had my replacement.<br />Very impressed with their customer service.  Will be buying a second pair for my wife."
0,"quit working after 2 months.just after I could return them.won,t turn on ....junk"
1,Slick look nice sound nice included items
1,Don't spend hundreds of dollars on expensive Bluetooth headphones - These will do the job just fine. They sound great but are pretty bass heavy so be aware of that. Overall great product and great value.
1,"I really like the quality of sound, and it comfortably fits the ear. Their customer service is great as well!"
0,Great headphones but the volume button broke within a few months.
1,Using the headset mostly for phone calls and listening to podcasts and music while commuting. So far so good!  Sound quality is very good and hold a charge for a reasonable amount of time.  Great product for the price.
1,The sound quality is much better than the previous pair that I owned.  Their follow up service and support has been excellent also.
0,"I bought this product awhile back and wanted to just quickly write a review.<br /><br />I would highly suggest looking elsewhere for a product, the cheap Beats I would recommend.<br /><br />These put some pressure on your ears and are uncomfortable after just 10 minutes of wearing them. The sound quality on these is also not very good. After buying them I never used them again."
1,-Easy to pair<br />-stays charged long enough for my use (gym workouts)<br />-The over the ear piece is easy to form to my ears<br />--They stay on while I run and jump<br />-Audio is good enough for me
1,Got as a gift for my husband. He really likes them and they look nice.
1,Just received my headphones and used them this morning  working out and loved them.  Sound was clear and comfortable in my ears.  Great product.  Thank you!!
0,IP7 would be just about right.  Purchased these on March 3rd and they are dead on April 18th.  They won't charge....steer clear!
0,"Comfortable stays in ear and sound is decent. Like every other pair (4 brands and 8 pairs so far) claiming to be sweatproof, these stopped working after 4 or so uses on the treadmill. Charges, but doesn't turn on most times and can't connect to bluetooth when on. Seems like it shorted out when sweat got in it. Everyone is happy to give a refund, seems like that don't actually care about making ones that work though."
0,Second pair I've bought and the plastic outside pieces have fallen off both pair I own. Will not be purchasing a third or recommending this brand to anyone
0,Bulky and awkward like a cheap childrens toy -- other reviews must be fake/spoofed -- lol -- DO NOT PURCHASE
1,👍
0,"The sound is decent, and it connects to my phone very easily.... however the Bluetooth function is pretty terrible. I can be running on the treadmill with the phone set down right in front of me on the treadmill (or on my arm) and it cuts out like crazy. Intermittently it's good and then it's bad again. It's like any sort of small movement interrupts the connection. Drives me crazy when trying to work out. Wouldn't buy again."
1,They are very affordable and work well.  Good sound quality and batter life.  My only issue is the ear hooks are a little soft and they do no stay in my ear during some exercises such as running.
1,Love the sound
1,"Work great,enough  battery for many hours,good sound,only 1.5hours to charge full battery.<br />I recommend to buy."
1,"A vast improvement over the torture device (ear buds) that came with my Ipod. Aside from not having to deal with a wire, these buds offer much improved sound quality, comfort -- plus they're not always falling out of my ears. Getting them to work with your device takes a few minutes but they come with a very clear set of instructions. An excellent value."
0,"Had high hopes for these and was disappointed in light of all the positive reviews. The first thing I noticed when pairing them was that there is a low level electronic buzzing or whining in the left earpiece when it is receiving an audio signal, like music and such. Mind you, I'm not an audiophile by any stretch. It's particularly noticeable with tracks where there is a fade in our out to a track or if there is a slight break in the audio. It's also more noticeable with spoken word audio, like audiobooks or talk radio where there are natural breaks in the speaking, not to mention classical music. I tried a number of things to remedy the issue, such as restarting my iPhone, resetting the headset, eliminating any other competing bluetooth signals, and even different devices. The whining/buzzing was still present. I even ordered a second pair and found the exact same issue. For whatever reason, the issue is not present in the right earphone (yes, my hearing is fine in that ear) on both sets of headphones.<br /><br />The issue, as I see it, rests in the likelihood that this is not a product that the company actually manufactures itself. You'll notice a variety of different headphones on Amazon that basically look identical to these but have a different badge on the side. A review of online overseas sellers reveals that headphones/headsets that look just like this one are sold frequently by way of China and have the same specs, while selling from those markets for around half of what this and other Amazon sellers charge for their branded versions. It is perhaps a lesser known aspect of the manufacturing juggernaut that is China. While seeming to be a high tech product for the casual consumer, headphones like these with personalized branding on the sides is a bit like the custom made pens, mugs, etc. that you can get at any number of local office stores.<br />Long story short, I don't really have an issue with a company reselling items like this under their own brand, but in my experience, it doesn't bode well if there are technical issues with the product. e.g., Does the company/seller have any sway in getting the issues corrected if they are simply one of many resellers and are not actually directly involved in the manufacturing of the product? Or, are they basically stuck reselling the item as-is and left hoping these issues don't crop up or are noticed by consumers?<br /><br />With all of that said, I am debating keeping one of the pairs that I purchased? Why? Because one of the primary uses I bought these for was for listening to music or radio streaming while I'm working, with a key emphasis on staying in place. For example, if I'm working out, mowing the lawn, chainsawing some trees, or even just assembling furniture with some degree of physical exertion, then the low-level whining and buzzing sin't likely to be noticed. I'm guessing that a fair share of reviewers are probably not sitting around quietly either, which might be why the buzzing/whining isn't noticed by more owners/reviewers. So far, they do stay in place pretty well, with the earbud basically staying in place regardless of what I've been up to. I did expect that the earpiece would be adjustable, which isn't the case, so the fact that it stays in place as well as it does with a one size fits all approach is good to see. In sum, I would say that this is a functional headset that will probably work for most folks if they are actively doing something while using them. For anyone who has had more expensive wireless headsets like I have (Jaybird, Pantronics) and that don't have a hearing impairment, then its likely that the buzzing will be noticeable. If you're buying these to be a pair of beater earphones to workout or do yardwork with, these will probably work for you. Don't expect, however, that they will be of the same quality as the brand/model they are patterned after, the Beats Powerbeats earphones. As it is, I will very likely be picking up a pair of the Powerbeats 3 headphones due to the impression the Senso headphones have left me with, assuming some markdowns occur with Black Friday this year. :-)"
1,"Very well made,  The HD  is crystal clear,<br />I have had two or three  other brand's.....And these are by far the best.<br />I really like the on-ear control's,  I have poor dexterity, And find  it hard to  get to the control's on a wire.<br />And the manufactuer's button.....that makes it easy to get to, power/stand-by<br />Are very good at blocking out surrounding noise.<br />This is exactly what I look for in Bluetooth earphones,  something that sound's great, and have ear controls.<br />When I first got these (the new design)  The ear-hooks where gel,  since....the gel has worn out, making it hard to conform to my ear's.<br /><br />Other then then that.... Great......Would Definitely Recommend!!"
1,Outstanding quality sound.  Very light too.  A great value and find.
1,Love them
1,Bluetooth not very good.
1,Works really well. Happy with purchase.
1,"Love these headphones. Great bang for the buck! Had another pair for over a year, sadly my kids got a hold of them and ripped them apart in an effort to brown-nose their mother. I like my music loud in order to drown out the little ones when they get obnoxious, and these get pretty loud. They provide me with an escape via music, audiobooks, and podcasts. Battery life is good, did notice a little accent changed in the voice on the new pair. :)"
0,"after seeing 11K review thought this is great product, after one day Bluetooth pairing doesn't work, tried with iphone and laptop and samsung phone, none worked, i am returning this product"
1,Great headphones.  Good bass And perfect for a workout.  This is my second pair.  I lost the first pair! :(
1,I just bought a second pair of these headphones to keep in my truck. The other pair stays in my gym bag. They do exactly what I expect and you can’t beat the price.
1,The ear phones were a little challenge to put on.
1,Nice sound long lasting
1,Best wireless/Bluetooth headphones I've purchased out of five. Soft and comfortable on the ears and the battery doesn't weigh them down. Clear sound both listening and talking. Very happy with this purchase.
1,"I've used these for several hours now on the same battery. These headphones<br />Are Amazing! The buttons and mic work great with my iPhone, the sound is superb, they stay in your ear, and they were only 35 bucks! I'm ordering some for my wife. Work great for at the gym (sweatpproof) or as a handsfree. And they come with two different charge cables, car charger, a nifty case, and different sized ear tips. Did I mention that they're only $35?"
1,I am very happy with these headphones.  I don't see how you can get a better value.
1,Just got my earbuds and they work great for working out and listening to music.  They don't fall out of your ears and you can pretty much forgot they are there while you workout.
1,I love these headphones! By far the best set I have ever had they last several hours I haven't timed them exactly but I can wear them at work listening to music on my phone and they last at least 6-8 hours on a full charge. I will be buying these again if anything happens to mine
1,"Easy to pair with phone, good for working out! Can feel a bit slippery depending on how sweaty you get but a quick wipe helps keep the pods in place :)"
1,"I use these to cut grass, go to the gym...Great headphones."
1,"Very nice sound quality top to bottom including appropriate bass.  Easily set up; my phone recognized it instantly.  A winner, especially at the price.  My only question is why an extra charging wire and a car plug.  Most of us have these  Would prefer an even more compact case."
1,Great
0,"I've been buying these same headphones for years. They used to last atleaet a year before the battery started failing. Now, I've went through 4 pair in 4 months. I'm a construction foreman and have them in most of the day so that I can hear someone calling me. The static and feedback in the calls is terrible. These used to be different. Best for the money. Now, not so much. Would not recommend at all, garbage."
1,"I previously left a review much higher.  I have been &#34;trying out these headphones because I wanted to give them as gifts.  They are incredibly easy to set up, and easy to  use.  AND the sound is good for what you are paying.  This would be a great gift for a young teen, or someone not concerned with crisp, clear sound.<br /><br />But after an hour or so of listening (I tried them several times) I was ready to take them off.  The sound is not what I'm looking for, and I'm sure my older children would want a higher quality sound.  I'd rather pay more, and get more.<br /><br />Again, this is a great gift for someone not as concerned with clear sound.  They are easy to use, and easy to set up."
1,I like how they are so light weight and hard to see.  Unfortunately just after two months the left ear bud is failing to produce sound.
0,Headphones didn't last more than a couple of months.  They have fallen apart.  Very disappointed in the quality - given the price and the reviews was expecting them to last much longer.
1,Love these headphones! Great while I'm running!
1,"I would say these headphones sound really good. They are comfortable up to about two hours, but what ear buds aren't? For the price, they work great. However, and this is the bad part, the Bluetooth range is about 6 feet. I tried on my iPhone and my Mac and when I walked away, they broke up something fierce. The cables hey send are great. But the small one doesn't work with my Mac. I plug the cable into my Mac and then into my phone, and it connects and disconnects every half second. I should not complain as this is just an added accessory to these earphones.<br />After I bought these, I got an email from the owner thanking me for my purchase. He asked if I had any issues that I should reply to his email. I did. Four days passed and nothing. Great effort on the customer service but fail on the response.<br />Pros: they sound great and are comfortable.<br />Cons: don't get up to get a beer without a loss of signal.<br /><br />I have it three stars because Bluetooth technology should have a greater range. It appears that line of sight is all these headphones can handle.<br /><br />UPDATE: It appears that my range is limited on my Mac. I tried something different on my iPhone 6 and the range was much better. I have an older Mac, so that may be the issue. I left my iPhone in my bedroom and went to the kitchen (30 feet and 2 walls away) and the sound was still great. I changed from three to four stars because of this. Also, it comes with a bunch of extra ear buds. Not too shabby."
1,My husband love these headphones! Neither of us have used bluetooth headphones and are amazed at the quality of sound.  It was easy to pair the headphones to our devices.  They are perfect for our workouts.
1,"So far, so good...great sound!!  Keeping these in my purse, but may get a pair for late night Tv watching...great value!!!"
1,"I had my first pair for 3 years, they spoiled me from anything else. These are the only headphones I'll use now. Super comfortable and lightweight. They come with a ton of different sized ear buds so you can find that perfect fit."
1,"Earphones as far as quality are a 4/5 to me but I give 5 stars because customer service was great! Had a little defect with my first shipment, but they emailed to check up on how it was and I told them, and they took care of the problem easily! I really appreciate the customer service and concern for my issue. Very good earphones, does the job and worth the price."
1,Awesome headphones
1,Love these headphones. Great sound and stayed in during all kinds of running. Better than much more expensive ones ive bought.
1,"Very happy with them, they almost made vacuuming fun!<br />They wouldn't connect to bluetooth.  I called & they walked me thru a couple steps & I have sound again.  Told me to call again if I had more problems.  Good support."
1,"Great design. Ear buds are actually comfortable and stays in your ears while you're doing jumping jacks. Pre-set buttons for volume and such are easy to use and well placed. Can't say anything about the longevity of these things yet, though."
1,"sound quality could be a little better i believe, but still great for the price. sometimes when the battery is low they cut in and out, but that is to be expected.<br />Update: after 2 months, the clicking power button became stuck and I could not power on the device. Sensor customer service was very helpful and replaced the device with ZERO hassle. Very satisfied"
1,Good sound quality for the price. Battery might last half as long as my Anker bluetooth earbuds that were just a little bit more.
0,I purchased this headset because of all the great reviews on Aug 27 2017 and I did not start using them until about mid September and they stopped working first of October!  So I only used a few times over a month and the volume control broke off in headset and from what i see is there is a white volume button broke off in unit (see picture)!  If that would have happened I would have give them a five star!  I will see how hard it is to get warranty to fix and I will issue a follow up review once I find out where to send for repair
1,"I've had these for about 6 months now. They work great once they're paired up with my Bluetooth device. However, therein lies the issue. They are very difficult to pair with my iPad. iPad says they're connected and the little voice in the ear piece says they're connected, but they're not. Only way to know for sure is if the little headset symbol is displayed in the upper right corner where the Bluetooth icon would be. I have to go through this pairing iteration several times before they actually &#34;pair.&#34; Very disappointed"
1,"Love them, good buy, great price"
0,I only enjoyed this product for 1 week and after that it stoped playing. I have recharged it but it won't come on. Wish I could get it repaired or get a new one. The sound quality was good while it lasted.
1,very comfortable earbuds!
1,Came on time.  My wife loves them. No complaints.
1,I just recently purchased these and they are great so far. You can't go wrong with the sound quality either.
1,Thank you for a quality product and follow up customer service.
1,"Crisp, clear sound from a head phone set that can take the volume with distortion. Well worth the money!"
1,They work very well.
1,Good product.
1,The company contacted me directly and thanked me for the purchase and wanted to make sure I was completely satisfied with my purchase and that they would make it right if I was not. Quality is pretty good. Haven't tried other wireless earphones such as Powerbeats 3 to compare but I am pretty satisfied with the purchase. A little muffled sound but overall ok.
1,It works really well and it was a good price!
1,So far so good. Headphones fit nicely and stay in place. Good quality for the price. Excellent customer service.
0,Terrible headphones. Stopped working 3 months after purchase. Do not buy these headphones. A complete rip off. I have tried to reset the headphones and have been unsuccessful. I don't swim with the headphones. I only use while at gym for an hour each time. I have cleaned the headphones and kept in a cool place in the case when not in use.
1,So so at best. Very muddy and cheap feeling
1,I have used these headsets for about a month. I love them!<br />When I use them for music - the sound is great!<br />When I use the them for talking - it is clear.<br />I work in a big city and notice connection may take a few more seconds longer than usual.<br />When it connects- it is announced by a voice so you know it’s on!<br />Great buy and highly recommend.<br />Thanks
1,So far so good. Easy to setup and comfortable. Would definitely recommend to a friend or family.
1,VERY PLEASED TO DATE. SOUND QUALITY IS GREAT AND CALL CLARITY ACCORDING TO PEOPLE I AM TALKING TO IS GREAT AS WELL.
1,Sound is great. Took some fiddling to pair with my device but got it in the end. Great case and charging cables.
1,These fit great & sound great.<br />No issues.
1,"Great product, great customer support and fantastic value. These units are very much as advertised. They fit my ears very well. They are very secure, and come with additional buds, so not a one size fits all, but are customizable to fit your specific ear style.<br />Very straight foreward instructions on pairing.<br />The tonal quality is also very good. I highly recommend these !"
1,best
1,have had some trouble with bluetooth devices in the past. but these head phones are awesome. also they dont cost an arm and leg to buy a pair. pairs easily with all of my bluetooth capable devices. battery life is great and it takes just over an hour to charge them.
1,"1st time for this type of headphones and I don't like the way they feel in my ears, they sound Great! Everything else is good"
1,"Great Sound, passive cancellation, stay in place even with jarring activity."
1,These headphones are amazing. I'm in love with them!!!!
1,"I use these headphones for working out. They are very clear, easy to use, blocks out other noise and more importantly are comfortable and don't fall out when I am running. Great value for money."
1,Love these headphones!! Feels great and the sound is amazing!! I live the adjustable piece over the ear!! I used them every night at the gym for over an hour in a week and they are still going strong. The battery is wonderful!!
1,"My purchase of these headphones was honestly one of the most positive interactions I have ever had on Amazon! Great product, kind sellers, no issues whatsoever! It is refreshing to get something that actually works for a change!"
1,"I would give it a 5 star but I can't seem to get the left earbud to stay in, no matter what size of earbud I use.  I got them for working out, so it was frustrating having to stop what I was doing to put the earbud back in, constantly.  It would be nice if the hooks that go over your ear would be adjustable so you can lock them into place better.  Other than that, the sound quality is great and I love having them."
1,Bought these for my husband. He likes them.
1,Good product nice good price love them
1,"These things work great, buy them! They are comfortable and come with many accessories that you wouldn't have thought of otherwise! Connects quickly to bluetooth and they sound decent for the price. The over the ear is soft and malleable so you dont get that pressure on your ears like the regular hard plastic ear loops."
1,"great sound, short recharge, comfortable.... great purchase"
1,"Great head phones to use at the gym, comfortable, easy to use. I would recommend these."
1,After first use had zero problems with it falling out of my ear and barely noticed it while running
1,"So far, so good. They sound great and are very comfortable."
0,"Sounds fine when connected to device, however, my pocket seems to be out of range. I am tall, but damn."
1,Good sound quality. Ordered these around thanksgiving and I haven't had any problems.
1,Excellent headphones.
1,"I don't do these reviews, but felt complied to after vacation. I wore these on a very splashy lazy river for 3 days & they still work great! The only time they cut out was when my phone was 6&#34; under water so the Bluetooth connection was interrupted! We'll see how they hold up to daily wear, but so far the sound & durability is great!"
1,"Great for running , haven't had a problem with them at all."
1,Pros:<br />- Work Great<br />- Comfortable<br />- Pairs easily<br />- Long battery life<br />Cons:<br />- They're enormous and I have a big head<br />- Sound quality is not on par with other wireless bluetooth headphones on the market. I have 4 different pairs and these have been downgraded to get destroyed at the gym
1,Great quality for a quarter of the price. They work great
0,"Compared to prior ear buds of similar cost, these were not impressive. Very tinny sounding, and little bass."
1,"Great sound, light product. Fits nicely and do not fall when running. Don't expect any great &#34;noise cancellation&#34;, but that's fine. It is a good product..."
1,i enjoyed these headphones so much but my left bud keeps going out! these are the second pair and having same issues .... anyway to have these replaced since it hasnt been a year. Thank you
0,"Overall these are a good fit/feel, but the volume wouldn't go low enough for me to be comfortable wearing them when I just wanted background noise at work."
1,"I recently purchased these buds to replace a pair of J Lab wired buds that I have had for 2 years.  Working for a tech VAR and a accessory distributor I had never heard of this brad, but seeing the amazing price point I gave them a try.  These sports buds have exceeded my expectations and have made my daily bike rides nothing short of awesome. No wires make a huge difference and the sound quality is outstanding!  If you are in the market, pick up a pair"
1,"Construction quality is superb; the operable buttons are well placed and mechanically feel good. Ear fit is good and intuitive, and probably appropriate for most (perhaps all) ears, given the simple design and the accommodating ear hook. Three sizes of plugs for the ear canal as well as foam plugs come with the device, and all are of good quality. Pairing with an older Macbook Air containing a USB Bluetooth dongle for the current Bluetooth protocol was seamless. Sound quality is more or less comparable to that of the wired sports model from the maker best known for noise cancellation headphones. Senso has better bass, no doubt because they fit closer (and comfortably) to the ear canal, and was one of the reasons I made the purchase, since these are designed to fit into the ear canal (whereas my other sports earphones are designed to sit adjacent to ear canal entry and thereby bass response and overall immersiveness is diminished).  In contrast, the treble range seems to have a bit of harshness to it; this comparison is made while sitting in a quiet room and simply listening to the headphones. Based on my experience with a pair of audiophile-level in-ear monitors that sound terrible if the plugs are not fully seated in the ear canal but exceptional when seated properly, it is possible that working toward a better fit with the plugs will improve the treble range quality. So far, I have only used the default pair of plugs, and my ear canals are approximately average in size -- but shape must also be considered.  In terms of sound quality rating and as comparison, I have high-end magnaplanar open headphones with matched external DAC and headphone amplifier, which would net 4.5 stars -- as there are always areas in which earphones can be improved.  Four stars for the Senso represents very good (and probably the highest that such a device would be rated by me) for what is a relatively low-end audio transducer.  It is likely that while listening during physical activity -- the primary reason for my purpose -- the sound will be &#34;better&#34; though I have not had an opportunity to yet do that.  The noise cancellation feature was not tested.  Overall, the product (so far) is well-worth the Amazon price.  I was contacted twice by email from the company making sure that I had no problems with setup; impressive."
1,"It was a good product and it exceeded my expectations. Small issue i faced with the Bluetooth connection, as it breaks up sometimes i am not able to hear the song properly while i am doing the running.<br /><br />Overall, i am happy with the product and I bought another one for my friend as well."
1,"The audio quality of the headset is awesome.  It does not have noise cancelation on it, but other than that , these are great headsets for the money you are spending.  I use these headsets for going to the gym, and taking calls on my iPhone.  Awesome product."
1,The product is ok. It is too big for my ears. Maybe it was designed for old men. Comfortable and reasonable sound quality. I use it on my bike for podcasts and audiobooks and it isn’t loud enough for all.
1,good battery like and easy set up
1,I like it very much since I use it when I stay at gym.Really thanks for your nice product .
1,"This was a christmas present for my husband and I am beyond impressed. It paired perfectly with his apple watch and has a great sounding bass. It also arrived five days before the ETA, and the seller was very friendly. Excellent service and I will be buying a pair for myself soon"
1,Good sound quality. Working great so far
0,"Initial use was satisfactory that I purchased a few more and when one went bad I returned for another.<br />Now I had to return one for credit and am holding the other one because it cannot hold a charge.<br />The warranty did satisfy 1 of 2 purchases and sad because I really enjoyed the use while it worked.<br />As for the one that I have that will not hold a charge, I will ask for a refund or replace with a comparable model that will hold a charge and last for more than 6 weeks. A shame."
0,"Ive had about 4 pairs of these, and had the manufacturer ship me new ones. There's always been either a connection issue with bluetooth, the wire that goes behind the ear falling out, the entire cover to the right headphone coming off (thereby exposing the circuitry inside), as well as poor wire contact."
1,Amazing headphones definitely a bargain. Great sound quality (comparable to air pods) and battery life is superb
1,Easy set up and perfect for my work outs..
1,Can't say enough about this product it's the best I've went through so many Bluetooth this one 0 problems connect every time and sound is awesome not go wrong for the money cheap price for an expensive sound😊
1,"This is only my second day using these headphones, but so far I am very please with their performance.  Hopefully they will last longer than other brands I have used."
1,"I love the sound quality, it's the ear piece that can't close down so it won't wiggle."
1,works very nice
1,I’ve bought this product 3 times. Excellent sound and the phone works well too.
1,"Work and sound great, fit nicely and the battery life is good.  I don't know how long the battery last because it's never run out while I've been using them."
0,"Your Reviews<br />Amazon Customer  is your public name.<br /> SENSO ActivBuds Bluetooth Headphones, Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7 Waterproof HD Stereo Sweatproof Earbuds for Gym Running Workout 9 Hour Battery Noise Cancelli"
1,"I’m new to the whole wireless headphones world. Read the reviews, which were all good reviews and the price was great, so I decided on these. Glad I did. So far they’re great! Love the package they came in!  It was like a little gift box with cool goodies inside. And ...just got an email from Ken Backstrom the prez of Senso asking how I like them and letting me know they have a one year warranty. Wow very cool.<br />I recommend these if you’re looking for above average with great sound at a crazy low price."
1,"I really like these earphones. They work super well, last super long and look great. I have had no issues with these earphones and love using them at the gym, or just when walking around!"
0,Worked great for a few months. Now the sound cuts in and out. Not a battery issue since happens after recharging.  Would not recommend
1,"These are GREAT headphones and a superb value. Plus, they come with 2 charging cables and a nifty case. I am rarely ever sp comp;ete;y happy with a purchase."
1,"This is my second pair. I LOVED my first pair but one of the ear buds broke at the connection with metal showing. No fixing. This new pair gets static very easily and the ear buds don't seem to be as comfortable as first set. Not horrible though.<br />I called customer service regarding the static problem. Customer service was outstanding!! They gave me directions how to reset Bluetooth to stop static. Also, in conversation I explained about the first pair breaking. The company has a 1 year warranty. They are sending me a new set complimentary.<br /><br />Nice interaction and representation of company. Seems they really want you happy."
1,They work great and fit perfectly very happy with them
1,"Fabulous product from a manufacturer I had never heard of.  If you're looking for Bluetooth stereo ear buds your quest has ended.  Delivered exactly on time with all accessories including a case.  Incredible high fidelity base, treble, midrange clear sound and volume that you'll never turn up more than a quarter of the way.  Every function works exactly as you would expect it to with clear well written instructions.  Pairing is essentially instant. Very comfortable to use, and they don't fall off.  You'll forget you have them on.  All aspects of these ear buds are top quality with careful attention to construction, assembly and electronics.  I would give this terrific product six stars if I could.  The sound and performance of these $30 ear buds is as good or better than any big name $200 set."
1,"good solid product, and sound quality is great for the price."
1,the headphones need to have a Little more cable two inches maybe
1,I like them. Work flawlessly so far.
0,Paired with an iphone SE. Even the lowest volume is too loud. Sound quality is not good either.
0,"Did not even last two months. Stopped working out of nowhere. Does not turn on when pressing power button, unless plugged in. If plugged in it will not turn on, just beep twice. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND"
1,These are better than a more expensive pair of blue tooth headphones I previously bought.
0,"Big and bulky, even on the lowest setting the music was too loud for me. It's probably set that way because the bulkiness of the headphones causes a constant whooshing sound from air hitting the headphones and the sound being transferred into your ears, so the music needs to be set louder in order to hear it above the whooshing sound? Returned."
1,Best we have come across
0,"CONS<br />They are constantly unpairing and repairing, so you miss sound and get the obnoxious “pairing” voice all the time. The microphone quality is poor - it sounds like you’re in a cave. They are not comfortable to wear for extended periods. My husband refuses to wear them, they are so uncomfortable.<br /><br />PROS<br />They stay in your ears even when upside down in a yoga pose. The sound quality is good. They hold a charge."
1,"Headphones are great! Microphone picks up a lot of background noise, but good product for the price.<br /><br />Had previously left 4 stars, but company had amazing customer service and replaced a pair of broken headphones, which warrants 5 stars in my book."
1,"Why buy a $150 earphone when a $35 set are just as great. Good sound, very light and comfortable. Buying another one for my wife."
1,These are great! Sound good and hardly notice when they are in my ears. I struggle with ear buds but these are the easiest to wear I have ever used. The buttons are a little tricky to get used to but with a little practice they work well. I really like being able to hear my phone ring and answer my phone with them in. Got a set for my wife too. She loves them.
1,"I really like these headphones, my second pair, but these fell apart. Now they won't pair, I was hoping they could be returned for another pair but apparently they must have a 30 day return policy. If I had acted when it first happened maybe I would have been able to exchange them. So Be advised...buy at your own risk! Ended up calling Senso and they replaced them, turns out they have a 1 year warranty which they honored. good job!"
1,Have only used them for one week but I really like the softness of the ear piece and the sound quality is fantastic.  So far so good!
1,"I am impressed with the sound, however some of the stated functions do not work as described with my IPhone. The song advance doesn't work and some of my call recipients report and echo effect. Sound quality is good for the price."
0,did not fit well
1,I really like the headphones. I ended buying my son a pair too. I wore them on my motorcycle and I wear them to work out. Real happy with them.
1,I ordered 2 pair because a coworker highly recommended them. I HIGHLY recommend these because the quality for the price is great. The battery life is around 8 hours as stated and the Bluetooth range of approximately 30ft is accurate also.  They work great for phone calls.
1,Good quality headphones. Very good sound and bass. Very easy to pair. Connects when turned on faster than any Bluetooth headphones I have used.
1,Solid Bluetooth headphones with decent (but not great) sound quality.
1,"I’ve only had these a few days, but I’ve never been more impressed and happy with a purchase. The sound quality is AMAZING! When I opened mine and played the first song, I immediately went back and bought a pair for my wife. She runs a lot and listens to podcasts and with our daughter, her corded headphones had to go. Thanks for a quality product that I’m sure will last a long long time."
1,Best headphones I have bought to date. Great sound quality and very durable. Also great price. I would rather these than there $100+ counterparts.
1,"Comfortable, easy to use and great sound!  Would definitely recommend!"
1,"The sound is excellent, the build is solid, the range of commands available on the headset very good. The overall impression after a few days is quite positive. Only issues: the earbuds occasionally get tangled. And when I use the earbuds on my bike, the wind creates vortices around the earbuds, partly drowning out the sound of what I am listening to. It is not as bad as with other earbuds, but definitely an issue. Both these flaws could perhaps be fixed by somehow streamlining the shape of the headphones"
0,Stopped working after a few months of use. Won't turn on after completely charged.
1,"This is my first pair of wireless headphones,  They work great sound is good and the battery lasts a decent amount of time.  Only thing I don't like are the controls on the ear piece instead of on the cord"
0,"The sound is great and talking on the phone is fantastic. The battery life is excellent and they charge very quickly. The reason for two stars is the connectivity. It appears the Bluetooth sensor is in the right earbud. It loses signal when my phone is in my left pocket. If my phone is in my right pocket, it will lose signal if I lay my hand on my phone. If I am sitting and looking straight forward while my phone is in my left pocket it works fine, but if I look right I lose connection. This issue is a deal breaker. I plan on checking them on my wife's phone before I return them. I also plan on doing an exchange for a new pair (just in case this is a faulty pair) before outright going for a different set altogether.<br /><br />EDIT: I ordered a second pair to see if I just got a bad set. The mic is even worse on the new ones. I have to completely disconnect to answer phone calls.<br /><br />EDIT #2: I ended up keeping them in spite of the mic not working and using them only for music during my workouts. They almost made it 1 year before the left side quit working. Moving on to better products. Got some JBL's from Walmart and they stay put much better and sound better."
0,"I am not sure who is giving this product 5 star ratings but i am not one of them. These headphones are uncomfortable and i am trying to listen and charge at the same time via usb and it can't even handle that.  I've never had headphones that consumed more power than they drew, but apparently these do.<br /> These headphones are currently plugged into my computer and dying as I listen to music.  Very strange to me and I will not purchase again.  To boast 8 hours of playtime is a joke<br />My phone last well past 8 hours and does way more.  They also don't play very loud. Bought these on recommendation by Amazon and not at all impressed. Stay away."
0,Purchased in February and no longer charges.
1,"So far my headphones work great.  I've had Bluetooth headphones before, but they slipped out of my ear, because of my sweating while working out.  With the ear clips no problems.  Sound great!"
0,These headphones don't hold a charge for very long; I'm so disappointed. They are extremely comfortable but they needed to be charged after minimal use.
1,"Really good sound, and farther range than expected.  Easy to set up for someone who has never worked with Bluetooth.  Mostly use them for listening to audio books that are on my phone while I am in the pool."
1,"Great sound quality and exactly what I needed.  Wired headphones kept getting knocked out during my workout, now I can focus on the exercise and enjoy good music instead."
1,"Bought after getting tired of clotheslining myself with my normal corded headphones.<br /><br />Had to adjust the earbud size after first day; they do come with different earbud sizes and I'm glad they do, as the ones that came with were extraordinarily uncomfortable.<br /><br />Sound is good. The little wrap-around wire that holds the bud into your ear isn't the best. While I appreciate that you can change it's shape, when you're doing high-impact stuff they do tend to lose some grip and have to be readjusted.<br /><br />Honestly, my biggest complaint is that the ""handsfree"" controls are a bit non-intuitive: the + button is back, and the - button is in front. So it was an adjustment to want to change the volume or change a song...and then realize that the button that is most forward on the controls is actually the ""back a song"" or ""decrease volume"" control. Of all the quirks o this product, this is genuinely the one that I have the biggest quibble with. Even than, they're not bad. Certainly not bad for the price. I'd recommend tailoring your expectations accordingly, but def try them out."
1,"I haven't had them long, but the sound quality seems to be pretty good and also good battery life! The travel case is very convenient and the car charger with dual ports is a huge bonus! My favorite thing though- They're so comfortable! Especially during work outs, most headphones make my ears sore, but these are soft, yet fully fit. Never sore!"
1,Love the sound quality. Ear hooks are a little difficult to adjust to get a comfortable fit
0,poor sound and constantly disconnects from bluetooth
1,I love these headphones I have gotten them for my self a few times and I have gotten them for other people because they are fantastic
1,Great for traveling in the airport and on the plane.
1,music sounds muddy to me.  boomy and treble is not clear..
1,"Good packaging and delivery time. So far pleased with the headphones as I get used to new controls, etc. The sound quality is good. And they are comfortable."
1,"What more could we ask for? decent quality, good sound, easy set up and connection. But 2 or three and share with your friends. Great listening"
1,"I've run in these 3x now and they stay nicely in place. I did switch to the smallest ear buds; I do have to fidgit with them in the beginning to make sure they are snug in place, but once I get them in place, they stay.  I have only run in cooler temps... not sure how they will be once I get sweatier."
1,I bought the headphone because my corded one kept getting caught and coming off my head. These Bluetooth ones work great and the battery last long so I can get the whole yard mowed.
1,"Positive: volume can go loud. Easy turn on/off.<br />Negative: After getting used to the ear piece around the ear, I LOVED these, but after a year, it started cutting in and out even though my phone was right next to me.  I would also shut off by itself and I would have to wait a bit before it would turn on.  Eventually, they didn't work at all.  BUT for the year and the price they were great."
1,I like this wireless headset my only trouble is persons can’t hear me when I talk on the phone using it
1,I use it for everyday use. Especially for workingout in the gym. They stay in my ears. Love that the ear hooks bend easily to the shape of your ear. As well as the hands-free calling feature.
1,"My daughter who exercises regularly didn't have a pair of wireless headphones. Also, she didn't have a means to receive calls from her cellphone while out and about.<br />I was on the verge of purchasing Dr. Dre's Beats.<br /><br />I did some research and SENSO appeared to be a  very comparative product. Took the plunge; made the  purchase. Great Choice!<br />She loves it. Great Gift- Great Purchase ! Price is exceptional; the product quality is great - according to my daughter- the heasdphones beats Beats."
1,"These headphones sound great. Music sounds amazing, HD quality. Noise canceling and everything. Just as advertised. So far so good!!"
1,"These are great! I love the noise canceling, and they don't ever fall out of my ears. The bluetooth connection is super! The only thing i would say annoys me specifically is the volume levels if you have a samsung galaxy and are using Google Play Music. I had the S6 and now an S8 and they both don't seem to get quite quite enough. I had the volume on the minimum levels for both phone and earbuds, and it's still too loud sometimes. When I'm watching youtube or facebook videos, volume is fine. Netflix and Hulu can be too loud if I'm watching certain shows. The sound quality is still great. You get all the bass through treble levels in the audio without sacrifice, and the balance is great."
0,Won't hold charge
1,Decent sound for the price. Good fit for running and lifting.
1,Finally found a wireless headphone that doesn't slide out of my ears when running. These are great!  The sound quality is wonderful!
1,"These go bad after a while for unknown reasons.<br /><br />They claim to be ""sports"" earphones, and for several months, they are the best workout ear buds I can find.<br /><br />Then, for some unknown reason, after somewhere between two and three months, they simply will NOT charge.<br /><br />It would be great if they'd figure out why, because they are otherwise exceptionally good buds. Top-notch sound quality, excellent comfort.<br /><br />Please fix your stuff, Senso. There's a reason I haven't bought any in a while."
1,"I like the Senso Bluetooth headphones. The overall fit is comfortable and secure. The microphone for the calling is a bit low, but works. Will definitely recommend this product to a friend."
0,I really wanted to like these headphones. I use headphones for when I workout and my old ones broke. I found this ones and based on the good reviews I ordered. Just used them once and have to return. The sound was really staticky when playing music - pretty much anything with a beat. It worked fine for radio talk show since there was no bass.
1,"I bought these with pretty low expectations, and I was very pleasantly surprised by them. I got them for working in a greenhouse where I was moving around a lot and needed the freedom of bluetooth. Our greenhouse was pretty big and I never had any issues with the range (I always left my phone on the charger). They come with a lot of accessories that most don’t. I have really small ears and have never been able to wear in-ear buds, but these stay in my ears with very few issues, even when I’m sweaty. They have a pretty decent battery life as well as a very common charger type. My 5 star rating is comparing them to others in the same price range, so I’m not saying they are as good as an expensive set. I would 100% recommend these to anyone who wants the convenience of Bluetooth without sacrificing quality or their bank account."
1,"Great set of headphones, especially for the money.  I use them in the gym and they work great!!"
1,My husband got these when his last set of headphones broke. He loves that they’re wireless and uses them every day
1,"I absolutely love these headphones! I had a pair of Jaybird headphones (about $150), and I had the hardest time fitting them into my ears or getting them to stay in (even woth all the different attachments).  Then they stopped working for no reason.  Which is what prompted me to look for new headphones. I was hesitant with these headphones being such a low price, but they are great quality! Easy to put into my ears and take off. I do weight lifting and treadmill running with no issues. I dont have to stop my workout to mess with my headphones, like the expensive brand. I highly recommend these headphones!"
1,"I have bought 5 of these headphones. One for me, three for my children, and one because I suck at paying attention to how much of something I'm ordering.<br /><br />I'm not going to comment too much on the quality or the sound and all that. I am no expert. For the price (on sale at the time I purchased) I found it to a big bang for the buck. They worked well (enough), they weren't perfect, but for roughly 40 bucks a pop, I don't think I could have hoped for better.<br />Occasionally had issues with connecting to Bluetooth (but that could be the wonkiness of other systems involved)<br />Audio 'skipped' sometimes.<br />Generally had no issues though.<br /><br />Point is I was happy with them. So were my kids.<br /><br />But, as all things are wont to do, eventually they failed. As in, every single one of the headphones stopped functioning completely. Well, one didn't get the chance, a dog chewed them up. But the rest that lived long enough to flourish eventually gave up the ghost.<br /><br />The number that comes with the box, with its 24/7 support and minimal wait times (all pluses*) they will walk you through the basics of how to reset the device. If it is deemed faulty, they will replace the headphones with minimal fuss. It is pretty great.<br />BUT!! Keep in mind that the 'one-year-warranty' does not 'restart' with the replacements. If those fail outside of the original time-frame, no replacement will be given. This might be common sense to some, but one can dream can't they?<br />CAN'T THEY!?!?<br /><br />All-in-all, 40 bucks for a decent pair of headphones that get a hassle-free replacement that all together is over a year of use is all gravy to me.<br />No.<br />More than gravy... gravy AND biscuits.<br /><br />I will probably purchase again.<br /><br />*....ew. The plural for 'plus' looks bad<br /><br />Edit: Holy Hell, I didn't realize the price has gone down even further. Yeah, for 20~ definitely worth it."
1,Dislike how it fits around ears. Nice sound
1,Headphones work and sound great. Great for my workouts. Like the compatibility with my iPhone as well.
1,"I bought these Blue Tooth Ear Buds primarily to listen to music or pod casts while I run or lift weights.  I have used a different brand of blue tooth buds and several pairs of wired ones  over the years that all stopped working after a number of sweaty or rainy runs.  So far,  and I ran through a Southwest Florida summer in them, these have worked well and stood up to the punishment."
1,"Easy to use,  stay in the ears well,  excellent sound quality."
1,These ear phones were very easy to pair with my phone and even easier to use.
1,"Love these headphones!  Charges fast,  and the charge lasts for hours on end,  with great sound!"
1,"Excellent product, they work without problems and the battery lasts alot. They are compatible with any bluetooth device, and are very comfortable in the ears (they do not cause pain)."
1,My first bluetooth headphones and I really like the untethered experience.
1,The headphones were great. There was an issue that customer was able to assist with immediately. I recommend this product and company for future purchases.
1,"I've purchased other wireless headphones before at a much greater price that never worked.  The sound is great,  I absolutely love these!"
1,Good
1,Great unit. Fastest connecting Bluetooth device I've ever seen. Battery life on a single charge is impressive.
0,Have not even lasted a year ... never keep their charge ... waste of money.
1,"Great wireless headphones for the price. Been using these for about a year and they still work great. If you are an audiophile and must have top quality sound, these are not for you, but for the casual listener, the sound is great. Lasts about a week for me before needing to recharge. Charges within 40 minutes."
1,Great price for the quality and convenience. Thank you!
1,The SENSO ear phones had good sound. I was very disappointed when one of the two ears quit when they were less than a year old.
1,Good product. Great items and all in one.
1,"After spending $100.00 or more for comparable headsets, I decided to give these a try.  I am guilty of only buying name brand, but I am trying to make smarter choices.  Purchasing this headset was a good decision. They have  a great sound quality for my audio books and music.  They fit my tiny ears very well.  The shipping was quick and pairing was a breeze."
1,So far after a week I like the way they work
1,These headphones are great and l never write reviews. I wear these while working out at the gym this is my third purchase of these only because l keep misplaceing them.
1,"Best sport earbuds I have ever used. They are comfortable, don't fall out of your ear while working out, and the best part, they sound great. Couldn't be happier. I think I will get one for my wife also, since she likes to listen to music while walking."
1,Super!
1,Good sound quality.  Comfortable fit.  So far pretty durable
1,"I really like this product.<br />Great price, different size ear pieces for custom fit and a really great protective case."
1,I enjoy using these headphones though my only problem is that it's too easy for it to be knock off by something. But at least it doesn't cause any discomfort to my ears on long trips and such. Plus I like how I can hear my music quite loud.
1,Better than most!
0,"The headphones don't fit at all! They part hangs way to high above the ear and constantly slips off. Keeping them on my ear while sitting is frustrating, not counting exercising. Always having to adjust them.<br /><br />Sound quality is distant and meh. Them not fitting is part of the audio issue too."
1,"Awesome headphones! I previously had $70 headphones that would always fall out of my ears. These ones look and fit nicely and never fall out during weight lifting or running. The mic works well; my friend was even able to hear me clearly during my outside run. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the sound quality. It's great but it's not perfect for the music I listen to (metal/ hard rock). That's just being picky though. These headphones are so good that after I lost my first pair, I immediately ordered a second replacement. High recommended."
0,"I bought these for my son so he could lift weights without having to deal with wire earbuds. Not even six months and they are broken. He charges it all night and the buds don't even respond. He doesn't use them for sleeping and told me that they don't even start. Who knows, to be objective, I have one that has lasted for almost a year. But it seems too late to return for an exchange. Next time, I will get him a better pair."
1,I have only used them a couple of times but they work great so far.
1,Like it
1,i do love the quality of the sound and materiel
1,Perfect fit for my teen. Also good sound
1,These work as described.  I haven't gotten to use them just tried them out.
1,"Love these Headphones! Great price too! I wear them all the time, very comfortable, and sound AMAZING! The over the ear piece stays put. (I have big ears that stick out so this is very  important for me! Lol! )Also the accessories kit bundle and travel pouch are a hit! Well done!"
0,"I've had my headphones for almost 6months now and they were okay. The sound was pretty good, but I could still hear the wind when I was running outside. And that's okay because after a few minutes I didn't think about the wind anymore and just the music. I never turned them up to full volume because they get very loud. I used them for yard work too. I could get 20ft from my phone before the sound would cut out, and I knew it was time to charge them when the sound would start cutting out 2feet from my phone while running. So after my 6months of use 1-3times a week they died. I did the research to get them to turn back on but they won't. I have never dropped them or tossed or abused them. I expected headphones to last more then 6months for the $37. I think I over paid. I would not repurchase these."
1,With this cheap price there is really nothing to complain about. The first day of using it has some noise. after fully charged for few hours everything was fine. But still it still has light noise from my left side every time I turn my head around. Might be connection problem but minor.
1,"I have stepped on these and broken the main cover off the rest of the bud and smashed them on the ground multiple times caught in a jump rope, all I do is pop the pieces back together and the headphones work great."
1,Great sound and phone mic works great
1,Awesome product! Great sound for a great price!
1,Product as advertised
1,"Very good, and very confortable."
1,"Solid product for the price, and was covered by the warranty. Great customer service"
1,not great for HIIT
1,Quality is nice. They dont fit in my ears well. I returned them for an over the ear pair instead.
1,"I like them very much, easy to setup and very light on ears while running, the sound is good a little bit much base. I like packaging and the small case that holds the headphones, very handy."
1,So far so good. Used them running so far. Sound is great & very comfortable
1,"These headphones replaced  a different manufacturer that failed rather quickly. These fit very well, sound quality is good and battery life is great. Even better, my smartphone indicates the battery status of the headphones. I like theses and the price is very competitive."
0,"Comfortable and decent sound, but has an unreliable Bluetooth connection.  Music will jump, buds will try and connect to multiple devices.  Control buttons are a bit flimsy.  Returned."
1,Got them for him as a Christmas gift and he was blown away by the quality of sound and the depth of the bass. Super impressed.
1,"If you want to know if these really are waterproof, I can confirm they are. I accidently ran them through the washer and dryer after leaving them in my pocket after a workout... I pulled them out and thought for sure they were done. No! They connected just fine and sounded how they always did, which is fantastic."
1,"I have various earbuds (cheap ones and more costly high quality pairs) as I often wear a hat. In this case I wanted something light, comfortable and with noise cancelation/isolation that would stay on my ears for when I ride my bike for miles and miles. I was a little skeptical at first because the ear piece looked bulky - that helps to keep it stable. The buds jut out from the rectangular body. Power on/off, volume and skip/rewind controls are easy. It remembers the last bluetooth device I connected to so I don't need to pair every time unless I want to switch to a different device. It blocks most of outside noise. I found myself using it more often for other situations, like commuting and traveling, and taking conference calls. Since sometimes I have too many calls in a day, I decided to get another one so I can alternate while the other one charges (which doesn't take too long). It takes some getting used to finding the right position at first (ear shapes vary of course and there's no one size fits all), but I got used to it. Sound quality of course doesn't compared to high quality earbuds, but for the price it's pretty good. You get a lot of bang for your buck on this."
1,"I've had these for about 5 months and while they still work, I'm afraid that they're about to die. I have trouble getting them to charge and if I don't charge them after every use they have a lot of static and / or work out of only one ear. I want another pair as a back up for when these die and I'm reluctant to get another one of these."
1,Love these headphones! I workout 4 days a week and I do a lot of cardio and they stay in place and fit comfortably!
1,Probably the best cheap ( price ) headphones you can find! Definitely will recommend and would buy another pair if something happened to these. These are the armoured tanks of the headphone options as I run in rain sleet and snow! They even work great in the sauna! Serious battery life! If I could give 10 stars I would!
1,I’ve only had them a short time but they sound great and are everything I expected.
1,After researching bluetooth headphones I decided on this product.  I was a little unsure about buying them for my daughter's birthday because the price isn't as high as other good headphones.  But this product is great!  The stereo sound is clear and they are super easy to set up and enjoy.  I've  since bought another pair for me.  Yeah!
1,"To be fair, I've only used these headphones for 2 days now. I can't speak to the longevity of the set, but for the $38 I spent on these, I definitely feel they are worth every penny at this point.<br /><br />These offer a very comfortable and secure fit during both weightlifting and cardio. Having the controls integrated to the earpiece is nice, as it spares the discomfort of the control panel slapping your neck as with other bluetooth headphones.<br /><br />The sound quality, while very good, is definitely not what a high end set would offer. But at this price, this set delivers good range and balance. I'd lean that they are a touch bass-heavy, but this is something I enjoy in a workout headphone.<br /><br />Battery life seems to be quite good. Mine have about 5 hours of runtime in 2 days and haven't required a charge. I hope to get 3 consecutive workouts per charge.<br /><br />Bluetooth range seems to be about 30 feet given that there are no large objects between the headphones and phone.<br /><br />Overall, a great set of Bluetooth headphones for all different types of exercise that come at a very good price. If you're looking for a set, I wounderstand definitely recommend them.<br /><br />And no, I'm not a robot or paid reviewer. Although, if Senso is looking to shed a few dollars, I'm your guy and this is your review!"
1,The best
0,"has mic and i use for phone calls, but everyone says its all static sounding. not service issue as i use another pair of headphones and they hear me fine. regret this purchase."
1,"No issues connecting to phone.  Quality relative to price is very good.  Only had a short time, bought for the wife and these are her ratings I put on the product, since she is using the product."
0,"Sound is absolute garbage. No range of frequency, flat am radio quality. Can’t understand why there are so many good reviews. If you actually enjoy listening to music, look elsewhere. Also bulky and uncomfortable. BT connection is flakey. Only plus is being wireless. I tried really hard to like these but just find them un-usable $ in the garage."
0,"I don't like the adjustable ear hook , the first ones i bought in 2017 were the best. Hope they bring back that model."
1,I bought these headphones roughly 4 years ago and I still use them regularly. Because of the pricing of these I never worried about damaging them; I couldn’t tell you how many times I have whipped these across a room. Actually one time I left them on the hood of my car during a rainstorm; I had my doubts but they still worked after. The sound quality has to be favorite part. It has the right amount of bass and the foam eartips that are included add to the depth. You can’t really go wrong with buying these. I’m hoping mine will last me another 4 year. Lol
1,"Forget any of the less than 5 star reviews. The sound is amazing, with a wide range. Excellent bass and mid-range. I bought these for use at the gym and walking to replace 2 different headsets that never stayed put, and honestly sound like crap.<br /><br />I bought a 2nd pair for work.<br /><br />BUY THESE AND TRY THEM, you won't be disappointed."
1,"I always find myself in the review section on Amazon looking for other customers' experiences with products. While I have purchased many things based on these reviews, I have not really written any myself...until now.  These headphones work like a charm.  I could not be happier with this purchase.  After accidentally (okay fine...and continuously) ripping my traditional headphones out of my ears at the gym, I knew I needed a different option.  The Senso headphones arrived quickly, charged quickly, and could not be easier to use.  And...they sound great!  I would definitely buy these again. So...as you look at other products and try to find your best option, know that these are a good choice."
1,"I am surprised how good these headphones are. I received a pair of Bose  $150 sport headphones for Christmas and they will not stay on your ear. The Quality is terrific but they fall off. I've been unhappy with my jawbone for my iPhone seven as you know it has a rubber earpiece the keeps wearing out and sound quality is hit or miss.<br /><br />I just bought and received Bluetooth Headphone,KUPPET Mini Wireless Earphone. Nice package looks great you can't hear anybody on the phone. I give it D.<br />So I thought I would try the Senso with my iPhone for making/ receiving calls. Surprise it works great. I'm going to order another set.<br /> I just cut the cable between the two earphones and keep the right one in the car. If you're left-handed sorry."
1,Best headset I ever ha$.  So comfortable.  Very good service from supplier when I had @ problem.  You can’t go wrong buying this headset
1,I bought the headset to use with a digital bluetooth transmitter on my TV. It helped me clearly hear voices that I was having trouble understanding. The bonus is that I am responding to this survey on my smartphone and listening to music on Pandora with my new Sensor headphones at the same time. Great product - only took a few minutes to sync to both tv and smartphone.
1,I love them so far no problems and they were delivered faster than i anticipated!!
1,Nice product.  Charged quickly out of the box and paired easily with iphone.  Good sound quality when listening podcasts and pandora.  Good microphone with using phone.
1,I received these before delivery date which was nice . They came in great shap. My problem is that I can not get my Kindle Fire to link with them .  It was in the description that they were compatible with kindle Fire 7 but as yet it does. Not find the head phones.  Guess I will have to call somewhere for help
1,"Great value, sound is good quality. The loops that go over your ears are a little large for my ears, which leads to these being a little looser than I would like. The charging cable that comes with these is great, use it for apple and android both."
1,very handy even for a non-techy guy like me....sounds great for its size...and looks elegant for me....t'was a good choice for me!
1,"I absolutely love them! Only thing I would suggest is that the over the ear holder be a bit more sturdy and able to bend and hold on the ear. They just rest on the ear. However, the sound quality and comfort are unmatched for the price! I would trade them for the world!"
1,"Amazing! Bought the Power Beats 3 from Apple and cost $200 with mediocre performance, and returned it the very next day.  So glad to have found this product, it surpassed my expentations and then some.  Made with high quality material with extras.  Pairing was fast and easy! LOVE IT!!!"
1,Works great as a stereo audio device but does not work good for talking on the phone
1,It is good for the price you pay.
1,"The most recent one I had when you turned it on it said ""power on"" at max volume. Haha yea that was annoying but I rate senso close to sennheiser and the battery life is awesome I've had close to 6 of them I think I'm bad about losing and accidentally braking headsets that's where their super low cost is awesome I typically spent 75$ or more on wired sennheiser and these bluetooth are 30$ I'm a happy customer just ordered the wireless ones because I accidentally broke my last corded bluetooth. Anyway figured I should leave a review yea got one messed up one out of many but still loyal"
1,Good for how much I spent. Not the greatest quality but it's still good. If you are looking for decent audio quality and Bluetooth I would definitely recommend them.
1,So far so good no complaints haven't had a chance to use it very much but I do really like them and there very confortable... Sound is good to.
1,A bit uncomfortable in the ear but overall great quality product for the price.
1,"I just go these today, so take that into consideration. The headphones are amazing. Sound quality is on point.... I was using my noise cancelling Bose headphones but I wanted something wireless for working out. Super impressed. I would highly recommend these to anyone. They cam with three different size buds. One of them are like ear plugs that will block a lot of noise. Super easy to pair with device. I can shake my head and they don't move. So far I am very happy.if anything changes I'll adjust my review."
0,"I am a petite woman with fairly small ears. For the past year, I have been using just a regular pair of JVC earbuds for running and the gym which work GREAT. However the jack on my phone started to malfunction, plus the cord from my usual headphones has always been a bit of a bother, so I decided to try and find a reliable pair of wireless headphones for the gym and for running. Unfortunately these SENSO headphones aren't what I have been looking for. I took them out for a run and no matter what I did they will not stay in my ear. I used the smallest covers (which are the same size as on my JVC earbuds) but the ear pieces overall were just too heavy and too big to properly fit and stay in my ear when running. For walking or sitting they would work perfectly. I also thought the sound quality was great. Planning to return and try something else."
1,It’s great use it for work & to listen to music
1,"These earbuds will not fall off during the run!<br />Great sounds all day long - plenty of Bass easy to set up as well, thanks for another great product!"
0,"I bought these things of all the great reviews they had.  I ended up buying them and I thought they where great, played music, answered and called out.  I am a runner, so they would last all week and I would just have to charge them at the end of the week for the next week.  I was such a happy camper.  It was cold at the time when i started running, and I was always wearing a hoody or a sweater and covered my head.  As May came around it was getting to hot to run with a hoody so I stopped wearing one.  That is when the problems came, since I didn't have any pockets I went out and bought a fit belt that carried my keys and cell phone.  At first putting my phone in the belt I started missing music, it would cut out a lot.  I just thought it was my phone was old and that was the problem.  Than the wind started, so i can hear wind traveling into my ear canal.  That became even more irrating.  My wife bought be a pair of Beats can head set, so i started wearing those when I go out on my runs.  I can't hear the wind and the lost of signal stopped.  Was it the head phones the hole issue?  Yesterday, I did a 5k run in town, and used these head set again, and the problems came back.  Well the verdict is in, you pay for what you get it seems.  I would say these are a great entry level head set, but if you are planning on become a runner6-7 days a week and about a hr a day that beware you might have to buy something well better."
1,"Great for the price. My only issue is that the wrap-a-rounds seem flimsy and at times come off. The left ear at times &#34;cups&#34; on the inside as if the sweat is encapsulated inside the ear making it difficult to hear.  Other than that, I enjoy them as much as the Dre Beats that I lost at the gym!"
1,"Went for it based on ratings on Amazon.<br />Have been using it for a few days, so far so good.<br />Comfortable during work-outs.<br />Holds charge well.<br />Good audio quality for the price paid."
1,Very good product for the price! Good sound and packed nicely.
0,"Absolutely no noise canceling in this headset. They apparently think that Qualcomm's cvc6.0 makes them noise canceling. Some marketing idiot is just lying about this feature, as they are at Qualcomm, because you can hear all outside noise on both the earpieces and the microphone at full level. Good sound quality in earphones, but quality and noise canceling are two different things."
0,"I bought these in hopes that they would stay in my ears while running better than my other Bluetooth earbuds. I was highly disappointed and upset when they were falling out of my ears every 30 seconds.  Also they are too big and bulky.  I'm going back to my other ones, at least they stayed in for five minutes."
1,The headphones work excellently. Sometimes it doesn't connect correctly. But not too often.
0,Sound was awful and one earbud you could hardly hear out of. I exchanged them and the next pair was exactly the same except they actually fell apart in my ear on the first wear. I’ve bought these several times in the past without issue. Must have changed manufacturers. The voice was different than the past pairs. Very disappointed
1,"These headphones are insane for the price. The sound quality is awesome (and I listen to rap at the gym, so bass is important to me). The battery life is very long and people can hear you loud and clear when you use it as a phone."
1,So far so good.  Overall sound is fantastic.  Impressive bass. Easy to operate.  Excellent value.  Only used a few times so let's see how they hold up.
1,"This is a great pair of wireless headset!😀 The sound is great and it's easy to pack around, not like my bulky Bose headset. Also it's very user friendly. The price is absolutely worth it.  Thank you senso"
1,"Very good, but short battery charge..."
0,Not very comfortable
1,Easy to follow instructions and pair up but the buds do not fit well in my ears. Wish there were more sizes than what it came with.
1,Just as advertised. Lower cost without lower quality.
1,The sound quality is much better than I expected. They're also more comfortable than I expected. I haven't had a need to adjust them yet so I feel they're secure on my ears.
1,All as advertised.
1,Is exactly what you expect
1,"SOUND AND NOISE CANCELING: The sound is amazing. As a bass head and a person who listens to bass heavy music. The bass is kicking and vocals are clear. Not the best but its good. Noise canceling is pretty good as well. I use these when I go to the gym and they work seamlessly. I don't hear guys grunting and screaming when they lift weights or them talking about protein shakes etc. It all goes away and its wonderful<br />FIT: However... the fit is not as great. Its too harsh and really stiff. I tried different earpieces the box gave me but it still felt hard and uncomfortable. It really needs some work. The earpieces feel too solid and it pushes against my ears way too hard.<br />KIT: This things comes with 2 cables (iphone and android), a carrying case, car charger and ear pieces and wire ties. Its pretty loaded with stuff and its helpful.<br />OVERALL: Great set of headphones sound and noise canceling wise, I was very bummed it was not as comfortable as I hoped it would be."
1,"This product is the best head phone they are made out of good quality materials and the case is durable and the lighting cable are of good quality and it has two charging end one for Samsung and it has the new port for iPhone too.The headphones stay on your ear and it has different size buds and the sound is crystal clear and the rang is better then any I have had and the battery.life is about 13 hours . Every one think I have the beats on but I think you can put them up their around the beat they are better then the LG to me, but look at the picture I attach to this review and let them speak for me and the Quality of sound with music is great and also when ypu are listening to your audible book and just talking on the phone and their is no back ground nosie. I hope this review help you, thank Senso for a great product for a good price and great quality."
1,"great product, great sound, awesome company to order from."
1,Great product for your dollar!
1,So far I am very pleased with these bluetooth earbuds.  They fit great and sound good.  Easy to pair with tablet and MP3 player.
1,good earphones，easy to handle it
1,"Can't beat these for the price you pay. They are comfortable and made of good quality material. They are not the best sounding headphones on the market, but they are still really good for the price. If you are not a sounds snob and want the best bang for you buck, I highly recommend these. And they come with some extra cool stuff like a case and magnetic phone holder thing for you car vents."
1,Perfect Gift
0,Terrible design for fitting and staying on your ears...in a crowd the Phone has to be within6” to a foot away to it will sputter and spurt
1,I love my Bluetooth it’s my second pair in seven years
1,Great Headphones
1,"I purchased this awesome Bluetooth headphone back in February.  Unfortunately the device is not charging anymore.  If not for this issue, I would give a five star rating.  About to contact SENSO to hopefully get another one under their 1 year warranty offer.<br /><br />Since contacting Kimberly at SENSO customer support, I now give them a 5 star review.  She was extremely helpful and quick to reply.<br />After going through the trouble shooting instructions (which, unfortunately, didn't fix the issue) a replacement has been shipped to me.  Thank you SENSO for making my experience with this issue quick and stress free..."
1,"This product is a tremendous value, performance every bit as good as any I have has in the past. Every bit as good as my $250 Apple Buds. At this price I will be buying one or two more sets as gifts."
1,8 hr battery life. Crystal clear with no background noise. Great for the price. Would recommend.<br /><br />Update since original purchase. Bought these a few months ago. Comparable quality to my Anker's which I accidentally stepped on.. The case is nice but I lost the first one on day one. Looked everywhere don't ask I have no idea. The first pair stopped working but the light came on during charging. I did a factory reset per the instructions and they were instantly fixed so watch out for that. I prefer less expensive headphones since I am clumsy and forgetful with them so I tend to look for the best quality I can get at a low price so I can replace them without freaking out. So far these fit the bill. I listen to these seven days a week for a one hour walk and I love them. Now that I have two pairs I will just run them till the battery dies and keep the second pair in my pocket in the case.
1,"These headphones are perfect! #1 they fit perfectly, no slipping or having to constantly re-adjust them in your ears.  #2 the sound is awesome and the volume adjustment is easily accessed as well.  This product is well worth the $38 that you will spend.  I have read some of the negative reviews and honestly do not understand why some people would even say what they are saying. It is like that have to have something to complain about!  You cannot go wrong with purchasing these headphones. The added bonus of getting a case for them plus 2 different type of chargers and a charger for your car is even better.  Speaking of the carrying case. I had expected a cheap flimsy type of case.  That is not the case at all. It is well made and durable.  I buy lots of products on Amazon and this is one of my favorite products ever!"
1,"I am so happy with these headphones.  They are comfortable even when traveling all day.  I could hear perfectly on an airplane at all times, including screaming babies and announcements to get you to apply for the airline's credit card.  They really helped me arrive fresh and relaxed.  I love that they are wireless. I also love that the battery lasts so long (8hrs) and that there is an audible message when turning on/off.  Great sound as well as a great price!"
1,"Excellent product and fast shipping,  easy to use and setup with my Android.  Great buy ☺"
1,"These are some really good headphones for the price. They have really good sound quality and decent bass. The only setbacks are the hardware that seemed to diminish rapidly after regular use in the gym, and then there seem to be issued syncing to multiple devices."
0,"I bought my first pair and I loved them. The sound is good and they were comfortable. After about 6 months  someone at my gym apparently wanted them more and took them. So I bought another set. After 3 months they turned off randomly and I would have to power them back on. In a couple of weeks time they stopped working all together. So, I bought my 3rd pair thinking sometimes things happen and you just get a lame duck. I've had them about a month and they just quit working out of nowhere. It's too bad because they do sound good and they are comfortable, but I don't think that I will take a chance on these again."
1,"Not so great for the person on the other end of the phone... I sound very far away and muffled.  Aside from that, they're excellent."
0,They only lasted about 1 1/2 years with relatively light use.
1,"Worth a lot more - not as good as $100 headphones, but close enough to the point that it does not seem worth it paying for $100 earbuds elsewhere"
1,"Great product..timely shipping, reasonably priced.. definitely would recommend<br />Thanks<br />Darold Buskirk"
1,Great sounding ear buds at a great price. I ordered a second pair for my wife.
1,My boyfriend loves these headphones.
1,"This is my first pair of headphones.  The sound quality, ease of pairing, and comfort while wearing are outstanding for this price point!"
0,"After a couple of months they kept disconnecting and reconnecting to my phone. In the middle of listening to lectures that distorted my professor's voice for 3-5 seconds. I had to stop what I was doing, rewind and listen again, then 5 mins later again, and again. I just destroyed them. Were they low on battery? No, just finished fully charging them. SO ANNOYING."
1,"My husband loves his headset and lost them somewhere, this is a replacement pair."
1,"Great product, great price! Looks and functions like the $100 kind of wireless headphones. Very happy with purchase."
1,Great head phone I can hear the music going 105mph on my motorcycle in Mexico  (with wind noise down the road) if I can change one thing it would be to make the ear buds have a foam or sponge like option I feel like the would help with the noise level in very noise spots but over all very good kit I like the a lot and I feel like there quality is as the same as a $180 Bluetooth head phone
1,"Great headphones and very comfortable, pairing was easy and very fast charging"
1,Amazing headphone
1,Great headphones for the price. So far no issues even with heavy workouts.
1,"Using small silicone ear plugs but,  because they are too tight they come out easily."
1,"I was looking for a replacement pair of bluetooth headphones that I could workout with. These fit comfortably and do not move about . The sound quality is good and meets my personal needs. The microphone sounds great on phone calls as well (it is built into the earpiece). The around the ear piece is a silicon material so it does not feel like a hard piece of plastic against your head. At a fraction of the cost for the &#34;comparable&#34; beats headphones, I have no complaints."
1,"Awesome wireless headphones!! Great sound,great comfort,great accessories and great price! I'm buy 2 more just because."
1,"Pleased and good sound. Was worried about the fit because I have friends that have tried different brands and styles. Recommended by a blogger, and they're comfortable. Easy directions, easy to charge and sync to phone. Thanks!"
0,The headphones stopped working in less than 3 months. I used them about 3 hours per week. Not recommend!
1,It’s an ok pair of headphones. The sound is a little worse than standard apple earbuds. These are good for when I’m running tho.
1,"I was little skeptical while ordering the Senso earphones. The reason I ordered is due to the great avg feedback by over 5000 users. I received these earphones before time.<br />Quality of sound from headphones is very good, connects very quickly to the devices (compared to other earphones I used so far), bass is good, battery life so far has been good (just a week old). Stays well in the ear and does not come out easily.<br />So far has been pretty good. Hopefully will continue to work for some time. Very happy with the quality for the price paid. Better than my high cost Jabra earphone."
1,"Searching for a pair of Bluetooth Headphones is not easy as there seems to be endless choices. I wanted a pair that sounded great, with good bass. I scrolled and read reviews until my brain hurt. I'm also not a fan of ear clips because they start hurting my ears after awhile. But after I saw the video review and saw that the ear clips were soft and flexible, I decided to try them out. They did not disappoint, the first thing I did was sync them to my phone and picked a song. The sound was fantastic, and the fit was extremely comfortable, I could barley notice that I was wearing them. I'm sure that the Bose or Beats might sound better, but I couldn't imagine them being 100.00-150.00 better. I am real picky when it comes to sound quality, and these will do the job. You can't beat the 36.00 price. The battery life says 8 hours. Plus it comes with several extras, a really nice zippered case, extra ear pieces in different sizes, a 2-1 USB charging chord that fits Apple and Android devices, and a car charger with two USB adapter plugs. No need to read anymore reviews as this is the one you should buy. I liked these so much that the next day I bought 2 more pairs for my wife and daughter. Can't beat this Quality for the price"
1,"These are fantastic. Great sound and the bonus is that they came with three different size ear buds. I bought two sets, one for my husband and one for me. I need mine for the gym and we both will use them when we travel. we were amazed how easy it was to set them up to our tablets. I have an iPad and he has an android.  Great price great product!"
1,I'm a runner and these sound good and stay on my ears great!
1,"I bought these to replace another pair of Bluetooth headphones that didn't stay in my ears. I want to like these more than I do, but I can't.<br /><br />From a fit perspective these are quite comfortable, although the earbuds are almost too mushy. I need to change them to some of the other options included. The extras included with the headphones are great; not needed, but a nice touch. The case is essential; it's easy to accidentally turn these on if tossed in your purse.<br /><br />So, why only 3 stars?<br /><br />The beeping. The maddening beeping. At first I thought it was because my purse was turning on the headphones, so I started being more aware of using the case and when I had last charged them. More than once now I've taken the fully charged headphones off the USB at my desk and worn them out of my office and have heard a periodic beep. What's more frustrating is the sometimes, after about 10 beeps, it stops. Other times, it continues until I can no longer take it and switch to my corded headphones."
1,Love these.  Great for running and do just fine with sweat.  Have had them for a few months and no complaints.  The charge lasts a good amount of time.  Worth the money.
1,Works great
1,I absolutely love these headphones. They are very comfortable to wear and easy to set up. The package comes with everything as described. You can chance up the eartip for an even higher level of comfort. They paired up nicely with my Samsung phone. They were a really good choice. Noise cancellation is top notch.
1,I just unbox my new pair of senso headphones. And I must say I am very pleased with the quality of the packaging and the sound quality.<br />These are great headphones for the price
1,Really good for exercising
1,NO LIE! Great Headphones..for the price Whaaaat! Definitely on par with high end earbuds. Just make sure you have a secure and snug fit and enjoy.
1,Wow! Amazing sound charge lasted a whole day at work fit is very comfortable blocks out the noise of the machine shop<br />I work in while providing me with great sound.
1,Great quality would recommend to anyone
1,"Great,very good bass fast delivery"
1,"Great product, thank you, would purchase again!"
1,"Only had them 1 week, but so far really Great Thanks"
1,"I am very happy with my purchase. I got these headphones to work out with and they have been great. The range is excellent, great sound and long battery life. I didn't want to spend over $100 for a pair of headphones just to workout and I'm glad I found these!"
1,"Right out of the box, these earbuds looked special... Well made, solid... Always a gamble, buying something unseen and untested... This time, it's paid off... Highest compliments..."
1,Very impressed with the sound quality and functionality of this product. Definitely will purchase again if I need too.
0,What a waste of money. Will not stay charge. Bought regular head phones to replace. DO NOT BUY. A WASTE OF MONEY.
1,Best ear buds we have ever had! Ordered 2nd set for wife! Great quality & price! Thank you!
1,"I spent hours, days almost, researching the perfect headphones for my workouts. I took a risk and tried the SENSO product. So far after 3 weeks, they have good sound, keep a charge throughout my workout sessions which typically last about 1.5 - 2 hours, and after some adjustments, stay in my ears.<br /><br />I know I have weird ears, so I played around with the additional earpieces to find the ones that fit best. There was a combination in the kit that worked, so I'm sticking with it. I don't worry much about the comfort--not that they are uncomfortable, but I'm generally lifting heavy things and they don't annoy me. When running on the treadmill, I do have to readjust them once in a while, but again, I have weird ears. They are definitely sweat proof, which is great. They come with a handy carrying case, IPhone charger, multiple ear pieces, and some other stuff which was nice. The additional ear pieces were major important but the other stuff wasn't a huge selling point.<br /><br />I had some pairing problems the second time I used it where I had to have my phone &#34;forget&#34; the device and try again. After that, I've had no other pairing problems. I love the fact that the controls are in the earpiece instead of in a dangly box that pulls the headphones to the right. One wire right around the back of my head = no problems.<br /><br />I am satisfied and glad I purchased these headphones."
1,Christmas present for my daughter and she loved it.
1,Great quality ear buds well worth the price
1,"So far so good, bass is a bit overpowering but that is the reason I got it. Integrates phenomenally with an iPhone and really simple to use."
1,Listening to them now...Love 'em!!! I was impressed with all the accessories that came with this purchase. My best $20 spent on Amazon so far!
1,Excellent
1,"I have difficulty with regular earbuds staying in my ears, the memory foam buds that are included in this work great!"
1,Work great
1,"Just received these headphone and ❤️ LOVE them..  they came charged already, it was SUPER easy to connect them with iPhone and the sound is fantastic.... block all outside noise.<br />Also, they are very light, well made and good looking.<br />I'm soo happy I got them.<br />Totally recommend 👍💯"
1,Sound quality is good.
1,Awesome product for the price.
1,These are great! Not sure what others are referring to when they say it's too loud unless my ears are bad. When I work out I like extremely loud music too. These are a perfect solution for anyone that just wants hassle free music while working out. I'm not into the latest and greatest so these were perfect quality for me personally. It does take some time to get used to them and figure out the best way to wear them in your ears. I messed with them for a while until I figured out what would be most comfortable and now they are perfect! Great price for what you get in my opinion.<br /><br />Thanks!
1,Great ear buds.  Really sound great and wonderful for working outside with total freedom
1,"""Great product, sound is amazing. So much better than expected for the price, and I expected good."""
0,Sound is decent and set up was very simple. Controls are pretty intuitive.<br /><br />The microphone does not have great noise reduction and creates an echo when you talk on the phone.
1,Good for walking and talking on the phone at the same time. It was a gift.
1,"These are by far the best ear buds I have ever purchased, I bought a total of 4 because my kids loved then so much they took mine so I was forced to get more. Great product."
1,Love!  Getting another pair!!!
0,"These cut in and out if they're more than 4ft from my head or if ANYTHING is in between my iPhone and the right ear piece, including my own body.<br />They don't work when my phone is in my pocket.<br />I asked for feedback when I got them, everyone said to reset the connection. I did and they haven't improved.<br />Very disappointed."
1,Quick delivery and great product
1,"Very good quality, and good sound."
1,"So far, so good.  The sound is very clear, and I like that they're waterproof."
1,"These headset are awesome, sounds great and it exactly as it's advertised. However the only issues for  me us that it fall if my ear while working other most times. Other that it's a really good product."
1,Great product!  I sweat a lot and these headphones are perfect for dealing with it.  I own beats by dre as well and they have shorted out numerous times.  These keep on going.  I had issues with one side shorting out but customer service has been awesome with sending out a new pair.
1,Love it works great really easy to use. Will use it all the time and really works well thanks for great product
1,"Fantastic headphone! Great for music, but the headset works wonderfully with my phone."
1,I would highly recommend these for someone that wants some good sound quality and also lives somewhere where it rains a lot (since they're water proof).
1,I ordered these in 2017. They broke last month. Can’t beat the price especially considering how long they lasted. Ordered another brand 2 weeks ago. They are not loud at all. Back to order this pair again.
1,"Order arrived very quickly, two days! Headphones charged fast and were very easy to pair with my smart phone. Given the price, I was amazed by the outstanding sound quality. All in all a great value! Thanks!"
1,I like the ear pieces. I tried another brand and mthey would not stay in. It was easy to pair with my iPad and I like the case to take traveling. Good sound. Not sure if they cancel noise. I will be taking them in the plane soon.
1,"I love the unit, Good sound quality and clearity."
1,"These are great headphones. Battery lasts a long time and the sound quality is great. My favorite thing, however, about having bought these earphones is the wonderful customer service I received. My headphones recently stopped working very suddenly. One night they worked great. I plugged them in and the next day they wouldn't power on. I contacted the company. They gave me some troubleshooting tips, which I tried. When those didn't work I contacted them again and without any further questions they mailed me a new pair! They just needed my order #. It was so effortless and they stand behind their products and that 1 year warranty. Very pleased."
1,I bought one of this for working out. It is amazing! Sounds good and sweat proof. I decided to buy one for my brother! The customer service was excellent! I would recommend this to my friends!
0,"Everything else about these is pretty great, but the Bluetooth range is so poor that it just ruins the experience. It’s obvious that the Bluetooth antenna is in the right earbud, because if my phone is in my left pocket, the sound constantly stutters and cuts out. Putting the phone in my right pocket fixes the issue. But, I wear my Apple Watch on my left wrist, and so the same problem occurs when streaming from my watch. Putting my left hand on my right shoulder fixed the issue, though that somewhat limits my ability to do anything but stand around. Oh, one other thing: the case is nice and compact, but not roomy enough to prevent the earbuds from turning on if the case gets a little squished in a packet or a bag. Funny thing, the same button that turns them on redials the last number called. Can lead to surprises."
1,Excellent sound. Very easy to use. My husband and I both have a pair
1,"Still working six months later (I am usually very hard on these). Pairs reliably with Nexus, but can't get them to pair with iPhone no matter what I do, though."
0,This is a shame.  The headphones have great performance but because of the design of the cable they constantly catch and the likelihood of them falling off if you have them around your neck is very high.  I would love to find this product with just one side so the uncomfortable cable around the neck was gone.
0,Not a good product. It went bad after one week
1,"love them, worth the price."
1,"I love these headphones.  Great sound for a great price.[[ASIN:B01G8JO5F2 SENSO Bluetooth Headphones, Best Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7 Waterproof HD Stereo Sweatproof Earbuds for Gym Running Workout 8 Hour Battery Noise Cancelling Headsets]]"
1,"These are fantastic. The door to the charging port is a little difficult to open. But other than that these are a great pair of headphones. I bought these as a gift for my bf who has the iphone that doesn't have headphone jacks, so these were perfect."
0,Doesn't stay connected when in my pocket.  Worthless Worthless Worthless
0,These don't work worth a darn!.  If I have the phone in my pocket they wont connect or stay connected.  Not worth the money.
1,Bought them for the Mrs. and she loves them!  No more cord getting tangled when she is out jogging!
1,"I have been trying different headphones and got mostly disappointed, but these headphones are great! They are my favorite so far! Good sound quality and they stay in place even if I jump a lot during my workouts! Love them!"
0,"These are not good.  I received these for christmas, 2017 and the wind noise is horrible.  When jogging, the wind noise is so loud, I can hardly hear my podcasts.  And its not windy outside, this noise is coming from me jogging, and I'm not that fast.  I have tired every ear piece that comes with it and no change.  I contacted Invotek via phone and they suggested triying the other ear pieces, which I had done.  I then contacted them via email and they told me how to reset the system, as they thought the mic was stuck on.  No change.  Im going back to my corded headphones and will return these for a refund.  I had liked the price point on these but will have to spend time researching another brand."
1,these sound great and are real comfortable
1,Great sounds lightweight
1,"I bought these to replace my TaoTronics bluetooth headphones. These headphones have a much more comfortable fit than the previous ones. Plus, the bass and treble are a lot more crisp.  I also enjoy the feature that the headphones will tell you once you turn them on or off. These are great headphones for the gym."
1,I have been using them for about 6 months and they are Awesome!!! They stay in place. The control buttons are easy to find and manipulate. I get very little wind whistling when hiking. The wind has to be blowing quite hard. Very comfortable to wear for many hours at a time. The play time is right at 8 hours as advertised.
1,Very pleased with them!
0,They were uncomfortable for me and they lost reception as soon as my phone went into my pocket or I walked less than 10 feet away.
1,I really love these headphones...such a great sound coming from a small package!
1,Haven’t used the headphones extensively but I’m very pleased with the quality and sound so far. They fit snuggly and comfortably and do block out much of the background noise. A different set of earbud I had didn’t do this so it was a little strange at first but it definitely helps the overall sound quality.
1,Feel really nice on your ears. Work great so far. Charge up pretty fast. Hope they last. No packing slip in the box though.
1,They have the best sound I have found in a Bluetooth headphone; but they don’t stay in my ears. I appears the piece that goes around the ear doesn’t work for all shapes and sizes of ears.
1,"I read the reviews on these and decided to try them out. Seriously, for the price? I couldn’t have been more pleasantly surprised when I tried them! My husband has Apple EarPods and neither of us can tell any real difference between the two. Of course, these are larger and a different shape, but for over $100. difference, these are amazing. I travel a lot, and the sound from these are amazing, and surprisingly, pretty comfortable even after falling asleep on a plane. They stay in, and when I’m working out, I won’t lose them. Great buy!!"
1,"Like the other reviews, the sound is amazing. From the moment I put them on, I  wore them comfortably for 4 hours. I can't imagine finding better quality for this price"
1,Great quality and durability. charges fast and stays on.
1,the battery life is really good and they are comfortable.
1,Pretty good. Mic doesn't work that well.
1,"The best review I can give this product is to recommend it to friends and family. After owning the earbuds for two weeks I bought a pair for my sister and father. I have recommended it to all my friends and acquaintances, many of whom now happily own the product. The best aspects of the product are as follows:<br /><br />Sound quality is above that of other work out head phones I've tried<br />Fits snugly on the ear so that you can run with them, yet comfortable<br />Noise cancelling, such that I can hear my music on a loud plane without turning the volume all the way up<br />Long lasting battery life<br />Connects immediately to my devices when I power on, remembers the last two devices used<br /><br />And besides all this, the customer service from Senso has been exceptional. Email correspondence is quick, and they seem to care deeply about my satisfaction with the product."
1,"Positives: Great range and battery life.  I charge them briefly before heading to the gym and they've yet to die on me after a month of use.<br /><br />Negatives: The part that wraps around the ear is not sturdy.  If the buds don't fit your ear, the wraps do little to help.  Also, the red button on the right earpiece is a small issue for me.  Pressing once pauses playback, pressing twice calls your previous call.  I've accidentally called people numerous times because of this feature.<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend this product."
1,"I love these headphones, Great sound very comfortable I love accessories. The dual port charging cable, the carrying case and the dual port car charger. I have the same style in the Beats by Dre, after using the SENSO I gave the Beats to my daughter."
1,"I gave the cm Senso headphones to my niece and her initial reaction was very positive.  She has only used them for a week, so I cannot comment on the long term.  That said, initial reaction was very positive"
1,I'm extremely happy with these headphones. From initial impressions when opening the packaging to pairing them with my phone and using them. The sound quality is the best I've experienced in a Bluetooth headset and they're comfortable to wear all day. I will definitely be buying another pair to keep around.
1,They are headphones. But the quality is exceptional. They also come with tons more capabilities than my previous pair. Additionally the customer service reps are out of this world. They truly do care about the customers experience. 10 of 10.
1,"Best quality ,A++++++"
1,The earbuds came well packaged complete with all the accessories that are needed. The product is well made and the sound quality is great.
1,"I have had several other similar types of head-phones, but these are exceptional.  I bought a pair for a gift, and then went and bought myself a pair.  I would highly recommend.  Syncing is incredibly easy (and very fast), volume control works great, powering on/off is easy, and they recharge quick and last for several days.  For the price, get a pair."
1,Great purchase. Very satisfied with the quality and VALUE of these headphones.<br />No need to waste your money on more trendy overpriced brands. I have owned all of them<br />at one point and the Senso's are on par with all of them.
1,"I have used the SENSO headphones now for several weeks now in my daily fast walks. At first, the controls seem a little difficult to find (they are really small) but once you get used to it, they are fine. The instruction diagram is also very small, and not easy to follow. Haven't had any incoming calls so far, so no feedback on this. The main thing however, is that the phones are light, comfortable, remain in place when fast walking, and produce good sound with excellent stereo separation. Possibly a little heavy on the bass, but that could be my high frequency hearing loss. The only small thing is that there are occasional momentary sound level reductions lasting for about a second (on both radio stations, Slacker & Pandora). Don't think it is a Bluetooth glitch, but is not really an issue I am concerned with.<br />I would definitely recommend them (have bought two sets).Tremendous value with exceptional features."
1,Great while they lasted but the side with all of the controls fell apart after only 6 months of lite use.
0,"I bought this earphone and it work fine for one year, now i have to throw it away"
1,Greatttttt
1,Just awesome perfect for running and have great sound .
0,The hooks completely didn't hook on my ears. They barely even touched my ear. For reference I have normal female ears.
1,It’s always great to read good reviews about a product and then have the product perform as reviewed.  That was my experience with these headphones. To make a long story short I agree with other reviewer’s that these are a good quality product at a fair price that perform as advertised.
1,"It can have a few glitches but those are usually solved with a restart. It’s connection can also get spotty, but only when it’s at low battery. Great set for the price"
1,"I've been constantly using this after a full charge for 1 hour daily and the battery has not died yet. It's been 7 days now. And the bass is terrific. To get the perfect balance, use with the Late Night equaliser of the Iphone and see the magic. No noise while using the mic. Although you have to be a bit on the louder side since the mic is embedded in the earpiece. But that's not a hurdle at all since the light weight and extremely comfortable design makes sure that you don't mind keeping it on for longer hours. Good job Senso!!! I'm certain there's no point spending on the big brands for wireless earphones."
1,"Wanted headphones that were wireless with good sound, My old wired headphones were good but I'm always snagging the wire on something, these are great, bought a set for my wife also, she really likes them too. Love that you can advance and reverse songs with the touch of the button, very happy with the purchase and suspect they will last a long time, thankyou for a great product at a reasonable price..."
1,"So far I think there great, just started to use them yesterday and found them to be very comfortable and easy to use.  Pairing with my I phone was quick and easy.  I wear glasses and found that they do not interfere with them at all."
1,Works great paired to my Win 10 desktop.
0,"Very nice sound, comfortable and good battery life. Unfortunately connectivity is aweful and that's the important part. This set struggles to stay connected at any distances of more than 20 feet.  And if your floating in a pool the best you get is about 10 feet. The who reason I purchased em these were because they had a waterproof rating and thought they would be ideal while I was relaxing in the pool. Well if I need to stay within 10 feet of my phone what's the use? Being returned this week."
1,"I bought these to use running and have been using them for a couple weeks. They are great sounding and the battery life is very good. I have to be available for work all the time and use them for taking work calls. The phone quality is great for hearing the caller but I've been told that I sound a bit far away talking, I assume that is because of the microphone location. Overall I am very satisfied with the performance of these headphones.<br />Pairing was easy. The only cons I can find are that when the battery gets low it tells you &#34;low battery&#34; every minute which is way too often. I get it, my battery is low.... warn me every 5 minutes or better yet, tell me it's low once then its my responsibility to remember to charge them.<br />On the wish list would be ear hooks that had some wire in them instead of just loose rubber, that would let the user customize the fit as they will come loose now and then while running. Also if you came out with a version that could operate with just the right side and unplug the left channel, lots of joggers like to hear what's going on around them, I'm sure you would sell a lot more."
1,"Comfort, great sound! I love these headphones! They have a great range allowing me to listen to music and not be chained to my phone or bother my family. I really like the way the ear piece holds the buds in the ear. In the  past I've always avoided ear buds because of them not being comfortable, that is not the case here. Great job SENSO!!"
1,Great sound quality
1,"Battery life lasts forever, easy to pair and turn on. Sound isn't great/supreme quality, however it is good for wireless. I would recommend getting cheaper ones, but if you're not comfortable taking a gamble, this is a safe pair to get."
0,Does not fit well into my ears. They all when I run. The audio quality is also not great.
1,You literally can't lose. Why waste money on name brand headphones when you can buy these!! Sounds quality was almost too much bass but in Spotify I adjusted the equalizer and WOW! Really made these things even more worth the money. Excellent sound quality and noise cancellation. And Not to meantion all the extras you get with it. The charger and cord are worth at least half of the price so you are getting Bluetooth headphones for like $15! If you complain about that than nothing will make you happy! Just buy them!
1,"Overall a good bluetooth headset, with easy controls, good battery life, and a snug fit. Definitely sensitive to wind when you run outside, unfortunately."
1,Ordered 2 sets so far. They both eventually have the same issue- the soldier lets go on the side without controls. They were recommended by a friend and used daily.
1,"Based on the price I was unsure of what the quality of the product would be but once I got them and paired the headphones up with my iPhone they work great!  I used them for running, indoor cycling, elliptical, and treadmill workouts and they are excellent for active people!  They are comfortable and the sound quality is far better than I expected."
1,"I just lost my yesterday... fell off while resting along my neck.  They are very light and they worked great since I bought them (about a month)... best review I can give is , I am buying them again.  They were great.  No 5th star because they do block outside noise which means no conversations when these re in your ears on or off... other than that they are great."
1,This is an excellent product and the value is wonderful. You guys got it right. Congratulations. Keep me updated with future products.
1,I really like it. Easy to pair with my iphone and they didn't fall off my ears as other one I bought
1,Work great.No issues!
1,Very nice for the price
1,"These work great, and are a great deal for the money."
1,Works as well as the expensive beats ones I had
1,Ok
1,Great Product! and Awesome customer service! would definitely buy again.
1,They fit great and the sound is high quality.
1,"Love these headphones! Great sound, pair immediately with my phone with a clear voice that says ""connected"", charge seems to last a long time, and they work as a phone headset far better than my $200 Plantronics headset - for less than 20 bucks!"
1,"I had been looking at a multitude of bluetooth/wireless headsets before purchasing this one, which I kept coming back to...then crossed paths with a friend of mine that happened to have bought these very ones...and he raved about them, so I bought them. To sum up my experience with them; when they worked, they worked great...but when they didn't work, they were maddening to deal with. They always seemed to be all or nothing...their connectivity seemed weak at times, regardless of charge-level. Spot on, or skipping like a scratched CD due (i'm guessing here) to poor connectivity,  whether connected to either the apple watch on my wrist or the smart-phone in my pocket. Pairing; sometimes they connected instantly, sometimes I had to turn them and the bluetooth on either the phone or the watch on or off, and multiple times to get them to connect...I have an iphone, and while I didn't use them a great deal of the time, after a few months of having to fight with them every other time I wanted to use them, I just bit the bullet and bought the apple air-pods..."
0,"I bought these to try to find a cheap decent sounding pair of wireless headsets to run with without really being devastated if sweat/heat eventually broke them down.  First I'll say what I like about them, the build quality seems good with soft touch surfaces and sturdy pieces and they connect to my phone quickly.<br /><br />Now the bad...they simply sound awful.  I wasn't expecting an audiophile experience for under $30, but the sound quality has no fidelity (lows are non-existent and the highs just sound harsh and muddled).  I was previously using the &#34;Brookstone Compact Reverse Sound Earphones&#34; (wired, under $30) for working out and they sound 10x better for the same price.  If you can live with a wired pair of headphones, I'd just buy those instead.  I already ordered another pair after hearing how bad these sound.  Another downside to the Sensos is that the silicon ear bud pieces kept slipping out of my ear hole as I sweat more and the over-the-ear pieces aren't snug enough to hold them in place from falling out of your ear.  The Brookstones already were superior in this regard with how they stay secure in your ear.<br /><br />I'm only giving these 2 stars instead of 1 because I paid under $30.  If I had paid $50 or more I'd give them a 1 and demand my money back."
1,"So far I love these wireless headphones I purchased to use at work. After a couple hours my ear hurts, but could be I need try the other tips. Otherwise, I really like them."
1,Most comfortable ear buds I've ever tried!
1,"Good fit, comfortable.  Good sound, fast shipping and arrival.  Worked great at the gym, no problem in hot tub or shower."
1,"Great sound, Just feels good."
1,Good battery life.  Great HD sound.  Perfect for exercising.
0,"I was excited, but unfortunately I am returning ...they will not hold a charge and this could not get them to pair.<br /><br />Once I receive the refund, I do plan to reorder."
1,"These ear buds were amazing. Great sound quality, settings, look, etc.. Then all of a sudden one day the left ear bud stops playing audio. I always keep it in the handy case it comes in and only use them when I watch videos and workout. I'm pretty sad because these are my favorite. I resistered for the warranty ages ago but don't know how it works.<br /><br />Update: SENSO has some of the best costumer service I have ever dealt with. I emailed them about the problem and they responded within 1-2 hours. At first the representative tried to help me with a possible fix to the issue but after it didn't work they sent me a new pair of headphones free of charge.<br /><br />Also I ended up purchasing a new pair because I stepped on the new ones but I didn't have the 10% off promo code that you get from buying them. I sent a short email to SENSO and the rep responded quickly once again and profided me with the code. AMAZING COSTUMER SERVICE."
1,"I use the Senso Bluetooth in the gym when I'm doing cardio. I found that if you use the right earbud size, it works pretty well. It doesn't fall off. Sound is pretty good. Battery is good enough for me since I only use it for one hour per day and charge them twice a week."
1,"These are my first bluetooth headphones and I couldn't be happier that I decided to cut the cord. It was so easy to set up, the sound quality is great, and the price was very reasonable. I am a very happy buyer and would recommend these headphones."
1,"my first bluetooth device & I LOVE these. They stay IN my ears, charge easily, connected w/o any issues to my iPad & I HIGHLY recommend them to everyone.  I bought them for noise reduction as I'm going to be flying on a turbo prop. I am hoping that they work on the plane; they worked great in reducing the noise when I turned on my loud Dyson pet vac!"
1,Excellent head phones
0,I bought a pair and it was going well until the charging port wouldn't accept a charge. I contacted the company and they sent me a new pair. The 2nd pair worked fine but now it shuts off after 30 seconds despite having 100% battery life. I noticed that the cords looked like they were spliced and you can see the wires which is funny since I took good care of my headphones. These were good at first but now I have no choice but to toss them out.
1,"These Invotek Senso ActiveBuds are excellent! Bought my husband a pair first. We go to the gym often and our other ear buds just don't stand up to our exercising. The ActiveBuds not only stay in, they have quality sound and are great for phone calls! The charge lasts my husband's whole entire work day in which he has numerous conference calls, he charges it on the way home and it's ready for the gym! Very happy with the product. Ordered myself a pair and will order another pair for our 16 year old son! Maybe even for our older girls as Christians presents also!!"
0,"Wind noise unbearable at wind speeds over 5 mph. Probably not bad at the gym, but do not buy if you are planning to use them for hiking or biking. As one other user described, it's like you're listening to music with a hairdryer in the background. As well, forget making phone calls in the wind, as even a breeze makes it unusable. Surprised this product has such a high rating considering this huge flaw. Guess most people are using them inside...."
1,"the first impression is, well design, crystal clear voice quality and comfortable.The second review after a few month. Still connect fast, the sound is great and battery life is more than 6 hours at least. Recommend this product"
1,"- Charger plug is not durable.<br /><br />+ Everyone has a different shaped ear, I have difficulty putting earpieces into my actual canal. The hoop thing around the earbud served great to keep them in my ears.<br />+ Battery outlasted a schoolday full of listening in class (Don't do that pay attention in school).<br />+ Cheap<br />+ If you take good care of these, they will last<br />+ Sound quality is nothing short of impressive for a pair of Bluetooth earphones this cheap. Don't expect hi-fi audio from these, but you can expect earphones that work well when taken care of. Bass is amazing, Treble is amazing.<br /><br />I typically lose my earphones before they wear out, although after an entire school-year of shoving these things in my pocket, the cable came out from the charging port still attached, and the button was mashed in. When I expected these to have broken, THEY STILL WORKED. Everyone runs a different budget, but I can guarantee if you put these in the case, they are a major bang for your buck.<br /><br />Let these headphones blow you away for the price point, it is worth every dollar of allowance/salary/giftcard you spend on it."
1,Very nice wireless earbuds. Good sound. Light and comfortable.
1,Absolutely love them!  Great service - great quality! My hubby loves these!
1,GREAT TRANSACTION GOOD PRODUCTS!
1,Surprisingly good.  Just right for my long walks. Good volume adjustment and effortless blue tooth connectivity.
0,"If you're buying these for running or weightlifting where your head is relatively stable, then they're ok if you don't mind the low bass on your music clipping. Speakers aren't anything to write home about.<br />However I bought these to use during boxing and crossfit, and they refuse to stay in my ears. On top of all that the pause button is super sensitive and on the side, so if you push the earbud back in nine times out of ten it will pause the music. I returned mine because there are definitely better alternatives."
1,They fit well and it’s easy to use on my run!
0,It has a deep bass sounds good but the one I got cuts in and out all the time.
1,Bought these for my daughter and she LOVES them! Work great!!
1,"I had a hard time with these at first until I figured out that you have to hold down the multi-purpose button until a woman's voice says that it is now on, and same thing to turn it off. But they fit well and nothing's fallen off yet. Lightweight and flexible, decent sound quality.<br /><br />12/21/2020: I dropped these - not from a great height - but the volume control pad on top and the on/off pad on the side both popped off, about a month ago. I managed to get them on again but not sure how long they will stay in. I've not been running since. I don't want to use glue in case it gunks up the works. Shall update after I take them back for a run. Wanted to post this for a sense of how robust/long weariing they might be."
1,"Pretty good while they lasted. They look really big, maybe just on female heads, but they stick out pretty far. I didn’t care they worked at the gym or wherever for a solid 6 months. In the last month they’ve been less able to keep the Bluetooth connection, so I constantly get kicked off of my phone by anyone else’s Bluetooth in close proximity. Need stronger Bluetooth wiring."
1,"Been using these headphones for quite a few months now. Absolutely love the quality of sound that plays. As someone with small ears I was worried they would pop out easily, but they work great!"
1,"They seem to be a good value.  Easy pairing with my phone, comfortable in my ears, decent sound.  For the price you can't really go wrong.  They are a little bulky on the outside, bit this shouldn't be a big issue for me."
1,Good sound
1,The sound is great and nice long battery life. The only thing is that the over the ear part does slip out sometimes while I am running. Also I can hear the thumping of my feet when I run probably because of the noise cancellation. Overall great product!
1,"I have used it for the last couple days and I am very happy with its quality of sounds and comfortable fitting in my ears.  For the price I paid, i think it is money well spent.<br />Bruce<br /><br />Add to my earlier comment ~ I listen the music while riding BART in San Francisco commute.  At least 40 minutes listening without battery problem.  Before I purchase this product, i borrowed my friend Boss headset.  It was good for noise cancellation but I was getting too hot wearing.  This ear plug type is perfect for me.  Bluetooth is also working nicely.<br /><br />I lost my first one last month.  I bought my second set.  Meantime my wife also bought her own set.  This is good product to listen music."
0,"I had to come back in and say that they stopped connecting to my phone after less than 2 months. The earbuds are also not the most comfortable once you've used the malleable ear clip (not sure what to call it) lots. Overall, disappointed in what I thought was a great product."
1,I love this headset it can go behind my head and I don't have to worry about it. It's easy to make and receive calls. I use it mostly for listening to music on my phone.
1,"These are awesome Headphones.  Comfortable and secure fit.  Comes with all of the charging accessories you could ever need.  It also comes with a sturdy case to keep your phones from damage.  Haven't had these wireless headphones long enough to comment on durability, but the sound is outstanding.  These replaced a set of JBL Reflect Sport headphones, which had a speaker go bad in under a year."
0,Good sound but two songs in and they busted not worth it prime garbage
1,"Battery life leaves something to be desired.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's a fantastic set of earbuds. The noise cancellation is always apparent, they don't slip out or off of your ears. Perfect for working out, chores, and studying."
1,"love the earphones good quality, nice fit, bought my second one because the first one broke. totally worth the money.<br />great for exercise too."
1,These earbuds offer quality comparable to my LG Harman kardon wireless headset which I paid $120 for.
1,love them great on deployment
1,Sometimes it will cut off when water is splashed on it but it’s rare and does work in a pool
0,"After reading the 27 plus thousands reviews,  I decided to buy them. Price cheap. They lasted 2 days. Not worthed."
0,"I bought several pairs of these, and on each pair, the charging port broke free from the body and is rattling around inside of the headphones. This makes the headphones, not rechargeable. I bought 2 pairs in May and both have broken. Will not re-purchase."
1,"02-23-2021: Great product.  Have had them for 3 years, but now they will not stay connected, no matter how many troubleshooting processes I have done.  Debating whether to call Senso about this."
1,Purchased in Feb 2018.  Unit is now dead and will not charge.  Will see if the vendor will replace them. ....they did....
1,I bought because they advertise an extended battery life. They do...
1,It does not feel confortable in my ears. They don`t stay in my ear while I try to run.
1,"Product is as described and at a fair price.  I use them while riding my bike and the sound is very good.  The only is issue is the sound cuts out intermittently when I turn my head occasionally.  Other than that, I pleased with the purchase."
1,"Very comfortable, good sound and paired easily"
1,Very good quality and sound. Worked right out of the box and am really impressed with the accessory package. Bravo Senso for making such a high quality product at an extremely reasonable price. I buying more for XMAS gifts.
1,Fits good sounds good
0,"Don’t waste your money. The Bluetooth connection is super weak. As a cyclist I carry my phone in my rear jersey pocket. As soon as I place the phone in my pocket, the buds lose connection and starts to buffer sound. Save your money."
1,"They sound very good and they are very, very comfortable"
1,"Sound is great, but a little painful on the ears with they early it fits"
1,I really like this product.
1,I love everything about them.  Nothing bad to say.
1,"I absolutely love how convenient these headphones are. I was unsure if the bass and volume would be loud enough, but everything is perfect! Thanks so much for the product!"
0,"This is my 4th set of these earbuds.  The sound and battery life are good as expected.<br /><br />Each time the content and quality seems to be slipping.  Gone are the foam inserts and the extra magnetic phone holder pieces.  I can accept this - I understand that companies need to be profitable and optimize the product content for things the customer is willing to pay but I do expect basic things like minimal build quality and some form of customer service when things don't go well. .<br /><br />I really wanted to like these earbuds but unfortunately, there is an annoying rattle coming from the right side earbud.  The rattle drowns out the music while running/jogging.  I have attempted to contact the company via their website but no response as of 2 weeks.  I'm a bit concerned they will not stand behind their product.  Just disappointing.  Buyer beware..."
1,Not perfect sound quality but works as advertised
1,I have had other earbuds that have not offered the great sound these provide. I love the fact that this is bluetooth. It was easy to pair with my IPhone and easy to use in general.
1,"Very comfortable bluetooth headphones!  Instantly paired with my phone, long battery life, and great sound.  Highly Recommend!!!"
1,Links to iphone easily. Keeps a charge well and stays in your ears even when you're being active.  What more can you ask for?
1,"I’ve been looking to buy a first pair of Bluetooth headphones and after reading Several reviews for different brands, I settled on these and I’m not disappointed. The sound is excellent and I’m very satisfied,"
1,Gave these to my 14y/o son and he loves them.<br /><br />I misplace my Bose Soundsports one day and used these and I am impressed since they are inexpensive
1,"Worked great! These have worked well from day 1. Never a problem connecting and I appreciate the message in my ear when I turn them on and I am told they are 'on' and 'connected'. With my Sony Bluetooth I have to ask Alexa what the hell time it is just to find out if the damn speaker is connected. Well done Sony. Anyway, these little suckers always work. I have to admit that I do not use any of the features with the controls on the unit (volume, and answer the phone, I think). The bottom line for me is that the buttons are too small and the juice isn't worth the squeeze. I use these in the gym, while cycling, and on my stationary bike. I recommend these, especially for the price."
1,"A little sound distortion with each step when running, but not enough to knock these solid buds down from a 5 star rating."
1,I love this ear buds! I have never been able to wear ear buds because they never stay in my ear. But these are very comfortable and the sound quality is great! Me and my husband both have a pair!!
1,Very good design very loud and just love them for the gym.
1,"Bought this headphones in total dark since no one that I know have these Senso headphones. The reviews gave me some hope and bought 2 at once.<br />Oh boy, if I just knew before... works like a charm and despite not being made for audiophiles, has a very good sound (if you stick the silicon plug in your ear).<br />Let's see how long the battery will keep charges. Will be back."
1,"I was really hoping these Senso Bluetooth Headphones would work out as they are only 1/4 the price of Beats Wireless Headphones.  The set up was a breeze and the sound was great, especially for the price.  However, the headphones are bulky and look ridiculous.  I wouldn't wear these in public, even at the gym.  Imagine wearing two separate Bluetooth ear pieces (the type used for phone calls only) and you begin to get an idea of just how big these are in your ears. If you can get past the size and look, I would highly recommend these.  Unfortunately, I can't, so I'm going back to the more expensive, but smaller/sleeker Beats Wireless Headphones."
1,I had some trouble with my headphones and decided to contact SENSO customer service.  The response was quick and helpful.  I took the suggestion to do a factory reset and my headphones now work great.  Thanks so much!
1,"These have a great sound, delivered on time, my only feedback would be that they slide around on my ears quite a bit!  So maybe I just have tiny ears, but I can't run with these on.  I have a colleague though that has the same exact headphones and says he has no problems!"
0,"Let me start by saying I've tried tons of Bluetooth headsets. Some with connecting neck cord and some with two separate ear buds. Those without connecting neck cord don't have the power needed for deep sound. They also don't work in both ears for phone calls. For those like this with neck cord, the sound is great with Long battery life and full sound. The microphone is poor in  non loud background. These are perfect for anyone needing hands free options in workout or just walking around town.  Update: the left ear has short in the cord and now the left ear cuts out. Of course this is after returning period. The above only goes if they don’t start failing after several months.<br />Update: I bought newer model and the microphone still is bad at noise cancellation"
1,"I really enjoyed these headphones.  I only use them when I'm working out.  Unfortunately, they pooped out on me about a month in.  They do not turn on anymore and wont even take a charge.  I guess I sweat too much for these sweat proof headphones."
1,"Had headphones for 5 months. Quit charging, and couldn’t get to work at all. Customer service was exceptional. Responded to my email immediately. And then mailed us a new pair right away."
1,Love the long battery life.
1,"so far, love these; great sound quality.  very similar to my beats.  they give a good variety of sizes; however, i do still have some problems with the ear pieces falling out but i took the ones off my beats and now they're a perfect fit.  my beats kept dying (battery--and then unable to charge--2x within 2 years)  not worth it!  these are just as good and 1/4 of the cost!"
1,"One of the best headphones I've ever had in terms of sound quality, durability & water resistance... The Senso team was very timely in their response to me and was quick to ship out a replacement pair of headphones, as the water damage happened inside of the 1 year warrantee (that Senso guarantees).<br /><br />Quality product, quality customer service. 5 stars on all counts"
1,I like these so much this is my second pair!!
1,"Awesome sound, price and support!!!!! I was a Beats guy all the way and I lost my set a few days ago and did not want to spend 200 bucks. I read the reviews on these and decided to try them. I am super pleased!! No more Beats for me !!!!"
1,"Just got these and tried them out at the gym today, they sound sharp and fantastic. Battery life is great and last 7-8 hours. They don't fall off when working out which was a must when I bought these. Only con so far is the mic doesn't pick up sound well when on the phone, the person on the other end has a bit of trouble hearing you."
1,The blue connection is not strong. Keeps cutting in and out when I'm right next to it.
1,"These headphones are a great buy! I found these on a recommendation from a fellow gym goer, I went online and read all the reviews so figured I didn't have much to loose for the price. I have to say that they are great! They stay in even better than my JayBirds that I just purchased (that were more expensive). They come with a lot of little extras and a great little case. Don't waste your money on the more expensive brands, take it from me. Also, for reference, I workout 5-6x wk (intensively, including HIIT cardio)."
0,Worked great for about a week then stopped charging. I tried different chargers and none of them work. It just keeps flashing from blue to red even after being plugged in for hours.
1,"These were just what I was looking for in a Bluetooth  headphone. Easy to connect, control and stay in place even in windy conditions at the beach where I jog. From my recent experience this company stands solidly behind their product because when I did have a problem the customer service rep was quick to respond with info to try to correct the problem and when that didn't work sent replacement item which I received within a couple of days."
1,"Please read, hopefully this helps you with the purchase:<br />1. They are great for the price!<br />2. The speakers have very good base response, but the treble is so/so. I'm using Pandora, and do not have the ability to adjust the tone.<br />The one thing I do not like (that other brands have) is a voice reminder to tell you how many hours are remaining on the battery before needing to recharge.<br />3. I've had them for only 1 week, and the company (Invotek) keeps asking me for a review. I would rather submit a review after using them for a good month or so to make sure they live up to what the company says.<br />Overall... I'm happy with them for the price I paid and feel like it's a good buy."
1,"I love these ear buds. They are everything they described in the description. They fit nicely in my ears and I can adjust them with ease. Although, I could not get them to pair on one of my devices,  believe it was my phone not being compatible with the ear buds but they were on my new phone. I just love them!"
0,"If I could give 0 stars I would. 3rd set of Bluetooth headphones under a hundred bucks that shut off or keep disconnecting with in 10 seconds. Total crap, don't waste your money. Chinese crap"
1,"I’ve bought much more expensive bluetooth headphones in the past... and these are on par, if not superior, to those. Great purchase."
0,I thought these were ok at first but after two months of use I am over them.  They constantly fall out of my ears and I have to adjust them every couple of minutes when I’m running.  I had a set of Powerbeats 2 that I lost and figured that I would just go cheap this time with the potential of losing another set and I wish that I would have just paid for the better quality again.
1,"I did buy them around May and they were working perfectly  with an amazing sound until just a week ago when I started having issues with the left earphone, losing the sound, it looked like a contact or something. I wrote the seller and an hour later Kimberly Pollak wrote me back with the instructions step by step how to fix the issue. Now they work like NEW!! The funny thing is that when they started giving me issues I though they were just another piece of... Well, I can say now confidently is that they are built to last and that the seller really cares to offer an AWESOME service!"
0,"This was my second pair.  The first one was great and lasted about 2 years with no issues, so when it was time for a new pair, I looked no further.<br /><br />The sound quality of the second one is very poor, especially when making phone calls.<br /><br />I just stop working and I’m not replacing it with another one of this brand."
1,"Excellent customer service. The ear hook on my first pair was slightly askew (everything else, including sound quality, was great). Notified Invotek and they provided me a new pair. Very impressive."
1,Very easy to pair
1,Have multiple pairs..work great.  One set went through the wash and still worked great:)
1,"Actually bought this second pair as a back up to my first pair..That's how much I liked them.  But for some reason, I cannot get these to work.  Very disappointed.  UPDATE:  Called the seller and fixed issue.  My user issue!  YAY!"
0,Didn't even last 30 days.
1,Exactly what you'd expect from a pair of wireless headphones.  These work perfectly!  Their customer service is exceptional.
1,These are great for running.
1,"Great headphones, I do wish the battery lasted longer though"
1,"The sound quality on these are amazing. They fit comfortably around my ears and so not feel like they will fall off. The carrying case is super handy also, as I tend to misplace my headphones. Fast shipping, ordered at 7pm and was at my front door the next day. Would recommend these headphones to all my friends, and would order a pair again."
1,"This is the best one, little issue is the holding part on ear when you wear jacket in winter, but still fits well, manufacturer have to improve cord  could stay on skin well, during conference call good for hear, sometime trouble when your turn to speak on this headset, you have to loud little but it's good, worth of money. This could save your many dollars compare other big brands, I listen music my friend bought $199 worth similar from big brand name, when he listen my SENSO, he returned it and buy SENSO.. excellent and recommended."
0,You advertised this product was water proof they are definitely not I have tried 2 set and went out nothing but static want turn on or off so upset
1,As expected.
1,My headphones arrived the same day that purchased them and thus far have been exactly what I expected.
1,"I've really enjoyed using these while running during the last few months. I'm pleased with the sound quality and ease of use, and I rather like having the wire connection between ear pieces because if I need to take them out, I just drape them over my neck until I resume my listening. They've lived up to their water proof claim, too: I was caught in a torrential downpour a little while back and my personal soundtrack continued on just fine. My small notes: 1. Even with everything snugly secure in and around each ear, they do feel slightly loose. This lets outside noise in, but for me I'm glad to be more aware of my surroundings. 2. The audio warning that the battery is low comes on maybe five minutes before the battery runs out (at least at my volume level) so occasionally they've died while I'm mid-run. So I try to charge them after three hours of use so I'm not left without my tunes later. Otherwise, I'm pleased with the battery life. It can be easy to lose track of the total usage time per charge, so it would be nice to have an earlier warning. Overall: they're a solid and budget friendly set that I'm quite happy with."
1,"Great for active work, play or exercise."
0,"Tried these out for all of 10 minutes before deciding they weren't for me. As others have said, the bass is HEAVY by default and there is no mode adjustment. The problem is that the bass causes distortion and everything sounds horrible. Since my iPhone has no way of storing different EQ settings for different devices, its not worth keeping these to have to manually change the settings each time I switch devices. And even with the EQ set to bass-reducer, they still don't sound that good.<br /><br />I will say they seemed pretty comfortable and the additional accessories are a nice bonus though."
0,Disappointed with these headphones. Bought them for my brother in law for Christmas and come to find out that the left headphone doesn't work. It plays music significantly lower than the right headphone. Sadly I had to return them.
1,Work very well and stay in place.
1,Great product. Long lasting battery. It lasts 6 to 7 hours. I use them everyday and find them really comfortable and the sound is great.
1,I have been looking for a good pair of bluetooth headphones to work out with. These are it especially for the price.
1,"bought them as a gift, and got great feedback.  Excellent buy for the price!"
1,"Excellent sound, great noise blocking!  I love the phone/earbud charging cord and dual USB charger that comes with it."
1,"Very good for the price. Only problem is that it sits loose. Overall, fantastic."
1,"I wish these had better sound quality. They are comfortable and the volume is great, but they make it sound like i'm kinda underwater. I am probably exaggerating a little, because I've been spoiled with great earphones.. but that's the truth.<br /><br />If you have no idea what audiophile/high end sound stuff is , you'll be fine, but you are definitely getting what you pay for here.<br />If the sound quality was a bit better, I would totally be on board. Not a bad product and worth trying out if you aren't picky."
1,Good
1,"Just received the Bluetooth Headphones and they are terrific! Comfortable to wear, great sound and very reasonably priced. I highly recommend them. Great product."
1,Excellent
1,Works good inside. If running outside there is a large feedback noise in the headphones. Can not use for phone call outside.
1,"For going to the gym and getting sweaty the last thing I need to do is spend $200 on a pair of pricey wireless headphones or earbuds that fall out. Senso's product is rugged, WON'T FALL OUT OF YOUR EAR, is extremely easy to pair, and delivers great sound. What's not to like about them?<br /><br />I have to amend my review. I've changed earpieces several times since they have started to pop out of my ears at the gym. I like them in every respect-but falling out of my ears while exercising is a game changer-and not in a good way."
1,"Very clear and noise protracted,<br />its very clear,  would recommend for ppl that like to have no other noises around,"
0,can't even hear when driving down the road with the volume down.
1,"There are a great product, Though if you want good bass buy other ones but they may be more expensive. The battery is really good and they don't have a voice tell you if they are low battery etc. . If you want earbuds that are good and don't<br />want to spend a lot of money buy these."
0,Not worth the money
1,Great headphones. Also great customer service
0,I wrote a review earlier about the poor battery life but I have had to go back and edit it because my headphones no longer work. I got these August 12 3017 it is now September 16 3017. These headphones lasted just barely over a month. Do not buy these
1,"I purchased these for my brother who was an unarmed security guard for an apartment complex. He loves them. Comfortable, easy to wear, easy to store. He was very excited to show them off!"
1,These ROCK!!!! Cut out all of the sounds of the annoying people at the gym.  Actually stay in your ears!! Plus super loud!!! Great purchase!
1,Overall Great product so far. To my rough estimation the battery is around 9 hrs for full volume output which is fine. Comfortable to wear as well.
1,Good sound quality and bluetooth range.
1,Good sound. Fits well around my ear.
0,Product lasted 8 months developed a small short on the battery side &quot;left&quot; to the speaker so if you move the neck wire it shuts off. Seal was fine. On the enclosure.
1,The headphones sound really good & did not hurt my ears. These would make a good gift .
1,"Really pleased with these. I used them all the time when I workout, the batteries last longer than expected. Super comfy and never fall off, which is my pet peave about earphones! really happy about them."
1,"My hope when getting these was that maybe they wouldn't totally suck. I did not have high hopes for my first set of Bluetooth headphones. I am not an optimist.<br />They're awesome. The sound quality is better than any headphones I've ever had, I think. They are comfortable and secure in my ears. They hold the charge well. I was hoping for a little freedom from my phone at the gym, but when they're completely charged, they transmit well enough for me to grab water or a tower or whatever. When the charge is slipping, you can tell because the signal weakens at closer distances, but we're still talking 10' instead of 20'.<br />They are very intuitive and easy to use for me. They connect with my Droid Maxx2 very quickly and easily. Really, I love them. I don't write a lot of reviews, but I think they're awesome."
1,Writing this review after 9 months of use. No problems until now. Good battery life and sound as well. The only thing is we can't use this while sleeping on side.
1,"I’ve had these for years but like many others they randomly disconnect and beeps. You have to turn off the earphone and turn off Bluetooth on your phone. Then you have to then on blue tooth, ear phones and pair again to get it to work. It’s really annoying. Other than that, the sound quality is good and it stays in the ear."
1,Great this far.  Only complaint and may have easy fix once I open the manual.  The volume when texting is ear shattering..  hope to resolve this and if possible update this review.
1,I like it
0,"I have to make repeated attempts to sync with my iPhone. I tried the other day before a walk, w/o success6-7 times) and finally gave up."
1,Every time I plug it up with some while it is connected to my Samsung it cuts off the CALL. So my Waze was running and Every time it said turn or and message it would cut off my call. So I disconnected my wake to call back. Then I plug the phone to charger while I walk around my around my room on a call.  It cut off. I have a Samsung 7
1,"&#34; These are very good for the price, really enjoying them!&#34;"
1,Very good and affordable headphones for a runner like me. The sound does not seem muffled and the bass is adequate
1,"Setup is a piece of cake. The packing is nice. The range of ear bud sizes should fit just about anyone.<br />The sound quality of the earbuds is pretty good, but the microphone quality leaves a lot to be desired. If you think you will be using this for a lot of calls, or something like conference calls for work, you might want to look elsewhere."
1,"compre unos auricularesen en mayo 2020  que se descompucieron y fueron remplasados, se descompusieron por segunda vez y se puso un reclamo a SENSO  para su garantia  y asta el presente despues de un ano no se me a remplasado"
1,"I Iiked these headphones, but after about a year of use one of the sides stopped working."
1,Great sound
1,"I've only used these headphones a few times but I'm already impressed! The bluetooth is so handy for exercising! No more lugging my phone around and navigating the cord (which is super annoying when lifting weights). The sound quality is amazing; loud, clear, and crisp audio.  And best of all... the ear buds stay put! I use these while running and they don't budge.  Customer service is also fantastic.  I received a message directly from the seller notifying me they had shipped and was contacted again after they were delivered to make sure I was happy with the purchase.  Cannot say enough good things about this purchase.  Would highly recommend!"
1,So far so good. Had them on a run and they stayed in place. Did a leg routine in the gym and they stayed in place. The sound was pure. The controls are easy to find and operate. It's nice not having to tuck wires. They were comfortable and I didn't feel any sweet spots develop.
1,"My wife bought me a pair of the SENSO ActiveBuds for my birthday from Invotek. They actually sound pretty good. Had to work to find the best tip and settled on the foam. I was impressed. For working out, these worked remarkably well. I did however have a small issue with the ear loops and the vendor, Invotek, was very receptive and immediately addressed the issue. Not only would I recommend these buds, but I'd also recommend Invotek as well."
0,😋... Well after only just one month my earpiece is not up to par as it being of sports ear speaker. Now every time that I jump around exercise workout it completely shuts off 😮😮😮 yes I am not satisfied!
1,"Aug 2019 Aupdate - - - -<br />I bought another pair just because the value is hard to beat and I have to say these new ones work really well. The connection is great. Call quality brand new is very good, I am sure they will fail after a year of use like my first 2 pairs, but I think for the price you get the value you paid for.<br /><br />I use these to run several days a week, charging almost daily, and they work well.<br /><br />--------------<br />Its my second time buying these headphones. My first pair had really good range. i could be over 100 ft away from my phone with no issues. These ones barely go 30feet which forces me to stay close to my phone at the gym.<br /><br />Update: 1 year on, the headphones are no longer staying connected to bluetooth, they disconnect quite a bit. They get dislodged from the earlobe pretty easily while running, which is very annoying. This happens even more often if you sweat"
1,Great
1,"I wanted to love these...but I just couldn't.<br />First, the good:<br />* great battery life and fast recharge time<br />* nice look and physical feel<br />* decent design<br />* pretty good sound - except when they slip out of place (see below)<br />* the company seems great; they even sent a follow-up email after purchase<br />* nice accessories included<br />Now, the key flaws:<br />* The ear hooks are very soft. In theory, this is good. In practice, this means it's very easy for everything to move around. The ear buds slip out of the ear opening just enough to be annoying. They won't fall out of the ear or off your head, but when they slip out a little bit, the sound quality drops big time (especially the loss in bass tones). This happens even with the right sized ear tips.<br />* The ear hooks would seem to be more comfortable than a more rigid option, but the opposite is true. I think maybe because they are so soft, it puts more of the work on the earpiece and is therefore less comfortable (and that might also be why it slips out more). See note below on a comparable option.<br />* The multi-function button on the side of the right earpiece is a horrible idea. It makes sense in theory, but again fails in practice. Every time you go to re-insert the earphone (see first flaw listed), you run the risk of accidentally pushing the button. It doesn't happen every time, but enough to be annoying.<br />Because of these major flaws, I'm not keeping them.<br />A few very minor annoyances:<br />* the extra USB charging cable included with the car charges is a nice thought, but it's only going to work with Apple devices<br />* the extra accessories are a nice touch, but if they are adding to the price, I'd rather save a few bucks and not have them; it's highly unlikely I'd actually use the carrying case, I already have a car charger, and the extra cable, as mentioned, is worthless to someone who doesn't use Apple stuff<br />I tried these [ [[ASIN:B01BV2BPVS TaoTronics Bluetooth Headphones Wireless In Ear Earbuds Sports Sweatproof Earphones with Built in Mic (Cordless 4.1, Secure Ear Hooks Design, 7 Hours Play Time)]] ] at the same time and found them to be better because they don't slip out of the ear (the ear hook is a bit more rigid, yet still somewhat flexible and far more comfortable). The sound quality on them is just as good if not better, and they stack up in every other way to be as good or better than the SENSO.<br />There is one flaw in the ear-hook design, as a category, though: if you wear glasses or sunglasses, they get in the way, caught up, and annoying. With the SENSOs, this makes them even more prone to not staying in the ear opening where you want them.<br />I really wanted to love these, but I just can't. With a few improvements, they could be great."
1,Bought so my spouse to wear when he works out and on the train to and from work. They work and sound good and he likes how small they are so he can easily tuck them away or just let hang from his neck when not in use
1,Super high quality sound and for under $30. If you need wireless headphones look no further. Set up was breeze as well.
1,These head phones are awesome  I just worked a 12 hour day and I plugged them in on my 30 mins lunch and they lasted all day at work and also I've never had a pair the connect to my phone as son as I turn them on and the show is awesome best 20 dollar head phones ever ... I'm a mig welder and these work great for me and dont have to turn them all the way up to have good sound ether and the pieces that are behide the ear doesn't bother with my safely glasses km and my hood ... now it's just to see how long they last in my line of work
1,Great headphones.  Charged quickly and lasted a full eight hour listening period.  Great fit and value for the price.
1,"I bought these just for personal, listening to music use.  The sound quality is great and they are comfortable."
0,"3.31.17  Okay, I've had these for a couple of months now and I am done with them.  It's so frustrating to be at the beginning of a work out when you get a low battery alert that means it will be shutting off completely within 5 minutes.  I had to start carrying an extra pair of headphones with me.  I've decided to throw these away and find another pair.<br /><br />These are very comfortable to wear.  There isn't a handy way to know what your battery level is at.  Mine gave an audio cue that the battery was low 2 minutes before it died.  Not really helpful if you're heading out on a run and it dies just after you start."
1,Like the way they fit and feel. Not sure of sound quality yet. Bass seems to be lacking a bit. Very nice otherwise. I would recommend especially for the great price. Worth every penny.
1,Love it. Good quality sound. Easy to wear during long run
1,Fit great. Sound is also on point. Most comfortable with silicone ear grip able to shape around ear perfectly.
1,These headphones sound amazing.  I love them. They charge fast and I own two pairs.
1,exactly what you want from bluetooth headphones meant for exercise!
1,I bought these two years ago. I don’t have even a single complaint about it so far. Last summer I gifted these to 8 of my family members and friends and they loved it. Best product for good price. About to buy one more for a friend.
1,"For the price you can’t beat these.  I listen to news , podcasts and audio books for the most part, so they are awesome! Could stand to have longer battery life like all of these."
1,These work great....IF you’re within just a foot or two of the transmitter. Connect to AppleTV 12 feet away and it drops.
1,"Wanted to get a handsfree solution to listen to music in the gym. I saw these based off the previous reviews, thought i'd give them a shot. Was definitely not disappointed. Very comfortable, connected to my galaxy s7 seamlessly, and came with a handful of accessories. Great buy!"
1,Very good sound.  Great product for the price.
0,There is background static noise when paired
0,Used it once and returning the next day... Audio was OK but the headphones did not stay on while running. I had to adjust them several times while running .The clip that goes around the ear is flexible and doesn't stay on.  I would not recommend this set.
1,"I have had these headphones for a week now and they have exceeded my expectations.  I have a Lenovo business laptop running Windows 7, a 5 year old HP laptop running Windows 10, and a 4 year old Android phone running Android 4.4.2.  These headphones had no problem connecting to any of these old devices, and they sound better than any ear-bud headphones I've ever owned, including wired headphones.  I was also surprised they do block some external noise.  I don't remember reading anything saying they would, but they do.  I wear them for about five hours a day while working on my computer and they are very comfortable.  The battery lasts a little over a day, so between 6 and 8 hours of continuous use.  Not too bad for such a small package.  I recommend these to anyone looking for a good sounding pair of ear buds."
0,"Within one year of receiving my headphones, the battery will not charged. I sent three messages to the seller and I only received one response back. Their response is to reset and disconnected my device. After I reset and disconnected my device, the headphones still will not charge."
1,I love them! I could set my phone down upstairs and walk down stairs with the headphones on and still listen to my music. I love jogging with them too.
1,"It came on time and as advertised. Good sound for the price, works well with all my blue tooth stuff, and getting different size tips helps."
1,"Update 2018-04-30: Received a replacement about 12 days after my last update when I brought the problem to the attention of the manufacturer. They were very understanding and easy to work with. They asked for an explanation, we worked through some steps to attempt to address the issue on my side with no luck. They then issued a replacement that took about 10 days from our last communication to show up. The best part is that my first set must have been worse than expected because the new set is not overwhelming on the bass side of the spectrum and is functioning as expected with a good battery duration and great sound. I'm much happier with this set and would recommend them to anyone.<br /><br />Update 2018-03-27: The battery died. These no longer function. They don't take a charge and don't turn on. The multi-function button to turn them on is easily pressed when they're stored in their case and they've been turned on unexpectedly too. I wouldn't recommend these headphones. I'm going to contact the manufacturer to replace them since they're in the 12-month warranty period and update this review with the details.<br /><br />These are great headphones. The silicon earbuds kept falling out and I would have rated them one star if they were the only earbuds with the product but they have foam earbuds as well and they fit perfectly.<br /><br />I would have given them a 5-star rating but the sound has overwhelming bass that requires that I go into the settings of my phone and bring down the entire left side of the equalizer from 1 kHz band. I have other Bluetooth speakers that connect to my phone and they all produce the same high sound quality that I can keep my &#34;V&#34; equalizer pattern with and enjoy my music. These headphones require the reduction of bass. They do have crisp clear treble but it's difficult to hear it because of the bass level."
0,"Thus headphone had great sound with great quality... but this device don't last long I bought this around Christmas time and the battery just died on me and not coming back on. The whole thing is charged and there's no damage to the headphone  whatsoever it just stop coming on, recommend powerbeats or another version of this just a little more money to spend so spend 25 bucks on this...do not buy this device people"
1,"Overall the headphones are good sound quality is good good sound when talking on the phone, wind reduction is good. There light easy to recharge and they recharge fast. When you turn on the headset it tells you that it's on and it's connected but does not tell you how high the battery level is, so you don't know when to recharge it."
1,so far I really like them
1,These earbuds are great! I have small ears and usually cannot wear any earbuds for more than 30 minutes without them hurting my ears. I can comfortably wear these SENSO earbuds for hours without my ears hurting. They are also great for working out because no cords get in my way. And very easy and clear to have phone conversations. Great buy!
1,Packaging looked great. Earbuds sounds even better. Very happy customer
1,"Amazing headphones!  Seals great to my ears, can't hear anything but great music.  Easy pairing,  multiple charging options,  just a great product for a great price.  And they got here in 2 days!"
1,There are great for running!  Also are coming down in price since the last pair I ordered!
1,"I ordered these for my wife and after “testing” them for her I think we need another pair. Sound quality is good, I thought bass response was also good.  Bluetooth range covered the whole floor of our house, not a big house but still good coverage.  Impressive value."
0,"First, the good news. These headphones sound nice and I am particularly appreciative of the different size ear buds that come with the headphones.<br /><br />Now the bad news. The Bluetooth connection is quite poor, they stopped working entirely after only two months of use. And even before they died completely I noticed that the music would blotch out if I just turned my head away from my phone. Also, I didn't like the shape of these headphones; it caused the wind to catch them and make the music inaudible except at very high volumes. This same thing hasn't happened with my new pair which has a more sleek design that doesn't catch the wind."
1,I was pleasantly suprised by the sound quality of these. clear bluetooth and easy controls. charge with micro usb (included). comes with a variety of earbud sizes and a pair of soft molding rubber tips.
0,Bought them because of all the good reviews but they're fake! My pair don't even work received them faulty I guess.  very disappointed.
1,Excellent performance and back up service by company.
1,Great product at awesome price. Fast and amazing customer service. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for headphones.
0,They won't work one ear phone won't work no sound junk
1,"great product for the price, and great customer service too!"
1,Wow!! I am really amazed at the quality and sound of these headphones!  They are 10x better than my Sony Bluetooth! Money well spent! Two thumbs up!!!
0,"I've had these headphones for about 11 months now, and while for the most part they have been excellent (some connection issues, and some times where the audio cut out for a second or two), I began to have issues with the headphones turning themselves off after 20 seconds.  I reached out to customer service who instructed me to do their calibration reset, but that didn't fix the problem.  They then asked for my order number (I assume to replace them since they are still under warranty), and after that I haven't heard one word from them despite the fact that I followed up with them 3 times.  The headphones are fine for the price, but don't expect them to last and don't expect the company to stand by the 1 year warranty.  I just ordered from another company that I hope will have more reliable and honest customer service though I assume I'll hear back from Senso once my warranty expires."
1,excellent sound .good fit
1,"This was a gift to my husband so that I don’t have to hear the sound form his tablet, laptop etc I’m happy"
1,very happy they work great easy to use would buy somemore
1,"These headphones are great!! The battery lasts really long and they are super comfortable. I've use them for half marathon training and never had an issue during any of my long runs. They don't drain my phone's battery either. I was hesitant to get over-the-ear headphones, but they are flexible and soft and stay put and my ears got used to them after the first use.<br /><br />The sound and bass quality is perfect, they really create that sense of being immersed in the music/sound. They are perfect for running. I once forgot to charge them before a distance run (my fault, not the headphone's fault) and my old backup pair of wired headphones didn't even compare! They also connect easily to my computer, which allows me to watch Netflix and I multitask doing chores or crafts. They have a wide range too. I'll charge my phone in the living room and am able to continue listening as I work around the house. It's only until I leave the house and go to the far end of the garage that they disconnect, but they come back immediately when I'm back inside.<br /><br />These pair immediately and overall very easy to use. The controls are great and it's easy to skip around through my playlist and control the volume while running. I like the freedom of the wireless bluetooth controls and appreciate not having to pull my phone out in the middle of a run. I've taken phone calls on them without any issues and they automatically pause the music, tell me what number is calling, and restart the music once the call ends.<br /><br />Other things to note: they're lightweight and hang around your neck when not in use and I like that they came with a little case for safe keeping. I think they look pretty cool too, similar to some name brand over the ear earbuds.<br /><br />Also, Senso/Invotek have FANTASTIC customer service and really stand by their warranty. I definitely recommend both the headphones and the company. I can't wait to run my upcoming half marathon with these keeping me motivated!"
1,Buy two! these are the great.....and what a kit! everything is included......you need nothing....pairs fast and great sound.  AS good as Beats!
1,"Extremely comfortable. I don't even know they're on after a while and they don't come out regardless if you're running, jumping or trying to shake them loose. The sound is also great. Wasn't expecting this much base from these little buds. The volume control is conveniant and easy to push as well as skipping songs and answering calls and such. Can't say about battery life yet cause I charge mine everyday, but they've held out. No complaints really. Definitely worth the money. Don't hesitate cause they're a small company, these are solid."
0,"Bought these after my 2nd set of Phaiser headphones died. Out of the box, they worked great. I plugged them in to charge when I received them for 2 hours like the instructions said, and they worked just fine. The sound is awesome, but I wish there was a way to check the battery level (my phaisers had the option to do a quick 2 press on the main button and it would tell you the battery level).<br /><br />After 4 days of use, I got the &#34;Battery low&#34; message. I took them home, plugged them in for 2 hours, and noticed that the LED didn't light up. Oh well, whatever. Took them to the gym the next day, worked out for 20 min, and got the &#34;Battery low&#34; message again&#34;. Thought maybe it was user error, so I took them home and charged them again for 30 min, didn't see the LED light up, figured maybe it was just me, charged them for another hour. Today, they died after 10 minutes of use. Returning them, I had such high hopes for them based on sound quality, but yet again they were a letdown."
1,Great headphones for the price. I was surprised by the sound quality.
1,I'm satisfied with the stuff.
0,"The sound quality was great, the battery life even better but the 1 downside for me is that it couldn’t stay in my ear while doing a bench press. I tried all the ear pieces but nun could fit tight enough."
1,"I LOVE THEM! Best sound I've ever heard and what a value for the price! Very pleased. Recieved fast! Dave in Tyler, Tx"
1,They are great
1,"Bought 2 for my son.  He loves them.  I like the price.  I bought them because the audio jack stopped working in his phone.  He is a runner.<br /><br />Note after 3 months one of the bud speakers failed, don't know if it was wire damage.  My son is college kid who shoves everything in his pocket."
1,Very happy...great value product.
1,"They work good, also the sound is loud and crisp. The battery life is decent. The only problem so far is that the ear buds tend to fall out of my ear while im doing quick movements."
1,"This is a great pair of headphones, especially for the price. If I have one complaint its that the chord is too long, other than that no complaints so far."
1,Solid quality at a very low price.
1,They're not comfortable
1,"So far very happy with the product, did arrive two days before schedule and in perfect condition. The performance to this point is the expected, very easy to pair with my IPhone, the sound quality can be better but is very good for running and also keep aware of the surroundings."
1,"Sound quality is great. Might not be the best, but these are good quality headphones.<br /><br />Also, the customer service was amazing. I was happy with how they handled my issue."
1,"I have really small ears and these earbuds actually fit. Took off one star because when I run or do a lot of jumping, usually one side will start to fall out but it fits way better than any other Bluetooth earbuds I’ve had and the price is good!"
1,I really like my headphones.  Easy to use.  I just like them.
1,These are awesome for the price! Highly recommend
0,I enjoyed these head phones for just about two months when the power button remained in the &#34;pressed&#34; position and now the device continuously malfunctions. I hope the seller will come through and offer me a replacement. I will revise this post once I hear back from seller.
1,"You cannot beat these buds for the price.  Great sound, louder than most blue tooth earbuds.  They also come with a great little case for storage.  The micro USB/Lightning cable that comes with it was a nice surprise as well."
1,"Just got these new headphones and like them alot!  They are very reasonably priced and have a good sound.  The carrying case is also very nice!  I love the fact that it comes with extra earbuds which I actually needed to use.  And the ""extra's"" they give you (magnetic phone mount and card holder) are a very nice bonus.  The only issue I had was trying to change the ear buds (hahaha) but I got it figured out.  :-)<br /><br />Nice job!!!"
1,Very nice
1,Great idea
0,"I live in a windy area, and these are really hard to hear in the wind. Also, they don't stay in very well."
1,"Used to have the jaybird bluebuds but they started dying on me.  When searching for some new ones, I figured I would try something cheaper so it wasn't so disappointing when they mess up and I have to say I prefer these!  The fit is soooo comfortable, they hold a charge for a long time and they are stylish.  Would definitely buy this again if mine mess up.<br /><br />TLDR: SENSO &#62; Jaybird"
0,poor warranty
1,"By far the best and comfortable earphones I’ve purchased. The price is awesome as well. I’ve purchased these repeatedly (I lose them, break them while working-my fault!) and will order a replacement when the time comes.<br />I get 8-10 hours of straight play time.<br /><br />Only two negative things, one is that I wish the Blue LED light was so bright at night. Dark nail polish will fix that!<br />Two, once you determine which soft plastic inserts fit your ear, dab a small amount of super glue so they stay on the plastic ear piece.<br /> Other than that, the sound is great, price is great! Recommended. I love them!"
1,"had purchased another brand of wireless headphones a month earlier, but was not happy due to the fact that the sound sucked and they would not stay in my ears if I ran or even turned my head while working out.  Got these yesterday and wore them to work out this morning.  Couldn't be happier.  Stayed in my ears the entire time and did not pull out when I moved my head.  the sound was fantastic as well.  highly recommend these if you need a pair of wireless headphones when you workout."
1,These headphones are great! They have excellent sound quality and have a long battery life. They are easy to connect and use. The quality of these headphones far exceeds the price.10/10.
1,"My first pair quit accepting charge after 2 months.  No problem, replaced very easily and new ones are great.  I can't believe the price.  I have bought more expensive ones and cannot keep them in my ears.  The ear buds on these are comfortable and stay in. Excellent sound.  You can get and extra six months warranty by registering at their website.  One year warranty without registering.<br />Can't go wrong with these."
1,"They work great. So far,  I've used them at work and on a flight. I look forward to taking them for a run."
1,"The not positive:<br />1) These are not aerodynamic so when there is a breeze there is wind noise, which although minor takes away from whatever you're listening to.<br />2) They are somewhat large and (just a little) uncomfortable on the ears too, after extended wear too.<br />3) Having my phone in my left pocket... or anywhere on my left side including my hand causes sound cut-out. This does not occur if I hold my phone in my right hand or even my pocket.<br /><br />The positive:<br />1) Sound quality and quality is very good.<br />2) It comes with a nice case and extra ear bud sizes for almost any sized ear.<br />3) Over the ear wrap is something I prefer to keep the earbuds from falling out during intense workouts.<br /><br />The takeaway:<br />It is a little annoying not being able to hold my phone in my left hand, having to keep it (always) on the right. The wind noise and the minor discomfort (I feel) over extended use are also negatives but overall the sound quality and quality is what I gauge as it's greatest attributes. I'll keep my phone on my right and deal with the wind noise.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />Add this to the positive column... the company is active and provides prompt feedback. They addressed the cutting out issue and following their guidance, I wore the headphones for an hour with my phone in my left pocket without issue.<br />The wind noise and discomfort exists regardless of what silicone earbud I try... including the ones from the LG headphones I've worn the past two years. This is minor and provided as feedback but not meant to dissuade.<br />My initial 3-star review was updated to 4 because the cutting out issue was resolved and also due to the company caring about customer service."
1,"a little loose on the ear, but compared to its price, it works great. I had powerbeats 2 before buying this one and I can tell you that they have the same quality!"
1,"I have just started using these and so far they are very good, will see how they stand up to exercise sweat."
1,"I bought these headphones to use at the gym and so far they are great.  The sound was very good, they stayed in place, they are comfortable and easy to put in, and they are sweat proof.<br /><br />The value is excellent.  I paid $37 and it comes with a lot of extras like a carrying case, 3 sets of extra eartips, wire tie,car charger, a short charging cable, and 3 foot charging cable.  Also the packaging is nice."
1,"My husband has a competitors brand, these were a fraction of the cost so I thought I would give them a try. They fit great and sync easily to my phone. I would highly recommend these if you are in the market for some wireless headphones."
0,Headphones are great easy to manage and connect with my phone. Unfortunately the ear piece is to big for my ears and they keep falling down even if I'm not working out. Very dissapointing. I was out of the country and just came back I'm not sure if I can return them or is to late.
0,"I purchased these, at first they worked so great, but after 3 months of having them, they won’t charge anymore and won’t turn on! The power button stop working. So sad that they did not last long at all."
1,"The 1st time I tried to turn music up, I turned them off but otherwise happy with them."
1,For $40 I think they are pretty high quality. My husband has the Beats version and he said they look pretty much identical. The sound quality is pretty good. I like that I can talk on the phone using them. I have small ears so it was a concern for me that they would fall off. I went to the gym and tested them out and they worked out great. I have wore them around the house for 3 hours at a time and they didn't cause any pain or soreness. Score! I purchased the extended warranty to go along with them too. My husband is considering buying a pair too. Awesome buy!
1,Nice head phones for the cost.  Ablittle crackly ehen you try to push them tight in your ear
1,"Such a great price and great quality! Love that it includes a lot of extras, such as a car charger and extra ear buds. For sure great value!"
0,topped working after 3 months
1,Just sought these out after my hubby lost his old headphones.  I bought a pair for myself a few months back and they are GREAT for workouts!  He stole mine when his disappeared.  I had no other option.  :)
1,So far so good. Fit great and stay on during my long sweaty workouts. Would definitely recommend.
1,Use mostly when doing exercising. Sound is a little tinny but good enough for that.
1,The battery power lasts like they say it does. Very loud. Top volume can hurt.
0,"Utter garbage. Been using them for a year with my iPod nano and there isn't a time that they didn't shut off, disconnect, skip or something. Finally had it and ripped them apart and pulverized them in the road with a rock and threw them into the road to let cars finish the job. Worthless garbage."
1,comfortable but a little bulky. the charge is lasts about 5 hours.
1,You won’t find a better pair for the same price. Great battery life and solid Audio quality.
1,Excellent Bluetooth headphones for a great price.
1,"Second pair of these, I bought these as a gift since my daughter loves hers so much. Great sound, blue tooth wireless. Have help up very well with the first pair too"
1,No problems to report at all.  These headphones are comfortable and easy to operate.  I would highly recommend.
1,"These are quickly becoming my go to headphones for my iPad. The price is great and I love that it came with various earpieces, case, car charger, and lightning/mini usb charging cable. They stay on extremely well while I’m working out and most people just assume they’re Beats. The only thing keeping them from being 5 stars is that there is slight feedback when they are turned on and nothing is playing."
1,"I've used the head phones for only three days in doors on the treadmill, but so far so good.  Sound quality is very good.  Ease of use is very good.  The over ear support is comfortable, but pretty flimsy.  I'm not sure if this will matter on long outdoor runs or not.  No indications of an issue thus far.  I'm pleased with the value of my purchase."
0,I worked fine for about 4 times. then quit working right after 30 day return
1,"Although I really liked this product, I originally gave it a low review on Amazon because of a battery issue.  I intended to return the headphones to Amazon for a refund.  However, almost immediately after posting the review, I received an email from the president of Senso expressing his sincere apologies and stating that they would like to replace my headphones with a new set.  I replied and told him that I would be willing to do that.  Within a few hours, I received an email from Senso Support asking me to confirm my mailing address.  Long story short, I had a new set of headphones less than a week after I posted my original review.  Therefore, I am very appreciative of the excellent product support that I received from Senso!  Also, I do really like these headphones.  They sound great (excellent clarity), are easy to operate and very comfortable.  I wear them while using various cardio machines at the gym, and I hardly realize that I have them on.  They also come in a very nice carrying case and have several accessories included.  By the way, I am voluntarily changing this review for the reasons I just stated."
1,Great head phones. The quality is excellent. They fit well and have multiple adapters.
1,"Comfortable and easy to use, good sound quality with good range from the sound source. Overall in the short time that I have had them I would rate the product very favorably."
1,The buds fit my ears like no others have and the sound is great!!
1,Great sound! I use them only while running. Very comfortable!
1,Liked so much that I bought 4 for family members.
1,Love love love! Everything is perfect. Used them today at the gym for the first time. Sound was great. Talking with them through the mic was great as well. The case and chargers awesome! So far so good. Glad I got these!
1,"Great sound quality, perfectly comfortable fit, all for an extremely reasonable price. I've searched for comfortable wireless headphones for years and tried several different varieties. So glad I'm done with all that &#34;noise.&#34;"
0,"These ""waterproof"" headphones quit working the very moment they touched the water."
1,Fantastic
1,Very light and they sound OK
1,"These are great headphones.  I mostly listen to books and movies on them, so I can't say much about the treble/bass, but the sound is clear for what I need them for.  The only reason I give them 4 stars is for some reason they cut out when I'm at the end of my driveway, even though my phone is just in my pocket.  I have no idea why, but it's consistent, and if I turn them off and restart them there are no problems.  Otherwise they stay on my ears well whether I'm walking or running, and they were exactly what I was looking for!"
1,"I have a hard time keeping ear buds in my smaller than average ears while running, but these are a perfect fit! I don't love it when you increase the volume too much, it beeps really loud back at you, right in your ear, but maybe theres a way to change that?"
1,"Love them. Have two pairs, one set for the pool, one set for work. Great sound."
1,"Excellent wireless ear buds, I was surprised by the quality. I get nothing for this review I just felt the need to let everyone know. These are better than my broken Beats!! The pairing is simple with a voice promt which is cool. The sound quality is very good and they are load which I love at the gym!! They may look bulky but they are very comfortable. Can't go wrong for the price so do yourself a favor and pick these bad boys up!!"
1,Fantastic sport buds
1,"Yes, happy and works well."
1,My boyfriend loves these more than his Beats. He loves them so much he's purchased 4 pair just in case they discontinue these or change the product
1,"I don't have anything to compare these to besides my old regular earbuds, but these are annoying. Are the loops supposed to go around your ears? These just kind of float above my ears and I find myself constantly trying to wrap them while I'm running. I'm not a tiny person with tiny ears."
1,Can never go wrong with this product. Best headphones in the game.
1,Quality was good. The sound quaility was lot better than I expected for the price I paid. Overall great and fully satisfied.
1,They are awesome!!! The quality of the sound is outstanding. I never imagined that ear buds would sound like that.
1,"I use these headphones almost everyday. They are not even a year old yet and the battery life is TERRIBLE. I don't know if I got a bad pair or something, but if I don't charge them the same day they're more than likely going to die on me the next day I use them. I don't even turn up the volume very high. It's usually very low.<br /><br />Other than the battery, nothing else is too terrible. I think the worst part next to the battery is the cord holding them. They get caught/tangled up in my hair so easily it's annoying. If you have long hair, watch out.<br /><br />The sound is alright, it's not amazing but it's not bad. Definitely does not have any noise cancelation at the level I listen to, but I listen to them really low.<br /><br />The plastic for the ears isn't too bad, they don't seem to bother my ears. I wear glasses."
1,So much easier than having to plug headphones into my ipod and having to tuck the cord somewhere.  The sound is great.  I would recommend them.
1,"The minimal level of the sound is a little bit to high. If we are using it at the gum, it's fine. But if I want to listen to music at bed. It's too loud."
1,Great sound. works great.
1,I've only used the headphones a few times but I'm extremely satisfied with them so far. They seem like a quality product backed up with a good guarantee.  And now I've gotten an email from one of the company owners asking if I'm satisfied.  That's kind of unheard of these days. I'm very impressed with this company. Keep up the good work.
1,These are great headphones for the price!
1,The headphones have a great sound and fit perfectly. I purchased a set for myself and one for my wife and she likes them as well.<br /><br />She can take them to the gym or go out on a walk and completely zone me out. For that alone these headphones rock.
1,"My third pair of these in about a year (yeah I lose them/break them a bit often). All of them have been outstanding products; this one, however, seemed to have a receiver issue in the right ear that caused audio to pop in and out. I responded to an email from the company (they send you one when your device arrives) stating the problem. After walking through the issue, we determined it was the headphones themselves. From there, it was simple and easy for them to ship me a new pair of non-defective headphones. Easiest and least stressful customer service interaction I've ever had."
1,"Good sound, comfortable fit on ears and great price!!"
1,Love our new headphones!  We were especially satisfied that they came with any and everything you need to use/store and charge them!!
0,Headphones ARE NOT USABLE IN WATER WHILE SWIMMING.  The signal stops as soon as your head enters the water.  Unable to use them in the pool.
1,Very happy!!
1,These earphones last a pretty long time if your not blasting them 24/7 and the sound quality it awesome. I thought these were some cheap quality earphones....boy I was wrong.
1,Excellent sound. Customer Service is polite and prompt.
1,Excellent headphones
1,Headphones are legit. Crystal clear with deep bass. Also comes with a car charger and iphone charger.
1,"I do love these bluetooth headphones. Out of the three brands I've tried, these are my favorites. They are the only ones that I can seem to stay in my ears, although they do have to be readjusted every few minutes or so while running. The others I've tried just fall out within seconds. The sound quality is great, and my phone can be up to 15 yards away with no interruption. I can use these for one hour a day at the gym and only need to charge once a week. The ear piece is very malleable, so they are comfortable, and surprisingly stays put. Other than having to readjust every few minutes with vigorous activity, these are perfect."
1,They don't stay seated in my ears quite as well as my last pair and as such I lose some of the Range of the audio but the long battery life makes up for it.
0,"Liked how they felt and the sound quality, when I could actually hear it. If I was more than a foot or two away from my phone it completely cut out or would sputter and break up. I would love to like these but they just aren't usable."
1,"sounds great, the volume control does not seem to be sensitive enough for me personally."
1,Nice!! They work great...
1,"Very impressed so far. I never liked ear buds because they always fell out of my ears. These stay put, and the sound quality is surprisingly good.<br />I exchanged the buds that came attached for smaller ones that were included in the box.  The Bluetooth was easy to set up and works well.<br />Overall, great headphones for the price."
1,"Good functionality and connectivity, but poor quality for some kinds of music. Good deep bass, alright mid-range, crap treble. Anything with symbols, hi-hats, especially anything from the electronic and EDM genres is hopeless to listen to. Prospective buyers: if you're wanting good sound quality (and I'm comparing to basic Skullcandy headphones you can buy at Bartells), look elsewhere."
1,"Pretty good so far, battery is good too. I worked out 3 days in a row (1-2 hours at a time) without needing to charge it. They also come with a car charger and stuff which is really cool. I'd recommend them."
1,"I love the headphones! the quality of sound is awesome, the price is right and not having a cord in my way when running or working out is so convenient! I would definitely buy again!"
1,I wanted a nice sounding Bluetooth headset that was affordable and this fit the bill.  I use these when I work out and perspiration doesn't bother them at all.  I can charge them on the weekend and they last all week.  They also pair very easily with my iPhone.
0,I often gets disconnected and there's a weird background noise or something like an echo. I am returning it.
1,"For the price the headphones are okay I guess. They stay in place when running but they do cut out, almost sound like a scratched CD. I thought at first it was because my phone was too far away but when running I keep my phone on my arm with a workout band so I don't think that's the issue. They serve their purpose. The only really bad thing I would say is that they came with the wrong charger- which was really weird. These literally came with an iPhone like charger even though they have the port of an Android. Luckily I have extra Android chargers so I didn't see the need to return them.<br /><br />I would say if you can afford better, spend more, but if you just need something to make due these are a good choice."
1,Worth it for the price.  No complaints
1,"For now I will only rate it 3 stars because I just received it and don't know how is the sound quality, battery life an so on. I will for now give it that rating because as soon as I took them out of the package I started checking everything that came in the little box with this headphones, which I have to say I'm pleased. The only negative thing I have to say about this is that the USB charger was slightly bent and couldn't plug it into my USB port. Since I bought two of this items, one for my husband as well, I compared them and his looks perfectly fine as you can see in the pictures. Other than that it looks pretty decent. Now I just have to put it to test when I workout. I will be coming back to rate it again."
1,"They don't come out.!  I tried to head bang them out of my ears but they won't come out!  They are comfortable, easy to use and sound great. And they won't fall out of your ears."
1,They don't sound as good as I expected them too. I'd like more treble. But I do like them and they are comfortable to wear. They connect to my phone super quick!
1,Love it so much gonna get one for the wife
1,I used these yesterday mountain biking in the hills. Worked perfect! Awesome product!
1,Amazing sound! Easy to use for hours
1,I bought these for my college daughter for Christmas. She absolutely loves them! She's used them on a run outside as well as in the gym during her workouts. She's amazed at the level of noise cancellation and the comfort. These are a great product. I'll be ordering some for my son as well!
1,Originally I was hesitant because as a consumer we here a brand and expect quality. I was working towards my 3rd pair of Beats...and extremely upset about that given the brand. I came on here and decided to give Senso a chance and I am glad I did. My son cracked jokes on me being an Apple guy....but he himself gave me the stamp of approval once he heard for himself the sound quality and comparing them to his Beats. In any case...I havent had any issues at all. And based on the reviews even if I get 8 months out of them I still would feel I got my moneys worth and I didnt dish out another $129 for name brands. Highly recommended.
1,"I bought my first pair of these in May 2018, and they were fantastic-- 8 hour battery, good sound quality, snug fit, good price. I then bought a second pair for my wife in 2021, and they are now clearly more cheaply made. The sound quality isn't as good, the housing material is cold hard plastic (the old ones seem to have a softer coating, maybe vinyl?), the button is a bit loose so it clicks loudly, and the voice that announces power on/off and connected/disconnected is now so loud it's literally painful regardless of your volume setting. I can tell when my wife turns them on or off in the other room because the ""power on"" voice is so loud.<br /><br />I would have recommended the pair I got in 2018 to everyone, and I would not recommend the 2021 version to anyone. Unfortunately my 2018 pair just stopped working (it is now 2022, so about 4 years after purchase). The show up as charged 100%, but they immediately shut down after being turned on. I won't be purchasing these again."
1,"For the price, these are really nice headphones. They fit comfortably on the ear. Have not had a chance to workout with them yet. They are simple to operate and sync up very quickly. If I could improve, the highs could use some help but overall sound is good."
1,We really like these headphones.
1,"They are great and connect right away to my phone. I use them to run. One thing I have noticed is the wind interferes with the sound more than with my wired ear buds. I am experimenting with the different sized buds. With that said, I still will not go back to my wired headphones"
1,"The hooks are much too soft, to be any use....  Tape on box separated .....  maybe another set, but not this one......did not try. Turned off from experience.....update!....<br />  Loud, bassy,.....hooks soft, But!, they do offer some support, soft enough to forget you have them on.<br />  As I said, package (looked) opened or tampered with"
1,Beware! I love these headphones but they barely fit my ears. If the top of my ear was a few millimeters shorter then the over-ear part would just slide right off.<br /><br />Also: It's really annoying how it beeps when setting the volume to either the lowest or highest value on my phone. Especially since the beep is super loud when it &#34;warns&#34; me the I've reached the highest sound level. It just about blows up my ear drums.
0,"Sound quality is average, battery life is tolerable, noise cancellation is kinda there.<br /><br />Now for the important but, Bluetooth strength, yeah this shit starts getting choppy at at 4 feet. Phone on your left hand side? Nope not if you want a connection, phone more then 3 feet away, better be prepared for to start losing connection..<br /><br />Maybe they're actually waterproof I dunno, bout to find out but I honestly doubt it at this point"
1,"For being a bluetooth headphone set, it's great for a workout. It stays on AND in your ears. The sound quality leaves a little to be desired, but functionality-wise, it's great for running, lifting weights, or other aerobic exercises."
1,"Wow, great product, I wished I would've given up my mp3 player a long time ago."
1,"My new Senso ear buds are the best I've ever used. The sound quality is great, even the bass. They fit comfortably and securely over each ear. The on-off switch and volume control are on the right ear bud, very easy to adjust while wearing it. There is even a voice notification that they have been turned on or off, so you don't need to wonder. They paired very easily with my TV. I highly recommend this Senso product."
0,I was sold a used dirty pair of headphones. Disgusting!
1,Sounds is great and they don’t fall out or come loose like others.
1,"I've only had them a day but they fit 1,000 better than my beats wireless that I had. The beats lasted a year and then made a cracking sound and died. I'm hoping these last longer because I like them so much better!"
1,work well and stay on in the gym.
1,i Would like to know how much  warranty come with this senso Bluetooth headphones ?
1,These are great for the price and the sound is very good.  Bought 3 pair.
1,Stay in place really well. Great volume and easy to use
0,I've used these headphones at work and thats about it and today they randomly decided to stop working. I know when I bought them they were only about $30 but still you would hope they would last a tad longer
1,Good product for working out with.
1,Wireless must I say more
1,the sound is very good but the mic not much good when i talk in the phone call the sound seems far and not clear enough i think you need to work on the mic sensitivity
1,"Decent sound and great build quality for the price! Materials are good quality. I had one connection issue but it was most likely my phone as after restarting my phone(iPhone 6s) I have had no issues. Headphones came with a full charge. Package included 3 different sized buds that you can change out as well as foam &#34;earplug style&#34; buds. Also included was a USB charging cable, an Android/iPhone cable, cable clips, and a carry case."
1,I workout five times a week for about an hour to an hour and a half. These headphones have lasted me a week and a half with only one charge. Great sound quality and they really don't move when you workout. I am a sweater so this was really important to me. I would definitely recommend this to anyone  interested in wireless headphones.<br /><br />EDIT:<br /> My pair broke after five monthsof purchase but the excellent customer service and one year warranty don't make it a problem at all. They immediately agreed to send me a new pair and I'm so thankful again that I bought these amazing wireless Bluetooth headphones five months ago.
1,"I wanted to give them a 4, but the issues I have had kept me from doing so.  I do like them.  However, I am a little disappointed with the range.  I was expecting more.  Maybe it's normal compared to others.  The other issue I have been having is the connection keeps dropping.  I don't know if it's the buds or my phone.  I did not have this problem with other Bluetooth ear buds in the past. Just something to keep in mind. I would still say they are a good deal for the price I paid ($35 I think)."
1,So far these headphones are great! The only thing I'm having an issue with is they fallout of my ear but besides that they sound amazing and work great and last all day!
1,"I have been wanting to buy bluetooth ear buds for some time now. I am so glad I found these, the quality for the price is outstanding. Every piece of this product feels solid and I love the way they fit on and in my ear.  I have small ears and right out of the box these are perfect. I don't use them for sports but these stay in place for regular daily talking on the phone. The black and red color is perfect. They generously  give you a short and long cable and the carry case is quality as well. I would recommend these to anyone."
1,"These headphones work brilliantly! They were easy to set up, and deliver great sound when I am out mowing the lawn or doing other yard work. I couldn't be happier with my purchase."
0,"This was my second set. The first set died unexpectedly and I figured it was something I did, so my husband got me a pair for Christmas. Here we are in June and those died also.<br />This set suddenly wouldn’t hold a charge. They will charge and work for one workout, but the next time I use them, they are dead. Total crap. Disappointed because I liked being cordless. I’m looking for suggestions for brands that last longer than 5 months."
1,"good sound, comfortable, good price,good shipping<br /><br />design can be better and also if include a magnet to hold together when not wearing"
1,"Purchased and liked these headphones - for the money, they were good to listen to my audiobook. Soon after getting them a small piece broke on the casing and while the audio still worked, I was unable to wear and play theoff, etc.  I contacted the seller and after a brief conversation with customer service I was sent a brand new pair of earbuds, which I have been using for a few weeks. I'm happy with my earbuds and more than happy with the customer service I received from them  Senso!<br />I'll definitely order from this company if I have a need in the future!"
0,I've contacted Senso multiple times after my headphones stopped working entirely in the left ear piece but have not received any response.  I registered my product on their site and followed the contact directions.  I'm going to switch to a company that follows through on the warranty.
1,"Bought a pair and liked them so much I got some for my 10 year old son.  Only pair he’s managed to keep and not lose/destroy.  And he likes them too, imagine that!  They also come with some cool accessories bundled in."
1,My wife loves these. Great 👍 job guys.
1,"Sounds is impeccable, quality is great. Did not like the ear loop."
0,"The headphones lasted 3 months. I dropped  them from 2 feet, they disintegrated when they hit the floor. The warranty did not cover the damage. I am going to buy another pair from a different manufacturer."
1,I can't wait to go out on a jog with them on. So far they work great. Amazing and clear sound. I also like how fast they connect to my phone.
0,"I've had this product for two months and it was alright in that period of time - especially for the price, however after two months the plastic holdings on the earphone began to give out after normal use (just going to the gym) and it fell apart. This might of been a defective product, if this wouldn't have happened I would've rated this product a 4/5"
1,"The audio is clear, the battery life has been great so far. My main issue is that the loops for my ears are far too large. They stay in decently well on my jogs despite this - the different earbud size options help."
1,"Overall these earphones are legit one of the best compared to others and there price is just absolutely great seeing how these earphones are of such high quality and for such low price. Not just that, but their customer service is one of the best ones I’ve seen in such a long time in any other online company. If you want to look at great and affordable earphones then this is the best choice by far!"
1,I love this product so much that I've given this pair to my brother and purchased the newer version.
1,I’ve had these headphones for a handful of months and I have no complaints. The battery life last longer than most Bluetooth headphones I’ve ordered from amazon. Sound quality is good enough for me and people can hear me fine on phone calls.
1,A good value for the price. Easy to pair with my phone. Comfortable fit. And I love that a case came with the headphones.<br />The sound quality is really good. Serves the purpose while working out at the gym.<br />I would recommend these.
1,"I've used these for several months at the gym and while running and they are AMAZING.  The sound was great and they even worked pretty good to make calls from to. Unfortunately they just stopped working.  They went totally dead with no audio or indicator lights.  Fortunately, SENSO support has been trying to help.  I'll update this review with my outcome but I really hope they do right because when these were working, they were great!<br /><br />Update 12/10 - They suggested a procedure to reset them, but it did not work.  They say they will be sending replacements.  I really hope they do because I love these headphones.<br /><br />Update 1/14 - I got my new pair and they work great!"
1,"Love the headhones.  They work all over my 2 story house with the phone plugged into a charger on my desk.  Came with extras such as magnetic holder for phone to car vent, cell phone credit card holder, wire clip and carrying case.  They are a little buggy when connecting to iphone 6 Bluetooth  but it is probably the phone as much as the headphones.  You get a little voice prompt when turning on and off and when connecting to Bluetooth which is nice.  They seem to keep extraneous noise out while wearing.  They should be a great help when mowing season begins - not being connected with a wire doing yard work."
1,works well
1,Excellent sound quality
1,Works great!!!!
1,Ear buds sound great long battery life great for the money
1,Quick delivery and so far sounds great<br />Easy setup and connection
1,"Best headphones I've bought in a long time. They fit nicely, they pair up easily. Wonderful sound. Great buy."
1,I got these for my fiancé and he LOVES them. He said they're just as good as beats but a fraction of the cost. Bluetooth works perfectly. Very happy with this purchase !
1,"Good product, quick delivery"
1,Range limited but sound great
1,"Best quality available at this price point, hands down. Given that these are a budget set of headphones, I was pleasantly surprised by the audio quality, as well as battery life, charge time, and bluetooth range. I can imagine that some might take a bit of time to get used to the fit, but it I, for one, had little issue in that regard. Furthermore, it's that same fit that ensures that these things are just not very likely to fall off.<br /><br />Now, extended use can get a little uncomfortable, but that's true of many, many ear buds, and again, stressing the price point, I find that this is a fairly minor down side."
1,For the price these are awesome...quick delivery and easy to use and the battery last for weeks
0,"While the sound quality worked for what I needed, two separate pairs lasted less than one year. I only wore them for about 3 hours a week while working out and kept them charged. I would not recommend."
1,"Having received these headphones last week and having used them consistently for quite a while, I can say that I am satisfied with them so far. The sound quality is pretty good and for 36$, they have greatly exceeded expectations. They come well packaged with a car charger, a regular charger, different sizes of ear buds and a warranty card! Great product."
1,Not even sure how it happened but I think I've only used it 2 or 3x since purchasing in July. This doesn't seem repairable and I've lost the return window. There's that. Good luck to others.
0,"I knew these headphones wouldn't be the best quality, but they are a little more subpar than I expected. I have had them for about four months now, but the issues I am having have been happening since a few weeks in. These headphones are not great in the wind - the air flows right through them and makes it difficult to hear. These headphones also have trouble connecting to my phone through bluetooth, and even when they do, the sound quality is usually pretty bad. For example, the sound might be quiet (even at maximum volume) or it will make glitching sounds like they are out of range, even if I am holding my phone in my hand. Furthermore, no one can ever hear me if I use these headphones for a phone call. Overall, based on my experience, I would not recommend these headphones."
1,Great.
1,Good Headphones for great price! Great sound! Really happy with this purchase!!
0,"These speakers sounds good for the value. I was using mostly for the phone calls and hardly 4 hours a week. Right after 6 months, it stopped charging and never came back. Tried to contact manufacturer but showing as product support ended where initially mentioned as 1-year manufacturer warranty."
1,Love these
1,"These are impressive and extend way beyond their price point. The sound quality is plenty good for active headphones and actually good enough to listen to when not bike riding, hiking, etc. I was very impressed by how comfortable they are. I am very sensitive to textures and these were just right. Soft where they need to be and firm where they need to be and you can barely feel the ear loops, which is a first for me. Ussualy the ear pieces are uncomfortable and that is not the case here. The carrying case and other accessories that come with the headphones make them seem like a much more expensive product. For this money or even double, you can't go wrong. Just buy them."
1,"The headphones are a very good product. The sound is very good, I used them for running and worked perfect.<br />I strongly recommend this product."
0,"I really wanted to like these and with such a high user review rating I thought I would. But I don't, because:<br />1. They are uncomfortable around the ears.<br />2. They pull whenever you turn your head/neck due to the cord lying on your neck (yes, I adjusted the cord with no improvement)<br />3. They make you look like you have mini Princess Leia buns on your ears and not tough nor cool whatsoever.<br /><br />However, pros:<br />1. Very fast pairing<br />2. Decent battery life"
1,Work great for exercise. Long lasting battery. Easy to recharge and fast.
1,quality of sound is really good. it just keeps falling off of my ear. had to buy separate buds that fits my ear
0,I just received this product but without the bonus items that are advertised:<br />Bonus Items:<br />• Dual Port USB Car Charger<br />• 3ft. Charging Cable for Apple (Lightening connector) and Android (Mini USB connector) Devices.<br />Is there anything I misread?
1,Very easy to pair and sound great. The rubber ear loops are helpful but don't seem to really do much to keep them in my ear. I wish they fit a bit more snuggly. I tried a few of the different adapters but the default size were the best. Well made and a long lasting charge. Good for grilling or working around the house but would not stay in the ears well enough for running or other more strenuous activities.
0,Left side does not stay on. Wish the rubber retains the ear shape more so it clings instead of sliding off.
1,3rd time purchasing this brand and probably my last (insert sad face). The issue I have is with the design. New style has adjustable/flexible ear wraps (the rubber part that goes around the ear) which sounds like a great idea but they are sooo malleable that they easily get bent out of shape and never really sit on my ears well.
0,"Its a great deal, and these are very comfortable to wear unfortunately the battery life pooped out after one week. The car charger that is included has been very handy, I was charging them on my way to the gym. It got to the point where they wouldn't turn on unless I pulled them in, even for a few minutes. Now, the blue light will indicate a full charge however, they won't even turn on. I have tried resetting them several times. I dealt with the poor battery life for quite some time, but it times for me to move on to a different product. For the price, there is a lot included with these ear buds, but be prepare for them to not last very long."
1,"Love these headphones. The sound quality is amazing. I downloaded music, so I listen as I take my walks. Great buy!"
1,"Just what I was looking for.  Great price for great buds.  The ear buds are light weight and comfortable.  They stay in place during my workouts.  The nose reduction is good.  The extra accessories were a nice bonus (I.e. storage case and chargers).  Overall,  I'm very pleased with my purchase."
0,I have bought these for a long time and they usually last 6-8 months with steady use.  Most recent pair was shoddy manufacturing and broke in just over a month.  Moving on to another company that has more consistent quality.
1,Very nice
1,Must buy good headphones great price and quality. Forget any other brand buy these.
1,"I haven't had them long, but...<br /><br />The Good:<br />1. Pairing was spotless—super quick and easy with an iPhone 7.<br />2. Battery life was great; I used them for a long work-out (about 90 minutes) and then didn't shut them off. When I woke up the next morning, they were still paired with my phone, and still worked fine. Obviously, if you walk around all day listening to music, it's going to be an issue, but for the &#34;let's go for a run&#34; and occasional use, it's going to be fine.<br />3. Controls are easy to understand; I haven't read the manual, and managed to figure it out. It has the right amount of &#34;obviousness.&#34;<br />4. There was no issue with the slipping out, and they're comfortable.<br /><br />Also, I need to make a point exceptionally clear—they come with the most awesome charging cable. On one end it's a standard USB, but the other end contains a clever connection that allows it to work with an iPhone Lightning cable or with a standard micro-usb. It's among the best part of the product—it's now my favorite cable.<br /><br />The &#34;meh&#34;<br />1. They're &#34;in the ear-canal&#34; style, which blocks sound and adds to the bass. That's a good thing, although if you're used to ear-buds that just rest in your ears, there's definitely a weirdness to outside sound and you can hear your blood pound when you're running.<br /><br />They're solid, and done well."
1,So far so good!  Great sound! -They Rock!<br /><br />And the company is an absolute pleasure to deal with as well.  Refreshing!
1,Great sound quality for the price. More bass and noise cancelling than I anticipated. Great value buy and I have already recommended them to friends and family.
1,"Won’t sync with either my IPad or Iphone. Wrote to manufacturer and asked for help.  In response they sent the manual. I’m past the return date so I guess I just have to eat the loss. Wish they had been more helpful.<br /><br />UPDATE<br />Although the seller couldn’t solve the problem, he did refer me to the manufacturer.  They explained that after a reset you have to delete the earbuds from your device in settings so that they can be recognized.  I did this and they now work great. I’m a happy customer."
1,"I usually can't wear ear buds, because they always hurt my ears.  I haven't had any problems with these.  The over ear piece was a little softer and more flexible than I expected, which was actually good, cause it didn't bother my ears either.  Pairing these with my iPhone and my Apple Watch was super easy.  The sound is good.  Really, considering the price of these, the sound is pretty great.  So far, I love these!"
0,I buy these all the time ... but this time the left side was defective... 🥺
0,The headphones have stopped working and I am very disappointed in them
1,"These headphones word really well and this is my second time buying them, I lost the first pair.  The reason I give it 3 stars though is because they start saying &#34;low battery&#34; every minute at 30% battery and then they completely die at about 25-30% battery.  This is very deceiving to me, you think you have enough battery for a workout then they quit 10 minutes into your work out and that's very frustrating.  So as long as you keep them fully charged, they work great."
1,"I loved this product, while it worked.  My headphones just stopped working after about 4 months. The button stopped responding and now I have to order something new."
1,Grear product! Thank you!
1,Got these for my boyfriend. He loves them. Says they're the best headphones he has had.
1,"Quality is excellent, I’m so happy with it."
1,I got these to listen to the TV without my wife having to listen. I am really pleased with the sound quality and the battery life. And the price was right!
1,"Love this product. Great value for a high quality product. With case, car charger, cables etc for the price. Great value, great sound and high quality. thank you"
1,"These headphones are the best ones ever. Simple to pair, &amp; they look &amp; feel great on. The sound is better than all the rest that I own &amp; have tried. They are better than somme costing hundreds more &amp; are well worth the price. I have a half dozen sets but by far these are the ones I keep using time after time. You can't go wrong getting a pari for yourself. This is the best way that customers can let other shoppers know how a product works &amp; by far these are the best on the Amazon market. Threat yourself to the best sound around."
1,"Awesome awesome product. I'll buy another pair when these go. Great quality, great sound and they hold a good charge. If I had to give one negative moment about them it would be the sounds breaks up if you're typing and listen to music at the same time. Not a big deal though"
1,I got these for my fiancé and he LOVES them. He said they're just as good as beats but a fraction of the cost. Bluetooth works perfectly. Very happy with this purchase !
0,"The ""wings"" on these that are supposed to keep them in place are pretty much useless. It's made of a flimsy, pliable plastic and never keeps its shape. You'll feel it flopping around on the top of your ear if you move at all. I finally took a pair of scissors and cut them off entirely."
1,"This headset is the best deal for the price. The wrap around and are surprisingly soft, yet still hold them in place."
1,So far they are a good deal.  They fit my big ears thanks to the selection of ear pieces.  Sound is good. Lots of bass and no complaints about sound quality on phone calls.  I go 8 hrs at work on a charge without problems.  They connect quickly when turned on.<br />12/17 update.  They work very well except they don't always connect properly when turned on.  The pause play button works but no audio is sent to the headphones.
1,Love this headset. Easy to use and the sound is great. Sound is consistent and I like being able to move around.
1,"Overall, these are a decent pair of wireless earbuds. The biggest drawback is the bass. The bass is heavily distorted with these.<br /><br />The signal is strong and they connect to my iPhone quickly. It is seldom that I hear a skip in my music. They last for hours and charge quickly."
1,"I've purchased, used, and discarded a number of Bluetooth headphones over the last couple of years and these are the best by a long shot. Syncing was a snap, comfort is great out of the box, and sound is fantastic. I do a lot of long-distance bicycle riding and have grown tired of constantly adjusting and re-adjusting the headphones as I ride. These stay put even during the roughest, sweatiest rides. I wear these in the office to listen to music in a rather noisy (talking, phone calls, and general office noise) and the sound dampening is pretty good. It's not on par with over the ear headphones but they're not supposed to be. If you're looking for highly functional, very comfortable headphones with great sound at a good price you really can't go wrong with these."
1,I'm so impressed I will be buying more as presents.  These are truly a great value for the quality of product. You also get a warranty.<br />Easy to use - Easy to set up.  Comes with great accessories.
1,"These actually sounds amazing, not for how cheap they are or in their price range, but actually truly good. I'm actually very surprised. If you're looking for great sounding affordable Bluetooth headphone you need to get these!"
1,These are easy to pair and work great!
0,Already quit working while I was working out just bought not even a month ago 🙄
1,"Wow!  They came packaged so nice, with everything you could possibly need to use them.  Very soft plastic, easy on the ears.  Quick charging and easy to pair with IPhone.  I've used them a couple of days and so far, they are 5 star worthy!"
1,"The headphones are great for listening to music at my desk and walking.  However, they don't stay in place well while doing my cardio.<br /><br />This is my second set.  The first stopped working after about 2 1/2 months - it would not charge anymore.  After posting my review, the seller, Tekatron contacted me and sent a replacement."
0,They quit working on the 30th day after receiving them by lose of Bluetooth connectivity and the next morning 3/25/2018 when I went to return them I couldn't as the window closed last night on 3/24/18 while I was in bed trying to get them to work!
1,A little too bulky like someone else said. I like all the extra stuff it came with. It was very well packaged. Still a 5 star item
1,"one week -  so far so good, sometimes first few seconds the audio shutters like the sync is not exact but no problem after that.  Very comfortable."
1,These headphones are very comfortable and easy to use.  The sound is super clear and they are very light weight.
1,going to the gym
1,"I bought these for my husband for his birthday and he loves them!!  He wears them when he works out, does lawn work or relaxes on the back deck. Great sound quality and comfort. I was surprised that they also came with a nice case and an extra long car charger (in addition to the regular charger). Great product at a great price and they were delivered on time"
1,Love it :)
1,Nice Headphones. They were easy to set up and sound very good. I'm taking a long trip soon and I will really put them to the test.
1,I used my headphones for the first time this day on a 9 mile run. Sound and battery life are great! Linked up to iPhone 7 very easily.
1,"I'm very happy with these headphones, they are very comfortable and have a good sound for the price."
0,"Purchased primarily for use with Apple Watch 2. Paired flawlessly with my iPhone 6+. Sound and comfort are pretty good for the price... the only problem is that they would NOT PAIR WITH APPLE WATCH 2! I tried everything in the troubleshooting guide. When I contacted them for assistance, they responded with a link to a discussion forum on other earbuds that have difficulty with the Apple Watch and a reminder of their return policy. They are obviously aware of the issue, but choose not alert consumers before purchase."
1,"Pros:<br /><br />Lightweight<br />Easy to use and get started<br />Sound quality is pretty good<br />Noise cancelling is excellent<br />Stick in your ears well<br />Charges fast<br />Holds a charge on standby for a long time<br />Volume and switching between songs are easy to change<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Run time isn't the greatest, but still pretty decent. I've experienced about a 6 hour run time on one charge.<br />The volume range is a little too loud. I typically have it on the lowest volume and that seems loud at times.<br /><br />Definitely would and have recommended to friends and family."
1,I wanted Bluetooth earbuds for my work place these are just what I was looking for!  Fast charging comfortable fit and awesome sound quality.  I had my husband try them and lived them too.  I ordered a set for him also.
1,"I bought 2 (1 for my boyfriend, 1 for me). My boyfriend's worked perfectly... mine not so much (because, obviously... me and my bad luck). I tried them for the first time yesterday - charged it and then connected it with my phone via Bluetooth. I tried using it at the gym (very anxiously might I add) but noticed that the connection was constantly being disrupted... I was literally 1-2 steps away from my phone and the the music was going on and off. I tried putting the Bluetooth on/off, tried &#34;Removing this device&#34; from my list, and even pressed the power button for 7 seconds while connected...nothing worked. I just sent an email to SENSO so hopefully it'll be resolved soon..."
1,"I exercise every other day, religiously, for about an hour and a half. So roughly, that's 3.5 days out of a week, for a total of about 5.25 hrs a week. With roughly 52 weeks in a year, I used these headphones for 273 hrs in a year for the gym alone. After roughly 819 gym hours (three years) and who knows how many hours outside of the gym, I've finally lost connection to the left ear. These earbuds survived extensive phone calls, music & video watching, and sweaty thrashings (that is accompanied by an intense workout). I can't speak for other people's experiences, but these earbuds have served me quite well and I couldn't have been happier. I think I'll buy another pair too!"
1,"This headphones impressed me. I like the sound and how they look. Love the fact that they came with so many accessories, and they were easy to set up. Main thing I like is that they stay in place without hurting my ear. I tried so many kinds and nothing would stay in while I was running etc. except for some really painful others. These I had them on for like 2 hours straight and I didnt feel any discomfort. I would recommend them, probably top choice for the price they cost.<br />There is a little downside it is the mic. I dont know why but the other person almost couldnt hear me and when I tried to record a voice message it was very unclear. Maybe it's because of the position of the mic... or maybe not... anyway they do the job."
1,"It's great...light and fits well.  Was surprised there was no plug-in charger with it, only a lead to charge it from the computer."
1,The sound is awesome! I am guessing  I sort of have to turn the earbuds in my ears because I am very small and the rubber part that is the ear clip is way above my ear. Not a deal breaker just an adjustment
1,I had another bluetooth earbuds that have quit working. I loved having the wireless connection so looked for another pair. I initially had some trouble connecting the sensos and contacted support. They responded quickly and resolved my issue completely. The earbuds are very comfortable and lightweight and they connect to my phone without having to go to settings on my phone
1,"I tried, I really did try to like these.  The first set weren't waterproof and died after a couple weeks.  No big deal.  They didn't connect to my iPhone most of the time, anyway.  Got the replacement set and same issues.  Sometimes it would connect, most of the time not.  If I played with it long enough, it would eventually connect with the iPhone.  Then there is the range issue.  If my phone is in the kitchen and I walk to the bathroom, about 25-feet, I loose the signal.  Continuously listening to a book, these earphones are good for about five-hours before they die.  I dared not take them to the water because the &#34;waterproof&#34; cover for the volume controls came off one day.  Now for the good news...for the price, they aren't too bad, assuming you don't mind playing with them all the time to get them to connect...let me restate that...they almost always connect but it is almost always a one-way connection.  I can control the iPhone but no sound comes out the earpieces without my messing with it for five-minutes turning off and back on again.  You get what you pay for."
0,"After a few months of regular use, the left earbud on the Senso headphones stopped working. When I sought support, the company told me to factory reset them. When that did not work, they stopped communication and did not fulfill their warranty."
1,"These headphones are an absolute great buy. The sound is clear, crisp, and all around great quality with a good balance of treble and bass despite some more active sessions when I'm working out or running and do not seem to be impacted by the moisture in my ears. The build quality is excellent and they seem to withstand everyday use very well. They fit great in my ears and I don't have to worry about them falling off especially when I'm running. They have excellent battery life lasting up to 8 hours with one charge and was even fully charged when they were first delivered. I am also able to see the battery level on my phone when they're connected which is very helpful. They connect almost instantly to my bluetooth devices which is a welcome change from some of my older headphones which would either takes a couple of minutes to establish a connection or experience an intermittent connection loss from time to time. The volume and other controls seem pretty responsive whenever I engage them. They also came with a few great accessories including a carrying case, charging cable for the headphones, charging cable for either a phone or other mobile device, charging adapter for my car, 3 sets of ear inserts to fit a range of ear sizes, and 2 sets cable clips to be able to tighten the cable that goes behind your neck for a tighter fit. Overall I and pleased with this purchase and would definitely recommend getting if you're looking for some great headphones that excel for active workouts as well as just basic everyday use."
1,"Awesome sound quality, very comfortable, comes with all of the chargers and accessories you'd ever need.  I have no constructive criticism for the manufacturer because i have nothing to criticize!"
1,"Love these ear buds. I never write reviews, but this product really impressed me, and thought it was worthy of my time to share my thoughts. So comfortable and easy to use. The quality and sound is exactly what I was looking for. I plan on buying two more pairs as a gift for each of my boys. They go thru the wired buds like candy, always wearing them out so only one side works. I hope these stand up to the test of time."
1,Run/work out with these daily.  Love them!
1,"Well worth the money!!  They do cut in and out if battery is getting low (especially in a windy day), but overall very good!"
1,"I love these headphones! I love how comfortable the ear pieces are. The cord is so light, I barely felt it while I was running at the gym. Finally I feel like I can work out without having to mess with my headphones too much or worry about them popping out. I bought a Bluetooth wireless set before this but it was bulky & bothered me while running. Thank you for making these so I can run with ease!"
1,The best! I’ve have these over a year and beat them up but they continue to perform beautifully.
0,I bought these for running and working out. When you sweat the cord sticks to your neck and pulls the ear buds loose from your ears. I'm a big guy and the over ear part is too big. I can put my finger on top of my ear between the headphone hoop they are so big. If this was smaller I don't think the cord would be a problem. Also I think if the cord went over the ear it would be better. By pulling down it pulls the ear buds loose.
1,It's good so far :))
1,"Great headphones, works wonderfully, awesome sound, very comfortable. and awesome service, would definitely recommend and buy again."
1,Perfect arrived just in time for memorial day weekend by the beach and pool.  The sound quality is perfect and even experienced some water splashing without issue.  Charge lasted all day.
1,Outstanding product.  My son loved it so much I let him keep mine and I bought a new pair. If you buy them you will definitely love them.
0,Broke after one month using:(<br />Can I get a replacement?
1,I use them to walk the dog and love them! They have great sound and hold a charge well.  They paired very easily.  I wish I had bought them earlier.  They are a good price for what you get.  Even the carrying case is a nice extra!
1,Like ease of use and sound quality.
0,Very weak Bluetooth receiver and they don’t stay in very well
1,Nice product
1,Got it for my daughter and she seem to like it a lot
1,"My son uses them frequently at the gym, says they are great."
1,Very good deal !
1,"Work great, awesome sound, and they don't fall off my head. I like the ear straps, I have a big head with big ears, its hard to keep ear buds from falling out or off but these stay in perfectly, even while biking."
1,These will randomly disconnect from my phone. Battery life will show 90% but they will only last about 20 minutes after they get to this point. Battery life is probably only 3 hours.
1,"Good wireless headphones, comes with a lot of extra things and case which is awesome. I enjoy using it during workouts, just wish the noise cancelling was a bit better."
1,"The Headphones are very comfortable, great sound. One issue is distance from the device, more than 50' the sound breaks up. But overall very happy with the product."
0,Only lasted 1 month. Piece of crap.
1,Great sound from these earphones at reasonable price.  Very easy to pair the my I-7 and stay in place while exercising at the gym.
1,"Very happy with these, very comfortable, nice when I want to work in the yard and still listen to my music"
1,"Call quality is not really good. When I am on the call, some times very annoying sound disturbing from the headphone. I wouldn't recommend for frequently users to make calls."
1,"Great sound, the bass is better than my Bose earphones."
1,I am really enjoying using my new Bluetooth headset.  I didn’t have to spend a fortune for good quality. The only issue is that it is not noise cancelling but still good value for the cost.
0,They are so inconvenient. Every time I try to use them they say they are connected but I play the music and it doesn't play. DO NOT BUY THESE THEY ARE A RIP OFF
1,"Arrived on time, comfortable fit, great sound, ingenious charging cable fits Apple and USB Micro, great pricing, happy customer."
1,Love these!
1,"Work well with my Moto G4 plus and with my iPad Pro. Quick connect. Fit well even with my glasses. Feels and looks little odd as they are a little rectangular box hanging on your ear. But sound is good and controls are easy to locate. Battery charge life has been good for my use. I have not tried them in running or exercise. My principal purpose for them was wearing in the evening while I review schoolwork from a website. My over ear headphones with cord would end up tangling up in notebooks or textbooks and be a hassle. These have eliminated that. I cannot speak to the sound cancelling qualities, seems to me that is a function of how well they fit your ear canal."
1,They work good
1,"Great product, fast ship, great price. 5 stars all the way!"
0,"it was perfect, good sound, good everything. I charged it and it didn't take the charge.  i got them exchanged and after a month of use the same issue...  I wouldn't recommend this product.  I want my money back"
1,"The sound quality is perfect, love the fit"
1,Love these headphones.  Sound is great and the price is very reasonable.
1,"For this type of headphone I'm not too picky, but if I have to turn up the music 10-20% just to hear over jogging speed wind noise; sorry no thanks."
1,"I've had these headphones for about a week and a half now, and have used them pretty much every day. My first impressions were great. The packaging and accessories are nice (USB car adapter is quite handy), they look great, paired easily on every device I tried, and they certainly feel solidly made. Sound quality was another issue.<br /><br />The clarity on these are nice, and they are plenty loud, but they just sound muted. Not distorted or muffled; just......off. The bass is ok, the highs are pretty nice, but the mids feel less present than they should be to me. I guess a good way to put it is that the mids lack pop. They're clear enough, but are somewhat lower in tone than you may be used to. I've tried them on my phone, my tablet, Echo Dot, and computer. Each gave the same results.<br /><br />Voice calls seemed ok, but I haven't really used them in noisy or windy environments, so YMMV.<br /><br />They do come with quite a range of rubber pieces to fit your ears, so for most people fit will probably not be an issue, and they are comfortable. I just found that over a 30 minute span on the treadmill I have to reach up and adjust them in my ear a couple of times because they tend to shift on me. Maybe it's the really soft material used for the part that goes over the ear, or maybe it is just my ears, I dunno.<br /><br />Range is ok for my use. I guess I got around 40ft between rooms. I'd suspect you could get a bit farther outdoors. I mostly have the device I am listening to close by, so that works fine for me.<br /><br />I will say this though, customer service seems great. I was confused by one of the cables they sent. I assumed it was the wrong one, so shot a message to customer service. I had a reply within a couple of hours telling me that the cable is multi use, and explaining how to disconnect the iPhone plug from the micro USB to use it for charging the headphones. Kudos on that.<br /><br />All in all, they are ok for the price. It's not something that inspires brand loyalty to the point where I can say definitively that my next pair will be these, but they work well enough (assuming the fit issue doesn't worsen). I don't regret the purchase (I still use them daily), but if I should lose these tomorrow, I may want to try a different set. Not because they're bad. They're just not quite the pair that would be the end of the headphone journey for me."
1,"Doesn't fit comfortably, sound quality not great."
0,"They lasted only 2 weeks worth of workouts and died.  They don't turn on or charge.  Complete garbage.  Spend a little more for something better.  When they did work, they were great.  Don't expect anything amazing on longevity.  Note: I do sweat a lot when working out if that is what killed them."
1,"Great product, excellent service and great price.  I purchased a pair of Beats PowerBeats3 earphones for $130.  Took forever to pair and the volume was not as loud as I thought, especially when used flying.  I just purchased these SENSO bluetooth for $38.  They fit great, sound incredible and paired with ease.  They come with a great case, USB charger for power outlet in car and several additional ear buds.  I liked them so much, I bought 2 pair."
0,"I receive an email from one of the owners, Kenneth B.  Sound is fine with music, but the mic is not operating as it should with making calls.  I try to make a hands free call through mic and once the call begins dialing I hear a fluttering sound (almost like an old phone dialing).  I cannot hear the person talking to me through the phone, and they cannot hear me.  I am going to return this item but am open to hearing back from the owner.  thankyou"
1,Best 20$ headphones on the market hands down.
1,Great headphones. I use them everyday at work. Music sounds great also the Bluetooth for phone calls is really nice. Good price
1,"I used these to listen to music while running outside and around the house. They lasted about a year. First, one side went completely dead, now they wont stay connected for more than 2 minutes and it says its charged, but they wont make it 1 full song before dying."
1,"Excellent earbuds. Long battery life, exceptionally quiet."
1,I have never been able to wear earbuds or have them stay in place. I love these. They are so secure in your ears. The ear pieces that go around your ear is super soft and pliable. Very comfortable. Running and jumping rope no problem. I am very satisfied.
1,"Good fit.  Lacks a little in the bass, but overall good sound"
1,I purchased these for my teenage son and I haven't used them myself.  He seems to be pleased with them.  Hoping they last.
1,Love these headphones. Great sound and easy to setup. So nice not having to deal with a cord attached to my phone anymore. Can't beat the price of these either.
1,"Exceeded my expectations! The sound quality is very good, and the charge lasts for hours. Excellent features: change volume, fast forward, and rewind, and comes with two charger cables, a car charger head, and extra earbuds, all in a nice hard case. I LOVE that it can pair with two Bluetooth devices simultaneously, so I can stream on my iPad and still get calls on my phone."
1,My husband love the ear phones.
1,"I have purchased two pairs of these ear buds.  The first set lasted about 8 months with everyday use.  For the price, I thought they were ok.  But They just stopped working..so I ordered the second set. The second set lasted less than one month.  The same thing happened..  they stopped working.  Also the over the ear wire is really thin and doesn’t work as well as the first set.  Won’t buy again"
1,Great headphones.  I'm beyond pleased.
1,"These weren't EXACTLY what I was looking for, personally. I have a really hard time finding in-ear wireless headphones that don't hurt my ears. I was hoping these just kind of clipped on to my ear and didn't actually need to go in but that was my fault as a buyer. That being said, they are much more comfortable and work better than other more expensive earphones that I've purchased. Easy to connect to devices. The on/off/pause/play button is easy to accidentally press while adjusting them while on. I would have like to see them advertised as ear phones or in-ear headphones, though."
1,Best earphones I've had to date!
1,I ran into a problem with my Senso head set and Invotek provided outstanding customer service to resolve my issue.  I could not be happier with the way they handled things and with the quality of my head set... they made me a lifetime customer.
0,Stopped working about 4 month after buying it.
1,Buy these now!
1,Great sound quality and fit ears pretty well.
0,Has a bit of static. Fully charged battery lasted about 4 hours on almost full volume
0,Great product and really good sound for the first three weeks.  Now drops Bluetooth connection to the point I threw it in the trash.
0,I do not recommend you purchase this item! Not worth your money. It will not hold charge
0,this was not good product not sure why it has good reviews. microphone is vey unstable as well
1,After just six months the power button broke now they are useless
1,Great set of bluetooth headphones. They are sweat resistant. I use them with every workout!
1,I think this is a great product. Mine arrived and it was easy to setup and I connected it to my phone within 3 minutes. Also it comes with 1 year of free warranty. Amazing headphones which are also comfy.
1,"Good sound, good bass, stays in my ear when I work out. Only had a short time but all good so far."
1,These earbuds are great. Whether you have small or large ears they fit great. I would definitely recommend these for anyone that works out at the gym or runs as they will stay on your ears without falling off. They are made out of rubber instead of plastic so they won't break as others have that I have purchased.
1,These ear buds work great. They're very comfortable and light weight. They said it had a 8 hrs of run time on a charge. I tested this and I  got 6 hrs.  It's a good trade off considering it takes a little more than an hr to fully charged. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone interested in great audio at a great price.
0,Right speaker broke after 1 month.<br /><br />Otherwise great.
1,"Great product, very will built.  Pair very easily and sounds great, I am impressed with this product.  GREAT PRICE!"
1,Great product and great customer service!
1,Easy to connect to phone and great sound
1,"These Bluetooth Headphones fit well, and feel great. They sound stage is very large and has deep bass, more that I had expected. The range is pretty good as well as the battery life is spot on, even at near full volume (not recommended to use full volume they get LOUD). I was weary of the wire getting in the way but since the controls are on the the ear buds the wire is never in the way and is super light so it feels non-existent. Also since the controls are on the ear bud, it is easy to locate them- on top of that the controls work really well; I might recommend flipping the volume up and volume down buttons but that is my only recommendation. For me the memory foam ear tips work the best, they seal extremely well, after contacting Invotek they were able to track down some replacements that I could buy for feature use, I highly recommend getting a pack: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01ABWGHHG/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1<br /><br />That brings me to my next topic, their customer service is on point, very quick to respond, very devoted to customer service and experience. I had the delight to work with Kimberly Pollak and I would like to give her a shout out. I have seen other reviews that say this product sometimes fails a few months into use, so don't forget to register the product for the amazing one year warranty that they provide; remember the device is not water proof so don't go swimming with it either."
1,Affordable and comfortable. Sounds great and battery has long life span.
0,"I bought these upon the recommendation of my son, who has had used his for 2 1/2 years with no problems.  They are comfortable and easy to pair. The sound blocking quality is good too. The battery life is decent too.  The sound was really good at first.  Unfortunately, after a couple of months, the sound quality has become subpar.  They cut out and the volume will jump very high and then very low.  The music at times sounds like I am listening underwater.  I tried the factory reset with no luck.  I am disappointed now as I am having to start the search for new sound blocking earbuds that are comfortable and have quality sound."
1,"I LOVE my headphones! They have a snug fit in my ear, I use them when I run and have AMAZING sound quality for the price. I can control the music and calls from the controls on the earpiece. The battery life is good.  I would highly recommend these headphones to any user that wants/need music whilst performing any outdoor activities"
1,"They're a little bulky, but they also sound a lot better than the smaller kinds."
1,I love my SENSO wireless earbuds! Works very well with my iPhone7. Excellent connection up to 30ft or even more... I've used it at Central Park for a run and noise canceling was great. Securely stays on your ear. Bass is good! Long battery life too!
0,Se descompone muy rapido
1,"Purchased during Amazon Prime day. Great price for a quality product. Sounds great, comes with different size ear gels, and stays put while running or any kind of activity"
0,"These headphones constantly were cutting out when I was wearing them. I even tried using them on different phones to see if the connectivity issue was due to my phone or the headphones. The headphones and phone had to be right next to each other for them to work, even if i held my phone in front of me the music would cut out. Returned the product"
1,Not going to give 5 stars till a few more days with them but for the price you can't beat it at all great sound and comfortable and decent bass. Bought these for my motorcycle rides to get away from a wire I'll be testing this today
1,Based on several weeks of use the ear buds have met my expectations.  Appreciate the follow-up email from the company making sure everything was working correctly.
1,"Work well, but hard to keep in ears when jogging. Bluetooth can cut in and out when phone is in my pocket."
0,"These are fine for stationary activity, but don't stay on your ears well while running.  The noise from the wind is also very loud.  I've had other Bluetooth headphones in the past and have never had the issue with wind noise."
1,Great sound the battery charges quick and last a long time and  the mic quality is better than others I have tried. Its so comfortable I can wear it all day and the controls are easy to operate. I will be buying and telling others.
1,Love. Ear buds kind of big but came with back up small ones that are still a tad bit but they wk! Never knew I had small ear holes!
1,Absolutely worth every penny! And MORE!<br />QUALITY QUALITY QUALITY!
1,"FINALLY! I have bought over four different pairs of wireless headphones. These are the only ones that both fit in my ears and stay in my ears during my workouts (because they do not have the mic as a part of the string around the head). GREAT product to use at any time, including while running!"
1,"I have had these several months.  They have a very nice sound, so I will give them 5 stars for that.  I am quite picky with sound quality.  I want to hear details and a full range and they deliver well beyond their price point.  They stay in and are comfortable.  Range is solid.  I do not stray more than 20 feet but over that range there is zero degradation.  They come with really  nice accessories too including a car charger and dual iphone/usb cable that is quite innovative.  So this is a great deal all around.  I thought about downgrading a star because outside, on days with a steady breeze, they get a bit noisy the way the wind whips around them.  Something I have not experienced with other headphones. But it is too sweet a deal overall to do that - so 5 stars it is!"
1,Bought these as a gift for my husband.  He LOVES the fit and the sound!
1,"Great product, especially for the price. Super comfortable, the sound is surprisingly good for budget headphones, and the packaging and accessories were a nice add. Just short of 5 stars because the lightening cable portion of 2-in-one lightening/micro wire does NOT work. I was really excited to see them include this handy wire - but half of it is useless."
1,"It's exactly what I thought I was getting. Sound if fine, they are comfortable on my ears. Two things that restrict me from giving it 5 stars are that one ear bud falls out occasionally (could be the way I wear them) and the tiny blue light is placed so that it looks like I'm on a Bluetooth phone call for a fortune 500 company. For $30? Would recommend."
0,"I purchased these headphones on 2/3/17.  I had them in my winter jacket pocket, and when I went to use them they were broken.  These headphones only lasted 6 weeks and apparently my return window has closed so I'm unable to return these."
1,Great sound
1,"Everythign works great, sound is great, do not care for the cord."
1,"Great headphones for work out, good long lasting battery"
1,"Compared to the one I used to have, this is by far exceeded my expectation.  Quality, presentation, and customer service are some of the criteria I have when purchasing an item.  This one has it all.  Sound quality was phenomenal for a moderate user like myself and I am lot more motivated to go to the gym without getting drown by these boring playlist they have."
1,So far so good I have only been using them for a week. The sound is very good no conductivity issues. I like the larger buttons on the top and they stay in your ears very well. I sweat a lot when I workout and I never had a issue of them falling out. As far as the battery goes I haven't had to charge them yet but I don't know how often I will yet. My old set I had to charge once a week. I would definitely recommend these to anyone that works out 5-7 days a week.
1,"Wonderful product, wonderful company"
1,Great headphones and sweat resistant. Also I thought it was cool that it comes with a year warranty if there are any issues! No issues for me me and it has a great battery life!
1,"I've had this for a few days now and it's exceeded my expectation.  Because I like it so much, I ordered another one :)  Thank you"
1,"Perfect for the gym or running, but the noise calculation isn’t good enough for cycling."
1,"These ear buds are soooo comfortable and snug, I can't believe it! For years, I have been unable to find a headphone that would stay in my ear while working out or laying in bed. They would either fall out or be painful. I had my fiance try them on and next you know, he had me buy a pair for him too lol. The sound quality is great and they are so easy to pair to your devices. Definitely a steal for the price."
0,"Broke in 2 days. Won't sync and won't play music.<br />Quality is not worth the 40 dollars it's on sale for either.<br />Too bad, I was actually needing a sporty bluetooth head phone :/"
1,"Love these things.  They sound good, for my ears well and barely noticeable."
1,Haven't had very long but so far very happy. Buds fit great and block out a lot of ambient noise. Sound is good and clear inside. Comes with case and several ear plug choices.
1,"Got these for my stepdad and he has only been saying thank you ever since.  He loves how it lets him know when it is turning on and off, and let’s him know that it has low battery, and he brags about the range it gets"
1,These headphones are perfect. They are not big and bulky and they stay in my ears which allows me to listen to my music while working out at the gym or working around the house. They also sound great for the price. I'm very satisfied with this product!
1,"So far so good. I've had them for a couple of weeks now. They fit comfortably in my year and don't fall out, even when running. This is usually a problem for me. I love how the function buttons are on the ear piece itself. Some I've had were on the cord. I found that the buttons tended to wear more quickly. Connectivity is great. Works great good bargain for the price"
1,&#34; Item as described. Delivered by estimated delivery date.Item as described. Delivered by estimated delivery date. &#34;
1,"These earbuds have everything; quality sound, battery life, solid Bluetooth connection, but why is the quietest volume level still SO LOUD?! Especially with pop and electronic music. If I'm in a quiet library I have to use other headphones because the volume feels a bit uncomfortable. Good for a loud gym, BAD for an office space or a library."
1,For the money these are great the last one I bought lasted four years it got it wet by mistake.
1,I have sensitive ears to objects inserted in them. There have been some of the easiest headphones for me to wear. They also seem to hold a charge for longer than advertised. The headphones are super easy to set up and use and provide much better sound quality than I expected. My only caveat is be aware if you have multiple bluetooth transmissions going at once (my house can have up to 4 devices transmitting at once)....it will probably pick up the device you are closest to first when pairing.
0,"When I first got these, I was so excited.  I hated the corded ear buds I've had in the past when at the gym.  These wireless buds worked, sounded fine, but the battery drains WAY too quickly!  After every use, even if only for a half hour, I have to recharge it or the next time I go to use them, the battery will be drained.  Recently, I had charged them up to full, popped them in my purse, and went on a train.  About an hour into my ride, I pulled them out to listen to a podcast.  And they had NO battery life.<br /><br />If the battery would hold a charge longer, if I didn't have to charge them every single time I use them, then I would most certainly have given them a higher rating.  I never had issues with sound cutting out or connectivity.  They worked fine for that and the sound, while not high quality, certainly wasn't terrible.  But the battery issue - that's a deal breaker for me."
1,Great value!!
1,Can’t beat the price for entry level Bluetooth headphones.
1,The sound ease of use and the battery life were all an easy sell but the product you get for the price is phenomenal. My last pair were 2 years old and I broke them or they would still be working. Great product very simple and great sound 👍
1,Finally found a wireless with bass
1,"I use these 3-4 days a week while working out. At least 3 of the days I am lifting weights for around 2 hours, as I do powerlifting. The fourth day is some sort of cardio, usually running. For both the gym and running, these are perfect. You can get them quite loud (if you’re like me and turn it way up when you’re about to do a set) or just mild enough to hear it and not destroy your eardrums. Bluetooth them to my iPhone for the first time and I find that the best EQ for them is “Rock,” which balances the bass out a little more. Sometimes (without the proper EQ and/or adjustments) the bass can be a little crackly and sound like a blown speaker in a car if the volume is up too much or the right adjustments haven’t been taken. “Well why would I want to buy these if I have to do a bunch of stuff to use them?” Well, they’re 20 bucks and you’re just going to workout in them. Go drop 200 bucks on some powerBeats and tell me how long they last. These have lasted me two solid years before I finally broke the earpiece while deadlifting, and the manufacturer sent me another pair."
1,liked my  pair so much I bought a pair for my wife as well. easy to use and great sound. great value for the price.
1,"These speakers are amazing. They are great for my Gym workout. They say they are waterproof but I have not tried that so I can not speak to that claim. They do hold a charge for a long time, and when you need to recharge them, they seem to charge quickly. They are comfortable in the ear and come with a lot of great accessories. These are a winner in my book. The price point feels like I should be paying double for these."
1,"These actually stay in my ears!  The sound is very good, with both speaking and music.  It is easy to connect with my Iphone.  The button to turn it on and off is just the right size to touch when they are still in my ears.  I like that it tells me when they are connected and when they disconnect.  The part around the ear is very flexible and does not bother my ear, even when I am wearing my glasses."
1,The mic is not great for phone calls.  The sound is good.  It stays connected.
1,Was a gift to my husband. He loves them . Great sound quality
1,Only had him a couple days but so far they're  working rather well
1,No documentation on the charging requirements anywhere. A little sync issues when first turning them on and occasional interference. Mids sounded muffled but was able to balance the audio levels in music app. Solid for the price. I find them very comfortable.
1,Great product at a wonderful price.....very happy with my purchase.
1,"These fit great over my ears for my workout.  I knew they wouldn't have Beats or Bose sound, but what you get for the price is outstanding.  My wife wants a pair now.<br /><br /> - Update: less than one year, they will no longer charge.  Not sure what the deal is, but I'm pretty frustrated.  Tried another cable and still wouldn't work.  Tried in a different port, no go."
1,"Really nice bluetooth headphones.  Great sound, excellent battery life.  I have not had success with bluetooth headphones until I got these.  A voice tells you when they are connected and disconnected; a really nice feature that was a beef with my prior headphones.  The description on Amazon doesn't say that they come with a really nice small hard shell case that keeps your charging cord, extra buds, and the headphones themselves safe, which fits perfectly in a pocket of a gym bag.  For a name I hadn't heard of before, I am very impressed with the quality and performance of these headphones.  If you are on the fence, buy them!!!"
1,Good quality Bluetooth device with extra ordinary sound quality..Using almost everyday for my walk and listening bhajans and all sort of music..Usable and connect easily is a plus..
1,"Pretty good bass line, goes pretty loud, easy to connect, mute, switch off and on. All around a impressive headset so far especially considering the price of other products with similar quality"
1,"Easy to pair with my iphone 6s, easy to use, sweat proof, good crisp sound, excellent bass, not the least bit noise &#34;cancelling&#34; but they do lock out external sounds pretty well. There's only one catch. They're TOO LOUD for music. I keep my phone on notch 1 or 2 for media and it feels like I'm on notch 8. They work well enough for podcasts and I use them for that specific media but not for music. It's too bad, they're great for the price otherwise."
1,"Love it! Great sound, easy set-up."
1,"Comfortable, clear, easy"
1,A
0,"I really want to love these, but I’m having too many issues. I bought these a few months ago. The sound, for the most part, is very good. My first issue was that they kept falling out. I finally got that resolved by switching to a smaller earpiece in one ear. I’ve never had to mismatch earpieces with any other earbuds before, but whatever works I guess.<br /><br />The bigger issue is that they keep cutting out on my constantly whenever I move around. I was out doing yard work and had my iPhone in my pocket. These things kept cutting out constantly. I couldn’t seem to keep a connection for longer than 30 seconds. This seems to be a rather new issue, as I’ve been able to run on a treadmill with these before (but with my phone in the cup holder) with no problem. I’ve tried putting the phone in my front pocket, using an arm band, and setting on a nearby ledge. Nothing seems to work.<br /><br />A slightly lesser gripe (only because I wasn’t expecting it in the package) is that the included microUSB/Lightning convertible cable is crap. It has a “captured” microUSB to Lightening adapter on a flat cable. It looks great and sounds like a great idea. I have no idea whi these earbuds came with a Lightning cable when they only charge with  microUSB, but great (I thought). The problem is that the cable keeps cutting out. I can’t trust it to charge my phone, so I won’t be using it any more.<br /><br />I may have to see about making a warranty claim. Otherwise, they’re too frustrating to use."
1,"My 5-Star rating is for the quality of service I received from Invotek and not for the quality of the headphones.  I bought these headphones because I read a newspaper or magazine review that these headphones were comparable with $150 Apple headphones.  I can't compare these with Apple, but these headphones are simply OK, not fantastic.  I would rate these headphones as about 4 stars on it's own merits.  It's fine for my use at the gym or out running, but if I wanted quality sound this would not be it.<br /><br />The reason for my 5-Star rating is that these headphones died on me after just over a month....too late to return to Amazon.  I then contacted Invotek's customer service on a Sunday, and by Wednesday, I had already received a brand new replacement set.  These headphones come with a one year warranty.  Backed by this kind of service, I really feel I got my money's worth and and happy with my purchase overall."
1,It’s only been two minutes since I’ve had them and they have way better sound than my Bose soundsports and AirPods. I can’t hear any outside noise which will be good for drowning out the gym’s poor choice of music.<br /><br />$24 gets you more than you bargain for.
1,"I was ruining my bluetooth Bose headphones at the gym.  The ear pads were getting funky from all the sweat.  I knew I had to find something to replace them and I wanted bluetooth earbuds; no more funky, sweaty ear pads.  I took a deep breath and ordered these.  I thought, ""Well, they're not terribly expensive, so what have I got to lose?""  What a great find!  I'm used to the sound quality of the Bose and I gotta tell you, the sound on these little babies is pretty darn good!!  Okay, so what about distance?  Can I put my phone in the cubby and still receive a signal on the other side of the gym?  Yep, Sure can!  What about the battery?  Honestly, I only use them at the gym .. max. time 90 minutes.  When I get home, I pop them on the charger for about 30 minutes or so and I've never had a problem.  What about the cord?  This is where I was concerned.  I have waist length hair and was afraid the cord would get tangled up in my hair.  Nope, not a problem.  I'm pleasantly surprised and happy with my purchase."
1,"I've had mine for a while now and they have proven to be well worth the price. In fact, for what I paid for these, I consider them to be a superb value. They're convenient to use, sound great, come with a very nice storage case, and so far have proven durable. For as many headphones as I've gone through, I'm happy that the Senso earphones I have are still going strong."
1,These are great not the greatest sound but work good.  Comfortable and good battery life.
0,They stopped charging 2 weeks after I bought them.
0,"Imagine, if you will, a 1983 U-Haul. Turn the stereo on. Close your eyes. What do you hear?<br /><br />These Senso headphones. They are shockingly terrible. Unless you have a vendetta against your own eardrums, don't buy these."
0,"Didn't get a chance to try it because I am returning it.  The one star is for the disappointment on my son's face when he excitedly opened the box and found the seals of the headphone box was detached and the product looks used because earbuds look dirty.  He refused to even touch it.  I am expecting a brand new headphone in a brand new sealed box, not one that has been returned by another customer ."
0,Had to return after a week. Stopped connecting to device.
1,Seems to work fine. Ear loops are flimsy but comfortable. Directions indicate  charging should not be left on over night an inconvenient restriction. Directions:&#34;It is not recommended to charge headphones overnight&#34;
1,"I ordered this for my 16 year old son and he loves it, theres no more long cords hanging or constantly have to put up with ear piece to put it back in the ear. I'm looking forward to get one for myself. Thanks SENSO"
1,"Easy to use right out of the package. Bluetooth feature is very handy. The only negative is that the earpiece is not adjustable for smaller ears like mine. They still work fine, but don’t hold tightly. A good deal for the price."
1,"Overall a decent pair of buds.  Sound quality is good, though the buds do a mediocre job of keeping the connection - without dropouts & skips - when using with my Pixel.  Also, battery life seems to be about 3 hours, as opposed to 8.  Always seems run out of juice at the worst times - which is half me & half the battery :)"
0,I purchased these to work.  This wire gets stuck in the neck area all the time.  Does not work good at all when some one calls you.  Batteries dies early.
0,"The charger was broken after few weeks, sound started become lower and lower, now I am suffering and I can barely use it because of its sound quality, it's buds are easily taken of whenever you put it in your pocket or even if you keep it around your neck so I had to look for it three or four times a day. The customer service is horrible, when I complained about sound quality they sent me a message on how to reset the headphone, I tried resetting it and nothing changed, they stopped to response to me hoping after few days I will be passing one year of purchase date."
1,"Senso bluetooth headphones.  This plays music well, however as a phone it lacks a decent microphone so people can hardly hear my voice."
1,Great buds!
1,Good product. I have been jogging with them and they've been great so far.
1,"I love these headphones. I've had them for about a year now. For the price, they are phenomenal. I haven't tested the waterproof side of them past running with them when it's drizzling. I think that the 8-hr battery life is a stretch; I haven't had them last that long. However, I did notice that the distance from whatever your using as the device (i.e. phone) significantly affects the battery life. If I leave my phone in one place while at the gym and am moving around with varying distances, the battery drains much quicker. Whereas, if I have my phone in my back pocket the whole time, the battery lasts a lot longer. The longest I've gone in one sitting was 4 hrs. They charge up very quick. The sound is great when listening to music. I've never had any issues with them dropping calls or being able to pick up my voice. They came with several different charging cords so you can charge at home or in your vehicle. It also came with several different earbuds so you can fit them in whatever size ears you have. Overall, excellent product and definitely recommend this product."
0,"This works fine for listening to audio, but phone calls are unbearable. Apparently everyone I try to speak to gets terrible &#34;feedback&#34; and weird audio anomalies. It sucks because I like these, but I have to return them and try another brand. I need to be able to make phone calls."
1,Bought them as a gift for my Dad to wear in his shop.  He loves them!  I am going to buy a pair for myself now also.
1,Wife has used these twice so far and loves them.
1,"I do not like how these new version have adjustable ear loops, I wear them all day at work and when someone speaks and I pull it out the ear loop stretches out and I have to fix it constantly"
0,Lasted about 1 month before they quit working.
1,Bought these for husband...he uses them daily and loves them!
1,I bought these for working out. It comes with a great zippered carry case as well all the adapters you will need for charging. The buttons are basic and simple. It paired quickly and well with my android phone. There is an audible cue to let you know the device is on. Sound quality has been excellent without any issues so far. I have yet to drain the battery. It advertises 8 hours of continuous use and the longest I have used it continuously is about 5 so far.<br />It comes with ear buds to resize for comfort.<br /><br />So far the only downside I have found (which I believe is just a part of getting used to this earphone set) is having it get pulled out/off my hear while exercising. The loop around for your ear is soft and flexible.
1,Great product! It comes with everything you need and more. The earbuds sync very quickly to your phone and the sound fantastic. Couldn't ask for a better product for the price. I also purchased the 4 year warranty which was only $8.
1,"Bass and the rest of the sound don't seem to go up proportionally when adjusted from the signal source...gets a bit boomy.<br /><br />However, this can be a feature when turning up the phone independently of the earbuds to adjust the ratio."
0,The cord is way too long and gets caught on everything. The purpose of wireless headphones is to eliminate the cord so I'm not sure what they were thinking when they designed these.
1,Love it!!! I usually have a hard time finding a comfortable headset that stays in....This is it....
1,"Awesome. Very surprised. Very clear detailed sound, comfy. Can walk all around the house with these. Highly highly recommend."
1,"Using these for running, walking and general use. The over-the-ear loop helps hold them in place and the in-ear is comfortable. The volume gets very loud so I don't turn them all the way up often. Battery life is 8 hours +/- or about a week most of the time. I would buy these again."
1,"High Fidelity for Low Cost<br />I didn't think that would really be possible, but these really are worth the money...  I was coming off of losing my Shure's and those were only ordered after 10 years of loving my Etymotic in-ear monitors that finally broke...  So spending the money on these wasn't the issue, but I read several reviews from users as well as industry reviews all of which said to give these a try.  For the money, it was worth a try - and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />I tried the original silicone buds at first, which were nice.  BUT when I changed to the foam which is much like my Etymotics use to be, it was even better...  great sound isolation (not noise cancelling) and solid performance.  I can't imagine the other &#34;big boys&#34; being worth the extra money over the sound quality I'm experiencing out of these.  I ordered 2 more sets for my girls...<br /><br />I would recommend!"
1,I bought these headphones for gym workouts. In gym environment sound quality is great.
0,Broke after a few months after purchase. Eventually just stopped pairing with devices and would cut out. Tried factory reset numerous times and it worked briefly and then would continue with the same problem.
0,On/off button jammed after 3 months use. Was working fine. Now useless. Very disappointing
1,"Love them. For the price, I don't have to worry about what happens to them. I beat them up pretty good, and the keep turning on. Good sound for the price. Are the beats sound, no, but at the gym I don't need HD audio."
1,Got these Bluetooth earbuds for my wife. She loves them. She says that they are comfortable and the sound is great. She loves how she can watch fb videos and then answer her phone easily.
1,"Sound quality is acceptable, plastic is cheap but works good. The headphones suddenly jump to full volume whenever I type for some reason. Battery lasts a long time. Overall, it’s definitely worth the price"
1,they worked right out of the box!
1,A little to high picht
1,"They sound alright, no complaints.  My biggest issue is the functionality. The power button is in a location where every time you push the right piece into your ear, you turn the set off.  Then I grab the edges and push the volume buttons. So basically, my right ear piece keeps falling out."
0,"Loved the pair I bought a few years ago, ordered another set and they are TERRIBLE now!!! Expecting the same quality, nothing like the last pair. Bad sound, cheap construction. Very disappointing. They even changed the little digital ""voice"" to an absolutely annoying, weird one. They're really quiet, can barely hear anything. No bass, just bad all around."
1,Great price comfortable to wear sound is very good  I use them with My Ipod when I walk my 10 to 12 miles each day  Only have had them for a few days but so far I'm very happy with them
1,"I liked this headphones) good battery life, great sound, and very nice carry bag included with many ear cushions. Thanks, great job👏👏👏👏"
1,No retaining device for cord.
1,"I shower with these on, and they're perfectly fine still. Need I say more? Okay then, these are the best earphones you'll ever buy. Sounds like a scam? Too good to be true? Well ignore everything you've learned in life til now, just for this moment and select these earphones. Then proceed to the checkout."
1,"I have had a few BT headsets for working outside and workouts. These are AWESOME!! Granted, I have only had them a few days. If anything bad happens, I will update this review. in the mean time:<br />Pros:<br />Wicked light, with or without the ear hooks<br />Good range for their design (20-30ft) at max. useful BT range. This is a good standard being and most of use have the transmitter (phone, ipod) with a few feet anyway. Think pocket, counter, machine tray, tool bench. Longer ranges require more power at both ends; thing CB Base stations for your phone and headset...ouch!<br />The Extras: case, dual micro usb/lighting to usb charge cable, extra tips, car charger and 10-in charge cable. The wire tie is golden; hold the wire slack out of the way and even semi-secures the wire behind your head or under the chin.<br />IPX7 Waterproof (not for swimming, but if you fall in these will be ok) great for sweat, rain and those who need/want them for showers.<br />Cons: None yet, will update if any arise.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Love Mine!!"
1,"I have had a few pair of these but this is the first pair that have done this. No I didn't leave them out in the sun, I really have no clue why this happened. It was a progressive thing that started with the left one and then the right...they still work but...I look disease wearing them..."
1,"Work from home, on calls all day. This allows me to hear clearly. I can speak in a normal, conversation tone & they hear me clearly."
1,Great product. Good price!
1,These headphones work and sound great.  Can't get anything better for the price.
1,Didn’t hurt ears at all. Snug fit and sweat proof
0,This is my second pair of these headphones and the Bluetooth sound quality is terrible. The first pair that I've had for about a year before I broke the wire was great but this pair is just not good
1,"As was mentioned before, the sound is great! I can hear slight nuances if songs while doing activities. The earbuds fit on you r ear even when sweating. Great quality for a great price. I would highly recommend to anyone not looking to spend a small fortune for workout earbuds."
1,"Great device! 4 stars due to the wrap around ear piece really isn't that stiff, so the ear piece is liable to move under heavy activity. If you make that piece a bit stiffer or give it the ability to be 'tuned' to the wearers ear, definite 5 star+ range. Let me know if you need a tester!"
0,"very cheap,flimsy piece of plastic, but it does the job. the voice is ok."
1,"Comfortable and great sound! Great product, especially for the price!"
1,Great sound and long battery life.
1,My wife's review:  The sound is great - you can hear detail at very low volume without noise from the outside world.  It charges fast and seems to retain a charge nicely.  The ear pieces are taking some time to get used to.  I went from an Apple-style ear bud to this one and there's a definite adjustment curve ...for me anyway.
1,"This is one set of headphones you want if you're on a budget. The sound is ok. Not great but not bad either. If you're used to full sized headphones these will be a bit disappointing. I paired it with my iPhone and pairing is simple enough.<br />There is, however, that subtle background hiss with these headphones that's hard to ignore once you know it's there. I don't see this a problem if you're out and about in the gym or in public. These are definitely not designed for critical listening. The bass is a bit boosted and the midrange is not as smooth as I want them to be.<br /><br />When tested with a range of tracks, featuring a few popular hip-hop albums, some jazz, rock, and even the occasional metal track, the high-definition nature of the sound of the ActiveBuds S-250, including their deep bass and crisp treble, became apparent from the first few seconds.<br /><br />Again the midrange is muddy sometimes.<br /><br />However, this is certainly one set of headphones you should consider if you know its limitations.<br /><br />The build quality is good. It comes with all the cables you need and it even comes with it own hard carrying case which is rare at this price point. It charges exactly how the manual says it would which is about 2 hours.<br /><br />I've never been a fan of in-ear headphones but these are very comfortable. It comes with three silicone ear plugs.<br /><br />The pricing, however, is a bit strange with the other two color combinations costing a few dollars more. But they're all still below $40.<br /><br />I only gave it 4 stars because of the background hiss.<br /><br />Recommendation: Why are you still reading this? Go get a pair 😊"
1,Great product for the price. I was hesitant at first but I'm glad I went ahead with the purchase. Worth every penny. Sound is loud and clear and installation was super easy.
0,"They lasted a month!  Won’t charge or turn on, waste of money!"
1,Home use for listening to music from my cell phone.  Great product!
0,"There's a buzzing noise in the background when you have the earphones on, but not listening to anything. Even when you start playing music, this buzzing noise never goes away. Really really annoying. I'm not sure if it's just because I have a faulty product, or if everyone has this issue, but I wouldn't recommend these buds."
0,"I got these on a bit of a whim since I needed BT earphones. It’s hard to ignore 25,000 reviews, the majority of them positive. However I have been very disappointed in the fit and sound quality of these earphones.  Admittedly my ears are weird and I have trouble finding ear tips that are big enough. But I couldn’t get these to stay in at all using the largest tips I could find.  These earphones also sound very flat. No bass and very little trebble. I recently got a pair of earphones from Anker and they are much better on both counts.  I now regret purchasing these. Don’t make the same mistake!"
1,good product
1,"My wife loves these!  She had multiple ear surgeries when she was younger and it affected the way most ear buds fit in her ears.  Most are typically uncomfortable and fall out frequently.  But these fit her perfectly, both comfortable and stay put.  It is great to see her wearing them around the house and singing as she goes."
1,"Great product for the price. Wear them for biking and running. Sound was better than other running headphones I had tried at $100+. The battery died after 7 months, however their customer service was awesome and shipped a replacement pair promptly."
1,"Great sound and noise cancellation! The ear pieces fit well and the over ear piece is light-weight, flexible, and comfortable."
1,work great and are very comfortable!  Connection is instantaneous!
1,"Using the headphones for meetings, video calls and conference calls.They work pretty well with the sound quality and levels of audio"
1,"I’m using it to pair with my Apple Watch while running. Only the foam ear pieces will stay in my ear. I wish there was more than one pair of the foam ones.<br /><br />Also, the sound is often static??? I don’t understand why and this is disappointing."
1,I love them!  Exactly what I was looking for
1,"Great sound quality, really are noise cancelling. They don’t fall out when you run or cleaning around the house!"
0,"First 2 months amazing, after that time, they disconnect from my phone, in almost every song or video I am playing, the ONLY issue they have, but personally the worst of all..."
1,I've used these many times over several years and they are still working great. I don't like the true wireless earbuds so these are a great alternative
1,great product
1,Great product.
1,"I would actually give these 4.5 stars.  They fit well, sound is excellent, paired easily to my iPhone! I'm trying to change the earbuds, and am looking forward to trying the small size once I figure out how to get the medium size off."
1,This headphones has an unbeatable price and sounds great.
1,Better sound quality then I was expecting and no trouble hooking up with a bluetooth range extender.
1,Don't work all the time.
1,"I like the large power button - very easy to access. My previous earbuds had 3 tiny buttons along one edge; it was difficult to select the correct button. The Senso flexible ear hooks are “too” flexible - they don’t hold their shape and sometimes fall off my ear."""
1,"My husband is loving his new wireless earphones.  He uses when daily for work.  He is a flooring installer and they work great for his needs.  They stay in place and the sound is amazing.  He has difficult hearing and the sound quality for him is superb. .  He loves that they cancel background noises and he can answer incoming calls easily while listening to his music. Waterproof feature is also good for when it is raining outside.  He only wishes the battery life was a bit longer.  Last for 8 hours for him.  Overall, a great product.  Thank you."
1,I use these at teh gym and absolutely love the sound from them. I believe mine are 2 years old now and I still love them.
1,Wasn’t sure about the whole Bluetooth headphones thing... These headphones are awesome. I say this as I bought them for the sole intention of them being loud enough when running against traffic. 9 times out of 10 headphones fall short of good sound and volume when running outside and these bad boys hot both goals at 75%! I’d absolutely recommend them for a reasonably priced fix for exercising outside... enjoy!
1,"The headphones are awesome......really great headphone. I listen to a lot of rap music, baseline with this headphone is strong."
0,I’ve had these for a few months and they’re no longer working properly. The sound cuts out constantly and it drives me crazy. I’m going to have to find something that actually works.
1,I gave this 4 starts recently not sure why it is asking again but I do really like this product and love the case and accessories that come with it.
1,"Great headphones! Ran with them to the gym and was able to do everything at the gym without the hassle of a cord. I was able to be a full basketball court away from my phone and still listen to music. They are almost fully noise cancelling as well. My only complaint is a slight wind noise that starts when running. Otherwise, I was very satisfied with these headphones as my first purchase of Bluetooth headphones."
1,"Good packaging. Quality speakers, controls except for chasing track from some reason don't work with my Samsung phone. But over all the device is too if the line in style, design and quality.😊"
1,"This is a great package. In-ear buds don't stay in my ears, so the over-ear loop is invaluable. The sound is great, the case for the headphones is great, it comes with a 2-USB port car power charger and USB cable. Excellent deal !"
1,Delivery came in early and the sound is GREAT. I use them at the gym for my workouts
1,"It's an awesome pair of headphones: fits very well and stay in place. It's also water/sweat resistant. On top of everything, it comes with one year of warranty and awesome customer support!"
1,"These were good for about a week.  Then, they started rubbing the inside of my ear to a painful point.  I suggest getting ones without ear molding to avoid this.  Sound and range is good though."
1,Do far an amazing product. Fit so comfortably and the sound quality is great.
1,They are great!
1,"Great functionality, but the buds and cord are a bit bulky hence the 4 stars. Overall a good buy for the price"
1,"Good value, use them daily"
0,No good bad quality the top loops hurt my ears
1,Great product for the price. Would recommend. I bought theses headphones after reading reviews. Was not disappointed.
0,Right speaker fell off after 6 months and the warranty department is completely useless
1,Great product delivered quickly.
0,"Purchased item back in May 2018, had to replace them in August 2018 as they no longer worked, about a month and a half ago, they no longer worked again.  Tried to get a replacement as the replacement headphones was shipped in mid August and would have thought the warrenty would be good but Tekatron said no.  I would not buy this product again as I purchased two sets and both are no longer working."
0,I’ve had this product for less than 6 months and they are not working properly. They do not link wirelessly anymore. I would appreciate a replacement.
1,"Nice sound quality, solid fit, easy to use. Only negative is that they will cut out occasionally, but usually is a very short interruption of a second or less."
0,"When they work, the sound is fine, but when you're moving at all the connection to the Bluetooth gets messed up, even with the phone right in my pocket. I have a different brand that works perfectly all the time, so these were a disappointment. Maybe I got a lemon."
0,"I am disappointed in my purchase. I bought these less than a year ago and have only recently started using them and they have suddenly stopped working. Simply no sound or connection to bluetooth. I am not able to submit a return for no reason, nobody will allow me to message them and I would love to just speak to a representative and possibly try again. Disappointing that there is no customer service option for me to speak to or voice my concerns, hense my review here. Thank you."
1,"Very comfy even after hours of uses in the gym.One Dislike actually. Depending on ear size, product could feel very loosely fit at times. But overall wonderful."
1,"Very comfortable, great sound!"
1,Great headphones and I am very happy with the purchase.  The battery is amazing.
1,"These are pretty fantastic. I just use them with my iPhone 7 because I can't deal with the silly port. Love them. I don't work out so don't know how they would be but I imagine they would be good. They stay in the ears snugly, are light and have excellent sound. Love that a car charger and an extra lightnjng port is included--plus a good case. Some feedback for future improvements...The charging items are cool but not intuitive making me read a manual and diagram which I haven't had to do in a while with the influence of Apple on consumer products. Same with the labeling of buttons. Not intuitive."
1,Really like the idea. But I have small ears and these did not fit.
1,"So far so good, no complaints great sound stays in my ears very well even making calls is pretty clear. Only 4 stars cause it has been less than a week since I have had them"
1,These headphones are a great value. Invited takes pride in their customer service. I did remove the ear hooks as I couldn't find a size that worked for me.
1,"I’ve found these to be the best headphones for the price. Not only do they stay in your ear well, but the sound quality Is insanely good. I’ve owned beats that’s didn’t have nearly as much bass or had the clarity these do. And most headphones I’ve brought that were “workout proof” were so quiet and uncomfortable. But these won’t dissapoint. The only reason I’ve had to buy 4 pairs for these were because I broke them. Other than that, absolute best headphones I’ve bought."
1,Great product for the price.  Bluetooth is interrupted occasionally when there is no line of sight.
0,It is hard to get these to fit right.  They won't work well with sunglasses or bike helmet.
1,love them
1,I have had many types of earbuds over the years and these ones sound the best.  They are easy to set up and actually stay in your ears.
1,Great!  Headphones are great and are just as described.  Thank you!
1,Everything the manufacturer advertised proved itself to be good quality. The bass was without a doubt the best I have ever experienced on portable head phones. Amazon rated this manufacturer one of the best products with over 30% fewer returns over other comparable brands in it's class.
1,Product is more then worth the price sound is excellent for the price
1,"Great headphones for on the go!! I use them for work and to workout, they sound amazing and connect so easily!"
1,"Ear hook doesn’t provide much support; nonetheless, when both earphones are tightly in place then the sound quality is great."
0,"I have only had these for a little over two months, and they no longer work. They won't charge, and have essentially turned into a useless piece of plastic. The fit was medicore, and the sound was okay, but now no matter what I do they don't work."
1,"Great warm sound. Very comfortable can't go wrong with the price, the quality and service. Would buy again without hesitation."
1,"Wow! I’m a “HeadPhone Junkie” for the money, these BLOW away the PowerBeats in my opinion.Sorry Dr Dre..but really you should take note. Nice job on the design and feel and sound.HAPPY HAS A CLAM:&gt;)"
1,Excellent quality and the battery seems to last quite a while too.
1,These are a great set of headphones at a great price.
1,"Excellent product, definitely will recommend to others..."
1,"Good and nice, sound  good  and clear"
0,"Very bad experience as I just bought this headset less then 2 months ago, every single person is complaining about the sound and the noise cancellation thing is BS.<br />And in addition to that the headset is too bulky and ugly."
1,"These headphones are very comfortable, stay in place well, have good sound, and are easy to use. I first got these as a gift and quickly discovered the microphone didn't work. Since these were replacing my corded headset earbuds, I needed a working microphone. I contacted customer service and after a little troubleshooting, it was determined I had a faulty microphone. With no further questions, they sent me a replacement set and they have worked great. These headphone also isolate very well. So keep your head up while running/walking."
1,product works great.
1,They work great! They connected with my phone and Apple Watch easily and have great audio quality. They stay on your ears and fit nicely with one of the three ear piece sizes included in the box.
1,"lots of wind noise. battery only lasts eight hours. sound quality is not as great as I wanted it to be ... but ...<br /><br />with all the extras, this company deserves recognition. opening this items box _really_ rivals opening an Apple box."
1,"These are very comfortable and i love the carrying case. The multiple cushion sizes are great too because i actually needed to use 2 different sizes and they fit great. I gave it 4 stars only because, while the sound is amazing for the price, I would have liked it to sound richer but overall great purchase!"
1,Easy to use and setup was a snap.
1,"Amazing quality and fantastic fit! What’s not to love? They do what they’re supposed to do, and then some!"
1,"Updated 5/29, with maybe 60 workouts, battery life shorted out, power button unresponsive/died within days. Called manufacturer after trying other charges, asked for new replacement updated model..sound quality a little better with more field and mids but bass is muffled with suggested red earpieces..dont know but the quality seems more refined and balanced mainly. 3 stars.<br /><br />I am quite convinced these standup to sweat and use, charge fairly quick because I dont use them for 5 hours at a time when I recharge (HOWEVER, this was still a crucial factor for buying that they COULD, when desired, when comparing options). The fact that these respond so well in charging, against sweat, use, bluetooth reception (depends on atmospheric interference too) and sound and fit in my ear so well I leave the review at a 4. Would come back in months to give a 5 if they can hold up, or if these guys honor warranties if something seems to go downhill.<br /><br />The sound alone is nice, my highs and lows are good, midrange is good (also depends on phone/streaming service). GOOD!<br />This was a quality buy with other potential product options on the market. Now knowing what I know, those would ALL be a risk in comparison.<br />May senso prosper at this price point/warranty honoring if needed."
0,I have only had it one week and it will not stay charged. Going to return it!
0,Has the earphones about a month when the left speaker went out.
1,"SUPER COMFORTABLE, GREAT SOUND, GREAT PRICE, EASY COMPATIBILITY, WHAT ELSE DO YOU WANT."
1,Awesome headphones!
1,"So far so good.  I recently purchased them and have used the Bluetooth ear buds only in the gym to date and have experienced no issues whatsoever.  They are comfortable and seem to stay in place with no problems.  The silicone ear pieces are nice and provide no irritation at all.  These are not noise deafening as advertised, however I really did not expect them to be (like a good pair of headphones would be)  The sound is very good and I especially enjoy the quick pairing with my I Phone where I keep my music.  I recently had a very bad experience with another pair of blue tooth ear buds that I purchased at a running expo at the Chicago Marathon in October of 2014. Prior to purchasing the Senso pair, these particular headphones went bad 4 times (would not charge)  Although the company sent me a new set 4 times, I have no faith that these will work over an extended period of time, so I am glad I looked at another product.  I hope to get back into running this spring after two knee operations in the past two years and it appears that this product will work out just fine.  Happy to date, thank you Senso!"
1,"There has to be a catch. Too good for 20 bucks. Whats in the box feels makes you feel like its xmas. Incredible sound, easy to use. Another winner from Amazon.<br />Having issues with them staying put in my ear. Unable to insert them I'm my ear canal. Otherwise no issues with quality whatsoever."
1,They work great! I am very glad I made this purchase. I use these headphones everyday!
1,"Very good sound ,fit very well ,a good price for the quality"
0,"I don't really like them they are not loud at all,i was expecting more. I had a 2 pair and after a couple of week they got real low and the buttons don't work anymore"
1,"My previous set up for running involved a wired Sennheiser sports headphone set that went behind my head with a cord that was just long enough to reach to my phone on my left bicep. With the new bluetooth headphones that have come out, I wanted to see if I could find a solution that would work with running.<br /><br />These had great reviews and were cheap, so I gave them a try. When I first tried them on at my kitchen table, I thought they were a bit bulky and heavy. However, when I went out with them on my first run, they were very comfortable and I quickly stopped noticing them on my ears. The only thing that I really noticed was the cord lying on the back of my neck.<br /><br />The controls are easy to use and reach, and the sound is good. Also hard to argue with the price!"
1,"Literally the best deal on Amazon. These headphones are fantastic, snug, waterproof. I've already convinced multiple of my friends to buy more."
0,"original-<br /><br />Decent headphones, but I experience static a lot with them.<br /><br />*Update*<br /><br />They barely work anymore after a few months. Save your money and don't buy these."
1,"Great sound quality, feel great, easy operation, excellent value"
1,"I've had half a dozen different Bluetooth headphones. Had these for about 10 minutes, already my favorite pair yet. Normally have my volume maxed on both my phone and the headset, but not with these. They're plently loud, pretty decent bass, comfortable on my ears, and I can just barely hear myself talking to my dog. Definitely worth trying these in my mind, I look for which products have the most/best reviews, these took the cake. All 5/5 stars from me, hope I don't need another pair for a while, but I'll be looking for these!"
1,"This item is excellent, the delivery times are very correct, the quality guaranteed, highly recommended"
1,Used this mess for awhile loved the company as well had to warranty them out once.
1,"Comfortable fit, very good sound (but not as good as more expensive high-end earbuds).  Excellent customer service - multifunction button jammed, and company promptly replaced it.  Second set going strong after another year."
1,Fits great and the sound is remarkable
1,"They're good for what I paid. Considering that other wireless headphones were upwards of $100, these do the Josh just fine. They're comfortable, easy to use, they connected to my phone perfectly on the first try. The packaging and accessories are high quality as is the feel and construction of the ear buds.<br /><br />The only thing I would say negative is the sound quality. Its very high on the treble and for some reason my phone notifications were super loud and scared me half to death when I got an email.<br /><br />All in all it was exactly what I expected and with a one year warranty and 24/7 phone support, I'd say I'm happy with the buy."
1,price is good
0,"Headphones worked for approximately 2 months even though they constantly had issues pairing and losing connection outside of being a foot away from the device. Afterwards however, the power button got jammed, making this headphones USELESS."
1,They are awesome
1,"These are surprisingly nice, considering the very low price!  I'm very pleased with this purchase.  The primary use for these is in the gym and I find the fit to be quite good; they aren't constantly falling out.  The on-ear control is nice and the bluetooth connection is painless every time, unlike a more expensive headset that I own for business.  Battery life is as advertized.  I haven't used the microphone, so can't speak to that feature, but as headphones for the gym, they are great."
0,Good for listening to music<br />Bad for calls<br />No magnet to hold the ear buds together
1,Sound great  the buttons for the volume are small  but just need to get used to
1,They were amazing! I used them as my primary headphones. It really shows you don't need to spend $100 for quality.
1,Cool
1,Just as described. Great sound quality.
1,"The quality of these headphones are beyond compare to any other wireless Bluetooth headphones I have ever owned! Sound is amazing! I listen to the Audible app and the sound is crisp and clear and not too BASSy. I will recommend these headphones to everyone, they stay in your ear and are very lightweight. The noise cancellation feature does exactly what it says it does!! BUY THESE WIRELESS BLUETOOTH HEADPHONES, YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED! Thank You!"
1,"Love the headphones, but a second pair for my family member. Highly recommended."
1,"Great sound quality, just disappointed by the range."
1,These Bluetooth headphones are great I use them every single night when I'm trying to listen to music and not disturb my family. They are very high quality for the price and I totally recommend
1,"Lost first two pairs, but happy with them, so replaced them with same. Unfortunately, both new pairs have bent wiring that never relaxes and is permanently kinked in a weird placement that pulls one side of the earphones away from the other ear. Also, neither pairs are as comfortable in the ear this go-round. It's not about the size of the bud, but more its shape, it seems, compared to the original pairs."
1,"sweat proof and water proof, these are my new favorite workout tool!!!"
1,Works well with the Bluetooth and sound quality is great.
1,These work and sound good - but there is no functionality to activate Siri or SVoice from the headset.  There is no way to activate voice control from the headset.
1,"absolutely amazing bluetooth, a bit of medium price for earbuds but good quality things cost alot. packaging was absolutely great(you get a case, 3 chargers 1 car 1 usb 1 dual usb(apple android). looks sleek and simple. the sound is pretty good, i own a pair of audiotechnica m50x which are around 100$ but really hot to use. and this pair of senso earphones is great for daily use. pairing was really easy for iphone 7+. it comes with 1 year warranty so that's bonus"
1,"used for 3 months now. sound quality good. operation is simple and reliable. conforms to any ear. MOST comfy, untiring, no sweating, no headaches. being 67 I have used a lot of headsets and these are the best. you can get louder, better range whatever but you will not get a more comfortable set for any price."
1,""" I love everything about this product! They say presentation is everything. The packaging and everything that went with it was top quality and sound produced was tremendous! So satisfied! Gave to my absolute non-techie husband and if he was impressed, you guys gotta be good. Gonna order another for myself."""
1,I like the over the ear style and there are a few different ear pieces one of which was perfect.<br />Working in the yard or cleaning inside they work fine.I gave the first set to my son and bought a second set!
1,Great product so far!  Easy to follow instructions and great sound.
1,"Fantastic quality, but sometimes they just randomly cut out or lose signal. Also, when there is low battery, the automated voice consistently says &#34;battery low&#34; every 30 seconds or so, ruining any additional music you're listening to."
1,There fabulous-light weight-great sound with real clarity. I have been able to pair them with my MacBook Pro and my IPad2 however am having a little difficulty with pairing my IPhone. Great price-neat travel container. Good Job!
1,I am very happy with these both as headphones and as a wireless phone. Pairing them has been easy and I've managed to get them synced to my phone and tablet which is great. Connection quality has been generally very good and when I asked people I'm talking on the phone with they never have trouble hearing me.<br /><br />Unfortunately my first pair did break after 8 or so months of consistent use but I was impressed by their customer service response when I asked them about the warranty. They did have me try a quick factory reset just in case that could fix it up but after that failed to work they are sending out a replacement set.<br /><br />I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend them to anyone.
1,"Don't waste your time buying beats, these are way better and cheaper. The bass on them is amazing."
1,Sound is amazing and earbuds are comfortable. Very easy to set up.
1,"bought this for my son, it sounds great, is stylish and functional,"
1,Great headphones for the price
1,"Excellent headphones, would highly recommend to anybody looking for wireless headphones to wear while working out."
1,"&#34;I use them every night to listen to music or watch TV, so I won't be disturbing my husbands sleep. Easy to use, easy to pair, and the sound is very clear!&#34;"
1,Excellent. Had to buy a second pair since my 20 yr old son took mine.
1,I am using these for outside running and other activities such as lawn work.  Syncs great with my S7 Edge and all controls work.  Sounds quality is definitely good enough for me.  They haven't come loose or fell off.
1,"Audio quality is mediocre.  Battery charges fairly quickly, they are comfortable but audio quality is very disappointing."
1,"Works great, sounds great !!!<br />Would recommend these to friends and family. Good product...."
1,"Awesome value for money! Have changed my workouts completely and so very well packed. Great accessories are included, esp the carry case to protect ur purchase"
1,"All I got to say it, buy it!!!"
1,The ear buds r a little big
1,I like all the accessories with the earned headset. I dislike the part that around around ear....it is to large and can not bend to fit around my ear.
1,"Good battery life, good Bluetooth connection.  No bass, terrible voice.<br /><br />Listening to music is not pleasant.  The bass is almost completely absent.  They work fine for listening to podcasts and news.  Being wireless is more than just a convenience when I'm walking four dogs.  The fit is comfortable and I can wear them for hours without even noticing they are there.  I forgot to pick up my phone, and the bluetooth didn't cut out until I was at least 30 feet away.  This is a great improvement over past headsets where I had to have my phone in the front pocket, not the back pocket, to avoid losing the signal.  Trying to use them for a phone call is completely pointless.  I sound like I just landed on the moon, but less clear.<br /><br />This set will definitely be useful for some situations, but it does not work as advertised.  I wanted to be able to use them to make phone calls, and that isn't happening."
1,Good for price. Great noise quality!
1,"Nice sound, but they don't stay in place, constantly falling off of my ears. I was hoping and still wish that they were adjustable."
1,These are superior to my 90 JBL reflects in every way.  they are the first that I have found that fit correctly which is key to great sound.  They do start to sound staticy when the battery is getting low but once charged this goes away.  So far so good owned for a few weeks.  For the price they are hard to beat
1,works great!
1,Used once and lost it so I can’t really give a great review but sounded really good
1,"Excellent quality sound, fits snug and securely, and very easy to use. The streamlined volume and multi-function buttons make it very easy to operate without having to take them off."
1,"Great sound, cool design, good price, very satisfied!"
1,"Very comfortable, and the sound quality is awesome. Excellent for use in a hot tub."
0,No warranty support. Do not buy these. I have had 2 and they both died before the warranty was up and there was no support from senso. Try Mpow!!
1,Not a perfect fit for my ears.
1,"So far so good! Enjoying the headphones and they are super comfortable. I hope they last. - March 19, 2018"
1,Nice but not a total fan of the flemsy ear piece
1,Really good value for money!!!
1,"I've had these for over a year and use them 4 days a week on the treadmill at the gym. The music at the gym is always so loud and these headphones absolutely cancel it out!! They are easy to wear, easy to charge (comes with its own charger) and the sound quality is phenomenal. They also come with several different sizes of silicone ear plugs and they stay in place over the ears. I highly recommend them and do to everyone I know."
1,"I often watch instructional videos on my Mac and the volume is too low, especially if there's other noise nearby. I looked into boosting the Mac volume artificially using apps, but learned that that can damage the Mac speakers. This is the only pair of headphones I've tried that is able to significantly boost the volume (via noise cancellation or directional targeting or whatever) so that I can actually hear all of the videos. The handy hard carrying case is also nice so the headphones don't turn on accidentally due to physical pressure applied by surrounding objects. And there's three different sizes for the ear buds so that it tends to stay in my small ears for the most part. The design is visionary and so even if the buds fall out of my ear the hooks make it so there don't fall away and are easy to put back in."
1,I like the sound quality but the base is left wanting!!  That’s about all the battery life is great I can do audible books for hours a day I like it
1,"Right price and works as promised.  The exercise routine is a bit easier when there is music in the background.  I am not an audio expert, but to me the sound is excellent.  I bought it so the ear buds would stay in my ears, however, the noise cancelling, sound reproduction, water resistant design and a reasonable price make this an outstanding product.  BTW, had a technical issue with the device and contacted SENSO tech support.  Received a response in about 20 minutes with easy to read and follow instructions on how to correct the issue.  After two minutes the issue was resolved and I'm back to the music."
1,"Very happy with the headphones thus far. My main use of them is in the gym, I have worked out, run, and many different other activities at the gym and they have worked great throughout.....<br />As far as sound I am extremely happy, pairing the head phones to my phone was as easy as turning them on....<br />I would definitely recommend this wireless headphones.....I am very happy!"
1,"Overall, fantastic buy. Cannot go wrong with these headphones if you're on a budget and need some solid bluetooth wireless headphones.<br /><br />Positives: Excellent sound quality, not absolutely mind blowing but very high definition sound and very reasonable bass as well. Reasonable battery life and very reasonable charging time. Volume goes extra loud, loud enough to damage hearing. Very sweat/dust resistant for the most part. Have been using these for 1 year, working out 4-6 times a week and they are in perfect shape.<br /><br />Negatives: Sometimes bluetooth connection can be a little frustrating, if you connect to one device and then would like to connect to another device at a later point, you need to fiddle with it and turn it on and off a few times before it works. Low battery indicator is my only major complaint about these headphones -- specifically, it warns you of low battery when you only have roughly 5 or so minutes of listening time left. Low battery indicator should have been set to warn you when you have at least 20 minutes left so you can still use them for the remainder of a workout. Numerous times I found myself halfway into my workout with a battery low reminder and my headphones cut out at the end of the song.<br /><br />Overall, solid 4/5 rating. For the $30 I dropped on these, they have exceeded my expectations far and beyond, and I would recommend them to anyone without a doubt."
0,One month old and they went completely dead.
1,I honestly believe the quality is ALMOST as good as the Dr things..
1,Charge doesn't seem to hold. I am not sure how this compares to other wireless.  Also would just get buds and not the clip thing.
1,"I bought these after getting trying a model from a different brand that cost twice as much as these did.  These are more reliable, simpler controls/interface, and TWICE as loud as the other brand I purchased.  Plus, if these end up getting flooded with sweat or get messed up (which all sport headphones do eventually if you work out with them), they are way cheaper to replace.  Very happy with these headphones."
1,"I have a pair of Bose earbuds and these put those things to shame!!! Deep bass, nice midrange and great highs....and loud as all get out!!! Controls are easy to work once you get used to them and they are comfortable as a fresh hotel pillow.<br /><br />I got these on sale for $37--originally about $135!!! If they are still on sale get two pair."
1,"Excellent sound, very comfy, good battery life, easy to setup and use.  I've now had these since February and I'm even more pleased than when I first received them.  I had previously purchased a pair of rechargeable ear buds from a shopping channel for over $30 and the SENSO<br /> blows them away.  I could not be more pleased with the sound and battery life."
0,"Sound was ok, but it died after two weeks of light use and good care. Didn’t expect much at this price but was still disappointed."
1,"Excellent, great sound quality, battery last a decent time, conversation is nice too."
0,Returned due to fit
0,Hang a bit too much off the ear
1,"So far so great. Great sound quality, east to set up and sound didn't fade even when I started sweating during my run."
0,"Sound quality is good, battery life is acceptable. However material is cheap, headphones are not durable, and are not suitable for wearing while running. Avoid."
0,Decent quality sound but the power button broke on me after two weeks of actual use.  Low rating is to reflect physical quality of product.
1,The caveat to this review is I just received them so this only an initial review.  The buds have a good sound and functionality of the buds is simple.<br /><br />They are comfortable and having different ear pieces this is a good thing.  With ear canals differing I am able to choose my comfort.<br /><br />The longevity of their performance is still a question hence only 4 stars. However at first blush they seem to be a good product
1,Have been using them for 2 weeks.  They connect fast to my Bluetooth and the battery last about 7 hours.  I'm very happy with the sound quality at this price level.
1,"First time buyer of Senso products. I was very surprised by the quality of the product. The wireless headphones arrived with its own carry case, 1 short USB charge wire, 1 long ( I think 24&#34;) charge wire that can be used to charge the earbuds and iPhone, car charger converter with two USB output ports (1A, 2.1A), and different size replacement ear fittings.<br /><br />I also received another surprise, communication via email from the company offering 24/7 phone support support and requesting feedback.<br /><br />In the past two weeks I used the earbuds at work, metro, and while running/exercising. The average use time 6-8 hours per day.<br /><br />The first thing worth to note, the Bluetooth range is awesome. In the past I had a few wireless earbuds and their range was terrible. With these earbuds, by accident, I discovered that at approximately 10-15m from my phone they still picked up my iPhone signal and played music perfectly.<br /><br />The microphone quality is so so. Sometimes people on the other side of the phone conversation complained of my voice not being loud enough. I am not too concerned about that especially considering that I purchase them for listening to music while working or running.<br /><br />I also do not have (so far) any issue with battery. I consider them to be a great buy at the current price level."
0,"dont buy them , just waste of money"
1,I have a pair of these headphones for myself that I absolutely love. I have even broke an old pair of these headphones (my fault completely) and didn't hesitate to buy another pair. So when my mom needed a new pair of headphones I automatically bought them for her! She already loves them and is using them on a daily basis.<br />I highly recommend them! Great quality headphones for a great price!
1,"Stopped taking a charge after a few months of use.  Good while they worked, just stinks that I have to buy a few pairs every year"
1,"I work out six days a week and need headphones that can stand up to sweat and still sound good. Good build quality--these headphones seem built to last. Controls for phone access, volume levels and track advance and reverse are easy to use. Sound quality, is good; highs could be a little stronger, but perfectly acceptable. Only worn about trhree hours at most in one session, but didn't experience fatigue or discomfort.  Pleased with my purchase."
1,Best Bluetooth Headphone! Very sharp and clear. Very well made.
0,Cuts in/out whenever I move or walk. If I still had the packaging I would return.
1,Great! No more bugging the household with loud music etc.  Love these things. I get 4 and 5 hour IV's at the doctors periodically and I can jam on to my phones playlist without disturbing the nurses or other patients.
1,Good price and sound was fine but the earbuds wouldn't stay in my ears--I gave them to a friend and they worked for her.
1,"I love the quality of the sound and how easy they are to handle. What I don't love is, even at a close range, certain angles get the signal interrupted. I tried using these for exercise and realized that the signal gets cut off whenever I dan my phone in my right pocket or side. If it weren't for this then I would have given 5 stars to this product."
1,I love them
1,"bulky, and should be worn inside (the gym) because the wind will ruin your music"
1,I gifted a close relative with these headphones and she is loving them.  A
1,"Great sound, comfortable, long battery charge"
1,I really like them! They work perfectly for the gym and that is whey I needed them. Gods souls quality and stay in place
0,"Didn’t fit right, sound quality is decent, but don’t fit right and constantly have to adjust. Even after trying all the different size attachments."
1,These headphones are absolutely amazing and sound better than Power Beats in my opinion.
1,Really impressed. Super easy set up and charging. EXCELLENT sound. No slip during heavy workouts.
1,The best in the market at the unbelievable price. Exceptional customer service e.
1,"These earbuds are great for the price. Good audio quality. However, the fit tends to hurt my ears after an hour of use. It is possible though, that a different set of ear tips could solve the problem. I would recommend these to someone looking for budget earbuds."
0,"I am writing a review to express my frustration over the quality (or lack thereof), since it's way past my return window. These earphones have been spotty with volume in the left ear... and now, there is ZERO volume, ZERO sound in my left ear. I am tired of hoping something will change. These are destined for the trash, and now I must spend more $ money on a competitor's brand. I will not consider this brand again."
1,"After I received them the other day,I charged them up, easily paired them with my iPhone and wore them for 2 1/2 hours walking and listening to music.  I was surprised and how good the sound is!  I was also easily able to work all the buttons on the earpiece to answer the phone & talk which was another positive surprise.  Best of all after I figured out how to put them on correctly they stayed in comfortably and did not fall out!  Also I love the case that came with them and the directions are very clear and easy to follow. So I am very happy with this product."
1,"Battery life is great! Lasts almost all day at work! Sound is pretty good, although the stock AMG phones that came with my phone blow these out of the water, but those are corded. Noise cancellation is great, especially when I'm driving and don't want to hear the traffic noise. I have a set of bluetooth full wireless headphones that are good but dont have the battery power these do."
1,"These headphones have exceeded my expectations. I have been running with these headphones in the hot humid summer we are expierencing. They are comfortable, stay securely on my ears, sound great and certainly appear to be very waterproof. ( Lots of sweat). I am very pleased with these headphones!"
1,"The left earbud broke off of the left base after about 30 days of use.<br /><br />UPDATE: I called the warranty number and they said they would replace the unit. If it happens, I will update the rating. I started with a 1-star. We'll see. If it doesn't break, its great sound and lasts a long time.<br /><br />They have communicated that they are sending a replacement set. Given how many they sell, it may be that some are bound to have faults that slip by.<br /><br />When they worked, they worked very well, so as of now I am going to upgrade my rating, given they are sending a replacement with no questions asked.."
1,"I have had these headphones now for 10 months and they worked pretty good. The sounds quality on music is good with good bass, they are pretty comfortable to wear for extended periods. The problems I have had are:<br /><br />1) Picks up a lot of outside noise while walking making it hard for people you are talking to to hear you.<br />2) Within the last week the sound is suddenly cutting out even though they are still connected to my device, I have to shut them off and back on to get them to work.<br />3) Sometimes the volume up and down buttons don't respond right away and then they work good.<br /><br />I am still under warranty so I contacted Senso support and I'm working with them to fix the issue with sound cutting out. I will update once I have this figured out."
0,"Like other reviews have said, even the lowest setting on my iPhone 7 is way too loud. I have tried resetting the headphones multiple times like Senso rep has instructed in their replies to other reviews with the same issue, however it doesn't seem to have any affect. It's a bummer because otherwise the headphones have been great, but I can't really use them as intended."
0,Had these for a month and literally had any use with them. Wore them once or twice for a jog and left them alone. Used them the other day at work and they fell apart. Save your money and don't waste it on this crap.
1,Love these headphones!
1,"Love these. I did have to buy a second pair after the first died after a year. I didn't give it a second thought. This new pair has an adjustable ear clip, which is great."
1,"These earbuds have pretty good sound quality. I'm not going to complain about that. What I do take issue with is the design of the controls. There are volume +/- buttons and one multi-function button. The multi-function button only responds to how long you press it for. A quick press is play/pause, a two second press is skip, and longer than that turns it off. The only other function on it is re-dial. I don't know why, but I guess that's an important one. The multi-function button is positioned directly over your ear canal so any attempt to mess with it drives the device deeper into your ear, which, for me at least, ranges from unpleasant to painful. I've also never had the skip song function actually work. It beeps like it did something but then nothing happens.<br /><br />While this is a good headset for listening to music, it's a very poor remote-control. Considering the impressive range of control offered by a single button on other earbud options, I'm very disappointed with what's offered here."
1,"Great product, great sound. I took away one star because one earphone stopped working within 5 months."
0,Terrible quality. Used for 2 workouts and never worked again.
1,Operates as advertised.  The earpieces hang well and provide a secure and good sounding connection as we walk.
0,"it was great for about a month with every other day usage.  then the sound started skipping when turned on but was still working.  then about 2 months after purchase, as i just connected it to the charger using the provided cable, an immediate burnt smell of metal was noticed.  i quickly unplugged the unit from charging. indeed the burnt smell was coming from the headset and the microSD connector was melted.  so it's dead. has anybody experienced this? update: they sent me a replacement very quickly.  this unit worked OK until it was dead again after about 8 months: cannot be turned on and LED does not turn on while charging.  Senso sent me instruction on how to re-set to default setting and i tried that x2 but it was still dead.  This time around senso can only offer a 5% discount for the next purchase.  Why would i want to buy this again?  if you are attracted to the price then do consider buying the protection plan."
1,I bought these for my fiancé and she likes them a lot. They get really loud. The battery lasted about 15 hours over the course of about 3-4 weeks of working out coming out of the package. (She just had to charge them) They seem great for the price.
1,It seems that the signal will be interrupted when your phone is in the pocket and your head turns around. And it will get uncomfortable to wear the earbud for a while.
0,"Was excited to receive these as they had great reviews and the price point was perfect.  Worked great for the price...for a little over a month.  Used probably 15 times and they are completely dead already.  Just outside the return window of course.  Buyer beware, you get what you pay for"
1,"Product arrived on time and as described. I generally don't have good luck with earbuds fitting and staying in my ears but the medium size that came with these fit well and I haven't had any trouble so far with these staying in my ears. I like to run everyday (2-3 miles) and have been using these for about a week. So far they have always stayed in my ears, stayed connected to my phone, and have perfectly fine sound quality for what I would expect for this price range. The carrying case these come with are really nice for traveling with these and I liked that these came with all the accessories to charge these under nearly any circumstance. So far using these for running or walking to/from school I haven't had them die/lose charge so I think the 8 hour time they are advertised with is pretty accurate. Overall I would recommend these."
1,They were intuitive to initially use and operate perfectly!  Great value!
1,"I've had these for a couple of weeks. The company is very responsive. They sent me an email immediately after I received them wanting to know how I liked them and to reach out for any follow-ups (for $30 headphones I was impressed). I've paired them with my Apple Watch and iPhone 7 and it seems to work well. No complaints so far. Will take a little to get use to the wrap around earphones if you haven't wore them before, but overall they are snug and stay put. I've ran with them and mowed the yard and they stayed in fine. When I'm at work (since they fit snug in your ear) it blocks out noise so I can't hear my coworkers, so I miss requests I would normally hear with the Apple headphones. No complaining though, some times they need to be tuned out! Overall, I would recommend to a friend and my wife is thinking of getting some."
1,Great price for the sound!
1,"Sound quality is spotty. Even with the paired device right next to the headphones, the sound cuts in and out- similar to what happens when the paired device is almost out of range for the headphones. Other than that the fit and usability is ok for the price point."
1,"Excellent headphones, sound is pretty good.  Accessories are really nice as well."
0,"These worked well while they lasted, but after only using them maybe 5 times, the ear bud separated from the base of the headphones and now they are completely useless. Super irritated they didn't last. Looks like the return window was only a month (it's been 3 months since I bought them)."
1,I highly recommend these headphones the sound quality is superb the only drawback that I have is there can be outside noise rather sometimes they are a little noisy other than that I recommend fast delivery thank you
0,How can I return this staff for one year warranty not working anymore won’t let me connect it?
1,"I just received by Senso Bluetooth headphones and didn't know what to expect based upon their relative low price, but I was pleasantly surprised because I have small ear canals and the small gel ear tips and the sound tube allowed me to get the perfect fit for my ears.  Pairing was easy with my iPhone 6 and the sound is very impressive.  I am not an audiophile but in my personal opinion it has good bass, treble and midrange.  You get a neat dual long power cord for micro-USB and lighting connector Apple devices along with a short USB power cord and 2 outlet cigarette charger all for the low price around $35 bucks with a one year warranty.  I bought these because I was going on vacation near swimming pools and the beach and these have an IPX 7 rating and will be perfect for my poolside lounging.  For the price, accessories and sound you can't go wrong with these."
1,"I loved these things but they stopped charging after a few months of use (started using in April and quit in July).  So disappointed as they were exactly what I wanted.  They were comfortable, have great range, and had great battery life until this issue made them totally useless.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />After sending me an email with instructions to trouble shoot the issue with no luck, they immediately sent me a replacement set under the 1 year warranty.  While bummed that it happened in the first place, I am very pleased with their customer service."
1,The best Bluetooth headset you can ever have!
1,"really good ear buds.. not so great with noise cancellation, which is why I brought them for... background noise at work"
1,"Great sound, bass, and the charging light isn't too bright"
1,"Seriously, I love these headphones. Sound quality is superb. Price was great. Mine were missing the wire wrap - no big deal. Seller said they would hip a replacement. I've yet to receive it but they did issue me a $5 refund. I'd buy these again in a heartbeat."
1,Nice sound. Easy to use.  Pairing was a little slow but eventually worked.
0,I have small ears. The Apple earbuds are so big they don't fit into my ears. I thought these would be great - as they wrap around and I could were them while working out. The part that fits around your ear is so big - they wouldn't't stay on.
1,Returned it. Didn't like the feel. Kept falling out during workout. And sound quality wasn't that great either.
1,"I've only had them for 3 days but I have used them 3 times and I am very happy with the sound quality while I'm running.  The big test will be on my motorcycle.  I've been told they have good sound quality for phone calls also, so overall I'd have to say I'm very pleased so far.<br /><br />So, after using them for 6 months the right speaker stopped working. As they are under warranty I contacted Invotek. Within 36 hours they had talked me through an attempt to do a factory reset and, when that failed,  had a replacement in the mail.  Excellent value, excellent sound, excellent customer service!!"
1,"Definitely would recommend these headphones for those on a budget. These headphones have great quality as well as they are comfortable and super versatile. However, you cannot go too far with the Bluetooth as the connection gets very weak."
1,"If you are concerned about sound quality, do not waste your money on these. However, they are fairly comfortable to wear. And, they come with a 2 port cigarette lighter charger as well as a micro USB/lightning cable."
0,"These sound great! The problem I have with them is they don't stay on my ears when I tilt my head.  Also, the cord snag on my neckline and pull the buds out as well when maneuvering under vehicles."
1,"I love the concept, how long the battery stays charged and the convenience.  I would have given these 5 stars but the hoops that go around the ears are too big for my ears and I cannot adjust them to a smaller size."
1,"I've purchased two pairs. The first was June 2017 (Red) and the second pair (Blue) in September 2017.  I bought the second pair so that I could keep one charged while using the second pair.<br /><br />They get 4.5 stars.<br /><br />I didn't purchase these because I'm an athlete so can't say how well they work in regards to exercise.  However, I used to run and bike and in my opinion, I do believe, if I was still doing those particular activities, these would be better than any other earbuds I've owned.<br /><br />Due to illness I'm pretty much sedentary at the moment so I use these to watch TV and I listen to alot of audiobooks through my phone or computer. The length of the books I listen to range from 5 hours (short story) to 65 hours (for a series).  Listening to them at night helps me fall asleep. Plus, living in an apartment with thin walls, my wearing headphones while watching action/sci-fi movies keeps the neighbors from banging on the walls when they aren't as interested in hearing the space battles, gun fights, and car chases as much as I am.<br /><br />Every other earbud or headphone I've purchased has caused outer ear pain after wearing them for a couple of hours. I tried to make sure I took the earbuds or headphones off before falling asleep. Most times I fell asleep with them on and then woke up in an hour or two with outer ear pain. Being a side sleeper only made it worse.<br /><br />The first time I fell asleep with these earbuds in, I woke up 5 hours later and had zero discomfort.  I've listened to some lengthy books (the page turners you don't want to put down) until the battery ran down and then switched to the other set of earbuds to continue listening without any discomfort.  I've taken a break, shut off an audiobook or TV, and forgotten I even had the earbuds in.<br /><br />Noise cancelling isn't great. My new neighbor upstairs likes to crank up her stereo occassionally on weekends.  These earbuds don't cancel noise but they do reduce the noise by about 30%.<br /><br />(Side Note: for my dumbest noise test,  I recently purchased a VitaMix blender and wanted to know hese earbuds would help reduce/block any of the sound. A Vitamix blender can generate a lot of noise. In my test, I turned the Vitamix on to level 10 (highest) and I could only tell a very small difference with the earbuds in versus when they were not.  Of course, I could turn on the Vitamix to level 10, walk 150 feet outside of my apartment and still hear it (without the earbuds).  I know these earbuds aren't made to block that level of sound but was curious and as I mentioned, it was a dumb test.)<br /><br />Now for minor (to me at least) complaints.  As I mentioned, I purchased 2 sets, 3 months apart.  Another reason I bought the second set was to try to avoid wearing out the first set from extended use.  I constantly switch in between the earbuds.<br /><br />The first set (Red) is still working fine with the exception of the battery life.  In less than 12 months it is down to only holding 5 to 6 hours of charge.<br /><br />The second set (Blue) battery life is about 7 hours.  However, the right speaker's volume is only about half the volume of the left speaker. I clean the earbuds with alcohol wipes daily for hygenic reasons so there is nothing clogging either the earbuds (or my right ear). It just suddenly decreased in volume about 2 weeks ago.  I checked it with multiple audio sources (audiobooks, music, phone calls) and it's the same for all of them.<br /><br />I have an  Android phone from Google that I use for night and sometimes day listening to audiobooks.  The bluetooth range before I start breaking up is pretty decent and I only have a problem in one 2 square foot section in my bathroom. Moving 1 foot in any direction clears it.  The signal only has to travel through, at most, one wall in any other part of the apartment which doesn't present a problem. Outside I don't have any problem listening or talking 30 feet from my phone.<br /><br />I had to buy a special bluetooth adapter for my Windows 7 computer in order to get a signal since Windows 7 didn't have the latest and greatest bluetooth version. My Windows 10 laptop didn't have the same problem. I have had some issues with synching requiring me to power of the earbuds or the device I'm trying to synch to, and sometimes both, before I make a connection. 98% of the time it's not an issue.<br /><br />One positive feature of these earbuds can also be a minor annoyance at times.  The earbuds can communicate with two devices so if you let your earbuds connect to your phone, so you can receive calls, you can also connect to another device (i.e. TV) and watch a movie.  The problem is that it seems to be a &#34;first come first synched&#34; situation.<br /><br />I have my Android Phone, Windows 10 laptop, Windows 7 desktop.  If they are all producing a Bluetooth signal, and I power on the earbuds to use with my phone, the computers seem to be able to synch with the earbuds fastest, but not always.  Sometimes I'm trying to connect to my laptop or desktop and either of those devices will tell me they can't connect.  Since the earbuds only tell you that they've connected, but not to what, I have to shut down the bluetooth on all 3 devices and then turn only the one or two on so I get synched to the devices I want.  Minor annoyance only since I've &#34;mostly&#34; gotten used to it.<br /><br />I've worn these (carefully) in the shower a few times to see how well they worked and they seem to be pretty water &#34;resistant&#34;.  Sound quality for what I use them for is very good.  I listen to music occassionally and, while I'm not an audiophile, I'm happy with the sound quality including bass. I've even heard some instruments on some orchestral arrangements that I'd missed on regular speakers.<br /><br />For me, comfort and wear time is 80% of what I look for in earbuds/headphones.  These get 4.5 stars for that.<br /><br />The other 20% is a mix of battery life, sound quality, device quality, ease of use, price, etc.  I've deducted 1/2 star because of the progressive decrease in battery life.  I expect there to be a gradual decrease but I didn't expect there to be an almost 40% decrease in 11 months.  Also, the right earbud volume failing is annoying but, for audiobooks it's not critical. I haven't looked to see if anyone else has mentioned an issue with the battery life.  As long as it doesn't decrease any faster then I should still have a usuable product for the next year.  After that, it will just feel like I'm using an earlier generation that only had a couple of hours of play time.<br /><br />But, if I need replace a set, unless something else came on the market that was considerably better and less expensive, I would buy these again."
0,"The sound on these are great but that's about it. They hurt my ears and when I was walking and had the phone on my left arm it would cut out all the time, but when it was on the other side it was fine. Didn't like these for those two reasons."
0,"These sound great, but sweat burned up first pair, so I tried again.  Same thing happened on the second pair.  Be warned."
1,"Great sound, easy to use."
0,"Used everyday at work,battery lasted almost 16 hours. Has fare sound. The main problem is it will start disconnecting from the phone even when it is just in my pocket.  That happens for about a week then it won't charge ( no light and no charge) basically just dead. Bought the first one  it lasted  11 months, second one  9 months."
0,I could not pair the buds with my phone.<br />Now what do I do next?
1,Pretty decent sound - I have the bose noise cxl'ing ear bud that deliver better quality sound - but with all the cords and power packs so these are much more convenient.
1,"I've never had wireless headphones before - so I don't have much to compare these against but I LOVE these. They work extremely well, hold a long charge, sound great, and I've had no issues syncing to bluetooth devices! I would definitely recommend these to someone looking for wireless headphones to work out with/etc."
1,Better than Beats!! I absolutely LOVE my earbuds. I can go from my room to the other end of my house with these. Sound is great! My ears are tiny so the extra ear buds was a plus. I wish The ear holder thingy could be flexible in sizing so I could decrease the size (as stated earlier my ears are tiny) but that’s a personal issue/preference.
1,i love it !! HD SOUND!! you cant even feel them on you.. battery really good .. music is loud .. you cant even the outside world... if i ever lose this .. i will buy them again
0,"They.work great for music, but very bad when phone call comes in. You either have an echo or cannot hear you because surrounding noise drowns you out. Hard to be heard when driving or outside."
1,These are a great price and great quality set of headphones.  They are a great value.  The blue-tooth pairing was effortless and the sound is awesome.  They stayed put in my ears throughout my entire workout through the sweat and all.
1,Love them👍🏻
1,"Love the quality of the earphones!! Used it running the other day and they are great!! Great sound and quality! The only thing is I would improve the style, I wish is was 2 seperate ear pieces instead of the attatched cord piece."
1,Got them synced up to my phone. Enjoy the quality of sound. Easy to sync up
1,"I had a pair of these for years and I am returning to buy them again after my dog chewed up my previous pair. Great sound quality, comfortable and pliable material to fit your ear, acceptable battery life and bluetooth range. Definitely recommend."
1,"Does the job it's designed for. Wish it wasn't as bass heavy as it is, but it's not terrible. Definitely beats having to use corded headphones when jogging!"
1,"Finally, earphones that are comfortable and don't falll out of my ears. The wireless Bluetooth connection is an added bonus.<br /><br />Sound is good, especially for this price point. Simple to set up and operate, although I find the volume control a bit tricky. The button are small. Don't know what they could do given the real estate they have to work with. Also, you can just adjust the volume on your phone.<br /><br />I like the one-touch on/off button on the side. Easy to find. I also like the fact a voice tells you &#34;power on&#34; or &#34;power off&#34; so there's no confusion if you mis-punch.<br /><br />Overall, well-designed at a reasonable price. Only question left is whether they're durable. Based on many other reviews I've read, I'm not worried.<br /><br />Would definitely recommend to a friend."
1,Good product love them
1,These buds do what they say they will do. They are clear and stay in place while I ride my bike. I would recommend them to anyone who wants wireless buds that are sweatproof!
1,"Great sound quality, very good instructions, comfortable to wear and love the carrying case!"
1,"Simple, functional and has better range than most. Great product."
1,"So the earpiece broke really fast and I was bummed. They worked okay while they were functional. But they were on the cheaper side, so you get what you pay for."
1,So far so good. Comfortable and decent sound quality. Not the best but for the cost it is as good as I suspected. I hope they last longer than previous brands I have bought.
1,"Good quality and sound, I recommend them!"
1,"I have only had these headphones for a few days, but thus far I am really impressed.  Bluetooth set up was quick and easy on my iPhone 6.  Sound quality is very good.  Used them for a workout in the gym and they stayed in place and sound quality was excellent throughout my workout.  Packaging is first rate and includes a complete assortment of accessories.  I have not had a need to contact customer service, they the fact that they have reached out to me proactively is an impressive indication of they desire to assist their customers.  Nice touch!"
0,Lightweight but missing many features. It is not noise cancelling. I don't know what Senso defines as noise cancelling but this is not it. The form factor is kind of ridiculous overall. The actual headphones are really small but I suppose it's because I'm a bigger person. On the plus side they stay in your ears but overall this purchase is a disappointment and now Amazon won't let me return it for free.
1,Excellent!!!
1,the headphones are very comfortable and the sound is clear all and all a very good product
1,Good audio quality.  Controls are easy to use - they are highly intuitive so I learned them quickly. Manual is clearly written & concise.  Audio quality is clear. Fit comfortably with eyeglasses.  Email support question was responded to promptly on a Saturday morning & reminded me of exactly what I needed to do to run smoothly.
1,Husband loves them! Just what he was looking for to use with his iPad.
1,"They didn't fit well in my ears initially, but after realizing I can shape them to my ears they haven't been falling out ever since."
1,"they lose Bluetooth Constantly, even if my phone is in my pocket."
1,Muy buen producto para hacer ejercicio
1,"I use these for listening to music when I’m working out. So far the battery life and sound quality has been good. I like that the ear piece is moldable and that I can bend it around my ear. The earbuds stay in my ears pretty well when I’m lifting, but I have a little bit of trouble when I’m running. I may need to play around with the ear tips a bit more."
1,I bought these to replace my Powerbeats3 headphones that proved to be less than sweatproof. The Senso headphones have performed very well and they really hold up during long runs without cutting out. I'd say the sound quality isn't quite as good as the Powerbeats3 but that's not a big issue for me anyways.
1,"In 2 months of use: I use the cell phone in my armband, and I hear a minimal loss of signal, almost imperceptible. As for the support, it's good, it does not bother me while Im running. The battery lasts more than 3 days of use, 1 hour per day."
1,Love them!! Great buy!!
1,I used my son's Beats wireless headphones and I think these are just as good.  Excellent sound - very good value for the money.
1,The Bluetooth headphones are great.  I have no problems
0,I really wish I could give negative stars. Not even a week after receiving this product the power cord stopped working. It's an off size for charging so I could not find a compatible cord. I contacted the company and was told they would send me a new charging cord right away. Never heard from them again. Now I have a pair of useless headphones. What a waste of money.
1,Buenísimos
1,"These headphones are a good fit and exceptional sound quality. I did not have any problem linking to my android. What else can i say, Ilike them a lot."
1,"I've used my Sensos a few times and so far no issues. They are very convenient, the cord doesn't get in the way while I'm at the gym, it fit and stays on/in my ears, and the volume is great.  I love the carrying case, the  dual charger,  and the charging cord that comes with it. I'm able to charge my earbuds as well as my phone so my old cord has been replaced with my new multi functioning cord. Thanks Senso 👈🏾👍🏾👌🏾😊"
0,I've used this item about 5-6 times and now it doesn't connect to any device. No wonder it was 30 dollars.<br /><br />I would not recommend.
1,"Very quality item, so good sound, the bass is awesome, battery is good."
1,Love this product - I am giving it a 5 star rating - great sound.
1,easy to used and very  comfortable.
0,"It is a good product for having only used it for a week. I like that there is a voice that tells you if it has paired with your device or not. Also, there are multiple silicone earpiece covers that you can use to try and find the best fit for your ears. However, unfortunately after trying all of the different sizes I was unable to use a size that was suitable for my workouts. I will say though that my workouts are intense in the sense that I do a lot of jumping, running and head movement. Thus, these keep falling out and I can't have headphones that require I tend to them often.<br /><br />Overall, if you work out hard to intense I would suggest finding some headphones that will sit in/on your ear a little bit better."
0,"I'll give them 2 stars because they did sound good when they worked.  I have only had them for a few months and they just stopped working.  I use them when paddling on the lake just in case they get wet.  Today I went to charge them and the light won't come on and they will no longer turn on.  Worked fine last week and now........nothing.  Same thing happened to my wife who had ones that looked exactly the same (different clone brand).<br />When they did work, they are not comfortable to wear with sunglasses due to the wrap around feature.  Also, they never really stayed securely in my ears."
1,Great for hands free phone calls and listening to music when jogging. Clear sound.
1,"Very good quality, has a lot of sweet add ons and even better price"
1,"Works as expected.  Great sound, deep base.  Can't beat it for the price."
1,"Let me start with the &#34;Cons&#34; because I'm offended by advertising for this product (I still gave it 4 stars)<br /><br />Cons:<br /> - No they are NOT Noise Cancelling.  False advertisement on the part of the manufacturer.  The box it came in shows &#34;CVC 6.0 Noise Cancellation&#34; on the front, but there is no noise cancellation at all (this is called lying!).  If you do a search on &#34;cvc 6.0 noise cancellation&#34; you will see reference to both the CVC/Qualcomm technology and another link about CVC 6.0 noise cancellation being Active Noise Cancellation.<br /> - Their passive noise cancellation is non existent.  Just a marketing ploy.  I have a pair of &#34;Passive Noise Cancellation&#34; headphone which do a good job of blocking noise, but these do ZERO for blocking noise<br /><br />Pros:<br /> - Light & comfortable on my ears.<br /> - Good Microphone.  Called my brother and a friend to get their opinion on the mic sound, both felt it was as clear as the iPhone mic (I switched back and forth)<br /> - The buttons are well placed and work easily.<br /> - Sound is good, not great.<br /> - All of the accessories are good.  Glad to have everything I need with this product (have not tried the car charger yet)<br /> - Price is reasonable for what you get (build seems good so far - just 2 days of using it).<br /> - The support service was good.  I spoke to Senso (very polite gentlemen) about the noise cancellation and about my gripe that they were doing some false advertising. He can't do much about it of course, but I was impressed that someone answered on a Saturday morning.  This might be enough reason for me giving them a 4 star."
1,Thank you.  I bought one for me and on for my son.  I like the bass these put out.
1,"I just received the headphones a couple of days ago, but so far I have been impr seed with the quality and ease of use. Nice packaging which included everything I needed. Paired real easy with my iPhone7. I would recommend."
1,They are a great little set of headphones. awesome sound
1,I really like these. I just bought a brand new pair after i accidentally broke my first pair. I did like the ear piece of the original pair though. The part that wraps around your ear on the new ones is moldable with wire inside which makes it harder for me to just quick slide them on. I prefer  the older ear piece.
0,"The headphones sounded fine when being used to partially squash the kill-me-now boredom of treadmills. They worked fine outside too. But this is my second pair that has failed. Senso was helpful and sent a replacement when the first one stopped working in a few months. The second pair works, but will not hold a charge. Unless I remember to charge them *immediately* before use, they are dead, and if charged they don't hold up for too long. Outside, I can live with this.  But....imagine my plight as I approach the indoor hamster wheel on a cold or rainy day ...only to find my headphones not willing to do their part in saving my sanity? Yes, I know #firstworldproblems and all that.  It has been just over a year since my original pair (and 8 months since my second)."
1,"Comfortable to wear, easy to pair, and sound good for the price."
1,"I really enjoyed these headphones for the price. They died after a year of use though, so that’s a bummer!"
1,"I had a GREAT headset off of Amazon over a year ago but they stopped charging. I will say I'm a  mega sweater and my last ones lasted longer than any Sony headphones, but they no longer were made and this was the closest option. The battery doesn't last too long, if I put my phone in my pant pockets it will disconnect as if its too far. Once its at 15% or 10% it gives a warning like every 30 seconds which is annoying. They do the job for short term workouts and work days"
1,"Very good headphones overall. Whatever you do, try to avoid ""maxing out the volume"" as much as you can. Audiophiles such as myself really can't help myself"
1,I received my earbuds in a timely fashion they were easy to pair with my phone and sound really good for the price. I only wish the lows sounded a little better.
1,loud  battery life about 8 hours  only issue was the cap popped off of one ear piece about 6 months in but SENSO replaced the whole thing!  Same day  one call!  this is a great company<br />use the natural foam ear buds  watch for ear damage due to the loudness and check the caps where the red logo is every so often and maybe hit it with dab of super glue to hold it on<br />other than that these rock<br />well update for third time the covers popped off and for the third time they stopped charging  so derated my review to three stars
1,It's okay
1,"These headphones work really well and are comfortable. I used them for running and working out, but also they came in handy because they seem to boost audio volume considerably. This was good for videos and lectures I watched that were hard to hear.<br />After working perfectly for about 11 months, when the battery died one day, the headphones wouldn't recharge or come back on. However, I contacted customer service and they were true to their ""Hassle Free 1 year warranty,"" and sent me a replacement right away!"
1,not the best quiality sound ... you do get what you pay for. the bass that comes from the headset sounds pretty bad like if the speaker was popped the ear pieces that go around your ear to hold the earpiece in place move and are very flexible when i try to place the right earpiece in i always pause the music or turn the volume up or. down due to the fact that the control is located there wouldn’t recommend them if you’re an active person and enjoy quality sounds
0,I dont like it at all.The sound is awful and the bass is really bad.My iphone headphones are way more better than this.
1,"Overall good value. Stay connected, , clear calls, good sound  and are reasonably priced. My only minor issue in the first week was when they let you know the battery was low, you have about 1min. I would have like them to have finished my workout. Not a big deal  moving forward, I'll just charge them sooner."
0,"Shipped on time, sound quality is good. Little disappointed with battery life. One minute indicator shows half and then it drops to zero within minute."
0,"There is only a warning 10 minutes before power is out. Excessive time to connect to broadcast device, as well as the first 15 seconds being flakey. Ear loops don't provide much/any ability to stay on the ear. Audio is below par"
0,Bought this for the reliability and water resistance. First time getting wet (not submerged) and 1 headphone went out and now only plays intermittently.
1,Great sound and quality. My only complaint is that the “over the ear” silcolone component is looser than I expected.
1,"I haven't used them much, I got them to walk and use at the gym,<br />So far, they sound great, fit well, are very light and stay out of the way, all the reasons I bought them.<br />I may have given a 5 star rating if I had more time to use them."
0,It stop working after a month of me using it
1,Love these earbuds! My favorite ones to wear out of five different models that I own.
1,"The experience with the seller was fine, box arrived in perfect shape and all as described. My only concern at this point is that the headphones start to &#34;skip&#34; (I don't know how else to describe it) after 30 or 40 mins of use even after a full charge. I replied to a message I received Tekatron with this information shortly after the purchase but have not yet heard anything back. Other than that, these have great (probably the best) sound I have heard from a wireless head set."
1,great value for its price
1,"I am able to fit them in my ears and not worry about them falling out. The only minor issue I have noticed, is me pausing my music when I re-install them.  I let my sister wear them for a little while and she has asked that I order her a pair, if that tells you anything."
1,"After my $150 JBL headphones stopped charging, I took a gamble based on reviews and bought these.  I was a little skeptical, but from the minute out of the box to my first workout they over delivered.  I'm not really an audiophile so I can't speak to the sound quality, but for someone that just wants an easy way to listen to music while running or a hands free microphone, these are great."
1,The customer support at Senso is truly amazing.  I received a defective pair of ear buds and new replacements arrived within two days.  The process was simple and direct.  The folks at Senso are to be commended for their commitment to their customers.  I would rate them at the absolute top.
1,Purchased these for my 11-year-old son so he could listen to books as he reads along.  He says they are comfortable and set up was a breeze!
1,Awesome headphones!  Very satisfied!
1,"The headphones sound great and were super easy to pair with my phone.  Have used them primarily to work out in the yard, but plan on using them to work out as well.  Very comfortable."
1,I had a pair of beats that were very close to these but accidentally broke them with my break bar in my car when charging. I didn’t want to spend a ton of money to replace something that might have the same thing happen to them so I got these. The battery life is 10x better than my beats were and I can tell no difference in music quality. And it came with an awesome magnet to mount my phone in the car.
1,"Good sound quality, no connection issues. Overall solid product"
1,Great product at a great price.
0,"I ordered these headphones in August, and they worked fine for 3 months.  But all of the sudden they stopped working mid-workout.  I tried recharging the headphones, but they just appear to be dead.  Tried contacting the company from their website, but they didn't have an means of reaching to them.  Sad."
0,"Worked well the first 8-10 times using, now it won’t charge. Contacting to see if I can get a replacement."
0,"AWFUL sound quality.  It sounds like there is a huge barrier of sound sucking material between the driver and your ears.  I had to spike the high frequencies in spotify's EQ to get a decent sound and when paired and playing in my car, I would have to turn the EQ back off again.  FYI, these are the same headphones as the TrendHolders bluetooth earbuds.  Both identically bad sound quality.<br /><br />I'll save you the headaches and just tell you to get the Symphonized NRG earbuds.  They sound great, are cheap and have the over ear piece to help hold them in place."
1,Worth the money you pay!!
1,Bought these as a present for my teenage son. He likes them quite a bit. Says they are comfortable and stay on while he's shooting hoops.
1,I love them!!! I had no idea for the price I paid they would sound so amazing!!! I now know why they are the number one seller!! Buy them!!!!!!
1,Excellent product ! Easy to pair with good quality sound. Case and charging accessories make use and storage easy.
1,"So far these are the most comfortable buds for my small ear holes!  Rating how well they stay in my ears, I give them an 8.5 out of 10.  Quality is great and they are comfortable."
1,"These are great headphones; very comfortable, good sound quality, fun to wear.  Thanks for a wonderful product!"
1,Excellent product. Easy setup. Very lightweight. Nice bonus items (chargers & cords) included in package.
1,Excellent product at a great price. Comfortable with great sound quality.
1,"Greatest headphones ever. Tremendous sound quality. Very comfortable and easy to operate. I use them to listen to Pandora music. I am in bed now using them. I don,t want to<br />remove them. Thank you for such  wonderful product., Extremely satisfied. Ron"
1,Owned these for a month now.  Great for running and working out - as these do not fall out of your ear like the standard ear buds do.  Battery lasts for several hours; I am very happy with the product and the price point is a plus for what you get.  I would highly recommend the product.  Regards
0,Battery died after about 8 months. Cannot get them to turn back on.
0,Was very sastisfied until last week when it stopped working.
1,Fast to connect to my bluetooth Pixel. Works very well for calls.
1,"Great product, met or exceeded my expectations"
1,Love them! Sound quality is strong!
1,I like the quality of the sound at a very affordable price. Easy to use and that it is waterproof is a big plus!
1,Love them!!
1,My absolute favorite pair of headphones. They are comfortable and helpful when I want to listen to music but have to charge my phone.
1,"Great sound, lasts for hours, sweat resistant"
1,"comfy, pair easily with Samsung Note 4, but from the rumors wonder how they will do wit Oreo"
1,Excellent sound.
1,Yjisbis  great product long life battery.
1,"This bluetooth headset does not disappoint. The headset is easy to use, comfortable, and it comes with a nice box to keep it all together in."
1,"This is my second pair I have purchased. I have one for work and for home. I use them both for daily workouts and to listen to audio books, pod casts, news and music ."
1,"Love it!, best for the price, good quality excellent  sound and I’ll  buy it again"
1,Use these all the time in my wood shop and cutting grass. They work awesome. 3 hours of battery life and enough bluetooth range I can set my phone down and walk around my garage without losing connection
1,"Shockingly good for the price! I needed wireless new headphones for the gym, seeing as my last ones were hardly loud enough to hear at the highest setting. The audio quality is really good and when I'm huffing and puffing along at the gym it cancels the noise out."
1,Very comfortable. The sound is great. I bought them to use for walking in the pool as part of an injury rehab. The ear hooks are barely noticeable. The only issue I have is that the volume does not go low enough. With my phone's volume all the way to its lowest setting I still can't hear what's going on around me. It's almost too loud considering the semi-quiet environment I'm in.
1,"don't write reviews much, but I've been trying out a lot of bluetooth headsets recently (Oh Pixel 2 why have you gone to the dark side and done away with your 3.5 mm audio jack). For the price these just can't be beat. The sound is perfectly respectable. They hold a charge. My phone friendos report that the mic works great."
1,"These are my first wireless earbuds and I love them. I use them to listen to music. It seems like you can  hear each instrument. I just wish they lasted longer between charges, but good for the price, I think."
0,Item left ear-guard damage/defective. Right phone bass not functioning.
1,love these great for my walks
1,"Great for running.  Pairs with phone, tablet, TV.  Does not work with the ps4 but that is not what I bought it for.  I travel a lot for work and these headphone deliver great sound, compact and love the traveling case.  Great product at a fantastic price."
0,had these since January of 2018.<br /><br />They just died for the first time. I charged them all day. now they keep flashing red and blue and they won’t connect to anything. And they turn off! I’m pissed!
1,this is my second paid. First pair lasted three years. This one about a month. Won’t turn on or charge
1,"Earbuds work wonderfully, highly recommend."
1,"I've purchased a few headphones similar to these.  These sound a bit better and will hopefully last longer than other brands I've tried.  Comfortable fit and, at least so far, good customer service."
1,Come in a great little case with charger and extra ear buds. Easy Bluetooth connect. Very comfortable and charge lasts a long time compared to the ones I had through my cell phone carrier. Sound is good and clear for phone calls and music.
1,For the few minutes that I used these headphones sound was nice and clear.  The headphones didn't fall out of my ear per instruction should be easy to use.  Come with additional ear pieces for different size.
1,Easy to use - good quality. Nice sound for audio and for phone calls as well. Good investment
1,"I just hooked this item up after a couple of months' wondering whether or not I'd give it as a holiday gift. I didn't realize what a good value this is: It contains everything you need for charging via wall charger or automobile, a total of three pairs of earplugs in sizes, and thorough instructions for set up and troubleshooting. Sound quality is fine for jogging or walking, though not &#34;audiophile&#34; quality. I would recommend this item!"
0,"These earbuds worked great right out of the box.  When they needed to be charged, I charged them and now they won't connect to any of my Bluetooth devices.  I will be returning for a refund and will try something else."
1,Love this product. Great battery life. Good sound.
1,Sound quality is just as clear as my kids Beats headphones. Email from the CEO making sure I was nothing less than thrilled with my new headsets makes for a great customer experience.
1,The sound quality is very good and they easily fit my ears my only problem is the button to turn on and off is so easily accessible that I find myself accidentally shutting them off when I adjust the fit around my ears
1,Nice earbuds great sound. Can't beat for the price
1,"My experience has been very positive. The pairing was incredibly smooth and easy, and the headphones work extremely well. So far I have been very pleased with the quality of the headphones; I would recommend them!"
1,"They are okay for audio only (music, podcasts, or audio books).  There seems to be audio sync lag no matter how close you are when watching video.  I had hoped to use these for gaming but there is 1-2 seconds of audio lag and my desktop/BT receiver are right next to me.  Still happy with the price, I will use them for audio books and music."
1,These are great! My iPhone shows the battery level on them also. Would buy again!
0,The wind noise is brutal.  Seem like great quality for indoors.  If you are running I don't see how you could use these.  I returned them.
1,"Great head phones, reasonable price and I love that there are multiple ear bud sizes. I hate having anything pushing into my ear canal but the small huds work great and are very comfortable!"
1,"love them, very comfortable and the charge lasts a long time"
1,So far so good. Have used it a handful of times and it’s seems to be working great so far. Loud enough & it does cancel out noise.
1,"Worked exactly as other reviews have stated.  Comfortable, Great sound.  They do not come off."
1,Great head phones for a low price. Highly recommend for others to purchase that are looking to purchase Bluetooth headphones.
0,After one month it did not take a charge
1,"Love them! 30+ year IT guy, It takes a lot to impress me. These are worth every penny. Sound is great, Fit is great, Soft rubber ear surrounds are very comfortable, other ear surrounds are hard plastic, I like these better. Battery life is awesome. Charging is fast, Pairing and Verbalized Connected and Disconnect. Power/Charge LED is excellent. 3 sizes of ear buds and case included. Excellent packaging and instructions. I have been using for about 3 weeks. Very pleased. Note: I did install a sound EQ APP on my android to make music sound better. I have also used a Blue tooth extender with these for TV, PC and Phone (Avantree LONG RANGE Bluetooth Transmitter and Receiver 2-in-1 for TV / Speakers, Voice Prompt, aptX Low Latency, Support Optical & 3.5mm Audio - Oasis https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01H6I3YGK/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) This extender works excellent and gets me about 5X the normal BT range. Great for working around the house and yard. Cutting the lawn and working in the garden. I place my phone and the BT extender on the patio table with a portable battery plug them in and sound everywhere I go up to 60ft (no obstructions), indoors about 25ft depending on walls. Both are excellent."
1,"I bought these headphones so I wouldn't have to hold my smartphone with my hands while out walking in the cold.  Unfortunately, this doesn't work so well.  Either the Bluetooth from my phone isn't strong enough or the receiver on this unit isn't strong enough to pick up the signal.  I still have to walk with my phone in my hand and my hand raised up a bit above waist height.  The volume on this unit is either too strong or too low.  There is a volume rocker (?), but I can't adjust the sound as I would like.  Usually when I am walking, I leave the earbuds out a bit from my ears so I can hear but I don't hurt my eardrums.  When I am inside and don't have to deal with outside noise, though, I the lower volume setting is just right.  I like that I am not attached by a wire to my smartphone.  Recently, I have begun using these with my new computer which has Bluetooth.  I am enjoying these earbuds.  I just wish I had a better connection to my smartphone while walking.  I don't know where the fault lies."
1,Great sound quality. Easy to use. Fast shipping.
1,It's so nice not to be tethered to a device with the headset.  This is convenient and sounds great!  Love 'em!
1,"Pros- Great sound and battery life<br />Cons- they seem to collect moisture in your ear after awhile.  Noise Cancelling should not be listed as a feature, as the only noise they cancel is due to the plug being in your ear muffling sounds- but not a big deal cause who expects these to cancel noise.<br />Unknowns-  waterproof?  never got them wet other then sweat from workouts."
0,"I’ve ordered this product twice. I ordered the first set two years ago. They lasted two years, and I have nothing bad to say about them. They had great sound and microphone, great battery, and fit well around the ears. I recently ordered a second set since the original set topped working, and the quality is terrible. The microphone is not effective, the ear pieces feel cheap (the original set were a nice gauge rubber that felt substantial), and the plastic used feels very cheap. Overall, a tremendous downgrade from past products and incredibly disappointing."
1,"I would buy them again...and almost had to. I had them for two months, took one out and it broke apart. They weren't eligible for return through Amazon so I thought I might have to buy them again but then I noticed that they had a one year defect warranty. I contacted the main company's support team and within a day, they sent a replacement. They were very nice and the replacement process was smooth.<br />About the headphones: I love how noise-cancelling these headphones are. I wear them on planes and I don't hear any external noise.<br />I go straight from the workout to the shower with them. I don't run them under the water or anything but a little splash doesn't seem to damage them.<br />I'm a short distance jogger and they stay in my ears.<br /> They are comfortable too. I wear them for hours at a time and I have even slept in them before.<br />I didn't want to spend the money to buy them again but I would :)"
0,My husband loved these and said they were the most comfortable headphones he'd ever worn.  Unfortunately they quit working after only 5 weeks of gentle use during his dialysis treatments. So disappointed!
1,"I have had a set for a while now, I liked them so much I bought some for my girlfriend."
1,Best Headphones I've ever owned!
1,"Giving these a 4 only because I haven't had them long enough. So far I love the fit, sound, feel. Very good set of headphones"
1,"These headphones do not fit my ears. The loops  that go over top of the ear are easy to big. My previous Bluetooth headphones had multiple sizes of ear wraps, as well as the plugs. These would also benefit from that.<br /><br />That being said, they are light enough that they stay in anyway. They work great,  despite being the wrong size."
0,"Only giving it 1-star because it works when you aren't moving. If you are wanting to sit on the couch and listen to the game, these are good. On the flip side, if you want to do any time of movement, such as running or biking, DO NOT BUY THESE. They cut in and out constantly. You can't even hear the music. Better off spending for money for quality ones than these, the ones Amazon Suggested. Not worth you wasting money. I am going to return them and get my money back."
1,They're everything I ever wanted. I would have given 5 stars but the thing that goes behind your ear is a little too loseriously for my liking. I'd rather it be a little tighter.
0,i recentely purchased senso.to replace  wireless ones that my dog ate.. However I had ulko prior.Senso plugs do NOT STAY IN MY ear walking let alone running..You would think the flexability around the ear would be an advantage.IT IS NOT!<br />It is a major disadvantage and im very disatisfide.i will be giving this product a poor rating due this.
1,"Love love love these headphones..Just what I was looking for. I had to order another pair for my Husband.  Great quality on sound, perfect fit, and I love that you can use it to make phone calls. I can control just a touch of a button with having to stop my workout to answer a call.  Awesome! I highly recommend this product. Great price, great quality. I give it 10 stars if I could. Great job SENSO!"
1,"Great bluetooth headphones that compete very well with very expensive competitor name brands. The battery seems to last about 6-8 hrs depending on how loud, how often you change songs, or use the other features. It's not crazy impressive, but it's good enough to last about an hour session at the gym all week."
1,"I bought these for my wife's birthday. She was very pleased with the ease of use and the ability to connect with two devices at same time. She consistently got 8 to 9 hours of use per charge and full charge took less than 2 hours.<br /><br />Unfortunately, after 5 months of steady use the headphones lost the ability to charge. We contacted Senso customer service and were pleasantly surprised by the truly 5 star customer service. The support team responded within an hour. They were courteous, professional, and provided troubleshooting steps in a clear manner that was easy to follow. When it was apparent that recalibration would not solve the issue they arranged for replacement headphones to be shipped. The whole process, from our initial contact to receiving order information on replacement headphones, was completed in less than 5 hours and this was on a Sunday! We received the new headphones 4 days later.<br /><br />We have recommended the headphones to other family members who have not had any issues and even with the charging issue we still feel comfortable recommending them to others, especially since we know the quality of care the company puts behind their product."
1,"These are perfect for the gym.  I use the foam earbud pads that come in the set.  They stayed in my ears perfectly during a rough workout. I was surprised to find by pushing the button on the right earbud you can cycle thru the last number dialed, the music on your device and another Bluetooth option.  I’m very glad that I got these and not another set!"
1,The headphones are very comfortable and they have a very long battery life.
1,"I used these headphones when jogging 2-3 times per week for about 10 months and they worked great.  Then one day they just wouldn't turn on. I had a lot going on personally at the time and didn't get around to checking on the warranty until it was literally 363 days after I'd purchased them.  I emailed Senso to tell them the issue and got a pretty quick response back with a troubleshooting tip to try.  If that had worked, I would have been happy with that, but it didn't work for me, which I told them (through email) and they are sending me a new pair, no more questions. Totally standing by the one-year warranty.  If you're thinking about getting these, I would recommend it. Hopefully you won't have issues, but if you do (within one year) you have nothing to lose as the customer service is great!"
1,Sounds good. Feels good. Great case. Wonderful battery life. Comes with these sweet memory foam type ear pieces as well. They don't come out of my ears. Buy these. Oh and impressive bass as well.
1,Great purchase
1,"Good sound; good battery life; not as easy as it should be to put on, although not bad; comfortable, although if worn for a prolonged period it could get a sore; excellent price; very good quality. So far it's a winner."
0,The good - very good sound for rhe price.<br /><br />The bad - these drop out frequently. Very disappointed. The bluetooth connection is simply is too unstable.
1,"Delivered quickly, well packaged.  good sound and comfortable,<br /><br />Had a problem with one channel cutting out after about 6 months of use (I am hard on headphones).  SENSO's customer service was above and beyond all my expectations.  **Highly recommended**"
1,I have had the Wireless beats by Dre for a couple years and wanted to test out these.  Great for the price but the sound quality is just not the same as a more expensive pair.<br /><br />Also forgot about the battery low issue.  On my Iphone it shows you the battery percentage of the wireless device connected.  So anywhere from 30-50% battery life it starts saying &#34;battery low&#34; in the headphones. With 30-50% charge left it says this over and over and over...
1,Sound great!
1,"I've had these headphones for about a week. They are comfortable, have very good sound quality and quickly connect to both my phone and to my computer. They are just as advertised."
0,Devices on each ear are too big and the advertised noise cancelling feature is nothing more then just good earplugs with sound.  I just took these with me on a flight and tried them out.  NO NOISE CANCELLING!!  I'm so glad I brought my Sony Headphones (noise cancelling) with me so I didn't have to listen to the whine of the jet engines.  Thank you Sony!!  Returning these.
1,These earbuds are amazing! I’ve owned them since nov 2016 and never had one problem. I’ve recently purchased beats studio 3 over ear headphones and Powerbeats 3 earbuds and these blow both of them away. These have better bass way more volume and just plain sound better in every way. They are way more comfy than either of those. I also paid 377 dollars for Bose quiet comfort qc 35 II and those made my ears extremely hot after 30 mins and put pressure on your head. These 30 dollar ear buds blow all of them away in every way. I only have to charge em once a week also. I’ve never had any connection issues once. As soon as you turn them on their connected instantly. The Powerbeats 3 I had to reconnect everytime I turned them on and off even tho I use Apple phone and they have that Apple chip. If you want some great sounding buds n wanna save a ton of money I’d but these. They came with so many accessories and a way better case than the 200 dollar Powerbeats also I could go on forever but trust me I know what I’m talking about. The Powerbeats 3 buds had not enough volume or bass these blow them out the water!
1,I really enjoy using the Senso ActivBuds. I had been using the Senso ActivBuds S-250 for about two months when the right microphone stopped working. I contacted customer support after hours and received immediate feedback on how to fix the problem. I was not able to fix the problem so a replacement was immediately shipped to me. I am so impressed with Senso's fast response and willingness to honor the one-year warranty. I recommend the ActivBuds not just for quality and great performance but a responsive customer service team. Thank you Senso.
1,Had these for six months now and have a problem. Very static yin left ear and will shut off if the cord is flexed. Called customer service and told the issues. Sent me a new pair couple of days later. Very happy with my experience
1,Great Product
1,Very comfortable and great sound. Excellent for work outs.
1,"Just did my first workout with these headphones. The sound quality is great, and they really do block out a lot of background noise. The earpieces are comfortable, and did not bounce around or move throughout my workout.<br /><br />Comes with its own carrying case as well as car charger which is perfect for charging on the way to the gym. The charger also connects to USB, so it can be plugged into a cube and charged on the wall as well.<br /><br />Overall great product so far, no real complaints. Although I'm not a huge fan of the over the ear piece, but only because I don't like the look of anything over the ear. The piece itself is very flexible and much more comfortable than other in the ear headphones that have over the ear pieces like this. Helps to keep headphones in place, and does not irritate after a while of being in place.<br /><br />Would recommend!"
0,The sound is not clear and almost everytime there is a problem with bluetooth connection.
1,"I liked everything about these, with the exception of the part which fits over the ear. It's uncomfortable and doesn't stay hooked on the ear, allowing the buds to come out. Otherwise, the quality of them is very good.  I hated to give it a 3 rating, but if they don't stay in your ear. . ."
1,"I Bought a pair for my tweenie daughter and niece for Christmas after reading all the good reviews.  I was looking for good quality buds at a reasonable price. I hope these are it.. Giving it 3 stars for packaging, for now."
1,"Y'all I HATE ear buds, seriously, I'm 29 and have never owned a pair because they all feel too big and bulky for my ears. But...I LOVE these ones! I can't believe I actually like them and they fit!"
1,"Major Value!!  Really nice protective packaging. Charged, paired and connected with no problem whatsoever.  Instructions specific, clear and easy to implement.  Sound quality even better than I had hoped.  Very pleased with this purchase."
1,Really comfortable and stays on with extreme exercising sound is what you would expect ok
0,"The main issue I am having with these earbuds is the L and R printed on the side of the earbuds is extremely small.  Even with reading glasses and a magnifying glass, the letters are just too small.  The area available for the L and R is large, but they chose to only use 1% of that area.  Not sure why, but it makes the product difficult to use."
0,Poor sound .. I am not sure how the other  reviewer's are reading this high. The sound is poor quality and doesn't have the bass or treble. They do have good packaging and comes with lots of accessories. If you're not interested in good sound. This is a good headset for you
0,Sounded ok - then all of a sudden the power button broke. Now they're in the garbage.
1,"they are amazing.  Sound is great.  Love the feel, not too bulky and very comfortable.  my only regret is not getting them sooner.  Buy them now, thank me later!"
1,These are excellent! Better than the big priced earbuds
1,"Wow. I really love these. I wear glasses and they fit comfortably with them. Oh and bonus items came with it.<br />They have a great volume to them. Although the person next you may hear your music if it’s fairly quiet, if you bump your music like I do and turn it all the way up.<br />Wear test: comfortable, and I bounced around and they didn’t come off easy!"
0,They were great while they lasted. Stopped working after 3 weeks ! Won't charge or anything!!!!
1,Way cheaper than Bose or ipods! And Sound as Good 👍
1,Awesome sound!
0,"They stay in just fine while jogging or lifting weights. However, the hooks don't hold the earbuds in, the actual earbuds hold themselves in. I doubt they'll stay in for everyone because I the size of peoples' ears are different. They also hurt after about a half hour or so of listening.<br /><br />I'd be fine with all this, but for the fact that the sound cuts out if there is too much movement (such as jogging). What's the point of getting these to work out with if they cut out with movement? I definitely do not recommend, and am in the process of returning them. I give two stars because, if you stay still enough, they don't sound bad."
1,"I recommend it ! Finally, I found an excellent headphone and it is a reasonable price."
0,Would not stay on. We're bulky. Also kept shutting down my kindle which I've used bluetooth headphones on before with no problems.
1,Really good headphones but some static when talking on the phone with them
1,"Excellent headphones, they work great. Had to edit right ear bud stopped working after three months. Excellent customer service new pair sent out right away."
1,Love these! Excellent headphones!
1,"Excellent, I was surprised of the quality of the active buds but also the entire package presentation. It was followed up by an email from the supplier which to me not only a great customer experience but standing behind their product. Very happy!"
1,"These earphones are exactly what I was looking for! Extremely light, the sound is perfect, they won't fall off during training and the price is right. I've been using them for a couple of weeks now and I'm really satisfied!"
0,I know reviews for this product are great but I myself have had many connectivity issues with this product. It is very hard to connect it to multiple devices and there is interference when connected to multiple devices. I did not expect it to have same performance and stability as some of the high end headphones but I think connectivity issues I’m facing are basic Bluetooth 101.<br /><br />It could very well be that I received a defective unit
1,had a small problem but the support group was very helpful and knowledgeable the headphones are good with good sound.
0,"I was really exited about these..I'm an audiophile..love my music<br />I listen to music in the shower but live in an apartment complex so I worry bout bothering my neighbors...<br />if you want these for listening in the shower you better have your blue tooth source about 3 feet away<br />as soon as it gets wet...PPPPPPPPPPPP<br />constant disconnections and blips<br />just to let you know..I have a top of the line blue tooth extender too<br />and a set of Tranya bt ear buds that ABSOLUTELY ROCK!!!!<br />sound great and I can go across the hall and do my laundry and go completely out of the building to get my mail and they still stay 90% connected<br />don't get me wrong...for workin out,maybe rain...ok<br />but takin a shower with em,,,,not so much<br />I'm hopin Tranya will come out with a ""shower""set<br />P.S.<br />the whole ""shower"" thing isn't advanced enough yet so beware<br />I bought a set of<br />True Wireless Earbuds xFyro xS2 Bluetooth Headphones Microphone IPX7 Waterproof<br />they were even worse<br />so the both of them will sit up in the top of my closet doin nothin<br />just beware and give the shower thing a little more time to tweak<br />good luck<br />good life"
0,"I finally decided to try the cord free life, and this was my first stop on the journey.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Comes with nice case and a bunch of different size earbuds<br />-Also includes magnetic adapters for all kinds of things<br />-Pairing is very easy<br />-Controls work well, even with two features using the same buttons (volume and track skip are the same buttons either pressed or held)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Had what I can only describe as syncing issues. The audio would sometimes cut to silence, and then suddenly play back the missing few seconds at super speed to catch up to the phone. I have plenty of other bluetooth speakers that my phone and apps pair with flawlessly, so I can only conclude it's an issue with the headphones. Seems to be once every 2-5 minutes while listening.<br />-This is something I never thought to look out for, but the control boxes are so boxy that you can hear even a slight breeze whipping around them. It's loud enough to make it hard to hear the sound coming from the headphones! Seriously, I don't know what's up with that.<br />-My ears are really small and a not properly shaped, so getting the headphones to sit properly and comfortably was an issue.<br /><br />After a few days of trying to acclimate to this pair of headphones I have to give up. I will be returning these to try a different style"
1,Great sound and quality. Very impressed. Only thing that needs work is the ear clips. They are loose and slide around. If the ear straps were smaller the earphones would be a 5 star
1,I love them
1,These are an excellent addition to our workouts.  I also use these under a pair of ear protection and they work fine.
0,"WARNING! These earphones are being marketed as useful during physical activity.  They might be, if your ears fit the earphone perfectly.  They do not fit me at all.  There is no way to secure them to my ears because the ear hook is too large and flimsy.  It is not adjustable.  How they managed to get so many positive reviews is bewildering to me.  There must be a lot of couch potatoes buying these things.  They're fine, if you don't move while wearing.  Unless your workout regimen consists of sitting in a recliner while wiggling your toes, be prepared to be disappointed, if your ears don't fit these things perfectly."
1,Comfortable and clear listening to your favorite playlist
1,"The sounds quality is great.  The only thing that I am not fond of is the fact that they do NOT fit my ears.  If I were the manufacturer, I would at least make a pair that targets female ears, or add an adjustable ear holder.  Otherwise, it is easy to charge, setup, and connect to my iPhone.  I would buy again as a present to someone with big ears for sure."
1,"I use my Senso wireless headphones while working out and stay put and provide clear, crisp sound. They're easy to use while wearing."
1,So I haven't use them much but from what I've used them the quality is good the build quality  good packaging is good they're very user-friendly in the sound quality seems great so I'm all for that price I'm very happy with them
1,These were Christmas gifts to my adult children who are runners! I haven't used them myself but I've watched and inquired. They were easy to set up to phone. They are perfect for running and work great!
1,No auto shut off. stupid thing turned back on after i fully charged it and placed it on my night stand only for it to fully drain and stay on all night. the best part is finding out at the gym after taking a preworkout. So mad.
1,"Excellent headphones for the price, really impressive sound. This is 2nd pair, first had one ear stop working after a year - still worth it"
1,Got it today. Sound is amazing. Thankyou for a good product.
1,Great headphones.  I already used them at gym and there excellent.  It has hardly any inner echo . What I mean is like hearing ur heart beat or when u move them around u hear all the inner movement in ear. 1 important thing is u need to use ur music players eq to adjust sound quality.  If not everything will sound flat. Great way to save money and still have good sounding product. The scale of 1 to 10 . I give a 7..
0,"This product is a cheaply made knock off from what the Beats are supposed to be.  When I received the headphones, quality issues were immediately noticed.  The plastics are cheap and the headphones start falling apart as soon as you start touching them.  The bluetooth connected right away and I was able to hear music.  The sound quality is extrememly poor.  Huge amount of distorted bass and very little mids and lows.  Sending the item back ASAP."
1,Received the headphones very quick and loved them right away. They work great and well worth the money. Love the case and dual charger too. Great product for the money and would recommend to anyone looking for wireless headphones that are affordable.
1,"The sound quality is pretty good but the headphones keep falling off. I am using the smallest ear piece and they are still not staying in while excercising. However, I've discovered if I use the headband, they will stay put. I will give them a try since I do not want to spend a couple of hundred dollars on Beats!"
0,I just received these today and noticed I am missing the &#34;wire tie.&#34; A little disappointing but apparently I'm not the first that was missing it. The headphones took awhile to connect to my S7 which was odd. They sound good let's see how they hold up tomorrow.
0,"I have purchased 2 pairs of these thinking that the malfunction in the first pair was maybe a coincidence. I purchased the 2nd and within 6 weeks they stopped working while charging over night. No sound, no charge light just dead. Fool me twice shame on me. If anyone actually reads these, as a courtesy I'd like at least my money back, or even a 3rd pair to prove that the product isn't a waste of money."
1,"Not bad for the price, but has a metallic sound, fits well."
0,"If you're an active user and choose to run or bike ride with these, the wind is what you'll hear most. It's overpowering the music almost 100% of the time. Also the battery life is great, but when it came time to charge my headphones, it wouldn't charge. Now it is past the return date with no juice. They are basically now heavy ear plugs"
0,They don’t seem to stay connected to my iPhone 7plus. Not what I was expecting in head phones.
1,Great sound. Fits great on my ears.
1,Great product
0,"I am so disappointed in these! Sound was great, loved the wireless.. have rarely used these and they no longer charge.. bought a new charger.. nothing! Guess the price was too good to be true!!"
0,"The hooks over the ears are too floppy and large for me, they do not stay in my ears.  In particular my right ear, and I'm not sure if it is because of the mechanics in that side making it slightly heavier; but it will not stay in my ear.  I have tried all the sizes of buds.  Outside of that, connecting was easy, and they play music with decent quality."
1,"I work out in noisy gyms and walk near noisy traffic. These are my first Bluetooth headphones. They paired right away, sound great, overcome the noise, the battery lasts . . . Great deal, especially for the price"
1,"[[VIDEOID:42e5c45aff743ad02868d3c448366c21]] [[VIDEOID:8f18b152964df1cc08174464c68b9298]] Best of the best.<br />Perfect, quality of sound is superb.<br />Bass are great.<br /><br />Best feature to me: they can be used on multiple devices with no need of re-pairing all the time.<br /><br />I think it takes a while to accomodate them in the ears, but this was a great purchase.<br /><br />Watch my video to realize how strong is the output from these headphones.<br /><br />Update<br />They don't work when running outside, background noise and interruption while working out in the open air. I am not sure if this is due to the fact that I also have the Fitbit charge using the Bluetooth. I will disconnect it on my next run and see if the situation improves and let you guys know."
1,"Good for exercising  , sweat resistant, relativly stable.<br />Produces some static when not playing"
1,Great sound and are very comfortable on my ear.
1,Bien
1,Amazing product with good quality sound. Very apt for exercise and also for regular use. The greatest thing to sci can pair two devices. Certainly this product has an edge over similar products in its sturdiness and design. The company was also promt in attending to queries.
1,"I really loved this product until the charging light would not illuminate upon plugging it in to charge.  Of course, if the product doesn't charge, it doesn't matter how good of a sound or length of battery life the product has."
1,The sound is good quality and the battery holds a charge well.  Better than expected quality for the price paid.
1,Wife loves them sound great work perfectly
0,On/off switch failed after a week and I couldn't turn the unit on.
1,"I LOVE 'EM! Great sound, nice and high like I like it, no booming bass but that's okay and I recommend these 'phones for audiophiles like me who want to hear nice CLEAR sound without that overwhelming bass sound I've found in many of today's 'phones. Fit is excellent, the ear hooks bend easily and fit perfectly and are very comfortable., the extra ear pads included help to customize the fit. The 'phones charge up quickly and last a good, long time! Linking with my phone via Bluetooth is easy. I think these SENSO 'phones are the best I've had!"
0,"The construction of them seem fine but if i have the phone on the left side of my body, the connection keeps cutting in and out.  Also, I got these primarily to run in but there's so much wind noise coming in around them that it becomes distracting."
1,We just received the earbuds this week and have used them at the gym.  They sound good and I love how I don't have to constantly reposition the buds in my ear like my previous ones.  No wires to fuss with!  So far so good!  :)
1,Everything went smoothly. Got them when promised. Great sound!
1,Great Bluetooth earbuds at a very reasonable price.  Purchased them a couple of weeks ago and been happy with the sound quality and battery life.
1,"Bought these headphones in December 2018. They are good quality for the price. They didn't fit me great, but ears are weird, so not too big a deal. They just crapped out on me last month; one of the ear buds stopped working, so I only get audio through the right side. I give them a 3 because they were good while they lasted, but I had hoped they would last longer. Then again, for the cost, maybe 2.5 years is as good as one should expect."
1,works very well and for a good price too!
1,Had them 1 day now and I have used them out in the garden listening to an audio book.  Also watched youtube and my husband sitting next to me did not even know I was watching anything.  So far I am enjoying them.
0,"Sound quality is good, but the bluetooth constantly loses connection for no reason on multiple devices, literally when the device is in your hand. If you raise your arms over the head, like doing pull ups at the gym, connection is gone. Not only does the connection to the bluetooth go out, sometimes the headphones turn off completely. If I could give 1 star I would. This problem began about 3-4 months ago. It would be nice if a full refund could be issued, because I'd expect headphones to last for more than 9 months."
1,"Great product, great fidelity. Connects quickly and is comfortable to wear. It charges fast and battery life meets or exceeds the advertise charge life."
1,I love them. They fit perfectly and include several size ear pieces for that perfect fit. Syncing the Bluetooth is very simple.<br />They are great
1,These buds are great. They fit well and were very easy to pair. Sound quality is better than expected.
1,Works great.
1,"Fantastic for the money! I have cycled through several bluetooth earbuds in the $40-ish price range. One with solid neck bar which remained in position OK, but was very tinny sound. Another had large control on connecting cable which caused ear bud to pull out due to control's weight. Sound was also sub-par for that unit. This unit stays in place and the sound is as good as any ear buds I've had short of some wired Bose earbuds of several years ago. They stay in place, have good range with even sound, Highs are a bit lacking, but I attribute that to bluetooth range. Quite a good set of buds for the money.<br /><br />Update: above review based on pairing with iPhone 5S. Just paired these with laptop (Asus Ultrabook) and sound is much richer! Even using cheapo bluetooth micro adapter. Way pleased with these. Highly recommended!"
1,"I purchased these a few weeks ago and paired them with my IPod and went for a walk..the kept cutting in and out so I called customer service.  The gentleman had my do a factory reset and pair them again.  Second run, same thing...so I called again. That gentleman confirmed my purchase not sure where this going, he said I should have a new pair with 7 business days, I asked where I should return to other pair to he said to just keep them, totally didn't see that coming...even though they don't work properly I would think they'd want them back.<br />Just received the replacement pair today, fingers crossed they don't cut in and out. Beyond that they are great for running, working out,etc.  Lastly the customer service was excellent!"
1,Wow.. this is my first ActivBuds to own. and to be honest the sound is the best and so  incredible to hear. And not to mention the affordability and kquality of this product. I will definitely buy one more to keep and additional one for my wife. I'm giving this a five star review due to my personal experience.
1,Great head phones but do read the manuel first.
0,"After having this headset for just under two months, I couldn’t stand and take the quality of it. I had read reviews and actually believed what I read. When I ordered I realized I had ordered 7 years ago and believed they improved in quality. Boy I was wrong!!! Never again. I decided to be Beats headset that are known for the quality. I guess you get what you pay for. Really disappointed. I was truly hoping they were going to be good."
1,"Good fit, good sound, easy setup, good price.  Can't beat it."
0,"Terrible sound.  Much worse than the similarly priced Plantronics single-ear unit I was replacing, solely because it repeatedly disconnected itself.  Can't send back because 'god-awful sound' isn't among the reasons Amazon will let me return it."
1,These bluetooth headphones work great. Wonderful sound and easy to wear for a long time. Lightweight yet sturdy.
1,Much better than anticipated
1,I love these headphones ! Easy to use love the sound and also the design on them.
1,"I like these ear buds, they have good sound, stay in place while working out, are comfortable to wear, and are priced very fairly. I own quite a few headphones and ear buds, although I don't own the beats wireless ear buds, so I can't compare them. A number of reviews have compared them so I'll just I am happy with these. They are better looking and fit better than other wireless buds I have. Nice for working out, going for walks and office wear. Especially for the price you can't go wrong."
0,"I've had these for three months and they die at 30% battery, so the battery life is lacking. They also hurt my ears if I wear for more than 30 mins at a time. I wouldn't get these again, a complete waste of money."
0,"Sound quality while playing is decent, and they are comfortable to wear, but like others have experienced, there is a CONSTANT high pitched buzzing very noticeable in the left ear, I guess from the active Bluetooth connection... it continues to buzz for about 5-10 seconds after pausing a song.  I can't remotely listen to anything with quiet nuances because the buzzing is incessant and overshadows it.  Cannot recommend these."
1,"These things are so nice, no more cord getting in my way when im working or doing house-work. Sound is very good, doesnt fall out of my ears when im running. Only problem im having on my Note 5 is that sometimes when my phone is in my back-pocket the signal drops (mainly when i was hiking / kneeling down ever)"
1,Excellent. Great purchase for the money.
1,These are great!!!
1,"Wow. Where did these come from? These buds are absolutely amazing, truly. I've never heard anything like how these sound, even from $400 over the ear headphones. Amazing buds, amazing deal."
1,Thank you very much 5*****
1,"Sound quality good, not enough treble.  I don’t like the fixed earpieces, the loops are too large."
1,excellent product and  good price
1,A very good pair of ear buds for the price. Has great sound quality and battery life last a really long time.
1,Just started using them tonight. So far very impressed. Relatively comfortable with long wearing. Great sound quality. So far good battery life.
1,Great value for money
0,Worked for 30 days and then the right side quit and the left side is super faint!
1,"Decent headphones, not much noise reduction however."
0,"I bought this headphones back in january and they were great, but now, less than a year after I bought them they have become useless. They dont recharge anymore thus I can't use them."
1,Wow. nice for the $$$
0,Sounds like mud. There's little more to be said except that you can't hear much detail at all in these. Returning these immediately.
0,I bought the product about 2 months ago and all of a sudden it stopped linking to my phone. I have tried all the troubleshooting tips they mentioned in the guide but nothing seems to work.
1,"Overall, I’m happy with the purchase.  The one con is that there’s very little warning when the battery is about to die- about 3 minutes."
1,Great product! Easy to set up and use. Really great Value!
1,The Bluetooth took multiple tries of disconnecting and reconnecting to get sound to come through the earbuds. The charge held for about 8 hours of continuous use with a full nights charge. Calls sounded distant through the microphone.
1,Love these headphones! The sound is crisp and you can't beat the price for the packaging and extras included. Would highly recommend.
1,"My old pair of Bluetooth headphones were struggling to pair with my phone, so I figured I'd give these a try.<br />Pros: decent battery life, sync instantly, sound quality is above average, comfortable, stay on my ears.<br />Cons: if you want the sound reduction,  you have to jam them in your ears like you would with ear plugs,  which isn't my favorite procedure.<br />Over all I'd say they have met all my expectations, and I'm a happy customer."
1,"PROS<br /><br />I used the headphones while jumping rope, lifting weights, and running on the treadmill, and on the train. I sweat a lot during workouts and had no issues with it slipping off. Can’t hear background noises on the train<br /><br /> I’ve only been using the headphones for two days but so far so good. The headphones are also light weight.<br /><br />Carrying case is genius<br /><br />CON<br /><br />You are able to talk on the phone but my friends heard an echo or a lot of background noise.<br /><br />Some of the songs I listened too off of Apple Music had better quality than others."
1,Sound good ! Wanted to get some and see for myself. Will be ordering some more for Christmas presents !
1,The work well for the money
1,"These are the best ear buds I've ever purchased! Very comfortable, don't move or get loose in your ears and don't end up hurting. Sound quality is very good as well. I lost my first pair and immediately proceeded to buy a replacement set."
1,Went to ear buds with these and I am pleased with fit. They also have a pretty good sound.
1,These earbuds are great! They have excellent bass response and good treble tones.  I find these easy to use and work well with my Android phone.  The zippered storage container is a perfect size and works well. Would buy again!
1,These work well but have a limited range. You need to be somewhat close in proximity to your device when streaming. Comfortable with all different earpiece shape and sizes to fit a range of ears.
1,Most comfortable in-ear headphones I've ever had. Sound is great too.
0,"These headphones seemed pretty solid.  Got them as a Christmas gift for my husband.  Now, after less than 3 months of use, they are no longer taking a charge, making them totally unusable.  I just contacted customer support at the manufacturer.  We will see how good their support is, then I will update and revise star rating appropriately."
1,Not good for working out. Almost terrible for running. They'll get you by in a pinch though. And they won't tell you there out of battery until they're 30 seconds from dead
0,the headphones are ok but the microphones didn't work right out of the box. I had actually bought another set a few months ago and the exact same thing happened. I think the microphone set up is quite poor.
1,Exactly what I was looking for.  They sound great.
0,"It worked well for 10 months or something. Then, first you will see minor problems like button for playing next song is not working. So for few months you will use phone to change song. You will feel its a minor fault and still be happy about it. Then, after few months around a year of buying, you will find now the volume is low. You will think, may be it was not charged well. Next time you charge well and viola volume is back to normal. Now after a year of buying, the volume will be permanently lower and the next song button not working. So, you will have to buy a new one now. Throw the junk, create more electronic garbage every year for lovely planet earth and again you are back to buying another one. May be they want to convey this is what you get in $30.<br /><br />Lesson: Good product if you want to put $30 every year. Or else buy a warranty and keep sending it back and forth. Basically, no peace for someone who wants to use only 1 hour of his day, 4 times a week during workout. I had higher hopes from it as I went for little more expensive one than many other cheaper products that were available. But now I regret my decision. I wouldn't buy it if its available even for $10 now."
1,"I like these -- when they work.  Too often I can't get them to connect.  Sometimes turning off the Bluetooth on my device and turning it back on will allow a connection, but not always.  I can't tell if maybe the connection issues get worse if the battery charge is low.  Speaking of the battery charge, it will drain just sitting and powered OFF.  I fully charged them, and then unplugged them from the charger but didn't use them for several days.  When I went to use them they were pretty much dead.  I really don't want to leave them plugged in all the time, as I've heard that's not good for the battery, so I feel a bit screwed.  Finally, when they are working, I occasionally get some static or crackling through them.<br />UPDATE:  I have already heard back from customer support.  Impressive--this alone made me give them an additional star.  They asked me to do a factory reset.  I will do that and test things out for awhile.  For now, I rebooted my computer and eventually was able to connect and I'm listening to music now.  I have to say, when these things work they are truly AWESOME.  I hope the factory reset fixes my issues.  But if not, I feel confident that they will replace them with no hassle."
1,"Great value, great product. I hated ear buds but these have change my mind.  I love all the features."
1,Dre Beats who?!! Lol best wireless I’ve bought !! Definitely want to invest in a back up pair just in case ... I tent to misplace then since they are so small !! He sound quality is amazing and LOUD!! They stay in your ears and is very durable to sweat and any other moisture!!
1,Excellent for the price. I wish they were a little tighter on the ear but they suffice and I weight train and cardio very intensely with them.
1,"Excellent sound quality, easy pairing, and every accessory included (what a plus). I’m very particular with headphones, having paid $100+ - these are as good, if not better. I’m buying another!"""
1,"Sound quality was good for music, but the call quality on these are subpar. The person on the other end of the call couldn't hear me well because these earphones have an integrated mic on the ear piece. People I've talked to complained about it sounding like I was really far away from the mic. I also could hear a little static feedback in the background while I was in call."
0,Battery died and wouldn't charge anymore
0,Sound quality is great. Only had it a month and headphone on one side keeps going in and out
1,best bluetooth  headphone ever had
1,Great sound. Deep powerful bass.
1,"Work pretty good, and quality is clean"
0,"I bought 3 sets of these for our family vacation. 2 work great.  The third set works only as long as the phone it’s paired to is right next to me.  Even if you turn around, the music cuts out.  I’m very disappointed with this."
1,"So far so good. I use them for about four and a half hours straight yesterday and they worked just fine. I was in a loud arena there were times that the noise inside the arena was a bit too much for the headphones to overcome, even at full volume.  But for the most part they worked great. I answered a phone call with them and even with the loud noise the caller could still hear me. I believe as long as they keep working at this level they will be well worth the price."
1,"Bought these for my wife for Christmas.  She really likes them.  The charge last about a week while using them about 1 hour a day, 5 days a week."
1,purchased to use while working out.  Did not disappoint.  Excellent quality & quick delivery
1,Great head phones. They work better than the expensive brands. Also great customer service when needed!
0,"I ordered 2 sets of these headphones and both have the same problem.  No matter who I'm speaking to and what type of phone they are on (mobile, landline) they hear an echo of themselves when speaking to me.  Everything sounds fine on my end, but they hear a very frustrating echo.  I have emailed the company directly regarding this issue, but this might be why they were originally over $150 and are now selling for less than $40.  They work fine as headphones as long as you don't plan to make a phone call using them, which is the only reason I gave them 2 stars instead of 1.<br /><br />Hope they can fix this issue, although from looking online it doesn't look promising."
1,Very nice for the $$$!  My husband broke his Apple Ear Buds and bought these as a replacement. The audio is much better than the Apple EarBuds.
0,"I first synced the set to my iphone and loved them.  Used them twice and then tried to sync to my new Bose stereo in frontroom - would not work.  My husband then tried to sync to his iphone and they would not sync. I removed from my phone and tried the Bose and 2nd iphone again, still would not work. When I tried to sync to my iphone a second time it would not work.  I checked to make sure they were fully charged and tried the steps several times.  I never was able to get them to work again. I know how to use bluetooth sync and have other devices that sync - so I do not believe it was my problem - just a defective pair. Too much time passed for me to return them - very disappointed."
1,I love these headphones. They fit nicely in my ear and the sound quality is wonderful. I would definitely recommend these. Great price too!
0,Stopped working after four months.
0,Junk. Died after a month
1,I had a problem with the unit powering up after a couple of months and the customer support team quickly found a solution.
1,I am blown away by this product. For the price it is deceiving but This Bluetooth headset is outstanding. Excellent sound quality good bass. Battery lasts for a long time and automatically pairs with my phone. Great packaging and fun little free accessories that they throw in. I bought a set of beats for 120 bucks and returned them to get another pair of these.  I did a side-by-side comparison on sound quality and full rich bass and I was amazed that the Dr. Dre beats we’re not nearly as good.  I even bought two pairs of the sensos this Bluetooth headset is outstanding. Excellent sound quality good Bass. Battery lasts for a long time and I medically pairs with my phone. Great packaging and find little free accessories that they throw in. I bought a set of beats for 120 bucks and return them to get another pair of these. I even bought two pairs of the senso to have a spare.
1,"Excelente sonido y durabilidad, a quien los regale lleva 3 año con ellos y vive feliz en la calidad y en la durabilidad, es un buen regalo para navidad. Salieron tan buenos que acabo de comprar unos para mi. Espero que salgan igual de buenos a los que regale."
1,"UPDATE:<br />1/9/18<br /><br />I bought another pair (my 3rd) for my wife to use in the gym. They arrived and I find that this unit has a very poorly made USB port cover which is much smaller and flimsy compared to my earlier pairs. It's almost impossible to open the port door with your fingernail and given the force required this door will tear away soon exposing the port to damage. I contacted the company and they made an unclear statement about a design update (hmmm, updates usually improve a product) and suggested I send the headphones back to Amazon for a refund. Not terribly helpful, could have figured that out on my own...expected the company to make it right.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm a bit disappointed...there may be a reduction in quality with these newly designed models. I've reduced my rating to 4 stars.<br /><br />ORIGINAL POST:<br /><br />I have a pair of Klipsch as well as a pair of Bose earphones I use. I paid more than 3 times as much for the Bose then l paid for this SENSO brand. The sound on these SENSO's compares favorably to both the Klipsch and Bose.<br /><br />At this price point including all that comes in the box, this is an outstanding value.<br /><br />Bass response  is often weak in ear buds especially in the sub $50 range. Not these, quite frankly at times the bass is almost too much and it can muddy up the sound...overwhelming mid and higher ranges when listening to a song with a heavy bass track.  I find if I reposition them not so deeply into my ear the separation of the sound improves.<br /><br />I can easily recommend these little workhorses, you won't be disappointed."
1,"I really enjoy the product. Been using them for the past 3 years; however they tend to only last between 3-6months. I sweat alot when I run I feel like they're not as water proof as advertised. The warranty support is great, very easy to get a new pair and comes with cool accessories. overall great sound quality. Easy to setup and intuitive functionality for pausing, resuming switching songs and raising/lowering volume without ever reaching for my connected device."
0,Already one ear not working.  I've had it about a month and one ear kicked out on me.  Not only that it's bulky and annoying. Wish I had returned it sooner but wanted to give it a chance I regret this purchase.
1,Great sound and great quality. Nice cords and carry case.
1,"These have a longer battery life than some of the other bluetooth headphones, but they often don't like to pair.  It can be frustrating as, at times, you have to unpair it from another device so the new device will pair with it also.  Yet, I believe it is supposed to be able to pair with more than one device at a time.  Technically it does...it just won't work on the newest device until you unpair it from the other."
1,I love it i give it five star
1,"The main reason I got these over some others were the over-the-ear hooks, but they turned out to be flimsy and not really adjustable - just some loose silicone doodads that do nothing to keep the buds from falling out of my ear. I have big ear holes, so no buds stay in. Sound quality is mediocre, as you'd expect in this range, but fine for running."
1,Super convenient and battery life is wonderful compared to other wireless headsets
1,"Decent for what they’re worth, I bought my pair 14months ago and stoped working two days ago. they started acting funny and stopped connecting and just shutting off  after you turn them on, even when fully charged. I wouldn’t call them noise canceling they cancel about as well as any other regular ear bud."
0,"Sounded great for an hour...then it started cutting out.  I charged fully when I got it, so I don't know if it's a battery issue or a connection issue.  Really disappointed. :(<br /><br />::Update:: Tried the reset per the manufacturer's suggestion.  This time, I was cutting out within about 10 minutes.  Returning.  The sound quality is wonderful if you get one that works.  :("
1,Great sound.  Only improvement I would recommend is different sized ear pads
1,"Very good product; excellent bass tone. Take a little time and read the instructions! Otherwise, it might take a bit of time to set up the headphones - I know from experience. You won't be disappointed with this purchase. Not being tied to an iPhone via regular earbuds is a real treat."
1,Awesome
1,"I love these headphones! They sound great and stay in my ears very well. My only complaint is that sometimes they have issues pairing with certain devices, but that might not be an issue of the headphones."
1,"Good sound for the price. Range is about 10 to15 feet but after that the sound degrades quickly. at about 20 feet the Bluetooth disconnects. The charging cable it comes with is not the best quality so the rubber wire cover pulls away from the charging plug. not a huge deal since its a universal usb charging cable, just grab one from your standard android phone charger and you'll be alright. The sound is good and does a good job of emulating surround sound. It is a comfortable fit around the ear and a couple hours of game play later you forget you have them on... that is if they aren't blasting your ear drums cause these guys can be loud or quite and everything in between. The reason these are not 5 star is because the quality of the sound misses some lower frequency sounds that you would get from a high end headset, then again for 30 bucks the quality is sufficient. another reason for four stars is that the battery looses charge quickly when not connected to a charger. it retained power for about 3 days while off then it needed a recharge before I could use it. I use these for gaming on my laptop so to me this isn't a big deal as I just drop them on the charger once I'm done and don't usually touch them again till I am going to be playing on my laptop. any avid gamer and or music lover would probably not want these for their main headset but if your looking for portability and quality for under 50 you cant go wrong."
1,Good seller. Item descriptions are accurate.  &#34;
1,In terms of battery life and sound quality these are the best definitely recommend it for running or just listen to music on regular basis to vibe away
1,"Ok sound quality, but for some reason wnot stay firmly in place, I continuously keep reseat them."
1,Great product great service!!!
0,Bluetooth connection was very poor when active. Worked ok when seated at a desk. I returned them
1,great!
1,Very good ease of connection and sound is superb. I don’t know about battery life yet but so far I’m very impressed with these bluetooth headphones.
0,"I purchased these originally in 2017, and got four good years of heavy usage out of them. I would rate that model at least 4 stars.  When they stopped charging a few months ago, I purchased the same product. I noticed right away they were cheaper, lighter, and much lower quality.  The on/off button was a bit tricky and never worked well, and is now locked inside the unit, and will not work.  I've used these fairly lightly in the last few months, so it's really disappointing to note such a drastic change in the quality of this product.  I've ordered a different brand to replace these."
1,"I like having this wireless apparatus, but the design has some problems. The controls are all on the side of the right ear (no problem at all), but the buds don't stay quite stable in the ear. When I want to adjust the fit, it's impossible to manipulate the right-ear bud comfortably without pressing one of the control buttons, which discontinues whatever I'm listening to. Not great."
1,these are some really good earbuds for music and talking.
1,"Perfect headphones in every way, unfortunately stopping taking charge after 10 months.  Called customer service and they replacing for me!!!<br />Highly recommend!"
1,Working great very pleased with purchase. Thank you
1,They were very good to get on my devices great sound
1,The customer service is fantastic as well as the product!
1,"The se are the Best ones I've ever had. They work perfect and have a great audio quality. It was a recommendation from a friend, and I'm still thanking her for it."
1,VERY HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT THANK YOU
0,did not like it. would always fall out from your ear while running. returned it thanks
1,"I've had these for 5 months now, and they still work great. I do a lot of running, and these don't slide around or pop out. Simple design with easy to use controls. Good battery life."
1,Well let me start by saying I've only had these senso Bluetooth headphones for 3 days and I'm absolutely hooked I was just going to wear them to the gym and I end up having them in my ears for phone calls and music constantly it sounds like I have Bose speakers in my ears the bass is incredible I started with the little red earbuds and they stay in my ears just fine and I can wear these things for hours without any pain that's a five star in my book so with the quality of sound functions and hopefully durability I am so incredibly happy with these . for $35 this is a killer product... PS I like the product case cables and charger and the extra earbuds quality made if I must say so myself
0,These were Awful and didn’t even work. Returned them.
1,"I have only had ear buds in use foe a few days.<br />so far I like them fine, but will need to get back to you after I have used them in different sets of circumstances."
1,This is my second pair of these headphones. The first pair lasted about 3 years then the left earphone stared shorting out probably because I just stuff it in my gym bag. Overall I’ve been satisfied with theses therefore decided on another pair.
1,"easy to use, easy to sync, 8 hour play time, I can work, run, bike (i use them at work and for training) and they didn't cost me $150......."
0,I purchased this item in order to listen to music while doing laps in pool. Bluetooth disconnects when phone is less than 5 feet a way
1,"I have only had these headphones less than a week. I haven't worked out in them yet, but I use them nightly. So far they were very easy to pair, pretty comfortable and I have only had to charge them once. The packaging was great, they come with a case and several accessories. I would say that they are a good value for the money. I will revise my review once I have had more opportunity to use them. I received a company email with warranty details. So far great!"
1,These are great headphones that have a good lasting battery. I also think the sound quality is good. For the money you can’t beat them.
0,"I LOVED these headphones, I purchased them back on April 19, 2017 and they were so awesome. Starting July 22, 2017 they have COMPLETELY stopped working!!! They will charge and will say connected and will IMMEDIATELY disconnect.  I have tried to reconnect several times over the weekend to no avail.  I was so happy bc my ears are small and it's hard to find earbuds comfortable--so these WERE incredible.  I'll have to buy some other ones and go over all the reviewing process again of reading comments. So annoyed and disappointed."
1,They are great love them very comfortable and great sound
1,"These headphones are great! I know a lot of other people who have them and love them as well! The only issue I had was after about a year of use, they started to malfunction. When I brought this to Tekatron's attention they immediately (and I do mean within minutes) reached out to rectify the problem. They actually shipped me a replacement the same day! No one else I know has had any issues with their headphones so I am sure mine just happened to be a lemon."
1,The headset is great!  The car charger and phone charger that comes in the package are horrible!  The phone charger does not charge the phone and the car charger broke in less than a week.
1,"I highly recommend these headphones for running.  I ran with mine consistently for about 10 months, unfortunately they stopped working.  I contacted support for the default 1 year warranty and it was incredibly easy.  No hassle from support and got a new pair ASAP."
1,Outstanding quality. Very competitive price. Very high durability. Great for gym use.
0,Pros: Sound quality is great for the price range.  They fit comfortable and are perfect for any type of exercise you do.  I could not believe how great they were once I took them out and put them on.  Too good to be true.<br /><br />Cons: After less than two months of use the headphones are completely dead and won't even charge.  The LED light won't turn on.  The only charger used on the headphones was the one it came with.  I also have a pair of Jaybirds that I purchased over three years ago and they are still going strong. At the end of the day you get what you pay for.
0,The body is made of cheap plastic. The equipment came out of the plastic covering and I had to stick it with glue. This is not even after 2 months of very nominal use. Put in some more money and buy from a better brand
0,"I used it during my meetings but all of sudden mic stop working, contacted customer service they asked me to reset. But did not helpful. Thenafter they are not replying."
1,"Work great, good sound, stay in place, great price."
1,"I accidentally put these through the washer and they STILL work perfectly! Comfortable, affordable, and great sound quality"
1,The sound quality in the head phones are great and I love that it comes with three different sized buds. My only complaint is the part that wraps around the ear is rather loose on me and becomes challenging keeping them in my ears during long runs. On the other side my husband also got a pair at the same time and he's a mild runner and heavy weight lifter and he loves the head phones!
1,For 7 months I used Dime Blacks. They would not last through a 3 hour podcast. They weren't very loud and the volume would not change. Wouldn't stay in my ears if I bent over regardless of the size dome I used. So I gave these a try. What an improvement. They stay on my head no matter what. Mid volume on these is plenty loud. I've never reached the end of the battery so 5 plus hours so far. They are a very good value for a low prices set of ear buds for active people.
0,Can't pair headphones with anything and can't find Senso support. Will return worthless junk if I can't pair.
1,These thing work great.  The only complaint is I don't know of any way to tell the battery level.  A voice recording comes on when the power gets low.
1,Great Item/Use it all the time.
0,"Headphones just did not work.  The red light came on when I tried to charge (Had plugged into power supply for over 4 hours) but the device would not turn on, pair, reset, nothing.  Literally, the only sign of life was the little red light which you have to view at a certain angle or you might miss it.  I am returning.  Sucks to get the one bad one."
1,"Great value.  I've tried other bluetooth in-ear headphones, and these excel at battery life, comfort, and durability.  Comes with great accessories for the price.  Sound quality is good, not the best, but better than average. Good bass."
1,I like the style and feel.. i must have little ears dueto the ear pieces felt ynsecure.. wore then right out of the box in excitement.  I need to write more as soon as I can rest them out more
1,There loud which I love and they fit perfect for my ears.  I connected the Bluetooth to my phone first and it worked right away and I love them. These are very good ear phones and also good for working out when you don't want to use or have your phone on you all the time.
0,Piece of junk. Dropped once from a distance of 3feet and they fell apart and now won’t work right with Bluetooth. ?? Leave it up to the company who sells them to do something about it.
1,This is the first Bluetooth headphones I ever bought first off they are really easy to connect to your phone they fit my ears really well the only thing I wish is that the wires that go over your ears were adjustable but they are not other than that I'm very pleased with this product and would advise anybody to buy them
0,Already stopped working . I should get a full refund for this terrible product !!!!!!
1,"Crisp, clear sound from a head phone set that can take the volume with distortion. Well worth the money!"
1,"They stick out a little more than I'd like but I love the comfort of the headphones and sound quality is great. I have had these a month now and use them 2-4 times a week for about 45-60min each time and I have yet to charge these. Great battery life from my experience so far. Great purchase and excellent bang for your buck, definitely recommend!"
1,"This is one of the best purchases I've ever made. I've had apple earbuds, headsets... and they really can get in the way when you're a university student constantly pulling out stuff from your bag (I've destroyed many earbuds because the strings get tangled or get stretched). This is a compact set of headphones that don't need to be charged often, stay in your ears and around your neck, really light while also sporting a pretty good audio quality. Also, the bluetooth system is really nice, and the design is pretty nice. Overall, very, very satisfied and am considering buying a pair for a friend."
0,"Bought this just one year ago and did not use it that much until last month after the COVID-19 force me to stay home more.  It connected and worked OK, not too secure in my ears so I have to adjust them from time to time during my one hour daily jogging.  But since a few days back, it started to suddenly lost the connection, power on/off would not help.  And a re-charge the phone will get it connects again.  This always happens after about 1 hour usage, happened 3-4 times already.  It could mean the battery faded?  What to do next?"
1,"I enjoy using the earbuds, but there are a couple minor issues I do have with them.  It would be nice if the volume control could have more adjustments between settings- also a longer warning time that the battery is about to die... Mine completely died after 4 months of use.  There was a ""fix"", but it didn't work for me, but the company quickly replaced it!  I hope this one lasts much longer.  If it doesn't, I will update my review"
1,pleased
1,This product is pretty awesome. With everything it comes with its unbeatable for its price. Another great thing oh get with this product is the customer service. I have already had to represent ice reach out to me and make sure that the product was what I wanted and to see if there was anything else I would need. The pair is pretty easy. It sounds good and it's pretty stylish. I like how they fit into your ears for security and then on top of that they have another part to go over your ears. There is no volume box on the cord like many other which is awesome and less distracting.<br />The only cons I have is that the part that goes around your ear is a little flimsy for me and when I first tried tried them it seemed like one side was louder than the other but have used a few times now and they seem to be fine but if there is a consistent problem k know the Senso company will help me become a fully satisfied company. These are the best Bluetooth headphones you can get for the price that has everything. Definitely telling other about this product.
1,"Recieved my headphones in the mail and instantly loved them. They have different earbuds so you can fit it specifically to your ears. I run a lot so I have very much enjoyed them and they’re loud, and block out the sound which is what I like when I’m running."
1,"I have a severe hearing loss.  These earbuds have been a life-changer!  Paired with a TaoTronics 2-in1 wireless adapter, I can now fully enjoy entertainment from my tv, Roku, and Kodi box.  Amazing fidelity.  Been years since I experienced such audio.<br />Comfortable fit.  Easy to operate.<br />I use a wireless transmitter plugged into the headphone port of my television because Kodi is tricky and unreliable when trying to connect directly with bluetooth."
0,No comfort at all. Can use more than 10 minutes.
1,Great Sounding headphones!!! I enjoyed them so much I ordered a second pair
1,"Rated five stars for price, quality construction, durability and packaging. Extensive research on Bluetooth headphones led me to the SENSO headphones. Compare these reviews to Beats, BOSE and others and see for yourself. The sound could be better in the higher frequencies (treble) but I happily accept the balance (with solid bass) over flat low-volume sound found in other products. Showing the product marked down 78%, from $169.99, is misleading as I have not read where anyone paid that much. Regardless, great product overall. Buy them."
1,"Over all these ear buds are great for the price. The battery is good enough for exercising, but not for working all day, which was expected. The bass is good, but kind of friend out all the other sounds. Would definitely buy again."
0,I ordered these a few months ago. They sometimes quit working while I am in the middle of a workout. The voice that tells you if they are or off becomes deeper. Restarting my phone does not help and it takes a couple of hours to get them to pair again. I have to carry a backup pair to make sure I will be able to have music for my entire workout.
0,"These have decent (not good) sound quality, a bad microphone, and they don't stay in my ears that well. They are also large and clunky as you can see. For $30 I could have gotten much better wired earphones, but if you want inexpensive bluetooth earphones, you might have to settle for these."
1,"So far so great. Great sound quality, east to set up and sound didn't fade even when I started sweating during my run."
1,"Good Bluetooth headphones. They stay on your ears, sound good and are easy to use. I like the battery charge indicator on my iPhone screen. Very cool! I like them so much I got another pair for my wife!"
1,"I have used these headphones almost non stop since I charged them after their arrival, I took them on a run, went to the gym, and with me to classes.  The entire time I was extremely comfortable with them on and did not feel as though they interfered with my movement or disconnected from my phone at any point.<br />Sound quality is what is expected from ear buds, although they do a better job hitting the lows in comparison to the high pitched sounds.  Outside noise blocking is decent as well, if you truly don't want to hear the outside you only need to go up to ~1/3 max volume, so needless to say they are fairly loud and cancel noises fairly well."
1,"I've been buying my earbuds based on Consumer Reports' recommendations, and was never disappointed, but never blown away either. Somehow, I got turned on to Senso's Bluetooth S-250 phones and was blown away. This is my second pair so that I have a charged pair always at hand. I can hear words in songs that were so crisp and clear that I couldn't believe my ears...literally. Maybe you can get clearer phones for a couple hundred dollars more, but WHY would you bother? These are great; they last (for me at least) a minimum of 6 hours on a charge; and are comfortable as all get out. Do your ears, and bank account, a favor and get these phones. They are, quite simply, great."
1,"These ear buds are mostly comfortable. I find my ears ache if I have them on for longer than 6 hours. Some days, they bother me entirely because I wear glasses and the arm just bugs me. But that's more based on my mood.<br /><br />I am a normal person with normal expectations sound wise (a super well-trained ear I do not have). I listen to classical music at work all day and these ear buds do the music justice. When the music is playing, the background noise of my office is inaudible.<br /><br />In terms of charging, they take forever to charge. I typically let them charge for an entire day once the robot voice starts telling me &#34;battery low.&#34; I tried charging them for two and four hours but would still get &#34;battery low&#34; right as I turned them on. The bluetooth Reader for them does not have a far range on the PC. If I walk three feet away, music jumps in and out.<br /><br />Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase."
1,These headphones are really nice. They have a good sound quality and are easy to recharge and sync with bluetooth. They work really well at the gym and stay in place during workouts.
1,"Wicked easy to charge and to pair with my phone. Insanely clear sound and so light! Walked all around my house, and it is not a small house and was still clear and cranking!! First day with it, tomorrow at work will be the true test lol but I will admit so far it has way exceeded my expectations :) I do not know about the moisture aspect yet, that will be tested but for now, I am a very happy bunny :)"
1,Battery lasts quite a while. Works great for running.
1,"This is by far the best ear plug style head set that I have ever purchased.  I bought this for its strong bass support and I am not disappointed.  The quality of the sound is very good.  I wear it for work out and the design allows the head set stay on my ears all the time.  Granted, I don't shake my head much.  So if you move your head a lot with it, you may need to test it yourself.  But the sound quality and price is great.  With that said, I did run into an issue where the led light won't shut down and it continues to drain the battery.  I bought this back in Oct 2016 and it is now Apr 2017.  So this does concern me a bit.  But when I file a customer service issue, they walk me through a reset process and it didn't work.  So they ship me a replacement one because I am still under warranty.  So their Customer Service is very good in taking care of my issue.  Overall, I am happy with the device and their customer services.  Great product."
1,Great headphones
1,"The music quality is excellent, and that's what I care about, and the battery life is very good.  The price compares very favorably with the much more expensive big name brands with similar features. I am glad I bought this. Now I  have only had it for a day or two, so I hope I am not disappointed."
1,Great bass and overall sound. Definitely worth the money.
1,These earbuds have excellent sound and are exactly as described. They come in a case for travel and have extra rubber tips to adjust to smaller or larger ears.
1,Work perfectly
0,"these things are a piece of garbage if you plan on using them for working out. They do not stay in your ear and the over the ear parts are so big and flimsy that they serve no purpose. If you are planning on using these for sitting at a desk or not active, I would recommend. Otherwise I would avoid these."
1,"Love the ear phones. Charge keeps me for 4-6 hours. Connection is great and even my sweat in the gym those them no harm. I am very happy with them. Had to reorder those because I lost my old ones. I am pretty sure the person who found them is very happy with them too! Also love the different sizes off ear covers. Most earphones hurt my ears after a while, but not this one, can wear them for hours without any problems. Great by for your money!"
1,I purchased the product for my granddaughter for jogging and walking. She is very satisfied.
0,"Only used the headphones for 1 day before I started having issues. They skip even when my phone is less than 2ft away from they. They also don't connect to my phone right away sometimes, and my bluetooth is always on. I have to turn my bluetooth on and off and the headphones on and off multiple times for them to connect. Not worth the price for these issues to start after only one day of usage. Also, these are incredibly loud and uncomfortable. They are so loud, they give me a headache even when the volume is very low. I also have small ears, and the buds often hurt after a while. I commute an hour and a half to school and they start to hurt within an hour."
1,"easy to use, good sound quality for the price. Stay secured while running just fine."
1,works great
1,"Purchased for my grandson..12 yrs old,  he loves them!  The service was great, came when they were supposed to."
1,"Bought these for my son as he was trying to steal mine. These are great! They’re light, they don’t slip. You barely notice they’re on. Even the small cord is not cumbersome. They are the best wireless headphones I’ve had, and I’ve gone through some for running."
1,"I was surprised  but nice headphones an good  sound,bgreat shipping"
0,"Not loud, doesn't block out noise and quit connecting to bluetooth"
1,"Works well if just listening to music or whatever. If I use it for calls it is crackly, and sometimes gets crazy &#34;outer space&#34; interference sounding noises. This is when both phone and headphones are fully charged. People I am talking to complain it picks up too much ambient noise or noise around me. Disappointed in the calling quality, but happy enough when just listening o music."
1,Extremely comfortable and easy to use
1,"Great headphones, has some static though and it slips off ears too easily. But the customer support was kind enough to replace it when it messed up"
0,"Paired fine, but connection kept cutting out the one and only time I tried to go on a walk with them. I have a similar pair of wireless headphones that don't have any issues with that. Makes the product absolutely useless for me."
1,I love these!!!
1,"I love the convenience of these headphones. I use them when I am doing chores around the house and appreciate that the button gives me an easy way to pause my podcast when my wife asks me a question. :) The battery life is sufficiently long; I can usually go a little over a week between charges, listening to about an hour of podcasts a day, give or take."
1,"Very happy with these headphones.  I bought much more expensive ones that did not go as loud as I wanted, and more importantly they would not stay in my ears during exercise.  These fit the bill."
1,"Awesome product. For the longest time I was looking for a solution for heavy bag workouts and shadow boxing where your head moves around a lot.<br /><br />The bluetooth around the neck didn't cute it. Over the ear models were a bit bulky, but this is just perfect without being &#34;Beat&#34; down with a really pricey model. Sound quality and paring is top notch.<br /><br />It comes with a variety of accessorizes. I found a winner!"
1,Better  than I could have ever imagined. Strong sound and very comfortable.
1,"The headphones feel sturdy, and they have a solid range. I like all the accessories that came with the earphones too."
0,The bluetooth frequently loses connection when the phone is in my pocket (which is no more than 2-3 feet away. Would not recommend
1,The service and product is great.
1,"May 19, 2017 UPDATE:<br />The more I use these the more I like them.  The Bluetooth is very fast for linking - connects to my iPad and iPhone at the same time... If I'm watching a movie on the iPad and a call comes in - the movie automatically pauses and I can answer the phone with the same dual connected headset.<br /><br />Just today I noticed that I left the phone in the garage when I walked away - I got to 100 Feet before it started to lose connection.  I've never had a set hold a signal so strong with distances like that!<br /><br />Just FYI - I still like the sound and performance.<br /><br />+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br /><br /> How do you compare headphones?  I tend to think a wide ranging recording from the analog days will reveal any flaws with range of tonality for reproduction.  Hence I suggest you play a good reproduction of the song by the Rightous Brothers &#34;Unchained Melody&#34;.  Please don't cast it away as music not to your taste - it's for a control sample so key in on the highs and lows of the vocals and music and then try playing it on your other headphones.<br /><br />I'm not easily impressed having used my Plantronics Go2 for over a year with high satisfaction.  Now I keep my Plantronics in the junk drawer with the rest of the old stuff that use to rule my digital life.<br /><br />It makes no sense to go on about my perceptions except to encourage you to buy these, try them as I described and see for yourself. They offer a 100% refund so I figured why not and would not have hesitated to send them back like I have others that over promise and don't deliver.<br /><br />Here is a couple of points:<br />1.  Use the foam plugs for a tighter sound inside your ear canal<br />2.  There is not a very active noise cancel feature I can tell - but the sound is so rich it actually 'takes over' exterior sounds... I noticed this while walking along a busy road - I hardly heard any cars go by me - I was impressed in the rich sound.<br />3.  My hearing is physically reduced in the high tone range... so a wider range of low to high lets me enjoy an immersive sound experience. So I can't be sure my hearing is a factor except I compared these to three other &#34;good&#34; buds, and hands-down I enjoy these the best BY FAR.<br />4. Strong blue-tooth signal and fast easy pairing - awesome !<br /><br />I Paid $36.96 which sounded cheep and worried me maybe these would be just a run of the mill sub $100 buds - but that's all I could afford so I took a chance fully intending to send them back if they didn't at least do half as good of my Plantronics... Now I'm looking to buy another for back-up because they are my current favorite.<br /><br />Please test them as I suggest and post your findings to share with me if I am right ... or is it just me and my ears????"
1,"These headphones deliver what they promise. The thing that I like the most: they do not fall of during workout. Sound quality is decent. Putting them into the ears is a little bit of work (you need to insert and twist to get the ear tips in place). I would have appreciated a finer volume control as well, lowest volume on iPhone is not really low. Overall, very satisfied."
1,They work great!
1,"The good:<br />1) Sound is good. I'm not an audiophile but it is good enough for me.<br />2) It is really sweat proof.<br />3) The wires do not get entangled or bounce around while exercising.<br /><br />The bad:<br />1) The connection keeps dropping when I pair it with my Sony mp3<br />2) The hooks refuse to stay in place.<br />3) The buds also refuse to stay in place.<br />I spend a good 5-10 minutes adjusting the hooks and it still doesn't stay snugly in my ear. The buds refuse to stay in, regardless of earbud size. The hooks keep &#34;floating in air&#34;, for lack of a better description. Granted, it doesn't drop off and drape around my shoulders; it's just that the fit isn't good so the buds feel as if they're floating just beside my ears.<br />I really wanted to use it for exercise, but it just won't fit well. I've downgraded it to music listening while working on the computer and even so, I spend the first 5 mins adjusting the hooks."
0,I bought these with high hopes of their quality. At first I had no complaints but during my 7th use the headphones switched off and completely stopped working. They would not charge or turn on even after resetting it. I contacted the manufacturer for a replacement and have yet to receive it. I hope the replacement does not also stop working as well.
1,They were great in every way but they did not fit my tiny ears. My granddaughter loves them so much. Please make some that itty bitty ears so that I can enjoy my music.
1,I am completely impressed with the packaging and contents. The user manual is laminated and in color! The sound is amazing. The various sizes of bud covers is comprehensive. I highly recommend this company.
1,They are very nice and great to wear doing anything
1,Great earbuds!
1,"Very lightweight and easy to use. Comfortable with multiple sized earbuds. They are not as loud as some headphones, but they get the job done."
0,"Returned. Music would cut in and out with my phone 3 ft away. Doesn't stay in my ear very well, which is a typical issue for me, but the ear hooks did nothing to help this"
1,Voice conversations on my I-phone were good and it helps with my hearing problems. But hear also every footstep I take while listening to voice or music. It becomes annoying after a while.
1,good sound
1,"I love them, I use it all the time, super handy to take out quick and not lose them, fit nicely, battery is fairly decent"
1,Mainly for audio books and podcasts at work . Battery lasts between 10-12 hours. Definitely water resistant. Only prob I have is after wearing over 5-6 hours straight my ears get sore. Not a deal breaker tho cuz they are excellent at everything else 👍
1,"I love these headphones! My runs are much more comfortable now, no more trying to fiddle with my iPhone while I'm on the go to change a song or change the volume, just a simple push of buttons on the headphone.  The sound is also amazing, definitely have already recommended these to friends. To top it off when I was having charging issues the company responded immediately and gave amazing customer service.  Very happy with this purchase and the SENSO people!"
1,Great headset! Blown away by the sound quality in comparison to others I've owned.
1,"Easy to use.  Charge quick enough.  Range is a bit longer than stated if there is a line of sight with no walls (I workout in my garage/driveway and bluetooth connect to an iPad).  They stay put during Olympic lifts, burpees, and going upside down on the rings."
1,Have not used it too much yet but t pulling weeds became so much fun having my oldies there with me!
1,great product
0,"Ok sound for the price.  If you are a broke college student or unemployed, it is a pretty good deal."
1,Total quality! Love the foam plugs because I have sensitive ears.  Great sound. Quick to charge.
1,"I have been very impressed with the durability and sound of these headphones.  I bought them because I wanted a headphone that would stay put and sound great with good bass while running, climbing, jumping, sweating, etc.  These have not failed me.  I have run 3 obstacle races (Spartan Super, ToughMudder and Spartan Beast) while using these headphones.  In all 3 races they have been submerged in muddy water, gotten sweaty and rained on and have continued working. During the Beast they got really muddy and I simply washed them off and they continued to work fine. They stayed in place while traversing the various walls, pits, etc.  The battery life is good and the sound quality great considering the price.  I have not had any trouble pairing them with my iPhone 7 or Windows 10 laptop.  I recommend them to everyone.  You will not be disappointed!"
1,"I bought two pair, one for my son and one for my husband.  They both love them and the price was fantastic."
1,"Borrowed my husband's and loved them, so I had to get a pair!!"
1,Well worth the money. They have a great price point and preform as well if not better than the same style beats I had last year. I work in a very loud wood shop and use them all day. They are comfortable and with the memory foam earbuds I don’t have an issue hearing the music over the machines.
1,These work spectacularly for their function and price point. Great sound quality on the hearing as well as speaking side. I personally returned them because I purchased them hoping to pair it with ny conputer for web conferencing (which is not their intended purpose) and there was a bit too much of a lag. My error does not demean the quality of the earbuds though.
1,90% as good as my Beats @ 20% the price!!! Love them.
1,"These headphones are excellent. The fit well, thanks to the multiple sized fittings and they stay in place throughout motion.  Seems like good battery life so far.  I haven't used them to talk on the phone yet, though, so I can't speak to that.<br /><br />e"
1,I received it timely. Headphones works smoothly having balanced sound and bass. In the package car charger did not work but i got new charger from Senso. Thanks for doing so qualitative product.
1,Excellent value and a quality product. The box included additional cords and car charger.
1,These headphones are great for listening without being connected by a wire. The instructions were clear and set up was easy. Arrived on time as promised. I really enjoy these and would buy from this seller again.
1,I love the price. It beat my expectations for sound quality and noise canceling.<br />I would recommend to a friend.
1,"First of all I find they do not fall off out out of my ears when running, bending, etc.  They connect easily and consistently with my phone, they come with xtra ear buds, they were delivered in a timely fashion.  I ordered a second pair to keep in my travel bag to be sure I always had them with me on the road"
1,awesome Bluetooth
1,Amazing sound
0,Physically hurt my ears and Bluetooth breaks up....
1,"I use them mostly when I'm working, paired to my phone.  I notice 'scratching noise' if the phone is anywhere except my shirt pocket.  I'm reluctant to blame my phone for the problem. These headphones are replacing a &quot;Beats&quot; pair that look exactly alike, but they're $100.00 less expensive.  I'm not unhappy with the new ones so far, but where I carry my phone makes a difference in reception.  But like I said they're $100.00 less."
0,Comfortable and easy to use but weak sound.  Used them with my phone at the gym and had them turned all the way up and the phone almost turned all the way up for average sound
1,My husband loves them.  The other kinds fall out of his ears.  These stay put and have good sound quality.  Great price!
1,"It was easy to figure out and head clean, clear, natural sounds"
1,"I am so blown away be the headset... #1 they do not hurt my ears... #2 the ear racks are flexible and they do not hurt my ears,  # 3 add to this that people can hear without me speaking louder because the microphone does not pick up my voice,  # 4 I can hear the outside when the buds are in my ears and I am driving.... Holy-Moly after about 10 Bluetooth sets I finally have what I have been searching for... Thank you...  So very satisfied in Florida"
1,"The sound quality is good but lacks definition / depth.  The volume level is fine.  The buds are OK, but the weight of the earpieces is noticeable and if you remove one side, it will tug against the other side very noticeably. They will serve their purpose."
1,"I love them and they sound great! But, the only downfall is the silicon ear wrap arounds. You need to make those things adjustable or actually more ridged."
1,I do not think I have yet to leave feedback on any of the products I have bought before. I am not good with proper reviews.<br />I don't spend much on headphones because they seem to break on me easily. They either last long but lose their good quality sound. Or have good quality sound but develop a short in the cord after less than 6. The pair I replaced with these broke in less than a week they were a different brand. Sadly they had a amazing sound as well.<br /><br />The sound from these is amazing. All the sounds are audible. Sometimes I think I hear outside noise but then I realize it’s from what I’m listening to that I never heard before. Speaking of that with other headphones sounds around me get distorted normal sounds can sound like someone calling my name and sometimes I hear knocks on my door and someone opening it. At the present with these it hasn’t happened. *crosses fingers.*<br /><br />What I love the most is it is helping me enjoy my favorite video game again. I played it one time with a good surround sound system and it was so immersive and after that it was as fun without the pretty sounds. But with these headphones I can hear the pretty sounds a lot clearer now I am enjoying it more again..<br /><br />Music sounds amazing as well. It had the right amount of base so it doesn’t trigger my bass intolerance. I can here the booms and still hear the singing. Other headphones with good quality sound the bass can sound off.<br /><br />So far the quality says it’s worth a higher price.<br /><br />I just hope they don’t poop out like all my other headphones.
1,"I like the quality of sound, but my right outer ear hurts when wearing them. I think its shape and my ear shape don't really match."
1,I purchased these after reading the other reviews. I have no issues with them staying in place and the sound quality is great! Can definitely hear the base! Very happy with them!!!
1,love these things.  more than I expected.  really great sound.
1,Thank you and job well done
1,"Easy to set up, long-lasting charge, and comfortable to wear.  Perfect for running and working out."
1,"Great sound, nice base. Comfortable wearing these headphones.  Very happy with the purchase. Delivery was also very timely."
0,They came out of box with the charging port loose and wouldn't line up. I tried a few things and made it worse Also made requesting a refund a dishonest idea so I love the design but will eat the lose glad they weren't expensive.
1,I like it.
1,"Senso took care of  me and sent me a new set of headphones when the other ones failed.  These headphones sound great and the batteries last a long time<br /><br />Update: 08/06/18- darn, love these headphones, but they went out today. Use them all the time. Ordered  the upgrade version. One comment... the coating started bubbling up and peeling off. If Senso wants to talk I’m open to it."
1,Holds its charge for at least 7 hours and is very comfortable.Great for exercise and is a quality product.<br />Landed up buying 3 of them because of comfort and convenience. My kids love them.
1,I love the distance I can get between my phone and headset.
0,Didn’t last! They broke after a few months! Not worth it!
1,"Can’t beat the price. My first wireless headphones. The ear attachments could be more durable. I spend too much time adjusting to fit just right. I use them during my gym workout. I wear glasses, which also contributes to a poorer fit. Overall though, I like them and will use until they wear out."
1,works well
1,"I've had a pair of these for a little over 2 years, the wires are now exposed near each ear piece, I have to angle the charger to get them to charge, yet they are still kicking.  I've been rough on these too. Catching them in the shoulder portion of a seat belt, ripping them from my head :) still working great. When these die, I'll be ordering another pair. Best sound quality I've found in their price range"
0,"I was really excited to order these headphones after reading such positive reviews. I have ran with these headphones multiple times now. I cannot get the headphones to stay in my ears while I'm running. No matter how much I adjust them, they always slide out. When I have them in and my phone is in my pocket, the sound breaks up terribly to wear I can't understand the podcasts I'm listening to. This has happened every time I wear them. I would not recommend these."
1,Love them!!! Very light
0,"These head phones suck I've had them for a month and as soon as the return warranty ended the headphones stopped working wright issues with not connecting and not picking up phone calls so know I have a Christmas gift that doesn't work,thank you unsatisfied customer."
0,"I wore the SENSO Bluetooth Headphones for about 2 hours as I walked and ran some errands. When I went to turn them on again later that day after charging, I unhappily discovered that they had broken. Completely unresponsive to the charger or turning them on. I've had several pairs of wireless Bluetooth earbuds/headphones, and I never had an experience like this. Save your money."
1,"After years of accidental pulls on the corded headphones and ear buds, I finally decided to jump on the Bluetooth path.  I know I wanted a decent one for running and outdoor activities.  Being not overly expensive was key factor as well.  After reading many reviews and watching countless hours on YouTube over these, I finally got it.  Package received was filled with goodies.  Right off the bat, the headphones synced with my Note 5 and ITouch 4th G.  NICE!  Impressive Bass listening to Tool's heavy &#34;Vicarious&#34; song.  Running with it took some fiddling getting use to the controls and cord management.  I noticed these stick out of ears a bit so I caught lots of disturbances on windy days.  That is to be expected from what I know.  Other than that, charge is about 8 hours as advertised.  It took me about 3 days to get comfortable with weight and controls with this set.  I like that all the controls are in the right ear bud so no need to try and grab onto an inline control while bouncing up and down like other headphones.<br />I like the Bluetooth way so much I am not going back.  I need to pick up another BT set for leisure/commuting that is more subtle.  But for running, I will stick to the Senso.  It is sweat resistant and simple to grab and go. Can&#34;t beat the price.  Also, this a true review as I was not compensated in any way."
1,"Good fit, good sound and so nice to be 'untangled'. Did have a problem with connection dropping out and sellers offered a 'fix' when they were following through. Prompt and courteous contacts. Was an immediate fix. Thanks"
1,Buena compra
1,"I bought these 7 months ago. I liked them mostly at first. Sound quality is ok, but now I’m having some trouble connecting the Bluetooth. When I turn on the device a voice will say “connected” but sometimes it doesn’t actually play my music for awhile. Also almost every time I turn them on now they will lose connection at regular intervals. It’s weird, it’ll beep every 10-15 seconds turning off my music then turning it back on. Very annoying. After I turn it off and back on a few times it seems to fix. But very inconvenient and I’m looking for a good replacement. I guess you can try at your own risk..."
1,"These have been great headphones!  I bought them in September and yesterday they quit charging and I called Customer Service to see what the problem was, after trouble shooting he determined they are defective and will be replacing them since they was a 1 year warranty!  I was pleasantly surprised! Good customer service is hard to come by these days, so that was really nice, that he tried to fix them and when he couldn't he said  they will be sending me a replacement. These headphones have great sound and make blue tooth easy. I was bummed when they wouldn't charge and feel lost without my headphones.  I use these for watching TV at night, listening to music at work, with my laptop and phone. I can't wait to get the new ones Senso is sending me. I would recommend these headphones."
1,The only thing I don’t like is that I have to keep repositioning them in my ear as they slowly slide out while I’m working out
0,"Good for when it lasted. Purchased on 2017/01/19 and died on 2018/10/09.  Total lifespan of 1 year and 9 months. Today it won't start and wont charge. If you are expecting a bluetooth earphone for a lifespan of 3 years.  This earphone is not on par with that.<br />Also, the battery life is only about 3-5 hours.  I use this earphone about 4-5 times a week during my gym sessions.  Sound quality is great.  Good bass."
1,"Great headphones, my son loves them. Quick shipping & follow up from Senso with immediate contact information if we should have any problems or questions. Would definitely buy from this company again."
1,I like the soundmi like the price.<br />It could be a little stronger.
1,"I ordered these headphones short notice and paid for one day shipping and they arrived right on time. First day I had them I wore them on a 12 mile run in the rain, this is an excellent product. The sound did not waiver, and the battery life is far better than any other Bluetooth devices I own, and the combination of rain and sweat had no effect on them either. I'm extremely happy I ordered these."
1,"At first I loved these earbuds. Decent sound,  stayed in place while running, comfortable on long runs (2 hours or more), stay charged for days<br />Then the honeymoon ended after a few months.... they don't stay charged! Nothing like running in silence."
1,these are just has good if not better than the newest beats that I purchased for my husband for our anniversary. I have since bought 2 more pairs for relatives. They in turn say these bluetooth earphones are GREAT!
1,"I bought these to use on the increasing number of video calls and webinars I'm on during the pandemic. They paired easily with my computer. The sound quality and microphone are great. The only drawback is the battery life feels short; unfortunately, monitoring it on Win10 is a pain. I just make a habit of charging them regularly."
1,This is my second pair of these Bluetooth earbuds… And for some reason these are not fitting as nicely into my ears than the last set I bought two years ago. Otherwise they are still of the same quality and sound.
1,"More than expected.... Great quality, sound, package &amp; overall product. I use it to run. I was looking for something not too expensive but not cheap &amp; reliable,  read the reviews of the SENSO &amp; decided to go for it. Really impressed with the product and all contents. It even has a case in addition to the ear buds replacements... Oh and a car charger &amp; a long &amp; a short charging cable. HOME RUN OUT OF THE PARK. Awesome job team. I was also looking for the gray one mentioned in one of the reviews to see if I liked too."
1,"Held up through a rainy half marathon and continues to work. I wish I could adjust the piece that goes over the ear but for the price, I can't complain."
1,"Let me start by saying that I typically dislike ear buds because they always pop out and don't sound good during strenuous exercise that involves bouncing or jarring motions - like running.<br /><br />But I decided to try these out because they have the ear hooks that I thought would keep them on my ears while running. And they DO indeed keep the headset on my ears while I am running. However, the ear buds themselves still pop out during exercise and I still &#34;hear/feel&#34; the pounding of my feet on the road. Only way I know to describe the sensation - sorry if it doesn't make sense.<br /><br />Also, the main button for power is located exactly in the spot where I need to push to get the ear bud back in my right ear. I forget that while running and inevitably I press that button every time I try to push the ear bud back into my ear. And that causes the music to pause until I press the button again. Probably I can setup the phone to disregard this button push, but it really isn't worth it IMO.<br /><br />These ear buds do sound nice when I use them while not exercising though. I like the sound quality when I am sitting at my desk and working, and am on the phone."
0,"These headphones have great reviews and a friend has them as well with no issues.  I think I may have a faulty pair.  Each time I turn my head to the right, the sound/music cuts out/skips.  This includes streaming music and music saved/loaded to my phone.  At first I thought it was my running location, however, it happens whenever I wear them.  These would be great for the price, but the constant skipping in the sound makes them more distracting and frustrating while trying to run."
0,"Purchased in November. Today they're not working. Won't connect to iPhone, but was connected yesterday. ...And just passed the return window, wouldn't you know it?  :("
0,"So at first I loved these but once I got to running and sweating the ear buds fall out my left one more than the right. Sound is great and I can Pretty far from my phone and the sound still works good. They are a little big though and fit funny on my ears, maybe I just have small ears."
1,sound from my phone is clear and understandable even at low volume levels. This headset is surprising comfortable and stays in place as I move about.
1,Very nice buds..and all the added accessoried are a plus. Even without the extras i would still buy these buds.
1,Overall great set of headphones
1,Excellent sound. Much better than a pair of over priced Beats Bluetooth ear buds I own.
1,Had a couple of glitches with my senso Bluetooth headphones -I love them but I guess I just wore them out very quickly.It was outside of the 30-day return window with Amazon so I contacted the manufacturer-Ivotek. They have fabulous customer service! Someone responded to me same day. We address the issue and eventually replaced my item under there one year warranty rule thank you so much Ivotek..love these headphones!
1,Everything I was looking for!
1,"The best Bluetooth headphones I've ever had, and I've had a few! I'm gonna order a few more pairs soon.  They are alittle bulky but when they r on u can't tell. Listen to podcasts all day at work on a single charge.  The adjustable over the ear is amazing!! Don't waste money on Bose or beats. These are the only ones I'll ever order."
1,Works very well easy to connect
1,I didn't get all the items that said came with this. No adjustable piece for the headphone wires.
0,"They have excellent sound quality and the controls are intuitive and easy to use. Unfortunately, after three runs they’re constantly falling off or out of my ears. I would not recommend these for exercise."
0,"While I like the look and feel of these headphones, I have had two pairs fail to charge after having the about 6-8 months each. Very skeptical to buy another pair."
1,"For the price, these are great headphones. The battery seems to last me 12 hours or so of constant play time (I work overnights and listen to music while working). I am able to work my 9 hours and then go to the gym right after and have plenty of juice left.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Price<br />Auto-connects to my phone when turned on<br />Battery life<br />Stays in ears 9/10 times without issue while working and working out.<br /><br />Cons:<br />When running and the cable bounces on the back of my neck, I get some weird fuzzy sound sometimes<br />Part that goes around my ear doesn't really do anything, it sticks up pretty high above my ears<br />Size, they seem a little bulky, but you don't really notice unless you look in the mirror and see them.<br /><br />Overall, I would buy again without hesitation due to the price, sound, and battery life. They definitely get their use."
1,Very nice sound and comfortable
1,"So far so good. Only had it for a couple days, but initial impressions are the product is really high quality, even more so given the price. Product comes with great case, and multiple charging plugs as well as multiple sizes for ear buds. Have used it a couple times, and it paired quickly and sound while running was great. Definitely has a decent noise-canceling capability. Very happy so far! Will update review if experience changes.<br /><br />Update: I had a product issue after about 9 months, contacted customer service, and they were extremely responsive and helpful. Not only do I strongly recommend the product, I also strongly recommend the company behind the product!"
0,They aren’t replacement for beats but for kids they are sufficient.
1,"This one of the best BT headset I owned.  Sounds are awesomes,  Cant beat the price.  I have been thinking get another. One thing though, If Senso has (wireless charging or charger auto shutoff would be nice since most problem devices similar overheating,  I dont have that problem with this yet. (hope not).  I really like this headset & I'd recommend this device.  I'm not much of a writer but I know what is good!  LOL"
0,"Pros: Good Quality Sound, for sound i gave 2<br /><br />Cons: Doesn't fit perfectly in ear, if you are not active then they will stay but during the run falls out from ear, there is no way to adjust the over the ear band... I am not happy the way they fit.. this makes totally useless for me as i primary purchased for exercise only."
1,"First, the good stuff: These are packaged beautifully, and they come in a very nice carry case with plenty of necessary accessories.  The quality of manufacture is excellent.  On these points alone they should get five stars.  The instructions were clear and well-written.  Everything about these headphones is top quality, except.....<br /><br />The sound quality.  I am not sure I should lay this on Senso, though, because this is my third set of Bluetooth headphones. I decided to spend more, do some market research, and select the best quality I could get. I probably DID get the best quality I could get. But the sound quality is just nowhere near what I want it to be, either on receiving (fair) or transmitting (poor). People I talk with on the phone say I sound like I'm in a tunnel, no matter what the environment. But that seems to be the way it is with these things. I just don't think you can get a set of Bluetooth headphones like this that have good, let alone great, sound quality.<br /><br />No offense, Senso, you make a great set of headphones in every respect that you can control. I just think I will never find a set that gives good (let alone great) quality sound, especially on transmitting. I believe if you are buying these to listen to music while you run or workout, you will likely be very satisfied. I bought them for hands-free conversations, and I am going to abandon them after two days of use.  Three stars, because that's all Bluetooth headphones will ever deserve, even the best-made sets like this Senso."
0,"I guess you get what you pay for... I got these a couple of weeks ago and was initially very pleased.. design was good, fit was snug, battery life okay and music quality was sufficient (any kind of bass was pretty muffled, even country).. I used these for 60-75 minute gym sessions, long cardio, weights, etc... a full charge would usually last four workouts... but today, middle of elliptical workout, they shut off.  iphone 7 was fine, headphones just shut off, couldn't reset them, power them back on, nothing... I had just charged them one day prior to assumed that wasn't the issue.  When I got home, I tried to charge them again just in case that had lost all charge... I come back in the room 15 mins later to a burning smell... I pick them up and they're nuclear hot... and then I see they've exploded."
1,Love them!
1,"I'm sure glad I did not spend big $$ on Beats, these sound great, lots of bass, NEVER fall out of your ears and allow basically no outside noise in."
0,I've had these headphones for only two weeks max. The sound quality is good and volume buttons work well. I haven't tried them for a phone conversation.<br /><br />UPDATE!!!!!!!! 3 weeks later<br /><br />These headphones have died!!! they will fully charge but will not turn on. Now I know why the company wanted me to rate them so quickly.<br /><br />Don't buy these!!!!
1,Battery life is very good. The sound isn’t amazing but u get what you pay for. If you don’t want to spend a fortune on earbuds then these are perfect
1,work great once learned how to pair properly.
1,"Good product, good service."
1,Very good earphones and good price good quality would buy again
1,"Good sound, but the bendable part for the ears is not that sturdy, but they will stay on while jogging."
1,Great product for the money! They sound as good as you would expect for the price tag. They fit great and feel comfortable. I have been using them at work and they stay charged for pretty much the whole day (7 + hours). I recommend these for anyone looking for some decent sounding sporty headphones.
1,Expedited delivery did not happen &#34;we&#34; deserve refund from USPS. I really like the set
0,"I bought these for running, typically 40-60 min, 5x per week. I didn’t want to invest much for my first Bluetooth set and chose these based on Amazon’s recommendation. I found them comfortable with decent material quality, but the wiring never fully straightened out from its wound up packaging shape.<br /><br />I killed the first pair after two runs when I accidentally jumped into pool with set in my pocket. I waited a few days to dry out and when the battery still charged I was impressed enough to reorder since it was clearly my fault. Because hey if battery is sealed well enough to withstand total submersion they must be good, right?<br /><br />Second pair started having problems almost immediately. They were very difficult to pair with iPhone. Phone would show headset icon but volume played through phone speaker. It required multiple toggles through music and podcast apps before Bluetooth would truly connect. Worse, they would malfunction during runs, typically around 30 min. They would freak out: calling up Siri, attempting to make phone calls, losing Bluetooth connection. Very rarely could I complete a run without these crapping out. Over and over problems would occur. Eventually they just stopped pairing with my phone altogether and now sit unused for over a month.<br /><br />In conclusion they might be fine if you use to walk but I would avoid for higher intensity workouts. I don’t believe they are constructed well-enough to withstand the sweat. The price might be cheap, but sometimes cheap is just that."
1,"This is my second pair (I accidentally sat on them), and my husband still his a year and a half later. Just purchased for our son."
1,"I recently received these headphones that I decided to purchase as a replacement for my beats headphones. Since I was not able to test this product (nature of online shopping), I felt I need to trust posted buyer reviews. Here are my first impressions for these headphones.<br />I am impressed by the sound quality and the bass for a product that costs the only a fraction of the ""name brand"" equivalent. The volume available in these headphones is excellent; the bass is significantly better to the one that I needed to replace. I instantly noticed the superb fit. I always struggle with in-ear headphones as I am unable to find a product that will stay in my right ear during the exercise. So far I only used the ear tip attachment that comes standard, but there are an additional three sizes to customize the fit.<br /><br />There are several accessories that come with the headphones. Already mentioned three sizes of ear tips, short charging cable (I am using this cable in my car), dual port car charger, wire tie (to create a tight fit around the neck for cable connecting left and right headphone, carrying case, and finally 3ft long USB convertible charging cable for these headphones and iPhone."
1,"I have small ears and these fall right off. They do work well in water, but they call right off."
1,Great headset. I'm very happy with this purchase. The sound quality is amazing. Great and affordable which is a plus!
1,I love these headphones. Charge them once a day n they will be best companions where ever you go!! 😁. Sound quality is pretty good. The packing was amazing. The headphones are great value for money. I recommend it!
1,"Great product. I have ordered quite a few brands of these style wireless earbuds and the senso is my absolute favorite. Physical quality is good, and sound quality is great for the price. Couldn't have asked for more"
0,"Really liked these at first. Sound is decent but aren’t noise cancelling. Wore them strictly for gym workouts. Over time the ride side started cutting out until it didn’t work any longer. After that it just went downhill. Budget friendly, but wouldn’t recommend."
1,"Pleasantly surprised with the quality of the sound.  Nothing fits MY ears, but these fit well and stay in place"
1,"This is my second pair of Senso Bluetooth headphones. I use them almost daily for exercise and when on airplanes. I was so impressed with my first pair (which continues to work great after 2+ years) that I bought a second pair for my travel bag. Unfortunately, after 5 months, these S-250 headphones suddenly started connecting and disconnecting from my iPad during a treadmill run then went dead. They will not charge, respond to any button, respond to being connected to a charger, light up, etc. Dead...  I called the customer support number (which was answered directly by a customer service agent!!!) and they tried to troubleshoot the headphones with me. They confirmed that they were defective, confirmed my amazon order number and purchase date, and sent a replacement set right away. I was THRILLED with the customer support experience.<br /><br />So here I sit with dead headphones waiting for a replacement to show up and still I give these a 4-star rating? Yep. My other pair is still going strong after 2 years and with the customer support I just received, I’d still recommend the S-250s.  My original pair made it through several marathons, all of the training runs needed to get ready for them, and the rigors of traveling with me constantly working for an airline."
1,"just got these a few days ago, they connected to both my phone (nexus 6p) and tablet (asus windows 10 device) fast and easy. I only really use them for skyping and the occasional call but the sound is awesome for what I use them for. The assortment of ear bud tips allowed me to get a great fit. The ear loops are very soft and flexible which seemed odd at first until I wore them and then I completely understand as they are way more comfy than the stiff ear loops. Overall, with a 1 year warranty, they are a good deal, especially for the price point."
1,Great Product. Can't love it more.
1,I liked how the sound was really crisp and sharp. Good earbuds. It's a bang for your buck.
0,"Bought these in April 2017 and they have actually been working well for me, but the bluetooth pairing stopped working officially this month. I will be returning these. I've had cheaper headphones last longer and sound better than these."
0,"Arg, these suckers stopped working entirely after a few months. I ended up only using them at work a total of 2-3 times. These earbuds went to sleep and never woke back up. Yet another rip off in a world swirling with junk.<br /><br />Wahooooo."
1,I got my headphones about a week ago. The battery life amazed me. I worked about 5 hours outside with them on. They were a big blessing and when I checked the battery it said 80% Wow!
1,All I can say is wow! These are the best ear buds . Sound quality crisp and clear. And noise cancelling ability is great! I will buy more of these for my family so they can enjoy them.
0,"The sound quality is good, that’s only if it connects to your phone! The first two times they connected fast, but after that it has taken me over 30-40 minutes to connect the Bluetooth to my IPhone. It’s really annoying going to the gym and having to wait for a Bluetooth connection! Sometimes I can’t get a connection at all!!"
1,Great headphones so far for the price. Got 1 pair for as a gift and 1 for myself.tested them working out both during cardio workouts and weight training. They took a little bit of time to get used to but soon I didn't notice them at all. Stayed in place while running and sprinting. Would recommend to others. Only used for a couple weeks so far but holding up well.
1,Headset has good sound and range and for the cost it's great. The only thing is the over the ear partis a little flimsy but still helps to hold on to your ear.
1,"Have had these for a couple months now, they work great. I use them 2-3 times a week usually for an hour or so. I have used them for up to 2 hours. The range from my phone is good, I can move around 70 feet away (direct line of sight) before the signal starts to break up. I've answered phone calls while jogging/bicycling and they work well. Frankly, they are way nicer than I was expecting for the money."
1,"I love my SENSO bluetooth headphones. Whether I am at home working or traveling, these are the perfect headphones to enjoy music and block noise, and the battery life is outstanding!"
1,"It's great earbuds, really compatible, easy to use, great sound, great noise cancellation. Arrived after one day! Recommend!!"
1,"These are great! Made really well, connected to my phone flawlessly and came with a nice hard clamshell case and at least 3 different chargers including a car charger AND a charger that can connect directly to the newer iPhones!"
1,"Great headphones! Bought a second pair after losing the first. The first version I got, the over-the-ear hooks didn't move as much, the newer version does. I'm not a big fan of how bendy they are, but they still stay in place even with my glasses on."
1,They are good quality headphones that stay on while you run. It comes with a nice case and wires for all needs. I would buy them as a gift.
1,Nice headphones. Batteries lasts for quite a while with constant use. Sound is good and they are very comfortable.
1,Really good headphones. Great for running. I really like the charging cable it came with too.
1,"Work awesome, great customer support"
1,"So far these headphones are great. I listened to music while weight lifting and then was able to do some guided meditation. The sound quality was great. I haven't explored all their features, like talking through them on my phone or running and sweating with them on but I am very hopeful that they will be great."
1,a good surprise in a small package - the ear buds look good and of high quality - easy to pair with phone - good sound quality -<br />easy to use controls
1,Very good product
1,A little too bass-y for my liking but not bad at lower volumes and for phone calls
0,The Pros:<br />Well made material. Easy to set up. Sound was decent.<br /><br />The Cons:<br />Had to adjust the hooks on my ears a few time. Cuts in and out when I using Spotify. Not great on windy days. Not great for jogging. Figuring out if it’s on or off is a bit annoying.<br /><br />Unknown;<br />Didn’t have it long enough to determine the battery life.
1,"Maybe it’s my ears, but the sound is much better when I push the plugs into the ears deeper and I get more base response. Love the wireless with no restrictive cord, and the plastic that wraps around the ears."
0,"I didn't matter what size buds I used, these would NOT stay in my ear after 1 min of running :/ SO disappointed. I tried everything."
1,Extremely easy setup. I didn't have to even open the manual. Sound quality is wayy better than the wired headphones I received with my Samsung Galaxy S5. Using it for phone calls is so much better than holding phone in your hand or using a wired headphones with microphone.<br /><br />Extremely comfortable to wear. I love the sound notifications that I hear when these headphones are turned on/off. Very highly recommended!!
0,"Update: Got a second pair, and completely different.  ZERO bass, sound horrible.  I am so disappointed, I told family and friends about them.  Maybe they make money by sending out a good pair here and there and garbage otherwise.  I am returning them, so maybe I will upgrade if another pair work.  If not, heed this warning if you have bought them yet, NOT ALL PAIRS ARE EQUAL!!!<br /><br />I have only had them for a week, so can't speak to longevity, but the sound is really really impressive at this price.  I honestly can't believe they are selling at this price point, but I sure do appreciate it.<br /><br />I stumboled onto these on Prime Day (only save $7 off the $37 spot) and reviews were off the charts so I pulled the trigger (needed a decent pair).<br /><br />Most other pairs at this cost sound like garbage and last a couple months.  These sound insane, but we will see how long the last.<br /><br />Great clarity, strong base, well made, and very comfortable.  They feel and sound like a $150 headset easy."
1,Loving it!
1,Great sound and comfortable. Good product .
1,"What a deal! I'm still in shock with the value that came in that little box! The build quality, superb, the sound? Awesome, coming from a pro DJ, seriously, keep it up!"
1,"I've bought these earbuds on at least 3 separate occasions. The last two times were because I either lost them or an earbud stopped working. The sound quality is decent, great for the price of the earbuds. I cannot compare these with another of the same price range, but I can say they do come with everything you need and some extras like new inserts. Each time I got a new pair of these, they had little differences. My newest pair has over-the-ear hooks that you can mold to your ear. This has caused more problems than solutions, whereas the other hooks that weren't malleable would fit a lot more snug and quicker. However, once you get done fiddling with your earbuds they will stay tightly in place until you have to take them off, making you re-do the process when you put them on again. These earbuds are perfect for the gym, jogs, and just walking around."
1,Very easy to set up.  Works great with my smartwatch.
1,"These headphones are lightweight and have great sound quality! The buttons are easy to push and they fit very comfortably (unlike some other over the ear brands I have tried). The accessories they came with are also great quality, and the customer engagement Senso has is truly wonderful! Thanks, Senso!"
1,"Sounds ok, none of the earbuds fit except the nerf type."
1,I receive these as a gift for my birthday back in January. I like them so much that I bought them for my wife for her birthday.
1,Worked great from the very beginning. Very comfortable. Enjoy wearing and using these. Delivery was outstanding!
1,"love it. The sound is good, the battery life is good and glad I bought it."
1,"Just what the doctor ordered! I'm a Beats man, with several pairs of the cordless and cord headsets and I was actually shopping for a new set, since the sets I have don't hold a charge for more than 2hrs. However, when I saw the price for this set I purchased 3 of them. I felt that if they were garbage, then I wouldn't be so much of a loss. Nevertheless, these things ROCK and I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for amazing sound, quality, and above all price. This set actually brings a car charger, and cords for both Android and IPhone!! Who does that???!!! This company ROCKS hands down..."
1,"I like the sound quality. I would reccomend these . They fit comfortably around my ears. I have not used them in the gym yet however . Battery life seems good as I have left them in the car overnight quite a few times, and did not have to charge them the next day."
0,"Only good for gym workouts. If you are using them for anything else that might have any type of wind resistance such as biking, running, etc. they actually amplify the sound of the wind (probably due to their shape). You actually hear more noise from the wind than from the headphones. I bought them to use when I go biking and the gym but unfortunately I will only be using the at the gym."
1,"Easy to set up and connect, the buttons work as they are supposed to, the sound is good, they do however pick up a bit of headwind. Overall an excellent addition to my runs."
0,"I am sure these would be fine for walking or jogging, but for riding bike these are terrible.  Sounds like a jet engine taking off in each of your ears at any speed over 7 MPH.  Just the wrong product for my intended use."
0,Second pair with the same problem. The  hold battery will not recharge / hold a charge after a few months. Bummer.
1,"A very great set of earbuds. Great sound quality, battery life is AMAZING, but there’s some connectivity problems. It’s often hard to get it working and takes some fiddling around with, but it’s definitely worth the low price"
1,These fit my ears and don't fall out when I'm working out at the gym. Easy to use and wear.
1,Really nice sound have had for about a week no issues
1,Good
1,Great product and better customer service. 👍🏽
1,"Bought these for long distance runs. Durable and gets the job done. For the price point, well worth the investment!"
1,"Bought this product for my son and so far he loves it. Light, easy to use and does not fall off from the ear easily. Has a great sound. All in all it's an excellent headphones for a decent price. Beats the competition!"
1,"I bought two pair one for me and one as a birthday gift for my best friend. They work great and would recommend them to anyone.  We walk together on opposite sides of town an we use them, there great.  The sound is awesome."
0,It worked for couple of weeks and now just stopped working .
1,These are terrific  earbuds for the price.  Good sound quality and well constructed.
1,"These are the best!  I have had two pair of beats and tried these on a whim, I am so glad I did.  These are sweat and drizzle proof, perfect for running.  I have worn them several times in the sauna.  The battery is long lasting, even after months of use.  Great price, great product...I highly recommend."
0,"I really loved these headphones but after hearing them about a year, they suddenly stopped holding a charge and no longer work"
1,I love these headphones! They make lifting weights much easier now that I don’t have to deal with a dangling wire. Great sound and easy to set up.
1,"is the 4 time that i buy this headphones,just great i love the sound of this product"
1,LOVE my SENSO headphones! They work perfect for what I need and have a fantastic sound! ❤
0,"The section that goes behind your ear is moldable, which you think would help but it's so flimsy that it doesn't hold in place. They fall out of my ears when I run. Not happy at all. And the sound isn't that good either. I should've bought my Jabras again."
1,"Very nice headphones , really loud. I had an issue with the right ear, started playing low, but I was sent a new pair."
1,"These were delivered yesterday. About 4 days so fast delivery. First impressions: Awesome!<br />They sound fantastic, deep base, not overdone or muffled, great highs and midrange. These get very loud and do not distort. I won't be playing these anywhere near their max as the sound is very loud and clear. Pairing could not have been easier and they can pair with two devices at once (play music from one device at a time of course) so, having my Samsung Gear 2 watch and mobile phone both paired I can toggle back and forth effortlessly.<br />The quality of the headphones and design are top notch. Easy controls on the right ear bud. The fit and comfort is wonderful, with the over the ear loop, these guys are not going anywhere, though I have not had a chance to road test running. I can say that they seem snug and very comfortable. Also, I don't have to jam the buds in my ear just to get them to stay on or get excellent base out of them. The cable that connects the ear buds and goes behind the neck seems to be just the right length, not too long or to short for me.<br />The extras that come with these, long charging cable for either iPhone or Android, short USB charging cable, car lighter dual car charger and the hard shell case are wonderful. What a tremendous value!<br />To be tested is going for a run, battery life and whether these don't malfunction. Judging by what I see and hear so far, I think I won't be let down. Highly recommend so far!"
0,Uncomfortable and do not adjust well to ears. No noise cancelling ability.
1,"Very user-friendly, and the wraps are really comfortable. The battery life appears to be excellent so far as well. It's a perfect stocking stuffer, now that we're heading into the holidays..."
1,Briefly tried the product that my husband purchased.  It was fairly simple to set up and sounds decent.  Very comfortable in the ear with soft gel.  I think the Samsung earbuds that come with the product have a crisper sound.  But these are wireless!!<br />Problem:  The photo shows a 15% coupon for next purchase.  It actually comes with a 10% coupon.  You need to register to receive it.  I registered and received an email that I would receive the coupon code &#34;very soon.&#34;  Emailed them twice.  Did NOT receive code!
1,like it. sound quality is awesome. synced right up to my phone well. nicely packaged and comes with lots of goodies like chargers and diff size ear buds. just going to be hard for me to charge due to I only have fast chargers and says it will hurt this product..... also eat pain which I think has to do with ear bands. is hard to get them positioned right and hard for them to stay how I had them. maybe a sturdier material that can bend n stay how u bend it would be better. but overall awesome sound just wish ear bands were adjustable for more comfort.
1,Tested them yesterday and they worked well
1,"These headphones are great until the inevitable short.  When you do get that inevitable short*, Invotek will honor their warranty.  They are product within the physical limitations of electronic headphones with really good customer service.  This is the best value you can get for the price and perhaps a price two or three times higher.<br /><br />I use my headphones daily on my bike commute to work and around my house.<br /><br />*All headphones will have a short if you use them enough."
0,It lasted about an year. The earphones won’t charge anymore. So that’s basically a dealbreaker. I would say that it was good while it lasted. The wire connecting the 2 pieces doesn’t quite fit well behind the neck - it’s more comfortable having it in front.
0,The unit I got kept turning off randomly. I was going to use them for swimming laps and they just aren’t gonna work for it. They fall out and when the water hits them they just turn off. Returned to manufacturer.
1,"These are nice headsets for the price.  I had the equivalent Beats version that I took back after a week as they would  not hold a charge well and would randomly drop connection 10-15 seconds at a time.  I have not had this problem with the SENSO brand.  These sound just as good (though I am sure some audiophiles would debate that).  The only thing I can say negative is that if you face into the wind, they do capture a good bit of wind noise.  I tried different size earbud covers but still got the wind noise.  Im going to ding it a star for that aspect.  One other MINOR inconvenience is the rubbery nature of the band that connects the ear buds.  The band seems to &#34;grip&#34; your collar or skin at times so that when you turn your head they can pull tension on one side or the other.  In some cases, I have pulled one side out of my ear just by turning my head and not paying attention to if the cord was balanced evenly on my neck.  The solution to this was just to drape the cord in the front."
0,I am returning them because the sound quality is terrible. Super super muffled. I am not a fan of having to shove them well within my ear anyway. I'm so confused by the great reviews.
1,Those are great. They fit well in my ear without them hurting. They do seem to block out a lot of background noise. I use them at the gym and cannot tell if someone is trying to talk to me or not.
1,Tends to try to disconnect if you don't have the paired devices within a foot or so. Other than that I love them.
1,I use this for walking and listening to my music on my smartphone. It has been really nice and the sound is very good.
1,"pretty good earbud.  Not as good as the most expensive brands, but I had a lot of problems with those more expensive brands breaking.  I would much rather go with a cheaper brand like this. It stays in my ears fine."
1,"CONS<br />1. Even on min volume, it's still a bit too loud.<br />2. There's no skip/rewind button, this means you'll need to do this as you normally would on your phone.<br /><br />Long overdue UPDATE:<br />Actually there is a skip/rewind button, you need to hold down the volume button to skip/rewind."
1,These are amazing! They have great sound and are comfortable. I have bought two pairs and want to but one for each of my kids as well.
0,"Bought these for running but I couldn't even use them for working out, let alone running. These do not hold on to the ears and the slightest movement causes them to fall off."
1,Outstanding sound and ease of use.  Great product
1,ive had these for a long time and theyre still going.  would buy these again
1,"Pretty good product for the price. I've had mine for 10 months, and now the wire is going bad so the sound cuts out on the left ear if the wire is in certain positions"
1,"Fair sound quality, battery life. Use them while cutting grass and yard work. I would buy again for the price."
0,"I wanted to like these headphones, because the convenience of listing to music wirelessly while I am walking is great. The sound just isn't up to expectations. Good, rich  base sound is lacking. Even though the price of the headphones wasn't expensive, I feel that the amount paid just is not justified. I wish I had spent more and purchased  a better quality product."
1,"I was going to leave a 4 star review because, even though they work great, there was only volume control--and no &#34;&#60;&#60;&#34; / &#34;&#62;&#62;&#34; button, but then I realized that if you press and hold down the volume button it skips or rewinds the songs. I wish I could give 6 stars. They stay on. They are SUPER LOUD. They have a long battery life and are extremely comfortable."
1,Sound quality is good for the price.
0,"I just received these headphones two days ago. Since then, I have tried to get them to play without skipping. I've done everything, but even sitting right next to my phone, in my house, with no interference or movement or anything, they skip constantly. They are brand new, right out of the box, haven't left my house yet---and they skip 60-70 times a minute. I like everything else about them--they are comfortable and fit well and come with nice accessories--but they don't work. I'm so disappointed."
0,"“B A T T E R Y L O W”<br />“P O W E R O F F”<br />“P O W E R O N”<br /><br />When you advertise “noise cancellation,” do you mean “make these headphones as loud as possible so that our customers can’t hear anything outside of what they’re listening to and then advertise it as noise cancellation?” I only have my volume up a single tick on my iPhone and these headphones blast sound through my ears.<br /><br />I always get caught off guard when the headphone battery gets low. Even though I have a single tick on the volume while using these headphones, when the headphones tell me the battery is low it automatically turns the volume up to max and screams “BATTERY LOW” into my ears. If you like surprise jump scares then this product is for you.<br /><br />When I bought these headphones Amazon advertised this product at 200+ dollars going on sale for 80-90%. I thought I was getting a great deal and buying some top notch headphones for a tenth of the price, but actually the product was worth 20 bucks. Maybe I should’ve known better, but apparently either amazon or SENSO advertised this product as being at an extremely high discount rate to get more sales. False advertising at its finest, or maybe that might be a trend with products sold on amazon in general. How unfortunate.<br /><br />Now to get more into the technical side, the sound quality isn’t good or bad, which is appropriate since these headphones are only 20 dollars. They’ll get the job done. These aren’t a pair of Bose or Beats. However, when you advertise these headphones as 200+ dollars on sale for 80-90% which is the pricing range of Bose or Beats headphones, but in reality this is only a 20 dollar product, you’re expecting much more from these headphones. And obviously, since this is actually a 20 dollar product you just feel ripped off because it was advertised as really expensive.<br />Noise cancellation as stated previously is solved by Senso by blasting sound into your eardrums until you can’t hear your environment anymore. Not noise cancellation, but nice try.<br /><br />tl;dr - these headphones are not as advertised because the noise cancellation is poor and sound quality isn’t good.<br /><br /> I’m buying a new set of headphones. I’m very disappointed, annoyed, and feel cheated."
1,"Great product. I run long distance daily and keep a quick pace. These are the only headphones that successfully stay in my ears during my runs.  Sound is great, too."
0,"Constant interruption of the connection makes me feel like I'm listening to a scratched compact disc 20% of the time - for you kids out there, that means the audio skips.<br /><br />The headphones themselves are bulky and uncomfortable."
1,"Connection was easy. Sound is a little tinnie, not as much bass as I thought after reading reviews but can be corrected with equalizer. I replaced my ear buds with these and so much better. They stay in my ear and never has fallen out. Volume is good also. Give them a 4.5"
0,"Bad sound quality, cheap build. Not satisfied"
1,"Quality headphones, worth the $ - especially for an active lifestyle.  Liked this so much, I bought a second pair for my wife."
1,good quality
1,One side lost its volume after taking a shower with it<br />Plus it has a bad battery life.
1,"I've had these for almost a month now and have been using them nearly every day. They last me about 2-3 days of heavy usage, and almost a week if I only use them on my lunch break.<br /><br />The sound quality on them is pretty good, overall good response from low-end to high-end, and they can get LOUD if you need. They also do an acceptable job of blocking out unwanted sounds. These come with 3 different size earpieces so you can find the size that fits (I need to play with these too, mine slip out a bit, but I'm still using the earpieces that it shipped with.) The ear hooks are quite comfortable and completely flexible, a definite bonus for me since I wear glasses.<br /><br />My only gripe is the cord that connects the two. Having come from recently using a set of LG Tones (R.I.P.) I am somewhat used to being able to only wear one earbud at a time if needed (Such as being on a phone call at work or listening to music while I work) and not having the earbuds slide around on me. I am getting used to working with this, and have found that hooking the earbud I'm not using at that moment to my collar seems to work acceptably and doesn't pull the one in my ear around.<br /><br />Overall, a definite buy recommendation from me."
1,"I'm not going to knock the SENSO headphones too much. Most of my dissatisfaction comes from the headphones just not meeting my needs and it's impossible to know that until I've tried them out.<br />The sound is fine and the battery life is good. The ear hooks are pretty worthless. I'm a runner and I want headphones that hang ON my ear not IN my ear. The ear hooks on these are very flimsy and do not have a wire core so they're not adjustable and do almost nothing to support the headphones. So, all the weight is on the ear buds that are in your ears. You hear and feel every step. I also sweat heavily so when the sweat starts getting in my ears, they are difficult to keep in position.<br />They might work well for walkers on cyclists but I don't recommend them for runners."
1,Very comfortable and do not fall out of the ear.  Great for working out.  Easy set up and good sound.
1,Paired easily. Does exactly what I wanted it to do which was to listen to audio on my PC while exercising.
1,"The sound is pretty good, connect to your phone fast"
1,I love these. I can wear then in the shower. Haven't tried to swim with them yet.
1,"My review stars are based on what they are for the price and for how much ass it gets you. Dont just take it from me, ask your mom. Don't go expecting Bose quality or anything. I've had these for almost 2 years now and they're still going strong like aids. I run allot for work. I've never had them die or stop working for any reason. But don't run a marathon and get mad at me cuz your slow ass can't run over 26 miles in a fast enough time to still have some music. I don't keep them in the case. I'm not gentle with them. I do clean built up earwax out of the removable ear bud peice. Running for over an hour is enough running for me. Plus I got knee problems, but I don't think that comes with the headphones."
1,"Awesome! best ear buds I ever had. I likee it so much, I bought a pair for my wife in 2 days. Great nai and cleat carrot. Good buy"
1,Works great.  Bought them for the gym.
1,"I really love these - so much so that my boyfriend bought a pair. The battery lasts long and they are great for working out in, but the noise canceling quality might be too much for me on my commute in to work on the train."
1,"So far I'm liking these headphones. The quality of sound is great. My last pair didn't get loud enough for me (I like my music pretty loud when I'm working out) and these get extremely loud. I haven't gone beyond halfway on the volume for the headphones. I don't particularly like that the main button is on the side. This button pauses if pressed once, and is the power button if held down. I constantly push my headphones in to my ears, because headphones never stay in for me. The button is where I would normally adjust the headphones, so I'm getting used to avoiding that. With that being said, the part that wraps behind your ear is great on these headphones. They're very adjustable! The only other thing I would forewarn about these headphones is that for some reason, when running outside, they catch a lot of wind. So the sound of the wind is pretty loud and obnoxious. Luckily, the volume overpowers it so you can blast your music and ignore it. But I'm not sure why that happens. My last Bluetooth headphones didn't cause this much wind noise. It must be the shaping of these that causes it. This isn't a problem when working out inside, obviously. 😊<br /><br />All in all, I think these headphones are great quaity for the price! I do recommend these headphones, and I thought it was nice that it comes with a magnetic car vent mount for your phone, and the cool case for the headphones themselves."
0,Doesn't hold a charge very long and after a couple months of having them they won't turn on. It takes about 5 minutes of trying before it will eventually turn on but then it shuts down on it's own after a short while. Also started randomly pausing/changing tracks on it's own. I really liked these when i first got them and they worked properly but they just didn't hold up.
1,As described
1,"Good sound quality for price. Strong bass, decent mid and high range. Quick to connect."
1,Long lasting and very clear.. I’m in the gym atleast 2 hours daily and they never go out on me... a must buy for the price..
1,"I use the product for running, and around the house.  It works really well for music and phone calls.  The cord is a bit floppy and sometimes in the way, but still way better than a fully-corded, non-bluetooth headphone."
1,"Have used for a total of about 2 months and today the headphones stopped paring to my phone. I've tried everything I can but the product seems to refuse to connect to the phone. Any help in this matter would be great, other than that the headphones have been a great product/value"
1,"Bought these on budget to replace my preferred wired Sony headsets at 20bucks.<br />WILL NOT DISAPPOINT<br />They are a tad on the chinsy light-weight plastic side of things but that's not terrible.<br />Instant connection. I mean instant.<br />Lady's voice confirms connection.<br />Sound quality could be better but I equate that to the weight and lack of acoustics.<br />But again, these get loud enough and the sound quality is surprisingly good.<br />Would buy again."
0,"I bought this a few months ago with so less use, and now It doesn't work anymore. I sent it to an electronic store to see what is happening and they told me this is useless. The were doing proofs, but the problem is in the motherboard. So much angry now!!!"
0,"The earbuds were nice at first, but within a year the rubber casing rotted and they became a sticky junk.  Sorry that I also bought some as gifts."
1,"My wife and I both use these and have tried both the red and the blue. Sound is decent and controls are easy enough to use. But they don't last very long. Between the 2 of use we are on our 3rd set each in 4 years. Each set progressively lasted less time then the previous set. Different issues with each one. Wouldn't turn on, sound cut in and out, powered off randomly on its own, range suddenly got very short. On our last sets the voice that would tell you if you were connected was very loud and unpleasant. We keep getting these because reading reviews of other products doesn't sound like we would have better luck with something else in this price range. Also doesn't sound like if we paid more for something else that it would last longer."
0,"Ugh. So disappointed. I bought these based on the very large number of positive reviews, and they would not power on, even when fully charged. I couldn't even get them to perform a factory reset. I sent them back for a refund, and decided to give them another chance. I just got another pair today, but they have the same exact problem. I think the manufacturer better brace themselves for a lot of returns and disappointed customers, because I think they have a major quality control issue, here; their product simply does not work. In fact, the day I returned the first pair, I noticed a lot of brand new negative reviews from others with the exact same issue; that's not a coincidence. I'm sorry to say that I now have to add my voice to the growing chorus of disappointed customers. Save yourself the aggravation and  do not buy this product."
1,"Not bad headphones. Not completely noise-cancelling, and the battery doesn't last as long as I'd like, but they do what I need them to do."
1,"I love my earbuds, they are great. The sound is awesome and they are comfortable.  Thanks Invoke"
1,"I had great support from SENSO because exactly one year after purchase, just STOPPED WORKING. It is very easy to contact them and to receive support. Totally recommended!"
1,Bought these headphones for my wife. They pre charged and Bluetooth connectivity was flawless.  The sound quality is top notch.  I didn't give five stars because they're still new and I don't  know how durable they are (or will be).  May update review in future if needed.
1,"These headphones have been a treat since I received them. They were packaged so nicely, they come with a lot of stuff! There is a small carrying case with room for headphones and short charging cord, 3 foot cord to connect them to android or apple devices, 3 sets of ear bud sizes, and a car charging block. All of that for a great price. They easily connected to my android Samsung Galaxy S7. The instructions were easy to understand and showed me all features. They are super comfortable to wear, and I have small ears. I chose the smallest of the ear buds to place on the headphones and they are very soft and comfortable. The wrap around piece is also made of a soft, flexible plastic that rests comfortably behind my ear. The sound quality is great. I use in an office setting and the noise cancellation is excellent. I've experienced no buffering or connection issues with my phone. I also love that the headphones speak to you when turning them off, on, or pairing with your phone so you know what they are doing. I have not needed to charge them yet, but based on a friends recommendation, the battery lasts for a long time. Would recommend to others!"
1,Very good quality. Great price and sound is amazing.
1,I love these headphones! They are exactly what I was looking for when looking for wireless earbuds. And the quality is great for the price! I also liked the little carrying case and extra bud covers that came with it.  I with the charging cable was longer and came with a biscuit because I'm having to use the biscuit that came with my phone charger to charge my headphones.
1,I'm going to buy another pair for my father. Customer service is marvelous. Thanks for everything.
1,Got them yesterday and went out running this morning.<br />The headphones are comfortable and do not fall off.
1,I am not much on ear buds but these work well. The sound is ok.  Too much bass and no adjustment.
1,"Best quality and sound of all my other Bluetooth headphones, will defiantly buy again and refer to friends<br />A 5 star purchase"
0,"I really like these headphones and they have been very reliable. I have recommended them to 4 other people on my team. Unfortunately, they only have a lifespan of about 1.5 years, which is good, but I wish they hadn't just gone out on me! All of a sudden they have stopped working and shut off while  I'm listening, even though they are fully charged. Huge bummer."
1,"Awesome sound, super fast delivery!"
1,These sound great and came really fast. Love the combo charging cable that also charges an iPhone. Wonderful sound for the price.
1,"I’ve been using these earbuds for about four months and agree with the positive reviews except for one shortcoming: the time duration between the first audio signal of low battery strength and the actual shutdown is only about 20 minutes (the user guide says it is several hours, but that’s not been my experience). There is a red indicator light on the ear buds that indicates low battery, but that light is useless unless you’re continuously looking in a mirror.<br /><br />Otherwise it’s a great product, especially for the price."
1,"High quality sound. Nice design. Comfy. The only issue I noted is this really really really weird softwae issue in where sometimes It cant read text to speech . Strange right? It just like poops out for that one single function. Like my mac can play all things sound, but then boom. One issue. I doubt this is an issue unless you use text to speech a lot. Like myself. I think it deserves 4 stars as it is better my most metrics to most things of the same price, but it has that one funny issue"
1,Very happy. One of the best set's of ear buds I've ever owned. Thank You.
1,"Bought them for my husband for the gym, he loves them, been using  them for over a year. He’s very particular."
0,Slow to charge. Only one successful connect with lPhone.
1,"The only issue I have is it's difficult to plug in the charger to the headphones.  Other than that, I love them especially for the price."
1,Can't beat the price and quality of my Senso earbuds. We own several sets.
1,For 30 bucks you cant beat this
0,Problem with headphones. Had less than 3 months. Will update review when I hear from seller.
1,"Just received them and have about 3 hours use. So far, so good. One thing I noticed is they paired up with my smartphone with no problem at all and quickly. Great sound!<br />Thanks"
1,"These are awesome. Only thing is if they are connected to my phone and my phone is in my back pocket, they struggle."
0,They sound great but have a bad bluetooth range. I lose connection with it in my front pocket.
0,"Worked great for the first few charges. after that, the headphones lose their connection randomly when my phone is in my pocket.  its fine if I leave the phone on the counter or charging nearby."
0,No one can hear me loud enough. Mic is in the ear piece.<br />I do not understand how can it possibly work.
1,"These are the second pair I have bought,  VERY affordable, long battery life 3+ hours, decent sound. I am rough on headphones and these held up for a long time, especially for the price."
1,"These headphones have fantastic sound just as advertised! The bass is great and treble is clear! However, like so many reviewers before me (that I ignored since these were at such a great sale price) said, they ARE SO LOUD OH MY GOODNESS!! Way too loud!! I had to put it at the lowest volume level possible and set the equalizer to &#34;Late Night&#34; just to be able to safely listen to them! Even with some songs they are too loud!"
1,"These sound great and I bought 2 because I thought battery might die out quickly. They lasted almost 8 hours everyday. I like the smaller ear inserts than the ones they had on them already. It really comes with a lot of stuff. A cigarette charger, 2 extra wires an an apple charger and a case. It came with a lot for the price."
1,"My wife's Senso headphones just arrived.  We connected them and we were immediately impressed with the comfort, quality of sound, and the volume control. They were a replacement set for a different brand that stopped operating.I'm thinking of ordering a 2nd pair of the Senso headphones to replace my current Bluetooth headset. I've lost some hearing in my right ear and I just thought that was the reason why with my right ear I could only barely hear the music with my headphones. When I tried the Senso headphones I was excited to hear the music loud and clear with my right ear. I'll give an update in a month and share if my wife and I are still as impressed as we are today."
0,"I have had these for a while now. tried them in various situations and with a brand new phone. results the same. They are ok for listening to music but useless for phone calls. every time I try to use them I get the same from the other end of the line.. your breaking up... I cannot hear you.. if the is any noise around then the become nothing but ear plugs. Tonight from a quiet living room the person I called could not understand anything I was saying. I pulled them out and went back to speaker phone.<br />Sorry SENSO, these suck."
1,Nice fit and sound. Great for making a weekend of chores more enjoyable. No need to hear the d/a neighbor screaming at the kids or revving every engine he owns to &#34;clean the carb&#34;.
1,"I've owned many of these, and they're okay. I bought for the gym, and they're bulky enough to hurt my ears. I had more success after switching to a larger sized ear plug, but I still cannot wear these for more than an hour. The button annoyingly can make a call if pressed wrong, which can be awkward during gym workouts. Over all it lost two stars for the uncomfortable feel, and the way it works."
0,Bummer. Started out fine but cuts out about 50 times a song. Blue tooth radio seems to be an issue. Can't use them with my phone in my pocket. I may try another set but other reviews are doubtful
1,"Damn good headphones for the money...outlasted the 3 different sets of BEATS that I have bought...got so mad after the last ones went out, I just threw them away!"
1,Sound quality is awesome! Comparable to expensive earbud brands. Would definitely recommend.
1,"These have great sound, easy to install, comfortable to wear.  Amazing range...packaging says use within 3 feet of bluetooth device.  I got all the way down the hall at work and suddenly realized I could still hear the music from my desk, well over 50 feet away.  Very comfortable to wear for extended periods.  Most earbuds are too large and my ears hurt after just a short time, but these came with different sizes and smaller size works perfectly.  Sound is clear and crisp.  Haven't tried exercising with them, but just walking and moving around at work, they seem to stay put just fine."
1,Really easy to pare with good sound. Cant believe they were only $25
1,I am impressed by the quality of the audio produced by these ear buds. They paired with my iPhone 5 SE on the first attempt.
0,Would not buy again stopped working after 2 weeks
0,"I have used similar earphones from mpow for workouts. Got this since the old one stopped working after a year and some months. Just by looking at this product, I can say the build quality is poor compared to my old ones. Gave it a shot since I didn't want to step out to do the return. With 4-5 light workout sessions, it is dead now. It was decent sound quality when it was working."
1,I just got my new Bluetooth headphones and the clarity of music and radio is excellent. For the price I consider this product a &#34;bang for your bucks&#34;
1,hear clearly
1,"Love these! Easy to use, light weight and the sound is amazing! I go to a fairly loud gym and the noise cancelling feature is awesome!"
1,"I have only had the head phones for one full day! And already deserve a 5 star rating.  Sound quality is excellent,  build quality is excellent, ease of use is excellent, price was excellent.  Very pleased with my purchase so far."
1,"Great product, fast delivery, love it"
1,Good headphones and fast delivery.
0,Dead and won't charge after 5 months.
1,I had an issue with the headphones not working anymore and the support they provided to me was excellent.  Fast response and resolution of the issue.
1,Awesome headphones. Use with my gym workouts. For the price you cant go wrong.
1,"The Senso headphones produce great sound quality. They do a good job of cancelling outside noise and are very comfortable. I had a power and connectivity issue, but Senso customer service responded to me immediately via email and after reviewing the issue, have sent a replacement unit. Very easy to deal with Senso."
1,"Can’t beat the price, I waited a few months before I decided to write the review. Sound quality is four out of five, quality overall five out of five."
1,Price worthy!
1,"Great headphones, easy to use and comfortable. For the price you can't beat them."
1,"I bought these for working after I got tired of catching my headphone cables on everything around me and ripping them out of my ears or my phone. The sound is excellent, battery life is good, and they work like a charm."
0,These were great until they weren't. I had been enjoying these for almost a year but then they up and died all of the sudden. I'm so sad.
1,These are the best!  My wife tried mine and has ordered them for herself.  Reasonably priced for a great quality product.
1,"They don't jump around or fall off my ears as I run or lift, amazing."
1,"These work. The battery doesn't last surprisingly short or long. The connection is lost if you walk down a long hallway, but stays connected in a somewhat large room. The only real complaint is that they don't stay in my ears very well even with the little arm that goes behind my ear. The arm is too large and doesn't actively rest on my ear but it is there if they fall out. When I run or doing intense activity where I sweat, they twist forward in my ear and eventually fall out."
1,"These are my first pair of wireless headphones and I'm pretty impressed! I have worked out in them 3 times and they sound great, they don't get destroyed by my sweat, and they stay in place.  Like other reviewers have said if you're used to $200 beats then these might not be for you but for me, they are perfect.  At 30 bucks they are definitely worth it!<br /><br />Love how the battery level shows up on my phone and I can adjust the volume on the ear piece.  Only thing it doesn't do is allow me to change songs which isn't a big deal.<br /><br />Give these a try!"
1,Had them for a week now. Way better then the Beats headset by Apple. Will update in a few months.
1,"Great . Pair with my iPhone have no problems . Charge super fast and battery life is long ! Would recommend"""
1,Are a little to big
1,Good sound stays in ear
1,Best ones I've found that handle sweat everyday and don't fall out and need adjusted while working out.
1,Excellent sound comfortable fit with optional earbud ends I like its angled design to fit in my ear and the controls are easy to use I haven't tried them swimming yet but can't wait to give them a try
1,Got these as a gift for my son...He loves them!
1,"this is the best headphone i ever owned ... and I had a lot<br />robust Bluetooth . great fit , leather light , good sound quality ,,,, durable like a crocks .... and the best thing , is accurate controls , as opposed to other headsets that are VERY complicated ... highly recommended"
1,perfect
0,"For the price, these work great until they break.  I used mine frequently over the span of about 12-18 months and then they break and won't turn on.  I bought a second pair and the same thing happened. If you expect these to work for multiple years I reccomend a different brand."
1,Power on button no longer worked as of aug 21 from purchase in February Battery life is ok for workouts but I can't say for work. I work in loud environment so the noise level is moderate high for music and battery last around 6 hours roughly. My main gripe is the static and chatter connecting to my phone via Bluetooth. It isn't every time but enough to cause aggravation. Fit is good and controls are fine. $30 set of headphones is what you get....
0,"not comfortable for use and connection fails after a few feet., sound is not so great either."
1,Just received my new Sensos and I am getting used to the controls and  putting them on and off.<br />So far so good.  The Fidelity is better than all the other earbuds I've tried and better than my Logitech Headset.  Once I get Bluetooth connected to my desktop I will check out the sound quality and hopefully follow up on this review.<br />I don't use the unit for sports so that is a caveat for people who read the reviews but the comfort level is very good after an hour of wearing them.
0,"I wanted to love these, trust me, I've been on the hunt for a good pair of earbuds to hike and run in, but these were not only uncomfortable and clunky feeling, they would not stay on my ears - had to adjust them constantly. They also did not pair with my ipod nano 7 - can't say that it is definitely these that were the problem, may be the bluetooth on the iPod, but I did connect the iPod to other things without. My ears are on the smaller side, and I did try using the different size ear bud covers but I'm returning these. If you have bigger ears, maybe they will stay put."
1,Excellent product so far!
1,used it with my S7 and have had no problems with it.
1,They sound and fit great
1,Great product. Great customer service. Thanks!
0,Very poor sound - Bluetooth connection was also poor. Kept losing signal if I was just a few feet away.
1,"Extremely impressed by bass and sound quality. Comes with additional chargers, great case, extra sizes for your ears! My old iPhone headphones used to give me ear aches bc they were too big. Great quality overall! I am not giving 5 stars only bc I've only had them for a day so I don't know how they hold up yet!"
1,"I had a pair of LG headphones before these, and those were really expensive, these are almost as good."
0,Charging port broke after 2 months.
1,I am pleased with the purchase which was delivered on time and as described.  I charged the unit and it works very nice and I think the sound<br />quality is excellent with good base.  The fit is very comfortable as well.  I have given it a 5 star because there is nothing short of an awesome<br />experience surrounding the product and seller.
1,"I love these headphones, they're clear and comfortable.  I stepped on my first pair and ordered another!!"
1,I recently purchased the Senso Bluetooth headphones in lieu of spending another 100 or so for Bose or other brands. Let me tell you I am very impressed by not only the sound but the comfort of these headphones. Thank you great product.
1,"So far I’m enjoying them so far, quick and easy to pair"
1,"Work great, fit great. Never have an issue with these during my workouts which are primarily H.I.T with a lot of movement."
1,Comfortable on all ear sizes and good sound. The only but is when the phone moves the connect comes and goes.
1,Lightweight & easy to use.
1,Reasonable price!!!! Comfortable and they stay in when I run!!!! Good sound quality for the price!!!!!! Connected to my iPhone easily and the carrying case and extra items that came with the ear buds is awesome!!!!
0,Extremely flimsy.
1,"great sound ,great fit."
1,Great headphones; the most comfortable headphones I ever had in my life also a bargain price for the quality offered.
1,not sure why but it beeps when you cut it on but doesn't play music
1,"I use mostly while running, the sound is perfectly fine.  The buds stay in place and don't fall out.  The instructions for set up are easy to follow and the storage box is great too."
0,I was impressed by the reviews and bought this with a lot of expectations. However i was extremely disappointed. It doesn't fit comfortably in my ear. I tried changing the angle and seeing. It still sucks. It hurts in my ear when i laugh - because of the way it fits in my ear. And the signal kept going off in between. I would lose it at public places mostly. The minute i get into the bus or when there is a small crowd( 5-10 people ) it would go off. Either volume will increase/decrease or the music would keep breaking in- between. Its  been this way since the first use. Very disappointed!!!
1,"Great Headphones! Comfortable too, I wear them while running for 30-40 minutes at a time. They also stay in my ears."
1,Decent Bluetooth headsets. They sound great decent battery. The range is kind of hit or miss.
0,"They last 4 months on my 3rd pair, very very disappointed."
0,Failed to pair
0,These did not even last me two months.
1,Excellent value. Great fit and amazing sound quality.
1,I've been let down before by many headphones for running; but this by far is my favorite so far and can't wait to keep using it!
1,Good deal for the price. I use these headphones on my morning run. They stay in place and last a week per charge. The sound quality isn't perfect (things tend to sound a little muffled) but I can tolerate it.
1,"Nice design, earhooks a little stiff but not uncomfortable. Sound bass-heavy but clear, EQ adjustment really brought out the nuances in the music. Haven't worked out with them yet to check BT connectivity, hope they are better than most. Accessories included are a nice touch - hard case, 2 in 1 long charging cable, car charger and another charging cable - and make them a great value."
1,"So they worked great for 2 weeks, until I accidentally put them in the dryer... Right ear bud stopped working, but then after a few days began working like normal."
0,Can’t be charged or used after 6 months! They worked good though but think I’ll go with another manufacturer this timer
1,Good price cord short but over all these are great to use
1,"I have tried other Bluetooth ear buds and did not like them because I could hear swishing noise while I walked.  These are surprisingly comfortable and have really good sound.  I didn't change out anything even though they come with several sets of ear buds.  They are easy to operate, stay comfortably in my ear but not too snug.  I have another pair of custom fit noise canceling earphones by Sensaphonics which are wonderful but they really do isolate out other noise and you can't still carry on any conversation if necessary.  I like these reasonably priced ear buds because they cancel most of the outer noise but not all of it.  Very pleasantly surprised.  The only complaint I have is that the marking for left or right ear is almost impossible to see even with a magnifying glass."
1,Excellent right out of the box.....paired easily with my phone. You may have to adjust the equalizer settings to get the best sound preference.
1,I'm looking forward to using them on my next run to see how they perform.
1,Is cheap and does what its meant to do. Please note: Any other review that uses the word &#34;noise cancellation&#34; really haven't used noise cancelling headphones.
1,Great sound for the price.  The headphones stay securely in place while running.  Can't beat the price
1,love it
1,"I love these things.  I use them for work, for workouts, and for leisure.  Battery life is pretty good.  The one thing that bothers me is that the piece that ties the two earphones together.  Sometimes this will get caught awkwardly on my neck which can cause one of the earphones to get pulled out of my ears.  Happens more in active situations like running."
1,"Sound is good, stays in place while I workout and has good range. Very happy with the product."
1,They are exactly what I need and without the cost.
1,"great reception  and  sound. user friendly,  perfect fit on me."
1,"Great bit of technology, works seamlessly with my phone and Kindle.  Now I can watch Prime movies or videos with great sound.  Very light and comfortable with the small ear peaces and easy to pair with devises, once I read ALL the instructions, it only took a couple of minutes.  Good value for the price and has all the gear packed into the easy to use case.  Happy old guy."
1,"Only two days in but works great so far.  Nice sound and battery life, easy instructions, and simple to pair with my iPhone 7."
1,"Works wonderfully, received it within a few days of ordering."
1,Fantastic wireless headset that I use at the gym everyday has great battery life and will not fall off no matter how fast I'm running how high I'm jumping or what I'm doing they stay in place and stay in my ear without having to always reinsert the buds
1,"Also the sound quality deserves 5-star, there are serious flaws with this headset: 1) BT connection is not solid when riding the bike and the phone is in the short pocket and moving.  You have to carry your phone in front pocket; otherwise, it's useless.  2). Promised 33 feet range may work only if you have the line of sight.  If you have a phone around the corner - even 10 ft away - the connection is not steady.  3) Aerodynamics are bad: the is very load whistles if you try to listen while wind is blowing ( even 20 m/h wind overrides the music).<br />I cannot understand why people are so happy with this set:  after all, it failed the test for most outdoor activities.<br />The set sits comfortably on your ears but noise cancellation is next to none.  I had other phones doing better job and costing less.<br />I may keep it because the sound is great:  rich treble and deep bass."
1,These buds are amazing. Fit is great and quality is awesome.
0,"I am writing this review because the majority of reviews are written within the first week and do not reflect the product's performance over a reasonable period of time. These headphones worked moderately well for the first few months (there were some connectivity issues at times, but I figured they were fine enough for the price). However, these are advertised as waterproof, and they certainly did not live up to that standard. In the shower a week after purchase, they immediately cut off. I assumed they were broken, but a day later they turned back on after drying out. This happened another time in the shower, prompting me to not wear them near water anymore. Then, just over 3 months into owning the headphones, they cut out randomly during one of my workouts. Again, a day later, they were restored (maybe they cut out due to the water from sweat?). And finally, last week, they cut out for good. Will not turn back on. I am just outside of the return window, so I have to eat this cost.<br /><br />I know there are a lot of positive reviews. But as consumers, we need to be aware of how companies are manipulating Amazon's review process. They are drowning out the real, authentic experiences, like the one I am documenting here. I recommend against buying these headphones, as you will most likely be replacing them in 3-6 months. Good luck!"
1,"I tried the Senso Bluetooth headphones today for the first time. Other than a directional issue w/ my phone, I was pleased w/ both the sound<br />and comfort."
0,"Item has already stopped working.<br />When they did work,  the sound and controls were good. The fit was great. I bought them in July, and by January they died."
1,Very good wish battery life was better
1,Works well. Battery lasts. Good price and excellent customer service.
1,"The sound quality and fit of these headphones is great. Also received them fairly quickly. They fit well and the overall design it really good.<br /><br />The only complaint is not from me but from the people I talk to on the phone. They all complain about the same thing and that's the terrible Echoing they hear of their end. Not sure why this occurs but as soon as I switch the output to the iPhone speaker, the problem goes away. Maybe it's some setting that I've missed but everyone I try to talk to on the phone with these complains about the Echoing.<br /><br />Otherwise I'm happy with the fit and sound quality."
1,"sometimes, it takes relatively long time for the phone to recognize it as an earplug. Before that, the music won't play via it."
1,"Great headphones for it's price. The sound quality with the bass isn't equal to premium active headphones such as Beats or Bose, but it does get the job done. Pairing to the phone is very easy and the packaging comes with some cool accessories like a small usb, car magnet and some extra plugs to interchange with the headphones. Great value for it's price, and I will probably be buying another pair as a gift."
1,Very nice Bluetooth headphones. Very comfortable and light weight. Work very well. Very reasonably priced. May buy an extra pair.
1,"This was my favorite pair of headphones for a few months. The sound quality is great and so is the volume. The controls on the side are easy to use when exercising. However, one day I plugged them in to charge and they just wouldn't charge. Tried to leave them plugged in overnight and nothing happened. After a few days of trying I just threw them out."
1,"They are cheap, and they give you very cheap sound."
0,"Great headphones that I use when I workout, while at work, or when going for a walk. Hold a charge for a really long time and has good sound quality. Would definitely recommend.<br /><br />Update: Less than a year later, after raving about these to several people they just stopped working. The power button no longer presses in. Now on the hunt for a new pair of inexpensive quality wireless headphones. I'm so upset these don't work anymore!!"
1,"This is my update. This product offers excellent price-performance-reliability for earplugs, especially at this price-point. I have had mine for 3 years and are going strong.  The one ding is that the shelf life of a charge is not very long.  So, I charge mine overnight and they are ready to use in the a.m.. 4+ hours of constant listening.  Enjoy!<br /><br />Original Review;  This product would be 5-star as far as I can tell in the few days I have used them.  Very easy to set up with two devices and the instructions are very well written to be operational in a few minutes. The sound quality is great and the noise canceling is great on a plane as well.  My only issue is the lack of low volume control.  The lowest setting on my old APPLE wired headset is perfect in a quiet environment.  SENSO lowest volume setting, iPhone X is also set at the lowest setting, the unit is still too loud in a quiet environment. I will do another airline trip with them because this is the best value for sure!"
1,"I bought these in October 2017. Sounds is great. Fit is great. No problems. I wore them to the gym every day and they worked really well... Until this morning (March 19). I went to turn them on and they just did not turn on. So in my case, they only worked well for about 5 months."
1,It's amazing
1,sound is good alot  of bass if ur into that seemed ok for the first 5 min but they skip alot  fit was ok  there not for me going to return  not happy
1,"Great Bluetooth Headphones! I have a set of Beats, too. We compared them as soon as I got the SENSO package. I am so impressed with the sound and quality. I've tried other Bluetooth Headphones that were cheap and sounded worse than the speakerphone. Not these! I love these."
0,Malformed ear cushions
1,Great price and awesome equipment no more wires 😬
1,"Great sound, comfortable. Great price."
1,"Great sound, long battery life and supportive and comfortable fit in the ear. All around an amazing product, by far the best bluetooth sports headphone of the three I have owned."
1,Amazing!
1,These thump!  My ears aren't the easiest to fit...these fit great even while working out.  The sound is great too...and I am a person who  usually would rather hear music coming out of my car/home stereo...not so with these.
0,I had to return these immediately. The bass was so distorted and poor that it made it hard to listen to at all.
1,"These are 2 star headphones, but a 3-4 star buy for the $30 price tag.  I have taken these on atleast 12 runs and use pretty regularly working around the house or garage.  The sound quality overall is pretty good.  Here are the basic pros and cons experienced.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Price Point (obviously)<br />- Comfortable<br />- Sound Quality is Good<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Have had issues with the Bluetooth connectivity.  I have had to ‘forget device’ and reestablish the link multiple times on my phone (iPhone 6S Plus)<br />- Bass is slightly too deep in my opinion.<br />- The minimum allowable volume does not go low (quiet) enough.  I run with a group and would like to be able to turn the volume down just one more notch, but can’t.  I would like to hear it, but still be able to hear conversations around me.  I know this is probably a rare issue with most.<br />- Expereince distortion on and off during every use.  It is not a huge deal, but it is like listening to a CD (for those how remember those) with some light scratches...sound just gets ‘choppy’ here and there.<br />- The ‘last number redial’ feature is HORRIBLE and i wish it didn’t exist.  It is cold here in Oklahoma, so have been wearing gloves during my runs and have inadvertently called people more than I can count while trying to pause the sound (because the volume doesn’t get low enough as mentioned).  Luckily my wife has received most of these calls, but I have called work related people, which is embarrassing.  The feature is worthless in my opinion.<br /><br />Ultimately, I am OK with my purchase and will continue to use these for the time being.  The price is right and overall most of the drawbacks are minor."
1,Easy set up. Good sound.
1,Excellent quality. Very happy wearing these while working out with weights and running.
0,Product  arrived broken.  Unable to charge device due to charging attachment on earpiece pushed into earpiece.  Returning product for higher quality product.
0,"I'm trying to decide how I feel about these wireless headphones. I bought them because my last set (Platronics) had finally crapped out. I didn't want to spent $80 on another set, and the Platronics didn't perform well in the gym. They were designed to allow external sounds into the ear as well as music, for safety reasons. But, the Platronics were overwhelmed by the gym's music system and when walking, road noise. So, I settled on the Senso headphones because they were reasonably priced, they supposedly had noise cancellation capability, and the reviews on sound quality were good.  But .......<br /><br />I just got the product from Amazon this week and I've used them at the gym on three seperate days. On each of those days the Blutooth crapped out about the same time sweat began to appear in and around my ears. Attempts to restart the connection, restart Spotify, and changing the order of attempt steps ... all failed.  I tried waiting five minutes and trying again, no dice. At one point I thought it might be something in the gym environment, so I left the gym while I was still a bit sweaty, went to my car, tried again. No dice. I could tell the headset was trying to reconnect with the cell (iPhone 6s) and it would succeed for a second or two and then drop.<br /><br />So, after these failures, I would take the buds out of my ears, leave them for 15 to 20 minutes, try them again, and everything would be working fine. I'm going to give them one more try this weekend and if it's another fail, I'm sending them back.<br /><br />I want this product to work because the sound quality is pretty good.<br /><br />There's one other concern. I normally don't expect headphones used for exercise to last more than 6 to 8 months. Between sweat and gym activity, it's a tough environment for headphone survival. This set has a connector wire between the &#34;phones,&#34; and I am extremely skeptical about it's surviving that long.<br /><br />It's possible I may keep this product and just use it for listening at home or while doing more gentle activities, but I'd really like to see if the product design is the problem or if it's this particular set.<br /><br />UPDATE: I attempted to resolve my issues using advice from Senso Support ... which was a repeat of info found in the instructions. It made the problem worse. So, I went through the 1900 negative reviews and noticed Bluetooth issues were a fairly common problem. I'm sure the company will figure out whatever issues they may have with Bluetooth, but in the meantime, I reordered the wireless Platronics Backbeat Fit. They're more expensive, they are not designed for noisy environments, but the product is sturdy and highly functional, and the sound produced is good quality.<br /><br />This whole experience had me wondering about Amazon's &#34;Best Buy&#34; designation and the draw of high numbers on &#34;sponsored products.&#34; Checking against independent resources like CNET or cell phone sites, there are significant differences between what Amazon sponsors and what independent sites label as best buys. For me, it just means that I have to avoid mistaking review numbers as the deciding factor in what I buy and to look at resources other than Amazon when determining what I want. Buyer beware, I guess."
0,"Owned these for 1 month and they have stopped working. Won't turn on. When I plug them in the blue fully charged indicator light activates, however when I try to turn them on: NOTHING. When I try to turn them on when they're plugged in it gives 3 tones indicating I can't turn them on when they're charging which means their internal battery is fubar. I was wondering why they were selling so cheap. Well, you get what you pay for."
1,"Super easy to connect. Loved the ""freebies"" that were included. Happy to have music when working out. Makes a dull workout fun. Have used them in the pool and no issues. I do not swim with them, I use them for water aerobics only. No issues at this point."
1,these are great...great sound..after my Bose just quit ordered these and really happy with the sound and price.
1,Happy
0,You get what you pay for. Cheap headphones for cheap quality sound. Can’t walk more than 5-10 feet from the phone before it breaks up as well as if you receive a text or email it disrupts the signal. Use them at the gym so far seeatproof has held up well. The cord is light which is nice ear coverings can get a little unccomfortable.
0,I do not like these headphones because they do not fit securely on the ears. I ordered them because earbuds are uncomfortable and keep popping out. I thought these would be better. They are not. I am returning them and requesting a refund.
1,So far these are a nice pair of headphones.  I am able to jog with these headphones without a problem.
0,"Ordered them in December, 2018. I finally had the opportunity to try the headphones. It was my first and extremely frustrating experience using a Bluetooth Device. They are muffled when applying pressure to them (to fit them in the ear properly). They are very high tone, when no pressure is applied. (Pushing them in, assists in a truer, but, poor tone.) I would prefer to return them for a better quality sounding headset, or, receive a refund. It took me over an hour to figure out how to get them to work. After doing so, it was nothing more than a disappointment. All the ear cushions are the same size (exception of one pair) None of them fit in the ear canal properly and they are all very difficult to switch on and off the headset. The power button easily turns off/ on while adjusting the ear piece. All 3 of my dollar store wired ear buds have a much nicer fit and sound quality. Would be nice to find a nice pair of wireless headphones with a healthy quality sound. I am not satisfied with these at all."
1,I had a pair Of these for a couple of years that were great! But they wore out so ordered another. These don’t seem to have the same sound quality as the others I had. I’m hoping that after I change out the ear pieces and have a better fit in the ear that they’ll sound better. Crossing fingers..
1,Very good headphones!
0,Ear hooks are large and flimsy.  I don't have small ears but need to constantly place them back on as they fall off while running.  May work fine for lower impact activities but I wouldn't purchase them for running.
1,"These headphones are great. The sound is clear and the base is good. And senso customer service is amazing. In 4 emails I was able to get a new pair because mine had broke after about 3 months, that is the only concern I have about them. I defiantly recommend their products."
1,"First off, these headphones are really good. The sound quality, with the memory foam type ear tips, is extremely clear and has an excellent bass quality. The battery lasts all day and they charge quickly. They don't fall off my ears or come out of place. They are comfortable and light weight for having such a lasting battery. I haven't had any trouble connecting them to my blackberry q10 or my iPhone 6. The customer service is outsatanding. They have gone above and beyond for me and treated me like I was their only customer, which I'm sure I'm not. I am so glad I didn't spent two or three times the money on Bose or beats &#34;by apple&#34;. These compare quite closely to them and I'd say this is a company to keep an eye on, for sure."
1,The sound is rich and the controls are very simple to use.  The earpieces come in 3 different sizes and they are soft foam that conforms to the ear instead of hard silicone.  The case is a nice hardshell to protect the earbuds while in a gym bag.  Thr company emailed me shortly after delivery to make sure I was satisfied and reminded me that these have a 1 year warranty.  I'd rather spend my miney in thesr than any of the Plantronics earbuds that I've used in the past and stopped charging after a few months.
1,"the only thing I have noticed that I don't like about these headphones is wind noise--As in when I am running and a breeze comes I can hear it clearly blowing on/through the headphones. It doesnt make it so I can't hear my music, but it is new to me as I have never had headphones that did that."
1,Very good
1,Fits nicely-as described. Sound is great. Light and actually stay in. Great product for the price.
0,"After using it minimally for 6 months, it's now dropping off bluetooth every 10-15min and reconnecting after a second or two. Very annoying"
1,"Quality is okay, but the battery life is phenomenal"
0,These lasted only one year and just quit working.  Buy something with more quality!
1,They have a very nice sound and range. I have moved around my house without any problems. I have recommended them to my friends.
1,"Great headphones, and an even better price. Connection was very simple, and works on multiple devices."
0,only had for one month and will not keep a charge :(
1,"** Update ** The manufacturer replaced my faulty pair with minimal fuss (just a few emails exchanged). Replacement arrived quickly, and work well. I take it back about Senso!<br /><br />I bought these 5 months ago. They're already dead, after fairly light usage on my part. The sound is decent - not amazing, but good for the price. The bluetooth can be a little sketchy - I frequently had to disconnect and then reconnect to my iPhone.<br />But hey, that's all irrelevant now - these things don't even last through the summer. Not buying Senso again, that's for sure."
1,My ear buds got to me quickly and work very well so far. It will even hook up to both my phone and iPad at the same time. I love it.<br />Thank you
1,Had it for two days.  Works great and charge holds up.
1,Sound quality - excellent.  Consistent bluetooth connection.  Only issue is the floppy ear hooks.  The darn things wouldn't hold the speakers in my ear!
0,it falls off easily when you are jogging.
1,The headphone is very light and comfy and the audio quality is high for the price.<br />Way better than all headphones I used before.
1,1 month later still going strong. Sound is great as well as battery life. Highly recommend.
1,So far these are the only headphones that comfortably fit my small ears and stay on during a workout. Much better than the headphones that costs hundreds and sound quality is also great for this price point!
1,These replace some Klipsch ear buds. Ten times better
1,"Comfortable , its nice that there are different ear bud sizes. They stay in place while running but they are loud. I know this younger generations wants to blast their ear drums out their heads but me not so much I have to have it at the lowest setting. Not a con just preference."
1,They dont fall out while I run (yay!) and the battery lasts a lot longer than I thought it would
1,For the price you cannot get better... good bass... sound is good... noise cancellation good... Sound is clear but not crystal clear... love them...
0,"Now, I only paid $36 for these- reduced from $169!<br /><br />So I am disappointed with them at $36, imagine if you paid full price!<br /><br />What is wrong, well;<br />-they do not stay in once you get really sweaty<br />-the loops are flimsy and do not really secure the phones<br />-the buds create an air tight seal when fitted properly - to aid noise suppression I guess - but this means that it feels like you are under water, plus you hear every footfall when running inside your head - like a dull thud.<br />-So no good for running - which is how they are sold- but would be good on aircraft etc I guess.<br /><br />Not tried the microphone so cannot comment on this part.<br /><br />Back to the drawing board"
1,Love these Headphones so much that I ordered another pair for my Daughter!
1,Initially I received a bad set.  The company worked with me to try to fix them.  When that did not work I was given a new set. Thanks for all of your help in making it right.  Great sound and an even better value.
1,"Decent quality sound for the price, and they fit well in my ears."
1,GREAT PRODUCT FOR THE MONEY
1,Gave it 4 stars because I don't like Black headphones and they only come in 1 color. Also the ear hook is not adjustable and I have small ears. Other than that they connect easily the range is really good the charge lasts long and extra pieces you get was an unexpected bonus! A must have!
1,I have only used them once but they are just what I wanted. They seem sturdy and I really like that they came with a protective case. The only thing some users may not like is that they are a little bulky to wear but it's more cosmetic than anything. Good for the price.
0,"Headphones stopped working after a few months. Wont connect to Bluetooth even though they are fully charged. They were good while they lasted, but I would not recommend the product to family or friends."
0,"I buy at least 2 of these a year because I unfortunately lose them. So I typically buy these and somehow picked this one up.<br /><br />Out of all of them, these were by far the worst. They lose the connection to the phone constantly and are impossible to reconnect. And even harder to actually cut on and get them connected. I have to cut them on twice in order to get them to work. Very awkward when I'm accepting business calls.<br /><br />After a couple of months I think they have gotten worse. I went and ordered my regular ones and haven't been happier. These are my backup and even there they make it replaced."
1,I love these!  They actually stay in my ear unlike others.
1,"These work well and are much more comfortable than my last pair of wireless earbuds.  My only complaint is that they are not &#34;noise cancelling,&#34; as advertised.  I'm not all that upset about it though.  If you're looking for top-of-the-line features and quality you aren't in the market for $30 earbuds like these."
1,Incredible value.  Excellent product with 3 sizes of earplugs.  Great stereo sound.
1,It is without reservation I give t his product 5 stars! The quality of the sound is amazing. Can't say enough about this product. It has so many pluses I can't count them all. Just buy it!
1,"They sounded good, were light, comfortable, all of that. One of the ear buds broke off after a couple of weeks. Maybe it was my fault for not keeping it in the case, but I didn't expect for them to break thy easily."
1,"Purchased on May 29th.  Stopped charging yesterday.  Tried several different cables and chargers.<br /><br />Charged these less than 10 times since purchase.  Very disappointed.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Updates!<br /><br />Customer service at Senso is awesome!  Quick response by email and stand by their product warranty!<br /><br />Pretty sure I had a fluke pair.  Cannot wait for the replacements to arrive!<br /><br />---<br /><br />Updates!<br /><br />It is October 11th, and my 4th set are on the way.  Newest set charged once, and never again.<br /><br />While the customer service is amazing, the product quality... ehhh, maybe not so much.  Charged the last set using ONLY the supplied 12v adapter and still crapped out."
1,"I've ordered this at least 4 times and they all have different sound quaities. I'm keeping the last one I ordered, however I'm looking elsewhere for new headphones."
1,Sound good
1,The ear bud is not too comfortable if I wear it for more than 30 minutes.
1,Love these earbuds First pair of bluetooth earbuds. Try to walk 6 miles each day. Nice not having a wire hanging between my phone and my ears for 90 minutes<br /><br />I think that you'll be pleased with the product<br /><br />Great followup from company on shipping and customer satisfaction
1,I needed a replacement for my expensive LG Bluetooth head set that had stopped putting out sound in one ear bud just after the warranty expired. After watching the very good video review for the Senso earbuds I ordered them. I had fabulous support from their customer service department for a few issues unrelated to product performance. I’m happy enough with the product (especially for the price) that I ordered one as a birthday gift for my daughter.  I don’t normally write reviews but wanted to share hoe pleased I am to have found this product.
1,"Sound quality is perfect but the right ear hook is not holding my ear properly, keep on falling down when I was running."
1,Earphones are lightweight.  Easy to pair with your device.  Good quality at a great price.
1,Very durable and good with music but not so much with phone calls
0,"update- I have these for a few weeks now, and use them everyday and they're bulky & uncomfortable, really inconvenient to only listen to just one headphone. it takes several attempts to connect to my phone, it says its connected but doesn't actually function when sync'd. sound quality is pretty good the controls are okay, stays on your ears really well. worth the 30ish dollars, wouldn't buy again. would only recommend to people using specifically both sides full time, good for running."
0,"Adjusted size to fit snugly in ear, but falls out with mild jogging. The over-ear hooks are super ultra flimsy and provide no support for the heavy wireless gear. Great for walking or sitting, but not suitable for running."
0,Died after 5 uses. I swear a lot.
1,"I recently purchased the headphone after trying two other products Mpow and  Anker in the same price range. I'll keep senso definitely at a higher side from sound quality wise but you pay an additional $10.<br />I definitely agree that the bass quality of this headphone is superb no other brand in the same range can match it. I had two objective before I buy this headphone. One was sound quality which I'm very much satisfied and another one is fitting, and I'm ok whatever I got. But I felt a major concern that sometime the sound is cutting, sometime after connecting with the phone I'm not immediately not able to hear any sound, not sure what's the problem though this is not consistent. But I fear after few months it recurs I wont be in a situation to replace or whether Senso will fix the problem or not. Another thing I noticed that the pictures in AMAZON website is WRONG, it's showing car mount and a mobile bag as a bonus item but it actually comes with car charger and phone cable, this is misleading.<br />Anyway overall it's good with this price range so even if with this problem I wanted to try my luck and keep the headset as there is no better option."
1,"I am a distance runner living in the U.S. Southwest desert.  I typically wear earbuds/headphones while running, and occasionally for walking, yardwork, etc.  A few months ago, I switched from wired to wireless headphones and first tried the Mpow [Gen-2 Version] Cheetah Bluetooth Headphones V4.1, which have a short/tight crossover cable/strap and work well, except I develop pressure-related pain behind my ears after two or three hours of running.<br /><br />I bought the ActivBuds to try a looser fitting crossover cable.  Both headphones have over-the-ear support, but the ActivBuds are made of a softer, flexible silicone or silicone-like material.  The crossover cable/strap is also a soft silicone or silicone-like material.  The soft, almost-sticky material is great for the ears, but if the cable rests against my neck, it sticks to my skin and pulls the headphone bodies out of my ears when I turn my head.  But, I have to do something with the strap anyway, to prevent it from tangling with my backpack, so the stickiness is not an issue, but it might be for certain users, depending on the activity.<br /><br />Here's my runners' solution.  The ActivBuds come with a clasp (&#34;cinch button&#34;) that slides over the crossover strap to vary its tightness.  I bought a 1-inch rubber washer with a 1/16-inch hole in the center (available at real hardware stores), slipped the washer onto the strap (folded at the center), followed by the cinch button.  I then tuck the strap inside and over the adjustment band on the back of my hat (like some runners do with a pony tail) and the washer keeps the strap/button from sliding back over and out of the hat adjustment band while running.  This way, I can adjust the tightness easily and the strap stays in place, above my neck and away from my backpack.<br /><br />I am not an audio expert, but, for me, the ActivBuds sound great.  I like the multi-function use for both the primary multi-function button, as well as the volume controls.  Both controls are easy to reach while running.<br /><br />The box contains an auto USB adapter (car charger, two charge levels) a short USB cable, a longer USB cable, multiple sets of ear tip covers, the adjuster button/nut, a carrying case, and the headphones.<br /><br />My original headphones were defective--the right ear tip was rotated much lower than the left, forcing the headphone body much too high, such that the over-the-ear piece was 1/4 inch above my ear, and, hence, they would fall out repeatedly.  I emailed the vendor describing the problem and they promptly sent me a replacement set of headphones, which work well."
1,love them
1,I usually don't write a review but this product is very good. One thing I loved abt it that I can simultaneously connect to my laptop and phone and seamless transition.
0,This product is awful 10 days old and stopped working<br />Try to reset it and still did not work.  Both red and blue lights keep flashing
1,"Para mi teléfono, muy buen sonido,  lo único que no me convenció es el poco escuchar desde afuera me parece inseguro."
1,"Excellent build quality, audio, and battery life. Excellent pair for the gym and every day use. For the price, you can't beat it."
1,Great sound quality. Good fit. Lots of extras included
1,"I bought these for my girlfriend so she could listen to music and take phone calls at work or use one earpiece as hands free in the car.  They serve their purpose.  They are comfortable, have a long battery life and she seems happy with the sound quality both for calls and music.  Being on the other end of the call, I can hear everything going on around her a lot better than I can hear her speaking.  I can hear people next to her having a conversation clear as day or dogs barking in the background when she is at work but she practically has to yell for me to hear her.  Unless she is in a quite place with no background noise at all, the sound of everything around her always drowns her out. This is disappointing considering she works in a noisy environment and one of the main reasons for buying the headset was to have a means of contacting her at work.  I also tried connecting it to my tv and could not get it to connect."
1,I use these for running.  They are great because they don’t fall out of my ears the sound is good and the price was better.
1,I like them
1,"I'm a runner and I bought some wireless headphone almost two years ago at a running Expo for well over $100.  I ended up using it only a few time because one of the ear buds would pop out when I ran.  I decided to give wireless another go but wasn't willing to spend a lot of money. I bought the Senso because the reviews were good and the price was more than reasonable.  I got the headphones right away, I was impressed with the packaging, and the generous accessories that come in the box with the headphones.  At this price point it's pretty awesome (car charger, extra iPhone compatible charging wire, carrying case). Right away, you feel like you are getting so much value for your money.  The Bluetooth pairing was really easy.  Once charged and paired I gave it  a go and I LOVE them!  The sound quality is GREAT, it's super light, and the buds (which come in three sizes) stay secure in my ear.  I've used it for long runs and the buds do not fall out of my ear.  I'm looking forward to using them in my next half marathon in a couple of weeks, I'm SUPER excited.  I will definitely buy more as gifts for birthdays and Xmas.  SUPER awesome find!"
1,"In comparison to the JayBirds I still have, the sound quality is way better and the fit more snug for $90 less! I've always had a problem of headphones falling out while running but not anymore. Perfect for running and the gym, and not to mention a bargain price. Mic is a little low quality if using for hands-free calling. If only for music, then perfect!"
1,"Very good sound for my daily five-mile constitutionals. While one can spend hundreds for name brands like Beats or Bose, these more than fit the bill."
1,Good headphones
1,"Work well, easy to pair to my old tv with a Bluetooth transmitter,good sound,wished they would last longer, I get about 6 hrs of tv."
1,"When I run with the headphones in and my phone on my waist, they cut out and in a lot"
1,"Best purchase ever! Ecstatic they fit my tiny ear canal and have bigger cushions for bigger ears! Can't hear much around you. When you first listen, the bass is really prominent but I just changed the sound on my iPhone and everything sounded perfect! (Not sure if androids have that feature). Will definitely buy again!!!"
1,2nd pair from this seller. Fast shipping. No issues. Buying for teenager. He goes through earbuds frequently. But these last the longest. about every 9 months. It's usually three weeks LOL
1,"These are very handy for me to have. I work out 4+ times a week and these are great. One of the ears stopped working after the second or third use. I was pretty upset about it. But, then it started working again and I haven't had that problem since. Can pick up calls while working out and then go back to playing music. Links quickly and charges great."
1,Got a set for a birthday present for a teenager they liked it so I ordered another set for myself.  Looking forward to trying it out!
1,This is the third device of this kind that I've tried. Returned the others. Longer play time and flexible ear hooks are best features.
1,"They connect right away, great sound and comfortable.  Great value!!!"
1,So far so good.good sound quality.
1,Super worth every penny.
0,"I'm having a problem with the right side earpiece ,there's static in it."
1,It’s very bad at pairing. It takes forever and I have to turn it on and off a bunch of times and reset my bluetooth a bunch
1,Wow! Not expected this sound! Had Beats for 3 years and never really enjoyed them! Never fit right and it was affecting the sound because they didn't quite fit &#34;in ear&#34; buds because the base is too big! But this..... for a fraction of the Beats cost! WILL BUY THEM FOR WHOLE FAMILY!
1,Sound is great. Comfortable to wear. Travel case and all accessories. Got more than my money's worth.
1,"These Bluetooth headphones are great! The sound is excellent!! I still need to figure out the right adjustment for mine, my ears are on the small side. So far I've only used them during my workout, but I think they will be perfect for travel as well. My husband also bought a pair and he loves them!"
0,Stopped working after a month
1,"Really like these - very comfortable. The one issue is that they don't have a low setting so where the music sounds good, its loud. And there are times when you want it to  be soft back ground to sleep. Now I just have to take one out. They do sounds great!"
1,Was going to buy beats headphones for my wife for her birthday but  gave Senso<br />a try and she loves them happy wife happy life.
0,"The bass was unusually loud at first and seemed to smooth out with extended use. Battery was great, and lasted practically an entire work shift. However, just 1 month into daily use of these so-far-so-good headphones, they stopped charging and never turned on again. Ironically, I missed my return window with Amazon by 1 day =("
1,Work well.
1,One of the great products I bought this year. Sound quality is awesome.
1,easy pairing and good sound quality
0,"After trying each of the pads, they didn't even come close to fitting my ears - and even if I could them to stay in, they would pop out after every step of walking.  No clue about the audio quality because I never got to the point where I could turn them on."
1,These earphones are great. Easy to use and provide very good sound. The different size ear bud covers are very handy as it turns out I need a different size for each ear! I had a problem with the earphones holding charge so I contacted customer service who advised a factory reset (very simple to do).  After this the problem persisted so I was sent a new pair of earphones as under one year warranty. No quibbling and very responsive to my questions. Great service.
1,My second pair. First pair lasted 4+ years of wearing them almost daily. Very fair price. Excellent quality. Great sound.  Can hear over my lawnmowers. Fits very comfortably in the ear. Excellent product.
1,"great sound and received it accordingly. Rate only 4 star because only recently owned it so don't know after time how it will work out.  For now it seems to work just fine, came with all necessities, looks and feels good, and does what I intend to use it for."
1,"I have been struggling with wired headphones while running since my very first iPod a dozen or so years ago.  Then Apple in all their wisdom zaps the headphone jack off the iPhone in an attempt to force you into their outrageously expensive Bluetooth buds.  Well, here's your answer.  These headphones are actually ear buds which are my go to for running.  Many different size pads to custom fit the sets to your exact ear size.  No wire to yank your phone out of your hands or frustrate you to death while your running.  The sound is not TOP shelf but I'm quite particular and these are good enough to way more than justify the price."
1,"The incoming sound quality is excellent, loud and clear. The outgoing sound quality sounds like a desktop speaker phone and that's very good considering the microphone is above your ear. I love the controls, particularly compared to the big name competition. There's one big button that turns it on/off and answers phone calls and pauses what's playing and the button always knows what you want it to do! There are other buttons to raise and lower the volume and they are positioned so you never get confused or accidentally hit the wrong one.<br /><br />The ear loops are an absolute necessity if you are going to move at all while you're wearing headphones. There are various sizes of ear &#34;plugs&#34; provided but the ear loops are not adjustable. If you like a real snug fit this may be disconcerting but they do stay in place well enough to hear clearly. These are the least expensive ear buds I own and I like them the best."
1,These headphones are amazing. The quality you get for the price doesn't even seem right.  I also was not expecting all of the things that came in the box. The value of the other things in the box are worth more than the price you get with headphones included. I've used these headphones only twice so far during my workouts and they are great. I can't hear the annoying gym music and I don't have to have my phone on me to listen to music. Great buy !
1,Superior sound quality
1,"I bought these primarily for use in the gym, I was forever snagging the cord of regular earphones on equipment.  First use yesterday... Easy to set up, paired with the phone instantly.<br />Comfortable to wear and the controls seem easy to use.  Can’t comment on battery life.... Yet."
1,great product and very good headphone My highlight is that when you ever have any issues with their headphone don't you worry PEOPLE They will make you happy until the issue is fixed I LOVE IT
1,As good as beats bluetooth headphones for 1/5th the price. Good bass and highs and the battery charges fast and drains slow
1,"Best purchase of the year for the money. Solid sound quality, good fit and durable. So happy I found these."
1,They sound really good for the price.
0,Not waterproof
1,"Great sound, easy to hook-up, I like them a lot!"
1,Great Product!!
1,Very nice Bluetooth headphones. All controlled work perfectly even after almost 2 years of usage
1,I love these they sound great actually debating to order a second pair also they were shipped fast no issues.
1,Dont have to worry about it falling off when im on my 3 mile run every night.!
0,I loved these at first. I've had these for 45 days and they stopped working? Can't explain it? They turn on but that's all I get. My other complaint. You have 10 minutes maximum from when it tells you &#34;low battery&#34; before it's completely dead.
0,Product I received was faulty. I'm not sure if this is the norm but I'm very disappointed.
0,Big in size and sound clipped
0,"I used the headphones while working in the yard and found that I had to have my iPhone within a foot or so of the headphones for them to hold a Bluetooth connection and even then it was garbled and broken up. I had to keep the phone in a front shirt pocket.  I was disappointed to say the least. I was not sure which earpiece the receiver is in but I tried locating the phone on both sides.<br />I was also surprised at the over the ear rubber pieces being so flexible, I'm not sure if the will keep the headphones in place during a run or a vigorous hike."
0,These have failed already after just a few months and limited times of use.
1,I will be honest - I purchased the SENSO headphones by price comparison  only thinking  if they  were marginal at best I would not have much invested in them.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I don't know much about specs but I do know what I hear through these headphones is awesome.  I would highly recommend them if you are looking for great sound at a fantastic price.
1,I bought these for my daughter so she could aqua-jog without worrying about ruining her ear buds.  She has smaller ears so they don't stay on great for her but she solved that problem by wearing a headband.  I would purchase these again.
0,"battery life is less than expected, you loose the signal a few feets from the device ... didnt fit my expectations"
1,"I received this headphones yesterday and tried it out last night at the gym.  It has clear sounds and easy to operate and connect via Bluetooth.  I've tried more expensive headphones in the past to which they have failed me.  For this price, this has been the best wireless headphones I've purchased.  It stays on nicely in the gym even when I'm doing heavy movements.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for Bluetooth headphones."
1,"What an outstanding value. Comfortable. The medium ear buds fit well. Clarity of sound with an muddled base was a pleasant surprise which is typically what you find with lower priced wireless ear buds.<br /><br />I have used them for about 5 hrs so far with no sound degradation or need to recharge. They claim 8 plus. We'll see.<br /><br />Providing a dual port car charger was nice. A separate wall unit would have been helpful<br /><br />Pairing was a snap. Customer service follow up excellent..<br /><br />For the price, I have not found a better wireless head set. Recommend without reservation so far."
0,"The product was not durable at all, lasting less than 6 months under normal use"
1,"Been out of town, haven’t used yet however my son said they are the same ones he has and they are th Best! So I will give you five stars trusting I will have the same experience."
1,"Decent sound; poor fit; little, if any, sound cancelling. 15 ft range."
1,"These are pretty awesome. I wanted something wireless so the cord from my iphone headphones wouldn't keep swinging back & forth when I was on cardio machines at the gym. Once I figured out how to actually turn it off, I've found out that the battery life is great. I've gone about 4 90-minute gym sessions without having to charge them. There's a battery life indicator that shows near the phone battery (on an iphone, idk about other phones) so you know when to charge it. They do hurt my ear a little, but most earbuds hurt my ear so that's more my thing than the fault of the headphones. They're also a little bulky, but they do fit very well and I've never had a problem with them moving. Overall, I would recommend them. Great value."
1,These head phones sound almost as good as my Bose for a fraction of the cost -- plus they are water resistant.
0,"Inexpensive, but terrible sound quality. the base gets distorted at low volume and higher notes get left out too. Don’t buy these"
1,"I am a runner and I use music to keep my cadence. I replaced my older ""sport"" headphones with the SENSO phones and it is phenomenal! I get all of the deep tones without having to ratchet up the volume."
1,Brought as a gift. Main comment is the weight of the headphones is a bit bulky on the ears. They stand behind their products and their quality. They do what it takes to make sure any issues are resolved quickly.
1,Great headphones!  Nice feel on the ear with not too much weight. Good sound as well. Multiple ear bud options and good accessories.  There were some delivery issues but i don't think it wa the sellers fault.
1,Good sound quality but I'm having trouble with static or something.... that I don't have with the standard apple earbuds
1,"They are ok for what they are, the flexible ear piece doesn’t hold its memory too well, and I came from beats Powerbeats and sound is terrible compared to those"
1,"These earbuds sound amazing and fit nicely to the ear, I have done a lot of workouts and I never notice anything except the great sound. The best part I am never distracted by them falling out when I am working out."
1,"Very nice headphone I would highly recommend these headphones. They are very nice quality, comfortable and sound amazing. Would buy again"
1,So far I've only used them a few times the sound is good and they are very comfortable
1,I’m very happy with headphones- their comfortable and easy to use good sound - I like the longevity of the battery time - nice product I’d definitely recommend to friends and family
1,Good sound quality and comfotable for the ear.
1,Love the sound from these buds but I have this very little thing that happens with them.  I use my buds on Samsung galaxy tab A.  I get little static<br />when when the tablet changes windows or when I change apps.  Over all great headphones.
0,"Nob to turn ON the headset broke 1 month after purchase, it can't be used to turn ON this headset anymore !! $36 Gone :("
0,Signal was cutting out even with my iPhone6S in my front pocket. Wanted to love them for the price but ended up with PowerBeats3 & IMO well worth the significant price difference.<br /><br />Also the headphones gives off a loud low battery warning like every 2 minutes even when the phone bluetooth claims there's 30%+ battery left & then just shuts off.<br /><br />Goes back to you get what you pay for in this arena apparently
1,"So far, so good.  Just received my Senso headphones a couple days also so have only used them a few times.  However, pairing was a snap to my iPhone 7....they came with all the accessories....are very light weight and the sound quality is very good, even though a bit on the bass side.(could use a bit more treble). Had a pair of JBL Bluetooth that short d out on me after just 6 months at 3 times the price, so I'm anxious to see how these wear.  Overall, very satisfied with my purchase."
1,These have great sound fit comfortably and are a great bargain. Definitely recommend them.
1,Decent quality. My boyfriend likes them
1,Awesome headphone. Good for while working out.
1,"The product is well designed: good quality sound, fit the ear comfortably and securely, and very reasonably priced. Moreover, the technical support was outstanding as they stand firmly behind their product. I highly recommend this product."
1,Love this item
0,did not work after a little while
1,works great no problems at all
1,Awesome for the money.  They sounds good and are perfect for running.
1,Great product. Love it.
0,After using these a few times the first time they ran out of battery they would never fully charge or be able to connect to Bluetooth again. Wish I could return but missed the window. Very disappointed.
0,Second pair did same thing stop charging after couple of months. Do not buy unless you want to constantly replace
1,Very easy to use and great quality.
1,"These headphones are incredible for the gym, they're comfortable and the battery lasts a LONG time. However, my pair started off sounding a lot lower on the left side until it broke completely. I'm not really sure if mine came defective."
1,"The sound quality while listening to music was very good. The ear hooks are very pliable and did a fair job holding the headphones in place but not great. When using the headphones for phone calls, the people I called said their was a strong echo on their end. I contacted the seller who told me how to do a factory reset on the headphones but this did not resolve the problem. I returned the headphones at no charge and got a full refund. The return process was very easy."
1,"It is a bit of a distraction to have to keep adjusting them. With the bendable wires that shape how they are positioned, they don't stay in place and need to be occasionally repositioned. Not a deal breaker though. I enjoy them very much. Not such good quality for talking on the phone though. Everyone complains when I would do that and so I stopped."
1,Decent product.  Better quality than most more expensive products.  Not extremely comfortable.
1,"These are great! I always envied people at the gym that didn't have wires to get tangled around their necks. This has great sound and a nice case. I just wish there was a way to see if I turned them off, instead of hearing it that is is off. Just an indicator light would be nice. But other than that, these are excellent."
1,These are the first bluetooth headphones that haven't messed up within the first few uses. I like them a lot and hope they continue to hold up. I workout 6 days a week for an hour or 1.5 hours and the battery almost lasts me the entire 6 days of workouts! They also come with an awesome charger AND a car adapter. All in all this is a great deal.
1,very happy with the headphones sound great and work flawlessly
1,"These connected well and didn't cut out like other wireless headphones I have used.  They were also able to be turned up very loud.  For the price range, these are very good."
0,"These were comfortable and felt as if they could be worn for extended periods. Unfortunately, I did not get to put them to the test because they didn't work. They constantly cut out and continually disconnected from my phone (galaxy s7) unless I held my phone within inches of the headphones. I ended up returning them. It was disappointing because I wanted something to run with, and these felt as if they could have been really good. Four stars for comfort, one star for usability."
1,"I was honestly amazed at these headphones, I mean the connectivity isn't remotely an issue, plus the sound quality is amazing. Every single set of wireless earbuds I have bought have had terrible sound quality, but I didn't expect much due to the price. These however were cheaper yet sounded perfect. Best purchase of my life."
1,Love them! So very easy to use while running or just lifting weights.  Light weight and they actually stay in your ears.
1,Just got them but so far so good! Love that they include an adaptable car charger and various other sizes/replacement ear &#34;buds&#34;. They stay in place for my workout without hurting my ear which is the best part.
1,Having to switch to Bluetooth headsets in order to charge my iPhone 7 and listen to music at the same time I found these headphones to be very good for the price.
1,"Amazing headphones. Great fit and sound quality, exactly what I needed"
1,"They're good for working out and commuting. But the left earbud has a ringing sound in it. I thought it was a defect so I returned my first pair. The second pair had it too, so I stuck with them because they're not awful. They have good sound, and work decent (sometimes getting it to pair with my phone is a pain), but don't try to sleep or study with them on. The ringing sound will drive you crazy."
1,"I had issues with the Bluetooth pairing to my cellphone. After speaking with Senso's support team, they quickly acted<br />to the problem and replaced it with a new one. Great customer service!  The new one arrived within 2 days and is working great.<br /><br />Brian L"
1,Easy to install and operate
1,Nice and Light!
0,"Would be nice to have an auto off when charging instead of overcharging. If you forget to remove if from charging, it kills your available usage time. It only lasts a couple hours now. It lasted a solid 8 hours before I forgot it on the charger one time. My fault, I know. No other issues."
1,I have had these for 2 months and used them every single night in the gym and have loved them since. I haven't had any problems with them and they dont get in my way while I workout. Personally suggest getting them for their price and the fact they come with 3 different sized earbuds. I love the earbuds that are moldable to your ear canal! Over all 5 out of 5 I love these so much!!
0,Not sure why these get such great reviews.<br /><br />Unusable in wind.<br /><br />Going back to wired Skull Candy.<br /><br />The stupid things behind the ear are aggravating as all get out.<br /><br />Wire behind head is BS.<br /><br />Go with LG.
1,"I purchased these headphones for exercise and I am very pleased with them. They are comfortable and stay on while running. With the proper ear peice you can still hear cars or barking dogs from behind. Their sound quality is average, wish they had better low end frequencies. They work perfect for what I wanted them for. Yes I would recommend them for active people."
1,"Work greats, bummed that it doesn't come with wall charger, but glad it has car charger.<br />Got everything on time, great customer service with them checking in with me to see if everything was working."
1,"Great set of BT headphones. Light weight, amazing sound quality, fast easy pairing and set up."
1,These were a gift for my husband. He is in love.
1,The best headphones ever bought
0,"I bought two pairs. Both of them died around the 3month mark of use 4 - 5 times a week, only charging twice a week. other then the battery dying they are good, Just wish the product life lasted longer."
0,I've bought multiple pairs and left earbud keeps breaking. Last pair I bought lasted 15 days.
1,I have only had these headphones for a month but so far I love them! Work perfectly as described and battery lasts a long time.
1,"I was so excited to find a pair of headphones that actually fit and stayed on my ears. I have very small ear canals and most headphones are way too large and fall out constantly. These thankfully had attachments small enough that they could fit as well as having the extra security of the wraparound piece, which I loved. Unfortunately, the bluetooth keeps randomly disconnecting from my phone. It's very frustrating to have to keep pressing play on my phone or having to turn off and repair the bluetooth connection. Huge bummer."
1,These are the best headphones for the buck. Amazing sound quality
1,Noise cancelation is GREAT!<br />I can’t hear a word my wife is saying...
1,"Impressive. They fit my ears great, batteries last forever, and sound quality is better than I expected for the price. Not getting that humming issue I've heard about. If they last a good lifespan of buy them again."
1,Awesome head phones with great quality of sound and long life! Although mine quit working within the first 3 weeks but the customer service was awesome and immediately sent me new ones.
1,"I purchased two sets.  Both were simple to set up and worked well; but one had a problem before or during shipping and was missing the little charging cable.  The company already had sent me a message looking for feedback. so I replied to that email and explained my problem.  I received an immediate answer (this was on a Sunday night, mind you), with instructions for return/refund and a discount code for my replacement purchase.  Well done!"
1,"Great product, good quality, good sound and very comfortable to workout I recommend it!"
1,"Amazing! I've used these headphones at the gym and mowing grass for about 2 months now and they have to be the best bluetooth headphones I've ever had. I originally bought $100 Plantronics headphones for use at the gym, but they didn't make a tight seal like these do. The foam inserts are the best by far. They assist with canceling out the noise, and don't get wet and slip like the gel inserts do. I sweat like a whore in church on a Sunday in August so I have put these to the test. They have yet to fall out and I don't even need to adjust them more than once during my hour and a half workout.<br /><br />ONLY PROBLEM: I need more foam inserts, my are becoming dirty and would love to find more somehow!"
1,I actually enjoyed it very much. The sound was more base but like it.  The manual was easy and connecting was easy too.  Since I have had it for less than 2 weeks I can not tell you about the battery performance.
1,"I really recommend this headphones, they are very good quality and very easy to use.I run a half marathon las week and they worked wonderful no issues to connect or sweat.I bought the jaybird 2 weeks before the half marathon and honestly they were so complicated to adjust and for 2 days  i was trying to figure it out and them finally i returned them and order this ones,easier and no problem running.<br />i recommend this Bluetooth headphones and for the price and quality you can not find something better"
1,These headphones stay put while you are moving around.  Great sound!
1,Bought these hoping they would fit my cauliflower ear for my runs as I wrestle and do brazilian jiu jitsu. Sadly they were too uncomfortable and did sit on my ears properly that would make them fall out. Gave them to my girlfriend (no cauliflower ears) and said she loved them and worked perfectly. Can't blame the product for the fit but buy beware to all my cauliflowered brothers and sisters out there.
1,"How can you beat the price of these?  The sound quality may not be the absolute best but if you are working out, playing golf, or washing the car, these are incredible.  I have small ears so the combination of the buds and clips are perfect for me."
1,"Just got them, so far so good. I don't think it's the best earphones on the market, but they might be the best I've heard for the price. They seem to be better than at least the earphones that come with your phone, which is impressive for wireless."
0,The headphones need to be charged every single night and are such a pain to connect to different devices. Not super pleased with this purchase.
0,Thought these would work out but they keep dropping connection.  It makes them unusable.  Would not buy againl
1,Great pair of headphones. Good sound and they stay in place no matter what I am doing
1,Good sound. I can't get them to connect to my Apple Watch 2.
1,Works great love it.
0,Only listened to music for 5 hours and it died.. It says up to 8 hours of music..
1,"These headphones are great. Overall I love them, and they are exactly what I was looking for if not more.<br />Pros:<br />- They stay in my ears, which was a huge issue with more other headphones.<br />- The battery lasts a while without being charged (I’m not sure exactly how long, but it’s lasted me 3 hours so far)<br />Cons:<br />- They aren’t noise cancelling whatsoever.<br />- The sound quality isn’t great, but it is still pretty good."
1,"These are okay, sound is good but when I'm wearing them I constantly have to adjust them. Always falling out, not a good fit."
1,"Extremely good headphones considering the price. Tested them out on my run and they were perfect. Headphones are a tricky thing and I don't see the point in spending a crazy amount, as those expensive will break sooner than later. Happy with my purchase"
1,Beautiful product!!  So easy to pair with my iPhone and that made me very happy as I am the least technical person you'll ever meet!  Sound is outstanding and I am enjoying it on my streaming and workouts. Very pleased I purchased this product. I read all the reviews and now I agree with them. This is an excellent merchandise!
1,"These are the best wireless earbud type headphones I have ever had! They fit perfectly, have great sound and bass levels (loud enough to be heard clearly while I mow the lawn) and have great connectivity. I highly recommend them!"
1,"The earbuds are light weight, provide clear sound and just enough noise dampening to help me ignore outside distractions without totally cutting me off from what's going on around me. I used them in the gym for a good two hours and they never slipped out my ears. Better still, they were comfortable to wear from the beginning to end of my workout. I'm looking forward to using them on my next plane flight to listen to music and watch videos!"
1,"These are the best headphones and the customer service is outstanding. I have purchased them numerous times and have never had an issue. The last pair I ordered had a defect and the company responded immediately to my problem and replaced them even faster. I can't say enough goid things about this product and company. If you need headphones, don't buy from anyone else. You will not regret it."
1,"These are great!! They stay in place, have clear sound and are sweat proof. I like that they are cordless and don’t get knocked off by me accidentally pulling the wire. Looking forward to enjoying these for a long time to come!"
1,"I will buy these again without hesitation. They fit my ear perfect, I have issues with finding ones that fit my ears comfortably. I go running in these and they stay in my ear the entire time. Would definitely recommend. It came with extra pieces to better accommodate, car charger, USB charger, wire wrap, headphone case. I've gone through many headphones and these are worth the price."
1,"If there were a 4.5 or star rating, that's what I would give.<br /><br />I have had them for over a year and they're my primary running set. Good sound quality, consistent connectivity. Overall very pleased.<br /><br />Two minor gripes:<br />1. Having to hold the buttons to advance the song is annoying to me<br />2. Sometimes the wire gets stuck on one side of the neck or the other and feels uncomfortable.  Not sure there's a remedy to this.<br /><br />Would 100% recommend."
1,"I loved these wireless earbuds. Sound quality was good and the battery lasted a while, imo.  However, I've only had these 2 months and they have stopped charging?!?!?! Can anyone help with this??"
1,"Used once thus far, but very pleased. They have good functionality and ability to adjust volume, skip songs, etc. No problems during a run yesterday."
1,"I was a little wary of the quality Bluetooth headphones would deliver, but wow! They were also simple to set up and are very comfortable. I usually buy foam earplugs to pair with wired headphones, but the fit is so secure, I don't think I'll need to. These sound as good as the $100+ wired headphones they're replacing."
0,These buds stated running out of juice quickly at 11 months. Then would not take a charge. I would not recommend this product.
1,"Very clear when making and receiving calls, This blutooth is really water resistant, battery could last longer tho."
1,Product came  as promised and as advertised. The ear buds fit snugly and come  with a handy case.
1,"I just got these things after looking to purchase other brands. I am very happy that I purchased these instead, they are great quality for the price! They fit nicely and are not uncomfortable, as I find most ear buds to be. The sound quality is pretty good, and they are easy to pair and use. They also come with extra ear buds, two charge chords, a D.C. adapter, and a cool little carrying case. Definitely satisfied and would recommend to anyone looking for some Bluetooth earphones. I can't wait to take them snowboarding!<br /><br />Update: I like them so much I just bought another pair!"
1,"You can't get any better headphones for running or working out, for the money, then these.<br />Exactly what I needed."
1,Works great!  Connects easily and every time.  Accidentally went through the washing machine and still working perfectly!
0,"Worked great at first, used them while mowing the grass and going on walks, started disconnecting intermittently then finally quit pairing altogether after 2 months."
1,"I purchased these for running with and a more cost effective version of the beats. They work jut great, sound is good, last ages on single charge and are well made. I am very pleased with them and the only downside can be if your out in the wind, they pick up wind noise badly, so best for inside gym work or outside on calmer days, otherwise brilliant wireless headphones at a great price. I’ll be buying a second pair for traveling."
1,"These were just what I was looking for.  They stay put, have great sound quality and a nice case to keep them in when they're not in use."
1,These sound great and the battery lasts forever.  A friend has the Beats and said these sound just as good.
0,"Hello,<br />I really like my head phone except I keep loosing connection with Bluetooth. I tried many different ways, but it will only connect and stay connected if I am not near another person with a smart phone or any where near my house. Even while walking I still lose my connection while on my walk/run. They are very comfortable and while running I do not lose them. The charge last for 4 days which is a bonus since I always forget to charge them."
0,"Thought these were great headphones for the first couple months until I found them melted in my truck. These actually had the best sound of any Bluetooth headphones I’ve owned, but that doesn’t matter if they’re melted. Luckily I didn’t have these plugged into an outlet that was always hot, so I was able to catch it before a massive disaster happened in my truck."
1,These are an amazing deal!  For the price they are top of the line and would even surmise that they compete with the lower end (but still overpriced) beats earbuds.  The car charger and cord is a nice extra.  I recommend these to all my friend!
1,"works great easy to connect and use , may be a/little longer batter life"
1,I was more impressed than I thought. I had tried similar devices but this by far out performs anything I have previously used. Excellent quality and sound.
1,"Have tried many Bluetooth headphones, that inevitably fall out, or have no battery life. These Senso are AWESOME, the earbuds are super soft & you can't even tell that the ear hooks are there, battery life great & best of all I love the sound. I'm going to pick up a second pair for my son. The extras are great, it comes with a dual charge android & lightening, great case, all in all excellent."
1,"I got the SENSO's as a birthday gift and what a gift. I class myself as bit of an Audiofile and was completely blown away by the quality of this product, both sonically and cosmetically. My old collection of headphones are now in the trash! Great product and exceptional value."
1,"These headphones were amazing until I stepped on them and broke them. 😂 I had them for a solid 6 months, and I’m reordering them now!"
0,I'm currently having trouble listening to my music while my phone is in my pocket or while I'm riding my bike. the movement I guess disrupting the Wi-Fi signal or something to the headset
0,They work. Not the best sound. Worst part is their size. Two big boxes sticking out of your ears. The rubber cover over the charging port makes is annoying to hold out of the way when plugging in the cord. Not a huge deal but irritating.
1,I mostly bought these for running. They still on my ear pretty well. I’ll stick with my AirPods for other because this product isn’t very stylish.
0,"I had these earphones for about three months when they suddenly kept disconnecting.  The slightest movement and it just cut off.  Resetting them did nothing to fix it.  Great when they lasted, but three months is way too short."
1,Lots of wind noise when I was on my bike but for $35 you can't really beat it.
1,"Really good Bluetooth, comfortable and clear. Keep on and make a lot of business!!"
1,"Given  a 5 star rating based on the price I got it. This works perfectly  with my work out and other general purpose . Plays smoothly and no connectivity issue<br /><br />The sound quality is not definitely the best (however it is good), however I would take it based on the price."
1,"Great headphones for the price.  I use them when lifting weights and running - even in the rain, and that has caused no problems.<br /><br />They fit well, form a good seal, and do not readily fall out.  The &#34;noise-cancelling&#34; claim is dubious.  I don't think there is any actual noise cancellation going on, but the seal and the sound quality are fine anyway.<br /><br />I've never intentionally tested the Bluetooth range, but forgot my phone in the other room once.  I was about 20ft away and the sound was still crystal clear.<br /><br />The battery seems to last maybe 4-6 hours.  It warns you when the battery is low with a voice in your ear.  You best take that voice seriously, because you get the notification three times in about a minute before they power off.<br /><br />I like these headphones and would recommend them."
1,"The sound quality is excellent.  In fact it's so good that my wife insisted that I order a second set.  The company has also been very pro actively supportive.  They are very comfortable to wear,  but on heavy running do tend to come loose a little. I highly recommend these as well as this company."
1,I loved them but unfortunately someone stolen them.
1,Great sound and very light. Still playing with earpieces to get a more secure fit.
1,Worked right out of the box.  Buttons are well placed and intuitive to use.  Sound is great.  Nice collection of accessories were included.  Price is right.  Great warranty period.  Would recommend this purchase to anyone.
0,"Sound is good. For a budget headphone, product has lots of options. Comes well packaged with extras you would get with more expensive headphones. Setup was easy. Major problem is the ear pieces are to flexible. Ear buds don't stay in place when walking much less running."
1,"Fantastic sound, lightweight, great battery life."
1,These Senso headphones have excellent sound quality for the price. The controls are simple and easy to use. Highly recommend.
0,"the item is slightly heavy. I bought this around April 2017, and used it well until October 2017. In October, I used it in a hot tub, and one side of the headphone sound dramatically died. I still hear some sound, but it is very weak. for IPX7, the item should still work."
0,"It took all of my willpower not to chuck these headphones in the trash on my first and only run with these. They were extremely flimsy. I spent more time trying to shove them back into my ears than actually listening to any music. The sound quality was not evenly distributed between the two ear buds. The over-ear loops were basically pointless, as they did nothing to keep the buds in place. Same goes for the neck strap -- which was too long and kept catching on my clothing. Additionally, the volume buttons are in a terrible place -- every time I went to adjust the right headphone, I would accidentally press the volume button, which would release an ear-piercing screeching noise directly into my head. I was extremely disappointed with these headphones and am 100% returning them."
1,"Great headphones, especially for the price.  Easy to connect, comfortable, good battery life."
1,This is my first try with anything bluetooth.  They fit great and sound great. Using them at work to cut the office noise.
0,"Bought as a cheaper alternative to the Powerbeats. Was fooled by the reviews and price. The material was cheap, obviously they were only 27 bucks. The sound was good awful and I’m partially deaf so I like stuff to sound loud and good. These turned halfway up had distortion from the bass. Nope, Terrible even if they were 27 bucks. I’m deciding on wether or not I want to return them but it’ll cost me 8 dollars to return 27$ headphones. Might just give them away."
0,Product worked less than 2 months
1,"So far these are awesome! They paired instantly without hassle and sound very good. I purchased one for my and one for my girlfriend to replace sets that were nearly impossible to have a conversation on. These are clear and the noise rejection works well. Nice variety of ear buds in the package. Did not see the cable wrap accessory though. Bonus gifts, phone magnet and wallet are nice."
0,These lasted only a couple months. Constantly cut out while trying to exercise. I would never buy again!
0,These look a lot like the rock sport brand.. but they aren’t.. they came in and did not even turn on I pressed and held the power button for like 10 seconds and nothing.. I charged em and nothing.. I tried turning them on while charging and nothing!!!!! -.- bro don’t even waste your money I’m never buying this again.. thanks for sending something that doesn’t even work smh.
1,Works great. Sound is good. I can make phone calls on walk/runs.
1,Work well and are comfortable due to the soft material. Seems to hold a charge reasonably well too - perhaps 4-5 hours?
0,"I bought these headphones in June of 2017 and 8 months later, they are not working as engineered. The skip song and volume control functions no longer work. They advertise a 1 year warranty, so hopefully they will be replaced...now I just have to figure out to contact the company. Amazon sure does make buying things easy...contacting the seller when the product isn't working as advertised? Not as easy...hmmmm, I wonder why that is?"
1,Was looking for a good pair of wireless ear buds with ear loops for working out at the gym because the wired ones always tend to fall out. I purchased these because of the price and reviews. I am amazed at what you get and the sound quality they fit in ears nice and are comfortable. My kids have the beats wireless buds and these sound just as good!
0,"Great sound, excelente battery life. I dont think these are noise cancelling headphones.<br />Mic never worked on mine, only useful for music.<br />Never had issues with Bluetooth"
1,Sound quality is very good given the price. Material is sweat friendly and the buds stick very well while running. Pairing was seemless and the multifunction button is intuitive to use. Overall a very good experience.
1,"Easy to set up with my IPhone 7. The comfortable, the around-the-ear holder easily re-shapes to fit your ear. The sound is very good. At a price of $19.95 these headphone are a steal. I am extremely happy with this purchase."
1,"Great quality and amazing sound, is really easy to use and pair with any phone!<br />It was such a deal for an amazing set of headphones, it was worth it the money.<br />I will definitely buy it again because it came exactly like they said and the customer service is so polite and worried about your satisfaction which I think is awesome!"
0,"They broke within two weeks of use. Sorry I bought them. They were awkward, wouldn't stay in my ear. Waste of money."
1,These headphones are easy to use and deliver good quality sound. I've used them only a few times so far but have really enjoyed them.
1,"Does the job well.  I need music when I workout and that's what it does.  BUT... when I am running outside and the wind picks up in front of me then all I hear is wind and I have to turn up the volume.  I tried putting on a headband over the headset to reduce the sound of the wind but it didn't help.  The bass level is good but could use a higher tuning with the treble.  All in all, it does a good job for the price."
1,Just did a tri this weekend and these held up great for the bike and run (both connected to apple watch).  Please with sounds and they stayed in the ears with no issues.  Not sure why I waited so long...
1,We bought 2 more sets!!! Great for working out.
1,Very easy to talk on and very clear for the other person!
1,I paid for these with my own money.<br />Great earbuds. Good sound quality for my use which is to tune out noisy office mates and listen to college lectures on public transit. They are very comfortable to wear for hours. I live in Oregon and have worn them in the (light) rain with no problem. Battery life is amazing.
0,Bought these on July 11 and sent them back July 31. I run and these were supposed to be sweat resistant but they just don't last. Don't waist your time or money.
1,"Great! Compact. Good battery life. Fit well, sound great."
1,"Great service, great quality, awesome sound!"
1,I've gone through about 4 pairs of BT ear buds and these are my favorite ones I've ever had. Fit great and really loud. Also I've sweated all over them plenty of times and they still work great.
1,Great value. Better then I expected.
1,Battery live around 6hr not bad
1,For &#60;$50 i would say they are excellent. I have Bose QCII but to be honest i use these headphones a lot since they don't put lot of pressure on my ears. I use them regularly during workout and they are sweatproof for sure. They are little big compared to Powerbeats but there is a difference in price also so i cannot really complain.
0,"It comes with a lot of accesories. The sound quality is not the best but it is good enough for 19 bucks. Whenever I moved my head to the right the sounds cut or if I put it in the pocket of my jacket or some other random situation. Other than that worked fine. I would gladly return it but yesterday, it open up the right side of the headset. I found the cover at the floor in my room but I lost the volume control. I didn't hit it, that is why I didnt realize when It open up. Don't waste your money, I have given a chance to unknown brands in the past but this is the first time I see such a bad product. Again, it is just 19 bucks but still. Psdt: It is kind of painful after an hour wearing it."
1,Nice product.  Good battery life.  Easy to use and set up....even for me!!
1,Very satisfied with this purchase.  Headphones pair up quickly and easily to iPhone.  Sound quality is excellent and earphones are comfortable and easy to use.  Use them when working out and have no issues with moisture.
1,A really nice looking headset lightweight earbuds are out slightly uncomfortable at functionalitity is great and easy to use.
1,I really enjoy these wireless headset  Charge the battery & they are simple to use !!
1,"Great price, easy to use, sound quality is decent for the price but I'm an audio snob! I'm using these for exercise so the convenience of not having a chord is the bomb!"
1,"Easy to setup, works well for phone calls as well. Neat carrying case. No regerts!"
1,Love it
1,"First time I went with wireless headsets, pretty amazing, no more cables and the sound is WAY better than my AKG headphones. Today I had my first call with it, i was outside walking my dog, I was able to hear the other person crisp and clear, I asked, if I was good to understand to and YES my voice was crisp and clear as well and no background noise distorted the experience. I give it all thumbs up!"
1,"I LOVE the sound quality! The noise cancellation is great and I actually can only wear one headphone in the office otherwise I don't hear people come up behind me. They do hurt the inside of my ears after wearing them for about an hour straight and they are a little heavier than I expected, but I still love them!"
0,"I got one and it was supposed to be IPX7 but it is NOT. You should be able to wear it while in the shower but you CAN'T. To make matters worse, water barely even got on it while in the shower and it still broke. So I got me a new one and I was supposed to send the broken one back, well when I got the new one IT WAS ALSO BROKEN. Just broke after a few weeks of use and I didnt even put water on it. This is the worse headphones I have ever bought. STAY AWAY. I was working a lot at the time and I didn't have time to return them so I was charged for 2 broken headphones.  The same might happen to you."
1,Works great
1,The sound is great and the battery life is amazing. Very comfortable. Good for working out or even just studying.
0,Not even a week after trying them one of the speakers has almost completely gone out. It is at half of the working speaker at best. Can't even use them because it gives you a headache .
1,"Awesome headphones, these really have great sound. The bluetooth connects quickly, and the battery life is amazing! I highly recommend this product!"
1,"Phenomenal. For the price I paid, you will not find a better sounding set of ear buds. My co worker had the Beats version which pretty much lol the same and these sound better than his. Especially in the mid range. Responsive bass, doesn't bottom out or distort. Super comfortable and well made. I've used for a total of about 6 hours so far and I'm still on the first charge. Comes loaded with charging accessories, different sized soft rubber tips, and a nice carrying case. After seeing all the reviews, once they went on sale I jumped on them especially with prime."
1,bomb.com they are equivalent to beats without the price
1,Ear buds are bulky and big. Not good for exercising.
1,"Good headphones, and the customer service when I had a warranty issue was great. The bass is a little strong but it's better than weak bass and not too hard to compensate for it with equalizer settings. Great package of accessories included. The construction seems durable, but as I said I had a problem where one of my earpieces stopped working and I'm not sure of the root cause."
1,"Absolutely love these!  They are comfortable,  they pair quickly and easily.  They sound great.  Very happy with the purchase."
1,Headphone hooks don't work. Flimsy.
1,Wonderful Product!
0,TRASH TRASH TRASH! I got these as a gift and out of the box the cord appeard frayed and the sound didn't work in one ear. Horrible! The worst part is that whoever my secret santa was wasted almost $40 on CRAP and I'm out my headphones!
1,Love it.... use everyday!
1,Great sound quality.  Easily molds around ear. Have had for 2 years and still going strong.  First pair were defective but were were replaced immediately with no issues.  I live the connecting cord in case one comes out they don't get lost.  I wear during water aerobics and there's lots of splashing.  Good range from music source.  I can actually think of no negatives.
1,"I bought these for running after spending a lot of money on powerbeats2 wireless headphones and having them break repeatedly. These paired easily, have good sound and the charge seems to last a while. My only complaint is how flimsy the plastic pieces are that go over the ears. UPDATE: I've been using these for a month, I've run a few hundred miles with them, including the Chicago Marathon, run miles in the rain, and these have held up well.  The battery seems to last 6-8 hours as advertised.  Great value for the money!"
1,Love these!
1,Don't like that it doesn't go into standby -  If you walk out of range or input stops (end of track or video) it continues to beep and search for signal until it batteries are all worn out.  IE -  I fall asleep after 30min of Tablet TV and when I wake power all used up.
0,"Stopped working after only a few months of very light use. These earbuds were turned on maybe a maximum of 10 times before they stopped working. Never got wet, never left in the sun. Just stopped turning on. Disappointing."
1,"Great value. I cant speak to the longevity of the product, but my initial reaction is &#34;wow, probably the best $30 wireless headphones out there&#34;<br /><br />Fantastic for running and outdoor use. You hear the music, not the &#34;cable noise&#34; or whatever it is that causes most headphones to suck in outdoor active use."
1,This is an excellent product that works really well and at a good price.
1,"Have already used it for many hours. No problems. Clear audio, good quality - and we do a lot of talking."
1,I inspected the headphone and they appear to be well made.  The sound is good and they fit firmly in my ears.  I haven't had a chance to run with them yet but they look like they will do the job well.
0,Lasted 3 months and now wont charage at all.
1,"Awesome headphones, easy setup, easy to use. Crystal clear sound, have been using with iPhone 7, music and calls are clear and perfect volume. Couldn't be more happy with my purchase."
1,Not active noise cancelling but passive as the fit is tight but comfortable (I switched to the smallest of the three optional insert covers). Really good sound and I have yet to run the battery out plus easy/quick charge. Very satisfied.
1,These linked up and work extremely well with my new Moto 5g Plus phone.  I highly recommend them.
0,I need to return this because it stops working after a month!! this is very bad!!
1,"Just received and work as advertised. Love the foam fit earplugs included as the rubber collapsible ones usually don't fit me well. Holds the signal, easy to pair, good sound, good volume.  If they hold up these are a winner for twice the price."
1,"I've used my ear buds twice already and they are great! During workouts there is no skipping a beat with these. The price is reasonable too, I would definitely order them again."
1,"Amazing sound quality, lightweight, durable and great product for the price.  My only issue has been that the ear buds (even smallest size option) are too large for my ears."
1,Great sound and setup took one minute. They're very comfortable too. I use them while lifting weights and they're perfect!
1,"The folks at SENSO are very courteous. They wanted to be sure I had received the headphones & how I was treated & liked them. I work out of an 18-wheeler tanker truck 12 hours a day & I'm a senior citizen. Many of us talk to & help each other through out the day. The wired headset I had for my phone worked sometimes but most of the time not. These are 1000 times better. Once I left my phone in the truck, a call came in & I answered it from the back of the tanker over 30 feet away. Some guys wear the headsets with an external mic. I prefer the integrated mic. With the smallest buds on, I can wear these 12 hours & don't feel them. Next I need to get my sons to show me how to put music on my phone so I can listen to it when not talking oilfield-trucker talk to my co-workers. No more CB radio."
1,"Love em!  They tend to slip out of my ears while mowing, but i sweat alot..riding my bike is not a problem, which is great!  I would buy again"
1,"This product is great deal. Sound quality is awesome, the ease of use, battery lifetime, and price is relatively cheap for the package. it comes with a case, two usb cables with iphone adapter, and the car plug is a nice add to the package."
0,"I've got to say, I trusted most of the great reviews for this product, but I am very unimpressed with them. Here's why:<br /><br />1- Earbud material actually becomes uncomfortable as it rubs against your ear. I tried putting felt pads on them to eliminate the issue, but product should be made of a softer material. Ear holders wraps are soft but easily slip off if you're moving on an elliptical or treadmill and actually working up a sweat or wearing a hat.<br /><br />2- Sound quality is not impressive, earphones usually distort at normal volumes or simply don't have a strong Bluetooth connection.<br /><br />3- Battery life is not as advertised. I end up having to charge these after approx 2 hours of use.<br /><br />Wanted to live these, but they don't live up to the hype with my experience."
1,These are great headphones they are replacement headphones because my dog chewed up my other pair of headphones
1,Exelent
1,"This product is great! This is the second pair that I’ve owned after losing  my first  pair. My music is always so clear and the headphones are easy to operate. The only downside I’ve noticed is, after having them for a few months the person on the other end of my call can’t hear me that well. However, it’s not a big deal since they are mostly used for music."
1,"I haven't used earbuds in years because normally I can't find any that don't fall out of my ears, regardless of material that supposedly molds itself to your ear or a multiplicity of different sized inserts. I've been using headphones but they're bulky to pack and I travel a lot, so I decided to give one of these hook-over-the-ears models a try. I did a lot of research and these SENSOs had the most and best reviews for something under $50.  I'd had Shure earphones before (cost $150) and they sounded great but always fell out.<br /><br />So far I'm very pleased with the SENSOs. They sound close to the Shures and they stay in my ears, plus they have the microphone and controls to answer the phone, which the Shures (which were wired, not Bluetooth) didn't have. I also like the audible feedback for power on and off and pairing state.<br /><br />I'm not an audiophile, so I don't need the absolute best sound quality, but I hate tinny sounding audio. These provide good balanced bass and clarity and that's good enough for me. They definitely sound far, far better than my Samsung Galaxy S7's speakers.<br /><br />I've only had them for a few days so I can't speak to durability, but they appear to be well made and I'm hoping they'll last a long time."
1,Great product! Highly recommend it!
1,These are my first Bluetooth headphones and I happy that they work well. It is easy to pick up a phone call while listening to a book and then switch back. People seem to be able to hear me well on a phone call.
1,"For this price point, these ear buds are unbelievable. Unparalleled battery life versus anything you can get at Walmart, and the sound quality leaves nothing to be desired. Yeah, if you are an audiophile you can probably find some better sounding ear buds but no where near at this price. I have had these buds for over a year now and they are my tried and true pair whether I am going out to eat, going to an event, or even during work. They double exceptionally well as a way to answer phone calls while in public with their intuitive and easy to use controls. You can even skip a song by pressing the volume ""+"" button twice!"
1,"Honestly, I was looking for a replacement for my JBL bluetooth headphones, I could not be happier with the SENSO headphones I chose.  They are SOOOOOO much better than the JBL.  They are manufactured well, have a long range of bluetooth connectivity (twice as much, if not more, than JBL), the thin wire never gets in the way or annoys me while exercising. The battery life is amazing. The earbuds come in three different sizes, and you get so many more accessories with your purchase.  I was truly caught off guard with the additional cords (plural, yes that is intentional) and the adapters (also plural).  Really one of my favorite purchases in a long time. Wish I had known about these before buying the expensive, disappointing JBL headphones."
0,Left side did not work out of the box. Returning today
1,Bought these as a gift for a person who enjoys running.  She loves them!  I have since bought other pairs for gifts.
0,"I got these for Christmas, but unfortunately just got them out today. It's now last the return date. The charging port is not intact, you can hear it rattling around inside the headphone. There is just an empty opening where the charging connection should be. So I can't plug them in the charge them and use them!!"
1,"Good quality headphones, function exactly as advertised."
0,I don't like them the volume is not loud  I wouldn't recommend them to anyone I threw them away never again
1,got my new headphones delivered in 1 day and after charging them took them out for a test spin.....Fantastic sound! very comfortable also. Highly recommend  these!
1,"I have only used these twice, and they seem to work just fine.  Took a few minutes to figure out how to get my phone to 'discover' the earphones, and the controls are very small, but once you get used to them, they seem to work just fine."
1,"Very easy to pair, comes with everything you need and is very comfortable.. i am very pleased with my my headphones.. 5 stars for me!"
1,I'm quite pleased - they work really well and would recommend them
1,"Nice soft rubber piece to go around the ear, the volume is easy to adjust, and the sound quality is very satisfactory.  Very happy with them so far."
0,"Loved them, but everytime they say  battery low when they are on Like 60% then they turn off"
1,This is a really good earbuds. I'm not really into the sports kind and end up throwing it away or not using it for a very long time but I can tell you this that these earbuds are amazing. I still use these and the bluetooth part just makes it better. IDK about the waterproof part since I am a bit skeptical with electronics and them being water proof. But it is definitely sweatproof lol
1,bought this for my son he has no complaints and is always wearing them so I give this a thums up
1,broke up at short distance
1,"Find myself having to re-buy these once every three or four months. This pair I received Nov 10th, theee months later almost to the day (Feb 9) i have to reorder because they will no longer turn on. Have tried resetting, they simply are broken. When they work, they are great. But using them at the gym 7 days a week is apparently too much wear and tear."
1,"After my favorite ""Blayz"" headphones "" stopped being available, I decided to try the Senso - as they seemed very similar.<br />I would say 90-95% as good as the Blayz, which is quite a feat for a sub $20.00 pair.<br />I haven't tested the 8 hour Battery time, but for sure 5 hours, and they rarely miss a beat. Sound over Voice calls and Skype are excellent. Good Base, could be better on the High's. Very comfortable - A winner!<br /><br />So Much better than any of those ""Ear-Bud"" systems. My sons who use The Apple AirPods are amazed at the sound these produce, but they just aren't as ""cool"" as the Ear Bud/style  they say.<br /><br />I'l go for sound and quality!"
0,sounded like a tin can-not good
1,"Best wireless headphones I've ever used in my entire life. I switched from Wireless PowerBeats3 to these SENSO headphones because of the outstanding quality. 10/10, best wireless headphones. I love the fact I can use Google assistant too. They came with so many neat little things along with the product itself, also 1 year warranty??? Literally the best thing I own."
1,"For the price, this product is awesome!! I hope it doesn't break! Will buy a few more for friends as gifts in the future"
1,"Good product, was a gift for my brother and he loves it."
1,Great headset!  I do HIIT training and I never worry about losing them.
1,"Love them, only thing is they stick out of your ears and I get wind noise riding my bike. Other than that they work great. Last long as stated."
1,Sensor provided 5 star customer service. I was very happy with these headphones when I received them. I had a problem with them and had the opportunity to deal with Senso’s customer service. I’m very glad that they quickly responded to my issue to my complete satisfaction. I didn’t give them 5 stars overall because of the initial quality problem that I had with my headphones.
1,"Awesome sound, no wires, easy pairing,  What more could you ask? Oh, and the price is phenomenal."
0,"I owned a pair of these before and was pleased with them - unfortunately I lost them. They were a great product for the price.<br /><br />Unfortunately my second set won’t stay in my ears, no matter what I do. I spend my entire workout or flight putting them back in. 2 stars because sound quality is good."
1,"These are great. I like them better than my last pair, and I really liked those. The sound on these is real nice. With my last pair, the wire would sort of grab the back of my neck when I would turn my head, tugging at the headphones and sometimes causing them to fall out. So far, with these, I don’t get much if any of that. I find they sit in my ears nice. I would definitely recommend these. Obviously, find the bud covers that fit your ears and your in good shape."
1,Very comfortable and easy to use.
1,Great headphones for the price and the packaging was very impressive!! I have been using these in the gym for a week and have no complaints. Noise elimination is great and stays in place when running on the treadmill. Could use a little more bass.
1,"These headphones are all right relative to the price. Nothing special & have some quirks.<br /><br />They're comfortable enough after trying out all 3 sets of ear tips. I settled on the medium sized ones. Not a fan of in-ear phones but these don't seem to take up too much space or hurt the area around my ear hole like others I've tried. I can't get earbuds to stay in my ear, so the hooks are a nice feature to keep the tips secured in my ear.<br /><br />I don't care too much about sound quality and these are fine. The controls are in the right ear piece and I have to wear my iphone 5c in an armband on the right side otherwise the music cuts out every time I stride. Sometimes it cuts out if a make a sudden move with my right arm.<br /><br />It's tough to control the volume or skips songs while running. Also when opening the port on the ear piece to insert the charging cord is extremely difficult and I worry it may break off if I use too much force.<br /><br />I only run 2-3 times a week. So might keep using these. Might just relegate them to beach and things that don't require a lot of movement.<br /><br />To reiterate, an OK product for the price."
1,"I bought these headphones in May 2017 and they lasted till February 2019  - until one side stopped working<br />as a person who would buy new headphones every couple of months, it was wonderful<br />and as a first time user of wireless headphones, it was great!!<br />i did a lot of sweating and they stayed on very well<br />You do have to treat them with a little TLC, but its worth it.<br />One of my best buys on amazon"
1,Bought as a gift. The recipient extremely satisfied with product.
1,"Luv these. Charge lasts for a few days. Not sure why anyone would ever purchase headphones that weren't bluetooth, especially if you're active!"
0,The charging port broke inside the headphones the first time I went to plug in the charger. I got one use out of them.
0,"I’ve ordered these headphone three times not because of how much i love the ease fit and quality.<br /><br />However after 4-6 months of everyday use there always seems to be something wrong. First time they wouldn’t charge, second time the connection between wire and headphone was poor and kept showing wires. This time the headphones are fully charged and will connect for 3 seconds and then disconnect and turn off.<br /><br />If you’re looking for short term Bluetooth headphones... these are great! But if you’re looking for something to last you longer I would chose a different brand.<br /><br />It’s a bummer because they’re my favorite headphone to run in and they are not expensive. however at this rate with the amount that I’ll need to keep buying them I’ll be spending a lot more and will invest in higher quality headphones."
1,Love these headphones!  4th pair. Dog chewed up 2. I can't tell the difference between these and the $200.00 beats I bought the wife. Will definitely buy again.
1,"Good overall sound quality. Still wondering how waterproof they are because I sweat a lot at the gym. They can last about 3 2-hour gym sessions before needing a charge, but they use the same microUSB as my phone. This allows me to charge them during the day when my phone is not being charged. I do get interesting feedback occasionally, which makes me worry about their long term reliability. Sound quality is good overall for earbuds."
0,"After 6 months of use, the Bluetooth is not working. Very disappointing! Do not recommend."
1,"I really wanted these headphones to work. I work outside, and have the luxury of being able to listen to music, podcasts, audiobooks, whatever I want to, while working. I bought these to replace an old, worn out pair of bluetooth earmuff type headphones.<br />The sound quality is pretty decent, and the 'noise canceling' plugs are great. I could actually keep the volume at a decent level and still hear what I was listening to over the noise of the equipment I am operating (old headphones I had to turn volume up all the way, and depending on what I was listening to, I still couldn't hear anything sometimes).<br />My disappointment comes from the constant 'drop' every few minutes (for lack of a better term). No matter what I am listening to, every few minutes the headphones just cut out and back again for just a second or so. It's annoying. It is not because I am going to far away from my connected device, because I am carrying the connected device in my pocket. They are always within 2 feet of each other.<br />The second thing that disappoints me is the battery time. Perhaps all devices of the size operate the same, but these earbuds only last me 3 1/2-4 hours. I only need them to work at most, 5.<br />One other thing I'll mention that has been said by other reviewers: the size of the plugs. If you have small ears, (I do) they will  hurt after having them on about an hour, and the 'loop' that goes over the ear doesn't even touch my ear because it is so big. The plugs are staying in because I have to cram the buds in my ears (because they are so big) and that's what keeps them in! I'm not sure how someone running keeps them in.<br />I think I may have to return these and go back to the bulky headphones."
1,"Everything seems almost perfect with these. I have used them for 2 weeks to run without charging them. Today, it consistently reminded me that the battery was low even though it said it was 30%!!! After a few times, it began disconnecting. I tried multiple times to connect them only for them to disconnect seconds later. They're great but I rather them lose battery quicker and go to 0% than stop working at 30%. Extremely misleading!!!"
0,"I've been very happy with these for over a year now. They are taken care of, mostly worn around the house. Yesterday they started to disconnect from Bluetooth randomly. Sometimes after 10 seconds, sometimes after a minute. Reset my Bluetooth settings, charged fully and they just won't stay connected. While watching a video say on YouTube, the video will pause itself and when I hit play the sound is no longer in the headphones. Departing on trying another brand. A little disappointed!"
0,"They worked great for about a month and now they don't work anymore.  Conveniently, they died after the return date.  Not happy at all."
1,"Very good build quality, especially for the price. I have had many cheap no name and expensive name brand Bluetooth headphones, however these headphones have been the best I have purchased so far. I will be buying these again when I loose them. Sound quality is for bass heavy music and comparable to beats style headphones."
1,"Excellent headphones!  They are very comfortable to wear, relatively easy to apply, once you get the &#34;hang&#34; of it, and produce a marvelous sound quality.  They also hold a charge for a long time.  The package also comes with a complete set of accessories, even a chord to power  up your IPhone!  Overall, I am delighted with these headphones."
1,"Nice headphones to workout and listen to music. They are not noise cancellation in the outdoors, but can definitely work in quiet places to talk. I also have small ear which they fit perfectly without falling out."
1,"They don't stay perfectly, and because they're so big I bump them with my towel a lot, but otherwise I like them. Good sounds and feel durable."
1,Deffinitley worth the buy👍👍👍
1,Very comfortable and great sound. Easy to wear too.
0,Great product while they lasted!!!  Good audio and battery life.  Stayed in place well.  Had them for 2 months.  Probably used about 20 times.  Will not turn on  anymore.
1,Pretty good deal considering the quality. I've got many different headphones including jbls and beats. This was a pleasant surprise. Loud and good bass. Work really well for the gym.
1,Awesome!
1,Well done. Confortable. Pretty good sound.
1,This exceeded all expectations.  great headphone
1,Great sound. Let's see how they hold up.
1,paired easily and sound great.also very comfortable
1,"This is my first pair of wireless headphones and overall the product works great for my needs. When I spoke to a few friends through it they said my voice was muffled but they could hear me, so while the mic may not be perfect it does work well for listening to music or audio books. The battery life so far has been great as well."
1,"This is a much better quality set of headphones than I expected for the price.  Even the packaging was good quality.  These charged quickly ,paired easily,and sound fantastic.  The little extras that came in the box was a magnetic dash mount to hang your headphones on. A nice little cellphone wallet.  Attaches to back of cell phone to keep an I’d or credit card and a very nice sturdy carrying case.  I now can only hope that the headphones are as durable as I think they will be"
1,"Let me start by saying I have no other motivation to review this product other than how satisfied I am.  This is a quality product that is superior to others in its price range.  I've owned many others.  At this price I am planning on buying more<br /><br /> Highlights: Much better sound than competition, much better battery life than competition, I personally like the flexible ear straps although I can see some disliking, no connection issues so far, really nice accessories, not flimsy, comfortable.  The end"
0,"I am surprised to see this product has so many 5 star ratings. I bought this headset to use  during runs. I wanted headset that stays in place and not falling off every 5 minutes. After reading positive reviews, i ordered this product. It was delivered in good package and on time. When I tried it on, ear hook was too big for me. I tried to adjust to clamp on my ears but did not fit. I gave it a trial run outside. Wind interference is terrible. You can hardly hear the music when it is windy. Left ear piece kept falling off my ears. I tried to fix it several times but no luck. Sound quality is mediocre, it was loud but i didnt mind.  I am returning this product."
0,"Updated Review: they just died in me after only 7 months of use. Battery won't hold a charge and keeps disconnecting from both phone and tablet that I've used the whole time. Unfortunate, because these were my favorite so far. Wish they lasted longer.<br /><br />Previous review:These are great! I recommend them. I've had them for months now. Use them daily at work. Hold at least 8 hr+ charge. Connect quickly. Sound quality is clear, crisp highs and deep full lows. Volume is powerful, sometimes have to lower volume because they are that loud. They stay in my ear and don't fall out. Work well with 2 devices at the same time. They work well at cancelling outside noise. Only reason I don't give it a 5 star is because sometimes on a call, I'm not heard clearly because the Mic picks up too much background noise. If I'm driving it's great, but in a public place not so much. I would purchase again, since I don't use them for calls, but for music and videos."
0,"These were great headphones most of the time. Good sound quality, complete noise cancellation,  ok fit, decent battery. One side stopped working after 8 months use -no sound whatsoever.  The other side continued to work but the mic became staticky to the listener. The fit isn't great for jogging or exercise... a quick head turn causes the slack to catch and can pull one of the buds out. They also require a frequent wipe down as they get sweaty. Two stars due to early failure with routine use and poor fit."
0,Ear buds don’t fit well..  speakers distorted.  Even at low levels..... returning.
0,Muy bueno todo pero al final los cables se rompen
1,"love it, but only about 8 hours used"
1,"Works as advertised.  Matched with my Pixel first time, quick charge, great sound, and comfortable through my entire workout with no slip."
0,"There's nothing more discouraging than leaving for a workout with the battery level at 70% then having it die 0 minutes later, after only about 3 hours of total use. Sound is great, they're very comfortable, but what's the point of wireless headphones if you they die so quickly? Especially when the description puts the battery life at 8 hours."
1,It works great for me during workout and running. Poor sound (echo sound of other person) thats annoying for others to whom I call using this  Bluetooth device
1,"I have spent hundreds of dollars on earbuds,and these are just as good if not better then the way more expensive ones."
1,I like these headphones for working out.  Cheap option that works great
1,"Great device. Light, good sound and easy control. Came on time and was in super shape."
1,the best earphones for working outside in the heat all day.  great sound
1,"Delivered fast, easy to use and the bass is tight. Use mine for workouts, no slip, no problems. Great product."
1,"So far, my husband like it, and no issues."
1,"Love the headphones, and if there is a problem, the customer service is prompt and super!"
0,"Range was pretty bad.  Walk more than 10 feet away and it starts cutting out.  I have another pair of bluetooth headphones that I can walk at least 30 feet with before they cut out.<br /><br />Can't control music apps.  Press pause, paused spotify, hit again to start playing, opens up phones default music app and starts playing that.  Not sure how that works, but not too pleased with these."
1,Only had them a couple of days.  Use them for running.  So far excellent.  Much better sound quality than my Jaybird X2s and they stay in ear better and I don't have to worry about finding that I lost an ear tip on the way to my run.  They even audibly tell the number of the caller when a call comes in.  Two charging cables and an adapter so I can charge for the car  AND a nice case.  Exceptional!!!!
1,"For me it is difficult to find a comfortable set of earbuds that actually sound good. I would say they are pretty comfortable but not perfect. Everybody's ears are different so don't go by my review... your mileage may vary.<br />These pack more bass than I expected and are loud. I have a Samsung Note 9 that has good EQ tuning capability and I am finding that is a huge advantage as you switch between different headphones since most have a different sound signature. The Samsung EQ allows for your custom EQ and profile saving.... perfect.<br /><br />Here's what's funny.... I bought these for a lightening deal last year (2017) and paid $15. I threw them in my drawer and didn't break them out until last month. Never even opened up the box!  These were the cheapest ones I bought last year and just assumed low quality. WRONG! I have been using other BT earbuds that are nowhere as nice as these. These are pretty darn nice for working out, traveling, or just listening around the house.<br />You get a lot in this package! case, cables, extra earbuds... and today I just noticed the foam pads... nice!<br /> I know that the real wireless buds are the rage this year but I bet most of them cost more and don't sound as good and the wire isn't really that much of a hassle... I would much rather save the $$, have longer battery life and much better quality.<br />I wouldn't hesitate to buy these again for sure!"
1,"These headphone are amazing, they work great when working out or just listening to music on the go. Sound quality is perfect and the range of Bluetooth is not bad. Customer service is outstanding, they reach out to me with timely response when I had a question about the headphones."
1,It fits great and doesn’t fall off during runnings.
1,They are great you can hear great
1,I actually had to put a decent effort into getting these off once I put them on so when you're running or biking or whatever you're doing these things will not abandon you however I haven't tested the longevity of the battery yet but we shall see and they sound great lots of bass
1,AMAZING!
1,I recommend these headphones for all. they are great.
1,"Comfortable and secure in the ear although a bit bulky. All controls are on right earphone and are easily accessible. Charging slot cover doesn't always stay in place. Doesn't always work if phones are 30' away from main unit. Anything closer than 30' they work flawlessly. Charging is quick and simple. Haven't yet maximized the battery usage to see if I can get 8 hrs. of battery life as claimed. Noise cancellation is acceptable but don't expect 100%. The phone connection feature is also acceptable. Only used the earphones several days so I can't comment on longevity. However the unit feels and looks solid and of good construction. Most importantly for anyone using earphones to listen to music...The sound is EXCELLENT.<br /> Bass, treble, separation... all working as good or better than any other much more expensive earphones I have used in the past."
1,Nice product. Great seller. Item is better than advertised!
1,"I know I shouldn’t expect much for the price but the sound quality is mediocre. I think the frequency response of the speakers is a bit treble heavy and needs more low end before I touch my equalizer settings. Truthfully, I bought these as an interim pair of headphones until I can find a quality replacement that I’m willing to shell out more money for. I will give this product 3 stars though for being decent enough to work, even after the punishing amount of abuse I tend to unleash on sport headphones and other Bluetooth devices. They seem to be constructed well for the low price. Whether they survive being drowned in my sweat after dozens of spin classes will be the true test."
1,Excelente
1,"Very nice set of headphones, I highly reccomend them."
1,Love the sound and the high volume capability. The only negative I found was sound quality while using them for cell phone calls. There seems to always be an echo on the far end and distortion on the near end. I highly recommend for listening to music or movies.
1,Headphones sound good and are comfortable.
1,if I would've payed full price for these earbuds I would have been not too happy sound quality is just OK
1,Like that they came with a nice case for storage
1,Comfortable to wear and easy to use! I would recommend them!
1,These things are amazing. Great quality and price. I will be ordering another pair.
1,They are awesome no problems!!
1,SENSO Bluetooth Headphones best headphones I ever bought. Great Sound. Very comfortable. Great Price. Easily paired with my iPhone 6S Plus. Highly recommend anybody looking for a great pair of wireless headphones at a great price. Recommended for one friend and ordered one for another friend. Will keep recommending it to other friends.
1,"Good price, and pretty good fit.  Stays in place while I run.  However, the sound is very muddled and bass-heavy."
1,"Incredibly affordable, durable and good quality. I keep buying $100+ buds and they break or they just don’t measure up to the price. This is a great, affordable option!"
1,Great product for the price
1,Good value
1,"I love the length of battery life this model offers. Perfect for when I'm on the go, at the gym, or even cleaning the house. They are flexible and comfortable too in comparison to a TaoTronics pair I owned. They seem sturdy enough as well. The only technical problem I've experienced is the connectivity with my laptop, but I think that might be less to do with the product and more so my computer. Connectivity unexpectedly gets cut off and sometimes the headphones won't connect at all unless I reset both my laptop and the headphones. Not a big deal because the headphones connect with my phone and tablet smoothly; so I'm not too concerned.  Overall, good results so far."
1,Excellent wireless earbuds. Would buy again
1,"This are great wireless headphones.  The sound is incredible.  They definitely block out all outside noise for me while I run.  This is a great deal for a great sounding pair of headphones.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B01G8JO5F2 SENSO ActivBuds Bluetooth Headphones, Best Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7 Waterproof HD Stereo Sweatproof Earbuds for Gym Running Workout 8 Hour Battery Noise Cancelling Headsets]]"
1,"Worked great the first two months. Low and behold the lower volume button stopped working. A week later the device emitted a beep and the Bluetooth stopped working. I tried a factory reset and nothing. I payed for a product that lasted less than 2 months and I got very little use at that.<br /><br />I contacted their customer service, they were very friendly and sent me a new set. Hopefully it works out because I really did like the headphones they were nice and tight."
0,Two months after purchasing this product and the left speaker already went out. Used very sparingly during a work day. Really disappointed with my product purchase. No one likes listening to music in one ear.
0,Se desactiva con cualquier moviento del telefono
1,"This is my first pair of Bluetooth headphones and I really like them. I've been using it since January for workouts at the gym, at home and for running. They stay put and don't fall out of my ears, which is really impressive. Battery life is not an issue and it will tell me when I'm low. Would definitely buy again."
1,"What's there not to love? They fit well, work well, and are much more reasonable price than the high-priced competitors."
1,"I recently received these headphones, and thus far I'm very pleased. I do a vigorous water aerobic exercise daily, and have tried a number of ear buds while doing so, but they often lacked clear sound, fell out of my ears, or broke down when too far from my iPhone. All three problems were solved the first time I used the Senso headphones."
1,"Quality, versatility and customer service seems great. Nothing I don’t like so far."
0,Didn’t even last a year. Just quit working. Complete garbage.
1,Don’t know how I ever worked out without them<br />Great sound. Very comfortable.
1,"Hubby likes these, unfortunately our dog does too."
0,The product came out the package broken. They looked to be used already. The ear buds themselves were worn out looking and discolored. I would not recommend these earbuds to anyone.
1,"Arrived on time. Work great, pairs easily. Sound is really good! It does block out most noise. They fit better than my last pair. I adjust them way less when I'm running/at the gym. They do not slip either. I did not rate the battery life, only because I've had them about a week. I also haven't lost signal with them yet, took a little bit to pair this morning at the gym, but nothing to serious. Overall good product for the price."
1,Sound is amazing for price.
1,Very robust and fit well. And of course the sound is amazing!
0,Would not ft my ears comfortably. That happens a lot.
1,Great product. Thank you.
1,"Great value! Bluetooth works great, very loud and very good sound quality."
1,These headphones are great.
1,Very comfortable and loud
0,"The only reason I am giving two stars and not one is because these are the first pair of in ear headphones that I've been able to run with and not have to constantly mess with them to keep them in my ears. That being said, they are worthless to have on a run because the bluetooth tech is not nearly good enough. Using these headphones reminded me of the day when you'd run with a discman and the music would just constantly skip. You'd try to hold it in a way so that it wouldn't skip as much, then you're paying more attention to the device than the music, run, or anything else. My first attempts were with the apple watch and those results were by far the worst. I ended up just taking the headphones out because they were just distracting with the skipping. I thought, ok maybe it's the combination of the watch and the headphones that they just don't have a strong enough signal, so I tried running with my phone. That did improve a bit, but it was still not good enough to continue using. I'm just passed the window for returning or I would. If you are going to run with bluetooth headphones, don't buy these."
1,Great sound and quality<br />I am ordering my wife a set so I can get mine back
1,Very easy to set up and use. The sound output is very clear with hardly any background!
1,"Love my headphones. They are comfortable,have great sound, and easy to connect to my iPhone. I had bought a pair from skull candy that were more expensive, uncomfortable and wouldn’t stay connected. These are perfect! Love love love and the price is great too!"
1,My wife is been using this earphone every day for 4 months and no complain.. no joke its very good earphone...
1,"I just got them and only used them once so far.  I went for a run and my music had a lot of skipping using the Bluetooth connection.  It could be that I just have an old phone iPhone 5.  There were times during the run when it was great, but there were a lot of stretches when the skipping was close to being annoying enough to turn off the headphones."
1,"These headphones are amazing. Better than a lot of brandname ones. They definitely hold their charge since I’ve gone over a week without charging them and they still work. Pretty water resistant too as I only use them when I’m working out and have sweated all over them. The accessories they come with are great too, so that’s a nice bonus."
1,"These are the absolute best, for very low price."
1,Used them right out of the box and they sounded fabulous!  Plaited them up easily with no problems.  Can't wait to use them to workout or run!  Great buy!!
1,"I used to have the Beats by Dr. Dre Powerbeats 2 Wireless In‑Ear Headphones because they were the best wireless earbuds as some suggested, and yes, I totally agree with them. I only bought these because I misplaced the beats so I need a substitute pair. The price of these looks way cheaper than the original price of $160. But honestly, they are really worth $40 with the low sound and texture qualities. If you don't care about the sound quality and just want something cheap for gym; or something that you don't mind losing, these are absolutely the best for you as they come with bunch of other charging supplies in the box."
1,Really cheap headphone but the sound quality maaan. So awesome!
1,"I was super hesitant to buy wireless headphones at such a low price but these are perfect! The charge last me my whole 8 hour work day. it allows you to adjust the volume, pause, and skip songs from the earbud so you don't have to be near your device to adjust what you are listening to. I am very satisfied with this purchase!"
1,"sometimes it just does not connect, recieve a lot of interference"
1,My husband ordered a pair for the gym. My son was so impressed with them he ordered a pair for himself. So far that both are completely satisfied.
1,"The phones arrived quickly and well packaged in a smart box that also provided a clear guide to the contents.<br />The actual package was very comprehensive with not only short and a long charging leads, but a dual car lighter adaptor and a smart carrying case to protect the phones.<br />The phones themselves are compact and light, fitting comfortably and snugly (with small, medium and large ear buds) all waterproof, making them ideal for exercise use. The sound from such light and compact phones is excellent, with good ambient noise suppression. I have listened to audio books and music, both of which are reproduced very clearly and at more than adequate volume from my phone.<br />Overall I very pleased with the purchase and with the very reasonable price."
1,"decent cheap bluetooth wireless speakers, sound is good, when rollarblading, wind noise is very high, not noise cancelling (but not billed as such)."
1,ok..sound
0,APARECE ENTREGADO EL PRODUCTO PERO NO LO HE RECIBIDO.
1,I just received these the other day so I haven't had much time to use them. Though I did try them out and the sound quality seems to be really good. And the pairing process was really easy compared to the last set of bluetooth earbuds. I really like the adjustable ear pieces.
1,Really enjoying my headphones. Music and phone are loud and clear. Real easy set up too.<br />I recommend these for the money
1,these are very decent headphones. ordered some 17$ TAIR bluetooth headphones that SUCKED. sound was bad and didnt stay in ears.<br /><br />The sound in these is decent. not great. stay in ears nicely and will be good for lifting.<br /><br />only downside is they stick WAY out of your ear. a bit clunky.<br /><br />glad i bought these. would be curoius how these compare the the similar BEATS model
1,I have went on a number of runs with these headphones without a problem. Great quality for the price!
1,"Good price , good costumer service, good warranty,"
1,"The sound quality is great, but the ear wrap is HUGE. It's taller than my actual ear."
0,dasent water droop
1,"I love my new wireless headphones, The sound is crystal clear. They were so easy to pair to my iPhone 7 Plus and the ear grips fit perfect. Additionally I thought it was really great to get multiple types of chargers."
1,These are really great head phones. They pair and function well. Good sound. Buttons are easy to access and push. The microphone works really well for phone calls. I'm going to buy another pair for my wife.
1,"So far so good. I just got these but they are exactly what I was looking for. The cord isn't too long, it doesnt bug my neck. The sound seems good. I only use them for walking at this point, but they seem comfy. Good deal at a good price."
1,Nice product
1,These Headphones are absolutely AWESOME!!! The sound is full and you hear nothing but your music. I use them when I workout and they are one of the best purchases I have made from Amazon. Thank you for a great product!!
1,"My Senso Bluetooth Headphones are great, the sound is solid and it connects to my phone really well.  Really like the voice power on and off from the headphones."
1,"Very happy with these. I wear these on the bus and for travel. The do a great job of clearing out the other noises so i can work or listen to music.They started to have some connection issues, and i got another pair to try . They were not as good, as these sound great, with good bass clarity.I ended up contacting them as i was within my year warranty period and after a very brief exchange i got a new pair in the mail. Super happy with the quick response and support. Happy to have these back again."
1,"I didn't care for these headphones. They are way too bulky. The sound quality was really good but not much bass in my opinion. I wear glasses everyday so the ear hook thing didn't work well for me. It was hard to get the bud in my ear and if I only wanted to wear one bud while at work, the other bud was too large to slip under the neck of my shirt. I'm returning mine for a different brand that's cheaper and smaller."
0,These worked great.... for a month.  Then they just stopped turning on.  I know they weren't that expensive but I wish I could've used them for longer than a month or could get my money back.
1,"great sound, a little getting used to the fit but all in all a great buy!"
1,I can't understand why this cuts in and out when listening to music and the phone is in my pocket two feet away. It's not just this brand. This is the second headphones I have tried with the same results
1,Got these for my boyfriend for his birthday and he loves them! They really are noise cancelling too lol..... he can't hear me when I'm trying to get his attention 😂
1,"I have only had this hooked up  for 2 days, but  so far I'm quite satisfied with them. They are very clear and easy to operate.  Ron T"
1,"I got these so that I could leave them at work for days when I forget to bring my headphones to work. They are not super comfortable, the over the ear part causes pain in my ears at some point during a pretty regular 1hr workout. There are great for when I forget to bring my other, newer, senso ear buds."
1,"I have had these headphones for a week now and they have exceeded my expectations.  I have a Lenovo business laptop running Windows 7, a 5 year old HP laptop running Windows 10, and a 4 year old Android phone running Android 4.4.2.  These headphones had no problem connecting to any of these old devices, and they sound better than any ear-bud headphones I've ever owned, including wired headphones.  I was also surprised they do block some external noise.  I don't remember reading anything saying they would, but they do.  I wear them for about five hours a day while working on my computer and they are very comfortable.  The battery lasts a little over a day, so between 6 and 8 hours of continuous use.  Not too bad for such a small package.  I recommend these to anyone looking for a good sounding pair of ear buds."
1,"This is my second pair I have purchased of the same earbuds. I want to clarify something, I am not a crazy, gotta be a perfect pitch kind of guy, please understand that. My first purchase of these buds was in April of 2017 and I paid about 35 bucks. They lasted almost 2 1/2 years of constant use as well as abuse and whether I was at the gym with volume maxed out ( and they handled that) or relaxing watching a movie these buds did the job for me. My recently purchased 2nd pair work as well as the first set and only cost 20 bucks. If you are looking for a very inexpensive set of buds that deliver great sound, then these should work for you. Looking for say Bose quality, then no, but I am pretty hard on my buds and these hung in there with me for over 2 years originally. I went back to them and am not disappointed. I still haven't received my free gift as promised, so I wouldn't count on getting it if I were you"
1,The tips really stay on which I like because for some reason I tend to lose these on all the other earbuds.  The wrap around the ear piece is flexible so you can bend into what position you feel is comfortable.  I've never had an issue with the other earbuds wrap around ear pieces even though they were hard but this is a nice feature.  And not something about the earbuds I appreciate the bonus card holder that sticks to your cellphone (handy for those of us that don't always want to carry a wallet as well as a phone).
1,"Great sound, stays in the earhole. My biggest issue is the ear hooks...they feel flimsy. Make no mistake they stay put, but the feel is off putting."
1,"Good head phones with good sound quality. Comes with plenty of charging cords, a very nice car charger, and a CASE, which most do not. Great buy for a great price."
1,The sound quality was much better than I expected since the price was so good.
1,"I workout in front of a fan, and the wind noise in the headphones is bad. I can tell that it's is from physical wind, as opposed to electrical or radio noise because the noise stops when I cup my hands over my ears.  Otherwise great sound and fit."
1,Good wireless earbuds for the money. Sound is great but no noise canceling as stated. I use them at the gym and they stay in place and are comfortable. I would buy again.
1,Very impressed so far!
1,Headphones work great I will get a lot of use out of them.
0,over hyped. I didnt like the sound. Cracking/static noise if I listen to music at high volume.
0,"Disappointed. Uncomfortable, tinny sound."
0,"Horrible with background noise, my most of the calls are outdoors and the headset doesn't seems to cater for that. Useless for me."
1,"Great sound for the price, no problems while doing constant moving like running and hitting the heavy bag. No complaints."
1,"I had these for almost 6 months now and I don't workout without them.<br />For the price I thought, what the heck, I'll give it a try.  I've gotten my money's worth.  I'll buy them again<br />They out performed my overpriced $110 monster.<br />I've logged over 60 miles using these.  I sweat profusely and not have a problem with them falling out.  The over the ear clip holds well.  The lack of wire in it make wearing sunglasses comfortable.  I've taken a few short calls during my runs and it was clear on both ends.<br />You get more than what you pay for."
1,"I totally love these.  I opened the box, asked my iPod to connect, within seconds, I was jamming to amazing bass.  Next, I asked my iPhone to connect, tried Pandora, amazing.  Immediate bluetooth connection.  They fit in my ear (buds) and around my ear perfectly, couldn't be happier.  Perfect for workouts or anywhere.  I haven't tried phone calls yet, but have had one week and these are over the top.  The price is in line for quality received.  Come with a portable carrying case, car charger, extra ear bud pads and more.  Love, love, love.  Oh, and I got an email from the company president, Kenneth Bastrom to follow up on satisfaction."
0,"When these first arrived I was initially quite happy with my purchase. The only problem initially was the audible low battery indicator gave me only a few minutes before shutting off the unit. Although the percentage of battery remaining was indicated on my phone via the Bluetooth function, it was always a mile off. I had to guess when it needed charging unless it was completely dead.<br /><br />The stems that go over the ear (to hold it in place) are very flimsy. If bumped or squished they'll bend very easily. I cringed each time I re-bent them because I was always concerned the rigid wire inside would eventually break.<br /><br />These flaws I could live with, but it wasn't long before the sound in one ear shut off. No doubt it's something in the connecting wire as it enters the earpiece. So pretty useless now unless I just want to listen in one ear. It didn't get heavy use. I suspect I got about 50  hours of use out of it.<br /><br />Sound quality is okay. I usually listen to news or books, so quality isn't as important."
0,"Pretty weak microphone. Even when I speak louder my usual voice on the phone, people still complain about not being able to hear me. Once I was asked if I had a wall between me and the phone.<br />Other than that,  battery life is wonderful,  synchronization time is flawless.<br />Comfort,  once you get used to them, they're ok.<br />ONLY if they improve their microphones issue.<br />I am using them only in the gym but when I get a call, I  have to turn them off so people can hear me. It's a bit hassle.<br />I would try something different next time."
1,"I've only used the headphones ones so far but they seem to fit well, have great sound and easy to use and setup with blue tooth.  I'm very happy with this purchase and the price is a great value."
1,"I was so impressed with tha quality and sound, I immediately purchased another set.  Absolutely amazing. Great product"
1,Great sound quality and comfortable. Easy to pair and charge/recharge. Excellent product.
1,"These were a Christmas gift for my son who originally asked for Beats wireless headphones. As everyone knows they are very expensive so I started doing some research. I came across this product and read many of the reviews. Since I don't use wireless earbuds I had no personal experience with any one company. Many of the reviewers had that experience and named several Brands I had heard of that were way more expensive and not as good as these. I decided to give it a go and purchased these. My son loves them. He uses them every day. He's taken them on long sports bus trips, gym workouts etc and they perform well. He just said it again last night--&#34;I really like these wireless headphones. And they charge really fast too&#34;. My husband has a pair that are way more expensive than these and I think he's on his fourth pair (getting exchanges thank goodness) because they don't hold up. This is a great product. And a really really great product for the price! Will definitely purchase again!"
0,I don't know if it's operator error but the sound frequently breaks up and crackles. I'm not satisfied with the product and have gone back to wearing my Mac earbuds. I wouldn't recommend this product.
1,"Love these headphones but last weekend they stopped working. I emailed Senso and asked how to access the warranty to get a repair or replacement. They sent me info on how to reset the headphones in case it was a calibration issue and I followed instructions without success. I expected more of a hassle but they asked me for the order info and got information to send me a new pair. It isn't the exact pair, they were replaced with sports headphones, but they feel and sound the same. I love that it was a no hassle replacement. Top notch service really, in a world where that isn't seen often."
1,These earphones are a great value and deliver Good sound for the money.  I am also impressed by the inclusion of a long USB charging cable with a dual mini USB and apple connector port and a car charger.
0,"I really liked these headphones. The sound quality was great for the price and they stayed in my ears for all my runs. However, after only having them a couple of months they will not charge with any cable from any source. I have tried the cable they came with along with several others. I have tried charging it both from the computer and from the wall and neither will work.<br /><br />It's disappointing because I thoroughly enjoyed these headphones, but they stopped working so quickly without any heavy wear and tear."
1,They are a decent pair of Bluetooth earbuds but really nothing spectacular. The sound quality is good when you are close to the phone but if you walk away any it fades easily and the range is minimal at best. But they are serving their purpose....
1,These earphones are worth every penny. I use them regularly for each workout and they fit perfectly without any issues.
1,"Love these, they really stay put"
1,Good
1,the treble isn't as crystal clear as what I get from the beats solo but it makes up for that in the volume and depth of the bass output. i love it because it drowns out the surrounding noise and makes me focus on my workout. i'm giving it a 5 star because the sound difference dissipated within minutes of listening to full track and getting used to it.
0,"Buyer beware, these are NOT sweat proof and should not be used heavy exercise or running.  This is my third pair and was initially attracted to the best seller rating and large amounts of reviews. They worked fine and fit better than most headphones I had tried for running during the winter months, but as soon as it started to warm up and I started sweating a bit more, I lost audio in one ear.<br /><br />Giving them the benefit of the doubt, I ordered another pair and one for my dad as well.  After not even a week of the new ones, the same issue happened. I returned that pair and received a new one. Well, around two weeks later I was out of a run, felt a drop of sweat running from my ear and the second it hit the earbud, I lost all audio. Now they are completely dead and I can no longer return them.<br /><br />I suppose for everyday use these may be fine, but I heavily advise against using them for the gym / running. To advertise as the &#34;Best Wireless Sports Earphones... IPX7 Waterproof... Sweatproof Earbuds&#34; is disingenuous and wrong."
1,"Great product! many useful extras included with device. great sound, easy to use. carry case appreciated"
0,A lot of distortion and whistling. Anyway I had protection so I got a new 1con z mail. I really do hope this 1 works fine.
0,"Great clear sound. Almost perfect.  The weakness is lack of bass sound and the battery didn't last long at as advertised.<br />Worse than that....After month of barely using, this Senso Headphones couldn't connect to any bluetooth device any more......."
1,"I'm rating this 4 stars only because I haven't had them for very long. I love the headphones so far, easy to use, the fit is comfortable and secure. I like the addition of the ear piece for extra security. The sound is clear and very good."
1,Fantastic ...what else can I say ...my daughter keeps borrowing them ..battery life excellent ..sound excellent ...comes with all kinds of accessories...guy at work bought same ...he loves them
1,Work great!
1,"My bluetooth earbuds arrived in one day and have worked perfectly.  The instructions are easy to follow and are very versatile.  I highly recommend them for clear, cable-free listening up to 30 feet away."
1,So far so good...and the sound is much better than I expected.
0,"Received headphones for a week. I charged them last night and went to use them. Found out that they had overheated.  The right ear piece has melted. I am no longer able to turn the headphones on. Very disappointed, sending them back."
1,Good sound and bass. Stays in  ears during workout.
1,"I love this headphones. It's not my first bluetooth headphones and hope it's the last, perfect for workout or a run because it goes around the ears. The sound is also decent."
1,"I bought these headphones on a sale and I really do not regret. The material looks to be really durable, they are quite comfortable and they attach perfectly so I can even run and they do not fall. I am impressed with the passive noise canceling, I can use them at the gym with the environment music and noise and I can hear my favorite songs in peace. The sound quality is not the high-end type but it is okay, its bass is very good but it lacks of highs. If you are planning to use them for sports then I highly recommend them."
1,Excellent cost performance.  The sound on the other end of calls seems to be muffled a little but it does the job.
1,Good product. Good service. As described and on-time. What's not to like?
1,Fantastic.  Think about another set very soon
1,The bendable frame around the ears.
1,"Good sound, fit takes a little work to find the right sized ear bud but you have the choice of several."
1,Pretty decent battery life.  lasts throughout most of the day before the battery needs recharging.  Perfect for casual listening or gym.
1,"Really liking these so far.  Took a bit to get used to but now that I am, they are what I wanted"
1,Great sound. Tremendous power.  Paired with an iphone8 and using Pandora to stream music and one bar of volume on the iPhone is loud enough.  Earbuds are comfortable and stay put.
1,"Got these on a special deal for way less than what they are worth, and they are completely worth it. Not sure if they are worth full price though. Fit well, sound great, and are even a bit water resistant."
1,I’ve had these headphones for probably 3 years now and they’re still going strong! I wear them often at the gym and I’m surprised at how well they’ve worked for so long. I’ve convinced multiple family members and friends to try them bc I’ve had such a good experience
1,"My son loves them. He initially balked at an unknown brand but said after reading that over 20,000 people gave them great reviews he would try them. He has been converted."
0,They were great until they completely stopped working after 3 weeks. No I didn’t get them wet. Will not order again. Waste of money.
1,For the price these headphones are great. The sound quality is good & the features are the same as any other  high end wireless headphones. Battery life is long. Comes in a cute zip pouch. The only CONS: don’t like the flexible ear part.
1,These headphones are Very Comfortable to wear and have a Great sound! Light weight and feel very secure when working out!
1,"Absolutely the BEST headphones I have ever owned at this price (and with a year warranty)  Great company!!  I received a letter from the President.  I am an EVP of a mid-size company out of Michigan, and I generally don't have the opportunity to touch every client.  Thank You Invotek!!  WOW!!<br /><br />If we look at why the headphones are better:  they are LOUD (if you want them to be), they are super comfortable in and around the ear, they hold a charge for 4 to 5 hour and a half long gym sessions, fastest syncing headphones on the market, best full spectrum of sound you will find under $200 dollars..  Need I say more???  You will not go wrong with these bad boys, and if you do? the Invotek service is really solid..  Just buy em already..  Fence sitters,, pull the trigger, you won't regret it.."
0,DON’T ORDER! I bought these to use while exercising.  I had decent “luck” with them in the past.  They either failed within a few weeks or lasted 18 months or so.  If they failed in the warranty period I was able to get them replaced.  Sound was decent and if I got 18 months from the product it was worth the price.  However when these failed I called for support was told I would receive an email with instructions.  It never came.  I called again.  Same result although I was promised the device would be replaced.  Family member who had also tried these had similar results.

1,"Great pair of nose cancelling bluetooth headphones.  Great feel,  sound and most of all a great price. Pairs easily and automatically to my bluetooth devices after the initial pairing. Highly recommend.  I use them when I do yard work and I am very pleased with them."
1,They are comfortable and sound great. Can't beat the price. These were for my wife but I might have to get myself a pair now too.
0,"These headphones are not quality connecting at all. It is taking me 5 or 6 tries before they will connect to my phone, even after they've been paired. The overall quality of the headphones feels like cheap plastic that will soon fall apart; which is confusing because the actual quality of sound and noise cancelling is decent especially for the price. It doesn't help if I can't enjoy the music though.<br />Seriously considering returning them after only a day.<br /><br />I gave these my best shot, kept them beyond the time to be able to return them (honestly die to covid) but I am decreasing my raing to only star. When they connect and actually hold, decent sound quality. That's all I will give these. Not recommended at all."
1,"Was not expecting the quality of sound for the price I paid.  Because of the hype about Beats and other high priced Bluetooth earbuds, I expected what you pay for at a much lower price you get.  Boy was I ever wrong.  This product far exceeds my expectations if fact as I type this I'm listening to beautiful crisp Christmas music with I think has great base sounds.  They fit comfortable to my ear and I enjoy the lightweight of the earbuds.  Comes with three interchangeable ear buds.  I would highly recommend this product if your on the fence for buying someone a great gift for Christmas gift at a affordable price."
1,"Great Ear set! Very fast charging, great sound, light and easy to use.<br />But just after a few months in the gym they stopped working and I dont know the reason. I guess maybe they are water proof, but not the sweat proof, after all..."
1,"sounds good, stays on ear while running, battery life is more than expected.  Good buy!"
1,Good earphones quality sound
1,"They're too bulky for my taste. They also cut out even when I'm close to my device. I use earbuds daily so I am rather picky. My last pair had a much better range, but they eventually died.  These just dont fit my needs."
1,"I bought these because my other pair was started to only work if it was plugged in and so far i haven't have any serious issues with it. 2 things that i found out early on about these were, 1 The plastic parts supposed to keep it connected to your ear are either flimsy or to loose which defeats the purpose. The other is that though I couldn't hear outside noises while listening my other set also had great noise reduction outside the headphones so no one could hear, these on the other hand are a one way noise reduction streak, people can hear it outside of yourself.<br /><br />The pluses are that the sound quality i believe is not only louder but better than my other ones. I haven't had them long enough to know if they'll keep up but hopefully they will.<br /><br />Would i recommend this? Like i said it's a time based decision but for now i'd say if you need some and don't run marathons for them to possibly fall out then it's a good buy. Their Customer Service is almost instantaneous and there's a 1 year warranty so there's that. That's all I got for now, maybe i'll update this later, for now 4/5 rating."
1,"I bought the first pair of these earbuds for my son, who is selective in what he uses, and he LOVES them! So I ordered a second pair for my daughter! She too is very happy with them. The earpiece is soft and flexible and keeps the ear buds in place nicely. My son says that they do a great job cancelling out other noise. For the price, they are amazing and rival more expensive brands. I highly recommend the SENSO Bluetooth headphones! I also recommend this seller, who was fast with delivery and everything was packaged well!"
1,These are surprisingly much better than expected. Good sound and &#34;noise cancellation&#34;.<br />The Bluetooth connection gets a bit clunky at times at the gym.
1,These are by far the best headphones I have ever owned. They fit perfectly in my ears and drown out all noise. I even wore them cutting grass and could not hear the noise from the lawn mower.
1,"These are really great bluetooth headphones!! Long battery life, good sound. I am really enjoying them!!"
1,"Easy to function, sound is terrific. Very happy with this purchase. Good price. Comes with nice case, charger cord and car charger."
1,Work great
0,This product stopped working 6 weeks after I purchased it.
1,Sound HD sound good<br />Need  a clip for  for shirt.
1,"I have no complaints! When I initially purchased my headphones they worked great. I was able to use them at the gym without them sliding off my ears from sweating, which was primarily the reason I brought them.<br />My 5 stars isn't just for the product, but my experience with customer service. I had an issue where one ear stopped working after over six months of constant use and I contacted customer service to help resolve this issue. After trying to help me troubleshoot, they sent a replacement pair with no questions asked; They were prompt and courteous."
1,Fantasic ear buds. I use them eveytime I go running or exercise. Perfect cash for quality of your active
1,"Great product no complaints so far, only have had them for 3 days but was impressed with quality and amount of things to come with it. Charger ext"
0,I was happy with them when I first purchased them. But held off on writing a review until I had used them for a while. I was using them at work today and decided to plug them in to charge. When I was leaving work I tried turning them on and nothing. The indicator light said they were fully charged. So sad that they went kaput so fast.
1,Great product.. great price
1,I really enjoyed these. Ive had them for a few mo this and I use them at the gym. Battery lasts a long time. Sound quality is great and they stay in your ear.
1,Everything ok!
0,I bought it in Sep 2018. Now it died in Dec 2019. Almost 1 year and 3 months. Bad quality.
1,Sounds great and very comfortable
0,Worked for six months and now has a fuzzy sound when hitting bass notes.
1,Love them easy on my bike rides
0,"I  purchased this April 2017. It is what I call &#34;standard&#34;. It functioned for listening to music while working out and doing yard work; nothing too strenuous.  Unfortunately, they lasted about 6 months. They stopped working and would not take a charge. For the price, I expected a longer time of use. This is not an item I would purchase again; and have not."
1,"For the price, these headphones are really good. They obviously go around your ears so they don’t fall out unless you start violently shaking your head so they’re good for gym use. My one issue with them is that they keep saying “battery low” and turning down your volume when they start to get low. I understand if they do it once or twice but they interrupt each song like 4-5 times and that’s pretty annoying. Get rid of that feature or just always keep your battery high and you’ll be all set."
1,"These are a great buy. Reasonably priced and work great! I've struggled to find a pair that I'm not constantly readjusting or putting back in during my workouts, these stay in place even during the toughest runs and heaviest lift days. Plus the sound is fantastic!"
0,The battery life is terrible. It has to be charged every 2 hours. If I ever buy any wireless again it won’t be Senso brand wireless.
0,"These are terrible, the reception is awful. I run with my phone in a holster clipped to my waist no more than 2 feet from the headphones and the reception is still awful. My advice is to buy a better quality pair of headphones."
1,Received as promised with extras like dual port car adaptor included. Fits well and sounds great
1,"Exceeded my expectations!!  Love it!  Easy to use, excellent sound quality, GREAT Value.  I have had other EarPods and these work the best."
1,Best sounding earbuds I have ever owned. Have had several wired and bluetooth sets. Sound ranges are clear and accurate. The buds fit my ears (small) with no noticeable discomfort. I do not have to stuff them way into my ears to get clear sound as with other sets. Great value for the price. The only problem I have thus far is I can see the indicator light reflection in my glasses at night. Still giving a 5 star. Thanks for a great product!
1,"Incredibly impressed with these headphones.  So I've bought a few bluetooth headphones before but there was always something I did not like.  Either the sound quality was garbage or they did not last long, or actually fit my ears.  SENSO changed that and blew it out of the water completely.  Opening the box and seeing everything included, you can tell that the company takes pride in their brand.  There are plenty of instructions and the headphones are easy.  For the price, these are the best headphones I've ever used. I train hard in the gym and do quite a bit of cardio and I don't sweat, I rain.  These are truly sweat proof and stay in my ears and are super comfortable.  The sound quality is crystal clear compared to other bluetooth headphones I've had.  These are a seriously high quality product for the price and I would order these all over again.  Well done."
0,Headphones worked great until the charging port broke and stopped working.
1,"These headphones are good quality however the design is poor. First of all they are fairly bulky. Primarily, the fit is uncomfortable as it starts to hurt my ear after awhile. I have owned a few other brands of headphones so I know how to fit them correctly. The plastic sits too close to the ear so it applies pressure and hurts after awhile. I tried to bring this to Senso's attention so they could have an opportunity to possibly improve their design but they instead blamed it on me stating that I do not know how to properly fit the headphones. I will keep them because they work, but I am not too impressed with the fit. I will say they have good battery life and sound quality. I have not had trouble with them breaking yet however I may have to wait another few months and see!"
1,I love the way they fit.
0,"Complete junk - worked for a few weeks, but battery doesn't last long at all and now won't work at all.  Price was really good, but now throwing  in garbage and looking at alternatives"
1,"been using this everyday. The battery life is fantastic range is great and they are comfortable. They won't fall out when your running or doing training. The sound is also very good, I have had Boss and such and there is not a significant difference"
1,"I got these earbuds for my boyfriend to use at the gym because the music they play there isn't his favorite and like most people good music motivates him to work out harder and longer.  He loves these and is so happy he isn't dealing with the cord being ripped out of his phone and having to plug it back in.  The battery lasts a long time and once it runs out it charges up pretty quick, too.  Two satisfied customers here."
1,"my wife and she finally found a set that works well for her. THANK GOD, cause I am fed up of buying and returning headphones. She uses them at the gym and work great, so does the mic."
1,"These earbuds we're way more than I expected for the price. Excellent sound quality,easy pairing superb when in phone calls. I was so impressed with the set I bought for a friend I immediately ordered a set for myself."
1,"Great product . For the price the sound quality is excellent . Connectivity can be a bit clunky  and can disconnect at time depending on your device but nothing out of the ordinary when it comes to Bluetooth . Functionality is great and easy , alongside with a decent battery life of 8 hours (for me that’s about 3 full workouts ) the issue was that it did not last long as it stopped turning on and charging . However the product gets 5 stars still because when it works it’s awesome but thanks to their super responsive customer service they’ll be sending me a replacement (within my 1 year warranty ) I will say this is due part of a faulty unit as most of the reviews here match my experience with it when it was working . Going through customer service was no hassle at all - all tthough very quick responding email . If you need a gear pair of workout headphones that won’t break your bank, grab these !"
1,Love these headphones! Sound quality is great!
1,"I bought these for both my husband, truck driver, and myself, I own a cleaning business and for both of us hands free is a necessity.  Doesn't stay around neck very well when not in use and hard to place back into ears to answer the phone. The sound quality is pretty good and people on the other end seem to hear us okay.  Not bad but no what we were expecting."
1,Great buds. You cannot go wrong. Clear and criso sound. Thank you Invotek!!!!
1,"The buds are a little hard to change out but that's probably a good thing. It means that they're not likely to fall off. Other than that, I love these."
1,"The quality of the sound was like listening to a concert in my ears!  The instructions were easy to read and understand.  They fit into my ears like a glove.  Great controls and all so compact.  I could not have been happier if they were a set of Bose.  Keep up the quality, performance and the way you care about your customer.  Also, there is nothing negative I can say about these headphones."
1,"They were large and clunky - stuck out of my ears really far and the loop went way past my ears and hit the arm of my glasses weird (didn't think about that when I ordered them, kind of my fault). However my husband didn't mind it and kept them and uses them. So, maybe just not for women and fit a guy's ears better?"
1,"I've had these a couple weeks and they are great so far!  The price point was perfect and I don't think I'm suffering from a loss of sound because they were so much cheaper than the big name wireless headphones.  I was impressed with the packaging and all the charging cords, adapters and different size ear pads were a plus.  I definitely recommend these wireless headphones."
1,I love this headphones. Unfortunately they stopped working within a month. I talked to someone in customer service and they are sending me a replacement. They replied pretty quick.
1,I like the bendable ear piece.  Is there any way to know what percentage of the battery is left?
1,I run alot and travel into city on bus<br />Great headphones!!had them over a year now and batt still lasts a few days with couple hours use every day<br />Great for the price
1,Awesome product!
1,These are great head phones. Easy to use and it is also noise canceling!! You won't be disappointed with a purchase of these!!
1,Work and sound great.
0,The connection sucks
1,Work fantastic. Love the product
1,Cool unit and i am using it daily now.
1,"These are my first pair of wireless earbuds, so I didn't really know what to expect.  I mostly want them for running.  The sound is good, (not Bose level, which I didn't expect).  Pairing with my phone was very easy.  Operating is very easy.  Comfort is good, but not great when running.  Smaller, wired ear buds will stay in the ear better and more comfortable.  For the money, ($38 or so) I think it's a great deal."
1,"I bought these for my boyfriend to workout with and he is beyond happy, and satisfied with this product!"
1,These are the second pair of iPhone 7 compatible headphones I ordered from Amazon. I went with plug ins (CCTRO MFI certified lighting) first and they were awful!! Didn't work straight out the box! So they'll be getting a terrible review.. but these Senso's are really good.. the price was right and the battery life seems to go the distance.. haven't needed to use them for more then two hours at a time before I was able to charge (but according to the little bar I hadn't even used 20%) so for $35 or whatever they cost I'm happy.. the ear hooks should be removable.. if I had one complaint.. There a little big and if you're wearing sunglasses and a hat they kind of feel odd.  But you can adjust them yourself to make them comfy so... 4.5 stars.. but I've only had them a week so talk to me in a year lol.
1,Pros<br />1. Good soud quality and noise cancellation<br />2. Made of good materials<br />Cons<br />1. The fit is poor and constantly need to adjust during jogging
0,"Garbage. Volume buttons are trash. 2nd time using it and the volume wouldn't turn up using the button on headset. Bluetooth connection was fine. Heard the music, too loud because I maxed out my volume on my phone. The down volume button on headset worked fine. Turned volume all the way down. Wouldn't turn back up. Sending back for refund."
1,"I ordered these because of how many people have bought them and the reviews are pretty high, by most. I have another pair by zeus, that work awesome, range say 30' for them, but I have gone 41', they were $24.00. I buy these for $36.00 thinking these would be better, but I get at most about 15'. The do sound ok, my other ones have more base. Dont4just buy because so many people have bought them"
0,Too much bass.  Washes out all other sounds.  Sound is not balanced at all.  would rather have a flat EQ sound then adjust as needed instead of starting with heavy amounts of bass.
1,excellent product and an even better customer service
1,"Great sound quality and they definitely do not fall off my ears. Best of all, they were washed in my washer (oh, no!). I put them in rice for a couple of days to suck the moist out and voila!, like new again. Amazing!"
1,I love these headphones.  Pairing was simple. The controls are easy to use. They stay in my ears and the sound is great.  I bought some other Bluetooth headphone and could not keep them in my ears.  These are comfortable and don't hurt my ears.  I would definitely purchase again. I would recommend.
1,Can’t beat the price for the quality.
1,They came on time and happy with their performance.Also impressed with the company reaching out by email to make sure all was good.Definitely would recommend to all.
0,"I bought these headphones in march. Since then I've used them numerous times. One day while running, the sound started turning on and off and wouldn't stay on even though I had my phone in my pocket only a few feet away. I bought these because I heard everyone in these reviews raving about them. Now, I wish I wouldn't have spent the money."
1,Entertainment
1,Headphones are easy to set up. They sound great and comfortable to boot. Very much worth the money.<br /><br />Update Jan. 2020<br /><br />Right ear stopped working. I guess they are meant to last 2 years.
1,Great product as expected
1,They work great...very happy
1,"If your bass head like me you worry about what the bass sounds and feels like. Im here to tell you that you don't have to worry about the bass or sound quality. These buds perform better than my $100 dollar skull candy wireless headphones!  These fit well in your ear and provides awesome sound, I highly recommend these over beats by far!"
1,these headphones really are great.  they synced up with no problem and were really comfy.  I havnt not taken them on a run or done any crazy outdoor stuff yet but they feel good in my ear and they sound good.  good battery life too
1,"They sounded good, but stuck to far out of my ears and looked funny."
0,"I currently own a pair of Jaybird headphones which do not seem to have enough bass to them. Because I spent over $100 on those headphones and still was not satisfied, I thought I would order this less-expensive pair based on the great reviews. However, the sound quality was absolutely sub-par, the ear hooks feel loose, and although the sound can get very loud, as other reviewers have noted, it is a messy sound with lots of fuzz to it. Will be returning."
1,"Bass is deep and good, but mid and high is very poor. I would not recommend these unless you specifically want bass."
1,Working normal
1,I don't love these. The over the ear piece is too flexible and doesn't stay on my ear. The long cord hangs down my neck and tends to pull the earbuds out. I did replace the inner ear plug with the smaller one and that helped it stay in my ear. The clip that was supposed to shorted the cord fell off the first time I wore it. Wish I could find under $50 over the ear headphones that had decent sound and stayed in place.
1,Works great for running and everything I need.
0,"These things stick out nearly an inch! Good sound, though."
0,"I have owned the Senso bluetooth Headphones for only a few months and the battery dies with in 40 min of usage even on a full battery charge. Unfortunately, it is not a fluke with this pair. It now happens everyday I pass 40 min of usage it dies.  very disappointed. Otherwise, it was a good earphone system for working out"
0,"I originally gave these 4 stars, but after wearing these almost daily since arrival on January 14th, 2018- as of yesterday, January 24th, 2018-I started having Bluetooth connectivity and volume issues ( had to turn almost all the way up to get certain songs to play loud enough for me to hear). I have to say, the more I used these earphones, I did notice they just couldn't provide the level of bass I like hearing in songs. What's a major drag though, is that I really loved the fit of these earphones. The silicon outside covering was quite comfortable. Unfortunately, I am going to have to return these to buy a better pair that are hopefully just as comfortable."
1,"After reading others reviews I decided to purchase these as an addition to my bluetooth head phones I use in the gym. Upon arrival these are packaged great and come with all the little items as described. Paring was easy with iPhone6.<br />Comfort of the over the ear hooks its super great, don't even notice there hooked on my ears. I changed out the ear buds for the larger ones that came with it to secure the bud in my ear canal better which also provided a better Sound/Base aspect to the music.<br /><br />Sounds is great and clear and Bass is decent. Now these are not as high end sound as my gym noise cancellation over the ear head phones I use in the gym but these are darn Great! There is minimal outside sound I hear in the gym so that's a plus! Charge seems to last about 6 hours on a above average volume level for me.<br /><br />For the cost of these I am super impressed as I've sent more and got less quality/charge/accessories on other brands.<br /><br />If I had to pick a negative aspect of these I would say I should have ordered them sooner!!<br /><br />UPDATE: After using these for a couple weeks they seemed to loosen on my left ear and continually fall out, meaning the ear bud comes out of my ear no matter which ear bud pad is on. I thought maybe my ear was bigger on one side than the other but what ever it is, these just do not work for me any longer after a couple weeks. So while the sound is great, quality is great and use is great, they are just not functional so I decreased my Star Rating."
1,"They’re loud, great bass, long battery life, comes with 2 chargers and a car adapter"
1,"Fabulous Bluetooth ear phones! Good recharge life. Very comfortable and effective noise blocking external noise. I use these on my bicycle and am very happy.<br />Additionally, Senso customer support is amazing. Unprecedented actually in the small electronics business. I am a huge fan and will buy again.<br />On a side note, once I turned DOWN the base in the Spotify equalizer, the sound is perfect."
1,"So far, so good!  My daughter loves these headphones and has them in A LOT.  The sound quality is great, and so was the price.  We've only had them a few weeks, so hopefully the awesomeness will continue!"
1,Muy buen producto  aonque puede mejorar
1,Works like a charm for me.  I can hear my calls great.  I am almost deaf so these work for me.
1,The first order of business was taking these for a test drive to the gym. The sound is crystal clear. I did not have to adjust them one time. So far so good.
1,"These bluetooth headphones are fantastic. The sound quality is impressive for such inexpensive headphones. And it comes with a dual-port car charger, a short and a really short USB charging cable, and a nice case to store the headphones in. Great product!"
1,"Sound was very good. My reduction in stars comes from fit and connectivity. It did not fit well to my or my wife's ear. It's front edge sits hard to your ear so that after a short time it becomes irritating and also makes it not hold well in the ear. As I would get active I would have to keep pressing it back in no matter which fitting I tried. also the connection to my phone had a lot of drops even with full charge. I saw a helpful review here that said how to reset it which I did and it did help with connection. The problem began to resurface again though.<br />Follow up review I would say that it's not been a very good product. Constant loss of Bluetooth connection is irritating, resetting is not hard just frustrating to have to do all the time. Not for active users, more activity results in faster lost of connection and fit."
1,"These headphones are great, the sound is awesome, very light weight and comfortable. These would make a excellent gift to give or treat yourself. They will not disappoint, enjoy."
1,I have really liked these earbuds but a few days ago I managed to leave them in my pocket & they went through the washer & the dryer<br />I was sure they were dead‼️  But I plugged them in anyway.  They charged for a day & now they are as good as new- I am soooo I impressed.
1,&#34;I bought these for my boyfriend as a Christmas present and he absolutely loves them. Great buy.&#34;
1,A gift I gave to my husband and he's a musician HE LOVED THEM. Definitely recommend these headphones!!
0,These earbuds stopped working after the first month of use.  I followed all the instructions and then they just stopped connecting.  I tried restoring factory settings and repairing but that did not work.
1,The sound quality for these wireless buds are great! I bought a set for myself and liked them so much that I bought 2 more sets for the rest of my family. I have purchased (3) sets now and I would highly recommend these wireless earbuds to anyone.
1,Tend to come out of my ears when running...
0,"Battery doesn't last more than a couple hours. It also seems like the components are the same as a cheaper one I previously had, only the button is red.<br /><br />Update: The battery is worse by the day. It lasts maybe an hour or two."
1,received product seems to be as advertised haven't used it yet.
1,Great quality and comfortable headphones and plenty of accessories. Pleased with this purchase.
1,Hurt ur ears after a while
1,"Great clear sound. You can hear and feel the bass from the music (if you prefer, at an increased volume). I've bought over 4 different Bluetooth headsets, this one is by far most recommended for listening to music while working out or for leisure."
1,"I just received these and have only used them a few times, but so far these headphones are 5 star. Soild sound and easy to use. I'm happy with my choice and highly recommend these SENSO headphones."
1,"I absolutely love these head phones. I've had countless different pairs, none that fit and sound as good as these.  I will be getting another two pair. And will be recommending to all my friends."
1,"Good deal, work as expected, crisp clear sound and decent base.  Very loud even when riding bikes have to be half volume or less. I am happy with this purchase."
1,I had to return the item because it was not comfortable in my ears.
1,"Fits comfortably , and the sound is great compared to others I have owned"
1,"This is my second pair of Senso 250’s. Unfortunately, my first pair sounded sooooo much better. Maybe it’s my new iPad or phone, but these sound hollow compared to my first pair. I’ll use these til they wear out, but wil probably be my last pair."
1,"The best I have had for working out.  This is the 7th set of Bluetooth headphones I've bought based on people's recommendations.  These are the only ones that keep battery life, sound good, and do not die from my sweat.  But these.  I'm buying another pair."
1,These headphones are amazing! They sound fantastic and they are comfortable. They actually stay in my ears which is a miracle because I have never been able to find a pair that did. This is a great company. The price was good and they ship fast. I will definitely use them again.
1,It functions as stated.
0,One of the headphone doesn't work. Can only hear from 1 side.
1,"The quality overall seems to be good. The sound quality is alright, and they have a good Bluetooth connection, but wearing them over your ears is very uncomfortable. I tried the different ear tips, but still it feels loose and like it's going to fall out of your ear. The hook doesn't seem to do anything since it doesn't really rest on your ear all that much, at least on my ears. I'm going to return it to Amazon and look for headphones with a different design."
1,These are great! Very impressed by the quality of these headphones.
0,Every time I tried to work out in these earbuds they would work for about a half hour until they got some sweat on them. Then they would make a funny noise like they were shorting out and then turn off. After a few days (of drying out) they would work again until they got a little sweat on them again and then same thing. Finally they stopped working altogether. When I contacted the company they said the warranty had expired. What a waste of money.
1,Great sound. Fast shipping
0,Poorly made product.  had only a few months and left ear piece started having a crackling noise than just died.  Did have good sound quality until the left ear became so loud with crackling noise.  Will contact Amazon to rectify.
1,"Decent quality, good bass, great battery life. Occasionally the ear buds still pop out while running."
1,"UPDATE:  I had purchased a pair that just stopped working out of the blue, I contacted customer service and they responded within ten minutes.  I tried the reset that they suggested but it also didn't work.  They immediately offered to send me a new pair, and they're on the way now!  I was genuinely surprised at how fast and polite everyone was.<br /><br />I already really loved the headphones but now that I know the service is so great I'm even more tempted to buy them again..<br /><br />Great headphones, great price"
1,"UPDATE:  Below you will see the first review I put on here. I need to update that review. I was contacted by Senso Customer service immediately after leaving my review  (my bad, for not contacting them first)  they were beyond AMAZING with helping me work this issue out. FANTASTIC CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!<br /><br />Left ear kept fading out. At first these were amazing. Perfect for listening to my audio books...but now, not worth a crap."
1,"Overall good quality at a decent price. I would have given 5 stars, but the part the goes over my ears doesn't fit as snug as I would like. It does stay in place while walking."
1,This is an excellent product and the value is wonderful. You guys got it right. Congratulations. Keep me updated with future products.
1,"This headphone is wonderful, I wish I bought two of them.<br />My husband sweats so bad and do a lot with this earbuds and the<br />have held up strong.<br />thanks for sale."
1,I like them.  They stay out of the way while I’m at the gym.
1,"If looking for wireless headphones, consider these.  They are good quality at a reasonable price.  There is no cord noise and they are easy to pair and use.  The only downside is that when I use them in a congested downtown area sometimes I get interference and they will cut out momentarily."
1,Works as advertised .
1,Very pleased with the answer to the problem I had.
1,The company and product is a 10 star. They are above and beyond with their customer service service excellence. Highly highly recommend the product. Works like a beast when I sweat in gym with no issues.
1,"Bought these in March 2018 to replace my Beats Powerbeats 2 because the earpiece snapped.  Sound quality is very good, and is actually loader than the Beats.  Came with a nice case, multiple ear tips, USB cord, and a nice little attachment to mount your phone in the car.  All for $30 vs $199 for the Beats.  I highly recommend."
1,Got the headphones a few days ago and used them for the first time today. Easy to pair and put to use. Sound quality was good and the earphones are comfortable.
1,Love these headphones!!
1,Good sound quality and the controls are easy to learn
1,"I had bought these March of 2018 in order to have BT headphones that had a battery life of more than 2 hrs (compared to little individual buds) and the price was decent. I've loved them every since and now over a year later, they are finally beginning to wear out after a ton of use including drops, being stepped on (repeatedly), tugged on by kids, tangled up, thrown around, drenched in sweat, ect. (and run over by a car once...)<br /><br />The casing around the main button popped off fairly early in, but a little tape and it holds just fine. The inner circuits and cord are tough as nails though which easily makes up for it. Sound quality is decent for the size, and it works well for taking phone calls in noisy environments or if you just need to be hands free. I use them for a few hours sporadically throughout the day so I can go a couple of days before I have to charge them again which is nice. Definitely buying from Senso again."
1,So far so good. Good sound quality time
1,My teenage son loves the quality and usability of this great Senso product!
0,They simply don't stay in your ears.  I tried all the tips that they come with and even other tips from headphones that did work for me.  I think the main issue is that the piece connected the earbud is heavy and the loops that go over your ears are far to flexible and are not adjustable so they didn't do anything.
1,"These did not stay on or in my ears at all. I tried all the different size ear fittings, and no luck. I think it’s due to the ear hook being playable. It allows for them to slowly slide out of my ear. I have another pair that has the ear hook and it’s silacone, but not playable, and they work great."
1,My son plans on taking them to college with him. They come with a nice little protective case. I have had this brand before so I'm hoping they workout okay
1,"These headphones have great sound and a very fair price.  I will second what others have said about the negatives:the over the ear hooks don't do much to keep them in place for vigorous exercising.  For jogging and weight lifting they fall out easily.  When I am doing work around the house, taking the dog for a walk, etc they are great and don't fall out.  Battery life seems to be about 4 hours for me before they beep every few seconds or keep saying &#34;connected&#34; every few minutes.  The beeping for low battery is annoying as I can look at the light and see if it is red or blue.  If you have eye glasses on at the same time as the headphones, you will get a flashing blue light reflecting of your right eyeglass lens every 5 seconds, which gets old.<br />Overall, for the price they are nice, but not awesome."
1,I had a pair of these that I used every day for almost two years and this pair replaces those which got misplaced. I use them on the treadmill and while on the elliptical machine  They pair easily and sound great. I couldn’t keep the earphones that came with my iPhone in my ears. These are terrific.  Thanks
1,"For the price, great earbuds.<br />The good: The sound is good, in call sound is a little harsh. They connect fast and easily every time. They hold a charge for a long time. They are loud and reduce outside noise ok with the well fitting earbuds.<br />The not so good ""but I can live with it, probably"": Wearing them is kind of like driving a first generation car that is now 4 or 5 generations old. They're blocky, chunky, and one side sags a bit. But, you own it free and clear so you drive it with pride. Or whatever. The weight of the earbud drags on the flat wire that connects them to each other, so if I have just one in, the other pulls down and prevents me from moving freely. The on/off/control button requires a good hard press that your ear and head will definitely notice. The ear loops are flexible and moldable. That's good for different shaped ears. it's not so good when they stretch out during active use.<br />If you are looking for good, reliable, cheap earbuds and don't mind the smell of stale french fries and a slightly worn driver's seat in order to get the retro-cool look and still have performance, you'll probably love these for what they are. If you are looking for a 2019 Tesla on a 1990 Prelude budget, they might still be ok. But if you just want the Tesla, get something else."
1,Product looks awesome. I am very happy so far.<br />Headphone do not alot of bass.<br />Headphones are very loud. So you will hear your tracks.
1,"CONTEXT<br />I think we all know how crappy corded earphones are! Especially for me, because I go running with my dog, they get in my way and sometimes even tangled! I ended up seeing these on a Buzzfeed article and thought why not purchase them? The price was right, after all.<br /><br />PROS<br />- These are very easy to use, just make sure you read the manual first, LOL.<br />- The sound quality on these is actually pretty amazing.<br />- Noise cancellation on these puppies is real! I can usually her cars approaching with different earbuds, but not these.<br />- Obviously, huge pro that they are cordless!<br />- They come with a handful of different ear bud thingies (LOL, not sure what it's called). This was a huge plus for me, because I could choose the ones that fit my ears best.<br />- The part that goes around the ear is adjustable!<br /><br />CONS<br />- While the part going around your ear being adjustable is a pro, it is also a con in that my ears are probably on the smaller side since I am petite. Because of this, I don't get a good fit and they often fall off my ear. :( This is a huge con for me, since I am having to adjust them on runs and sometimes, they even fall off! Super annoying.<br /><br />OVERALL<br />I do like these and think that they work great. However, for anyone who is petite and considering this, maybe look into a different set."
1,A friend turned me on to these headphones. I use them daily during my workouts and I also use them when shopping in the grocery store weekly. They charge quickly and they sound great.
1,"Comfortable, easy to pair with device. Nice carrying case.  No need all the extra stuffs included in the oversized box ."
1,"It's an amazing earpiece and I really liked it's quality. Also, I am greatlful of the follow up emails that I received from the seller."
1,So far I'm very happy.  They have nice sound and fit nice.  I going to buy some for my wife.
1,"Received my headphones earlier than expected. I used them at the gym and they work great! Ear buds stayed in place and sound was good. I didn't receive any directions with the set, but I've used other Bluetooth devices so figuring it out was a breeze."
1,"Skips on iphone se when playing spotify, even after replacing with new pair. I don’t know if the fault lies with Spotify, Apple, or Senso, but it’s not a bandwidth issue. If you have iphone 7 or newer hopefully it won’t be a problem for you."
1,Very happy with it!!!<br />I had beats wireless 3 and they died out of no where but with these I don’t miss them at all!
1,"I'm very happy with these headphones. The sounds is much better than the earbuds I was using and it's so nice not to have my phone attached to my arm with headphone cords hanging down. These also came with a case, car charger and different sized earbuds. These are comfortable and easy to use. The value is huge for the small price and I would highly recommend these!"
1,Went through the washing machine on accident and they still work!
1,Exactly as I hoped! Lightweight & with great sound! I received an email from one of the owners checking to see if I was happy with them! Very pleased!
1,I wanted to get a Bluetooth so I can be hands free. Decided to go with this.  Well worth it.
1,"These are a good deal for the price. The sound qulaity is great with phone calls, apps, and music. The ear pieces are the most comfortable ones I've ever owned."
1,"The quality of sound depends on how far you shove it down your ear. The mic picks up everything in the background better than it does your voice. And if you are only using one earpiece, the other one is just flopping around and getting hooked on things."
1,"The sound is excellent, they are easy to setup and use and I like them. The problem I encountered is with the power button sliding down the indent and sticking there. The product lasted about three months and has since stopped working. Too bad, they were quite useful."
1,"Very good quality, especially for the price. They're just as good as beats or anything else you would spend easily over $100 on. They stay on well and the music quality is great, don't ever need to go above half volume."
0,Had the headphones for two weeks now. I workout hard therefore I swear I lot and the right side earbud went out while workout after it got sweated on. I am definitely returning it and would give 0 stars if I could.
1,Worked perfectly!
1,"It's a really good earphones, I do really like it."
1,"Great quality. And resistant to rain. My wife makes use often, and loves the quality, perfect fit and durability of the battery."
1,Being a frustrated beats wireless customer last week I stumbled upon these. Figured why not give it a try and received them Friday. Was impressed with the packaging and presentation. Once I synced them up to my iPod and got them on was happily surprised.  Went right to my golf club and got a practice session in with them. Super clear and no cut outs. I think as this brand gets more and more known even more people will realize they can get a very high quality product at a great price. Also will say there customer service is 5 star. As had a few questions and was getting multiple responses with help. The kind of service I appreciate. Thank you
1,"Pretty good sound, good value.  I would prefer if the over-the-ear hooks were adjustable, because it's a one-size fits all design, and they would stay in better if I could make a snug fit.  I like that holding the + and - buttons skips forward and backwards to the next tune.  The cable clip slipped off, but I probably don't need it."
1,Better than I expected .. I love them!!!
1,"Awesome ear buds, very comfortable."
0,Headphones are not working anymore. -.-
0,"I bought it after reading so many positive review, but when I received mine I did not like the quality of sound that camu out of these headsets. Not sure if they were defective."
1,Great purchase great quality. Highly recommend this product.
1,These are great for the price!
1,Affordable and sounds great!
1,"I've tried three brands of mid tier bluetooth headphones, the SENSO are by far the best.  They sit comfortably throughout my workouts.  They have a quality feel. They sound good.  The bluetooth has been uninterrupted.<br /><br />I'm recommending them so highly because of the various issues I've had with bluetooth earbuds at this price range."
1,"Purchased product to try and rid the hanging cords while running. I charged them up, put them in my phone arm band for a run, the headphones were cutting in and out the entire run. Since this incident, I have only ran with the phone outside of the armband. The headphones seem to do ok. They occasionally still cut out during my run. Additionally, when i turn my head, the headphones seem to come out of my ear a bit. Not bad, but not great. I'll get something better."
1,Second pair that I have purchased.  These headphones hold up well during workouts and working around the yard.  Very easy to pair and very easy to operate.  This is a very well designed product and the battery life remains constant.
0,"I purchased these to wear while mowing my lawn.  There is no apparent noise cancelling functionality.  I will say it again, they do not allow me to listen to music while mowing.  I set them aside.  I have given up my search for noise cancelling earphones because the only thing that works it the full ear covering muffs designed for shooter or equipment operators.  I tried  using these..under muff type protectors.  They are too big and very uncomfortable.  They are very bulky and difficult to wear and can not imagine wearing them in gym.."
0,I have listened only once but asfar as audio quality is concerned it falls short I prefer the Klipch and Bose both are more expensive For convenience and value for money you cannot be beaten!
1,I received these on Friday and have used them daily since and thy work great. Very good quality for the price.
1,"These are awesome, I can connect both my IPhone and my android at the same time. it answers the one that rings or is playing the music. I liked them so much I bought one for my grandson. It is a have to have product."
1,Great earphones.  The sound quality is excellent and they last me about 10 hours a charge when listening to music.  They are great for talking on the phone as well but the noise canceling is not the best.  All-in-all they are great buy for the price.
1,Long lasting battery charge.  Great sound quality.
1,"They pair right up with the phone via bluetooth, sound pretty good, and stay in my ears while working out in the gym. What's not to like?"
1,These headphones are great! They fit well. They keep the outside noise out. Calls were clear. I would recommend trying out a pair. You won't be disappointed.
1,As described.  Thanks!
1,Wonderful and I wish I would have bought these sooner
1,"I only received these earbuds a few days ago. Upon first use after(just trying them on and playing around with them)is they are literally the most comfortable earbuds I have ever owned. You can just barely tell you have them on.  So I wore them to workout today, they didn't move, no cord noise and I wouldn't call them completely &quot;noise cancelling&quot; they are real damn close! They sound better than any set I owned too! I've owned at least a dozen in the past. They feel like they are built with quality. Not cheap feeling at all.  I wear them at work and the gym. For being under 40 dollars you cant go wrong. My wife usually cant stand earbuds of any type. After she tried mine out she requested I get another pair for her. I really cant say enough good things about the feel or sound or price! I'll just have to wait and see how long they last. Get a pair of these, you'll be glad as hell you did. Thanks Senso!"
0,"The left bud buzzez often times. Went on a bike ride, and Bluetooth connection is really bad. Had series of back to back breaks and drops with less than 2 feet away from my phone. It got really annoying and had to disconnect and use the phone speaker instead. Contacted seller, and I was told to reset the device by holding the power button for 7 seconds. It didn't help. Since i've had these for few days, was told to return it for full refund, and also gave me 5% discount on the next purchase. Nice gesture but useless as I am buying another brand."
1,Great product and great price!!
1,"I like them, they work great!"
1,I alternate between the two devices I ordered when I watch tv. I am hard of hearing and can enjoy the higher volume without bothering anyone else.Great product
1,"These headphones are amazing! Super nice quality and defiantly worth the price. The battery life usually lasts for a good week if you use it for 1 hour workouts every day. Cancels out sound well, would recommend to purchase"
1,I've only had them for about a week and so far I am very satisfied with them. Keep u posted.
1,Love this product
1,"Sometimes I have a hard time connecting them and fitting them into my ears but they stay in and have good sound quality. Not perfect, but I would recommend at the end of the day. Good for working out!"
1,Wow! Best headphones I have. Easy to use. Easy to pair. Amazing sound quality. Highly recommended.
0,"I ordered a pair of these and they would not turn on after charging. I returned them for another pair and had the same issue. They charge until the light is blue, then they simply won't turn on no matter how long you hold the button.  Not trying another pair."
1,Pretty freaking amazing ...
1,I charged them up and they easily paired with my phone. I love the way they fit my ears. I feel I made a great purchase.
0,Not charging and cant return it
0,Drops connection at distance further than 10 feets with direct line-of-sight to the cell phone.<br />Sometimes drop connection if phone is in back pocket of pants.
1,"Due to the over the ear piece not being adjustable the ring is too tall and flips over my ear.  The sound is good, though and connects quickly and easily.  Listening to quiet music is kind of hard because there is a constant static sound in the background, albeit not extremely noticeable."
1,The headphones unfortunately have broken and I am getting a new pair sent to me. The team has been absolutely wonderful and responsive. I definitely recommend buying them and the warranty.
1,Good quality
1,Love these headphones.  They are lightweight and the sound is crisp and clear.
1,These headphones are comfortable and have great sound.  I would recommend them for the price. Their customer service is good.
1,"The ear buds I received were just like most reviews I have read, they came nicely packaged with all accessories. I really enjoy the feel and the design, unlike most these buds you can actually put in your ears using one hand and once there in you don't have to adjust them...Amazing! Kudos to the design team on these. I am going to recommend these to everyone I know I'm the market for wireless ear buds.<br /><br />Thank you!"
1,"The product works well  it was easy to sync and get set up. THE only issue is it is bulky and kind of big for my ears. The portion that wraps around the ear is too large. Haven't tried running with these on yet, but so far it works."
1,These are the BEST in ear Headphones I ever owned. Wow!!!!Thank You.
1,"Well constructed, great sound for a headset."
0,Dies constantly.  I have to charge it every 1 hrs.  Sound is not very clear.  I use it connected to my laptop when it works
1,"After messing with these headphones, I have grown to love them! They fit perfectly, and the earbuds that they come with to help cancel out sound work really well considering that these are just earbuds. The sound quality is just what I need when listening to musing or games on my laptop. 9 out of 10 would recommend for the price. The only gripe I have with these headphones is the mic quality. Its not the best but is expected with the price."
1,For the price the sound is unbelievable
0,Each time I am on the phone with someone there is a weird choppy sound and they can't hear me. I've had to switch to my earphones with the cord. I was disappointed a your reviews were great!
0,Loved the sound quality.  First pair the charger stopped working after 3 uses.  Bought another pair and same thing happened again.  Very disappointed.
1,I have used jaybird boss but price comparison and quality I would definitely recommend it. I do no go to gym without. It does not fall out of the ear and the ear loop it stays in place
1,"If you have time read this review, I think it will help you decide to buy or not.  First,  I dislike earbuds and find them annoying because they never stayed in my ears. So after going through 3 sets of headphones in one year and damaging them due to sweat and having to clean the headphone pads to avoid them from stinking of dry sweat, I broke down and searched for a pair of earbud style with a clip around the ear to help keep them in place better.  Like most of us, I searched for them here on Amazon. There were three things I looked for:  one is the reviews, second is that it's fulfilled by Amazon ( so I have some backing if these things are bad ) and third is warranty period for them. Paying $125 to $200 was not what I wanted to spend on name brands that don't deliver and are hyped up for their name, that's just me !  I figured I take a chance on these earbuds for $34.00, and must say I was pleasantly surprised by their performance and quality so far.  The sound coming out of these earbuds is just incredible to me. At the gym, I have them paired with my iPhone 5S and at 50% they are loud as hell. I will probably never need to go higher than that . Connection with my iPhone was easy and no issues. The fact that they are sweatproof was a must for me. The 30 ft distance in my home worked fine through 2 walls to the other end of my home.  I made calls with them and the mic worked well.  I tested the running time of 8 hrs, and it was on point with what they said . The comfort wearing them to my ears was great and guess what they stay in place. The clip around the ear is a soft rubber or silicone material that surprisingly works to help keep the earbuds in my ear. Then you get other little gifts like hard carry case, dual car charger, a short charge cable and 3 foot charge cable that works for as a lightning cable and mirco usb cable..... Both will charge the earbuds.  Also you get two sets of ear tips small and large and the earbuds have a mid size on them already.  My Amazon friends things are mass produced and during production you will have like in any other product defective units that leave the factory, but remember you have a one year warranty and I'm sure that they will back it up or Amazon will.  All I can say is that after a full week I am very pleased with my purchase and guess what I did,  I bought a second pair....the gray ones....lol !  The only cons I have at the time of this review is that they charge you more for the gray ones, than the red ones, and the earbud pads are little in different in feel from the gray and red earbuds, but in no way is it a deal breaker.  At their price point and with what you get these are a very good deal, especially from a unknown brand.  I can only see with time how they do, but for now these earbuds rock.  I have a one year warranty on them so I'm not worried. Wish you all good luck."
1,Would have been 5 stars if the battery life wasn’t such trash...I charged the thing for a whole day and night got a full battery went to the gym 30 minutes in I’m down to 75% approximately?!?!? I hate that sh!@ God forbid I stayed at the gym for a long long workout (2-3 hours) I would have needed to go to my car and charge it lol...jeez companies and manufacturers a word to the wise work on development of resilient durable battery lives
0,Less than a year in and the sound is now horrible with no bass.  I bought a replacement headphones from Walmart for 1/3 of the price that had way better sound!
1,"Love these headphones! The sound is great, and they stay in your ears while exercising."
1,Quick Update:  After having use the earphones for over a month I have to say this has been the best $40.00 investment I have ever made. Continue to sound great. I exercise in the water 4 days a week and no problem getting them wet. They stay in my ears and the Bluetooth distance is excellent and far better than the 33 feet in the specs.  Would recommend them over the others I have used in the past.  Great Job Senso!<br /><br />Love these earbuds.  Fantastic sound.  The specs say the bluetooth is good for 33 feet but I find they work from a lot longer distance.  I can have my phone on one end of a 25 meter pool and still get receptions on the other side.  Works great in the water.  It's nice doing my water exercises to music.
1,Great little headphones
1,"I can see why there are so many positive reviews: great sound quality, long battery life, comfortable, relatively easy to use."
1,"great headphones for the price, easily worth 100 bucks!"
1,headphones work just fine they are for my daughter
1,For the money....sound is pretty good.
1,"Purchased these headphones a few months ago, and they worked great. In addition to testing their ipx rating in the shower, I had them on while running a marathon last month (the first hour of which was in the rain), and they made it through the finish with no problem. I did have an issue a couple weeks ago with one side of the headphones losing its outer case. But because I had registered the headphones on their website, resolving this issue was quick and painless. The customer service was responsive and understanding. Now all is good in my running world. I highly recommend these for anyone on the go. Great performance for your buck!"
1,they are awesome! definitely a great value
1,"Great product, fast delivery."
1,"The headphones are great.  The Loop that goes over the ear is very flexible but will definitely stay in place.  I have been slacking, since its winter, so have not had a lot of time to run with them, but the pair up to my ipod and with no problem and don't seem like they will fall out.  the buttons are a little hard to press though, which make the earpiece have to be repositioned in my ear when I use them."
1,First order had problems with playback. The seller was very responsive and promptly replaced them. The new set works flawlessly
1,"The fidelity of these are amazing! I have compared them to many wired earbuds and these blow them away. The musical range is huge and the clarity is excellent. Battery life iong, Bluetooth range about 20 feet depending on location. GREAT stereo separation, which gives them a concert-hall prescence. Highly recommended. AAA+++"
1,"These headphones are amazing!! I've tried several pairs of Bluetooth wireless headphones and they never stayed in my ears very well, but these were a perfect fit. It also comes with great accessories - a car charger, an adapter for the iPhone jack in addition to a regular charger. I feel like you can't do much better given the price point. I rarely leave Amazon reviews but felt compelled to given how much I love these. Amazing sound quality, excellent fit, totally reasonable price - can't ask for much more!"
1,"These are the third pair of wireless headphones I got (after returning the first two) and I absolutely love them.  I'm a runner and have taken them on just a couple of runs so far (~10 miles), but they've stood up to sweat as well as to the constant motion.  Things that I love about these:<br />1. Sound Quality - Bass, mids and heights all sound awesome.  Who knew that I didn't have to give up quality sound on a run (at this price)?<br />2. They don't move around while running - an earlier pair that I returned had to be adjusted a lot<br />3.  The wires do not stick to the back of my neck as I sweat - again, the other pair stuck to my neck and pulled on one earbud or the other.  I had to put the wire to the front of my neck with that other pair to avoid this annoying feature.<br /><br />If I were forced to mention a downside - they're a bit larger than I expected, but nevertheless still very light - so really I do NOT have a complaint about these headphones."
0,The Bluetooth keeps disconnecting when I run.
1,I use these for bike rides and work. When there is a lot of wind the signal can come and go but nothing serious.<br />They went thru the washer and dryer and came out unscathed. That earned them a 5 Star. I have had them for 4 months and still work.<br />The rubber insulation is pretty good. When they came out of the dryer they were missing the side piece. The water didn’t get in because they are covered inside as well with like a melted rubber cover. All the junctions are covered inside.<br />The sound quality is good. The connection is sometimes sketchy  but nothing serious. I use an iPhone 8plus and I have issues with other electronics as well. So it could be either.<br /> Over all a great product that I will be buying another.
0,DISAPPOINTED!  That's all I can say here!  I did my research to find quality wireless headphones and couldn't wait for them to arrive.  I opened the package to charge the earphones - only to find inside the charging port on the earbud was damaged. They couldn't be charged so I packed them back up and returned them!!!
1,Bought these for my grandson's birthday. Best present
1,these are the most comfortable and produce the best sound I have ever heard in a set of ear phones!<br />Grab some of these!
1,"Great headset. Unfortunately, I can't sleep in them. The apparatus makes sleeping on my side impossible."
0,"They're a bit bulky and don't fit into human ears very well; they're uncomfortable if you're wearing them for a long time. More importantly, just days after the window to return them closed, the battery quit. It will no longer charge. The first time I charged it, the connection was a bit difficult to get seated properly but it seemed to do alright. Now it doesn't matter how firmly the cord is connected, it simply doesn't charge. This happened suspiciously close to the return date. Don't waste your money on these."
1,What a great buy on Prime Day!  These are great for running and walking. The battery holds a charge and you can use it several times before you have to recharge them. I would recommend buying them at their regular price - a great value either way.
1,"You can order else without any worry at all, if you don't like them it's not a problem because customer service is stellar. The sound is good from what I can tell (not an audiophile) the battery life is 7-8 hours. So they are was advertised but what they don't tell you is a lot of other ear buds in this price range seem to offer no support after you buy them. I bought one pair with the big warranty symbol on the page and I couldn't figure how or where to get help.<br /><br />With these help is never a problem., you really can't go wrong the customer service is just too good."
1,Headphones work well and have good volume. Accessories are good too but the charging cable with the lightning connector won't work with my OtterBox case because the overmold on the connector is too wide.
1,"great price, practical,  and can be placed loosely on ears to be aware of surroundings while working;  walking, riding bike through neighborhood or in nature.  Can also be placed to cancel out noise.  Cord does need some improvement. Satisfied especially compared to more expensive types that fail like LG HBS-780, with the frail earbud wires that apparently shorted out.  WORTH THE PRICE (so far)!"
1,"Very nice headphones.  I've used them several times already and the sound is good and most importantly, they stay in my ears when I am running.  I can't speak for durability as I've only owned them a couple of weeks, but they have to last longer than Beats of which I have seen literally fall apart in my hands.  If you realize nothing else remember this...Beats are made from the most inferior materials.  All of their money is spent on marketing!!  Give the Senso a look.  I've been pleased so far."
1,"Great customer service! We had a little trouble getting these to play without gaps in sound, but a quick email to their support team had us up and running in no time. We have paired them to our iPhones and to our TV using a bluetooth transmitter. Works great!"
1,"I got these today and tried them out while at the gym.  I'm SURPRISED at how awesome these are!  I'm always so picky when it comes to headphones especially wireless ones.  I've always loved my LG wireless headphones but they always fall off of me when i lay on my back while doing ab workouts or bench press.  These match the sound quality of my LG headphones yet don't fall off of me.  For as cheap as they are priced, these DEFINITELY are QUALITY!  It's only been a day so I'm hoping they do last me a long time."
1,"I am 1 week into these headphones and I am liking them.  Good sound quality.  If there is one thing I would improve, it would be the fit.  Maybe it is different person-to-person, but these are kind of loose on me"
1,"Despite what is advertised, there is no noise cancellation for the microphone, so the other end of the call can hear EVERYTHING. If you're only using these to listen to music, they're fantastic, but forget trying to make phone calls with them. I'm giving them 3 stars because the accessories are great and the sound quality for the wearer is wonderful, but the lack of microphone noise filtering is a deal breaker."
0,"Worked great for 3 months, then.....nothing."
1,Always
1,"no complaints. battery doesn't last a million years and the audio quality isn't sennheiser, but it's like 30 dollar bluetooth earbuds, y'know?"
1,Great product!
0,The commands hurts my ears.
1,"Sound quality , battery life are really good."
1,"Super easy to pair. Extremely comfortable and easy to put on/take off. Haven't worked out with them in yet, but they don't feel like their going to fall out."
0,Like to the point I'm leaning toward a return. So spoiled by the battery duration of my Monster Hesh 2 Over-The-Ears but super weak batteries on these... I tested. Wanted to see what I was working with so gave them a full charge and popped them on for a full day at the computer. 7hours before the annoying voice other reviewers mentioned started. And would not stop. 12 completely unenjoyable minutes later they were done. Brand new and 7 hours 12 minutes of life? That will only get shorter with time. 2 stars because honestly sound quality is acceptable for working out. I wish the pieces that hook round your earlobes were adjustable as they stick out slightly. Come w/a  lot of nice little gadget accessories (kinda useless to me)  I got them for working out and now I'm bummed.
0,These headphones serve as a good place holder for when you're waiting on your high quality Bluetooth headphones to be warrantied and that's about it
1,Love these! Great sound for phone and music plus they’re easy to set up and easy to use.
1,Normally when I buy something I don’t take the time to review unless it’s better than expected or worse. These exceeded my expectation and co workers told me that on the call I sound like I’m actually holding the phone. Battery life is great and the quality is superb.
1,"The other reviews are right -- great fit, good sound, great price.  My only negative comment is that I wish there was a way to tell if the headphones were on by looking at them.  The only way to know is to listen to them and see if the music is playing."
1,"The sound is a little muffled, but otherwise it works. The bluetooth connection works pretty well."
1,So far so good.  Thank you for the extras.had them for a while and they fit my small ears perfect.<br />Sounds great
1,Sound quality is great. Great carry case and different types of interchangeable buds. So far very impressed.
0,"They worked well, not perfect, but well enough-especially for the price. Until about 2 weeks ago the left bud stopped working altogether. I've tried resetting them, charging them, etc., but nothing works. The right bud still works fine but the left is silent."
0,"They seemed to have a good build quality.  But, the sound quality is terrible.  You get what you pay for."
0,Came back to change my review. Lasted a little over a month. Thankfully they were cheap.
1,I really didn’t expect the headphones to have such great sound with great base. The accessories that come with the headphones are also an added bonus.<br /><br />If you’re thinking of getting Sports headphones then look no further.
1,Great headphones for the price. Sound works well and they don't fall of the head.
1,I am really happy with these so far
1,Great sound. Comfortable. Very light
1,"Okay so I'm sparse with glowing reviews. But these earbuds have far exceeded my expectations. I have now purchased 4 pairs in all. A pair for myself, wife, 2 kids...we use them working out I use them when my high dollar name brand earbuds dead after 20 min. These are my reliable, sweat proof, hard to break and comfy go to. If your wondering how well they are made that's it. 100% won't let you down. I wear mine in the shower listening to motivational videos even."
1,I’m still getting used to them but I love the fit and the sound quality is really nice
1,"I love these headphones. The sound quality,  the battery life,  the bass. Everything with these are top notch."
1,"I’ve had a pair of these headphones since March.  I love them so much!  No more keeping up with my phone attached to a cord while I exercise!  I just bought a pair for my husband for Christmas so he can stop using speaker phone for all his work calls!<br />Great quality, great value, highly recommend!"
1,"Using the Senso, I am able to hear clearly and the audio is decent.The buds remain in my ears for the most part. I did not like the feel of the cord hanging on my neck and the cord would also get in the way of my glasses at times, because I would hang my glasses on the front collar of my shirt at times. Other downsides are that those I called complained of hearing an echo whenever they would speak to me. I had the LG-750 and the charge lasted me at least two days, but the Senso battery, fully charged, barely lasted a day. I would not purchase Senso Bluetooth Headphones again; at least not this type. I am not altogether upset with the product, because I took a risk by trying something different."
1,Good
1,These are awesome. Great sound; easy to set up and use; spare ear buds for size variety.....so glad I purchased these.
1,"These are working wonderfully so far. They are incredibly easy to wear, and stay in well with little to no adjustment needed while I'm working out. The sound is also pretty great."
1,Sound quality is great! My only issue is they are slightly on the loud side. I downloaded an equalization app and it helped some. Customer is great.
1,"So far im very impressed.  The sound is great,  comes with alot of accessories I wasnt expecting and so easy to connect to my smart watch.  Can't wait to use them at lunch tomorrow."
1,So far so good
1,One of the best earphones for the price. Awesome customer service.
1,"They sound pretty good.  I bought these to wear to the gym, but I was not  crazy about the over-the-ear fit.  I passed them on to a friend who really likes them. The come with  a clever case, a charger, several bud covers and some other stuff.  Worth the price."
1,"These were great. Even better than I expected. Unless it is super windy , the noise cancellation works well . Battery stays charged for a long time . Definitely get eight hours of use on every charge ."
1,"This is my second pair of these headphones.  I use them to listen to music at work.  For some reason, this pair is a lot louder at work using the lowest setting (I wish I could adjust the sound one notch lower, but there must be an issue with my worker computer) than at home using the web based GooglePlay to listen to music.  Nice sound.  Con: plugs will move a little out of place while jogging, but not big deal; you can bend the attachments but it still won't be snug on your ear for a long time while jogging."
0,Mediocre sound quality and also mediocre blue tooth connection. Would not buy again.
0,These things only lasted 7 mo.
1,Excellent headphones for there cost.  Works well with jogging although you will encounter some wind noise.
1,Was a bit sceptical when I ordered it. The build quality is good and the sound quality is good. It packs in quite a punch for its size. The bass might be slightly higher but I liked the quality so far. I wore it for a couple of hours and it is comfortable to wear. Overall I am very happy with my purchase
1,"For the price these headphones are a steal. They deliver the quality, sound, and features as promised. I have had these for over a week and used them daily. As for fit they take a little bit to find exactly the best placement to put in your ear as is with most headphones of this type. The sound is very good and they do a great job with the noise cancellation aspect so that you can keep the sound level down on your music. I like this because you don't feel like you destroyed your ear drums once you stop using them. The battery life is great and when drained they charge quickly. So far I have found them very easy to use and have no issues with pairing them to my iPhone. They will work for a good distance from the phone allowing you to keep your phone off to the side somewhere safe with less chance of damage from a dropped weight while working out.<br /><br />Please note that this review is based on using them for their intended purpose as workout equipment. If you are looking for the same comfort and sound quality as Bose you will be disappointed because you are looking at the wrong category of product. For a durable and easy to use headset that will suit you well in the rough sweaty world of a gym these are a great product."
1,I'm training for my first half marathon and purchased these for the training runs and workouts. I've been very pleased with the performance and how they stand up to sweat and long distance runs. We just got back from Florida and I used them to train in the humidity and they worked great. I love the price point and the quality.
1,I just got it 2 days back. Initial experience is great!
1,They are very nice. I can't keep them in my ears but I haven't found a pair yet that I can.<br />But the design is very nice.
1,"The headphones were great!! I use them to run and they hold up very well. No issues yet and I’m very happy with what was included in the package, very well designed and product seems durable. Will purchase as a gift for relatives! Thanks!"
0,"This is or would have been a great product if I could have better volume adjustment capability.  These are LOUD!  I had the volume down to the lowest possible setting and even with volume control and limit set, it was just too loud.  I would have rated them higher than two stars as their packaging is great and so are the accessories but the main function of the item doesn't work correctly.  I guess I will just have to keep trying and see if there is another pair which may work better for those of us who love music but don't want to go deaf listening to it."
1,Working great...bought them once they didn't work.. i return them with no problem and order them again and work good
1,Really liked these until they suddenly died yesterday. Bought them 8 months ago. get moderate indoor use but nothing crazy. Very disappointed they didn't last longer. Would be reluctant to buy again given life of product
0,Never worked
1,"Very good sound, good deep bass<br />Fits well in ears<br />No conection problems with iPhone"
1,These headphones are great. The Bluetooth worked right away on multiple devices and are very comfortable.
1,"The volume is excellent. Charge time is great. My only issue is the ear piece that goes over the ear is big. Although it is adjustable, with the right ear, my buds sometimes fall out. I have really small ears. Otherwise these are my second pair and I love this brand."
1,Great pair of headphones - light weight too!
1,"Using these on my walks, I power walk 3-4 miles a day and so far the quality has been good!  Haven't had them very long so can't comment yet on how they hold up."
1,Amazing value for the price. The battery lasts for at least 8 hours. The sound is clear and the ear buds are very comfortable. I’m very happy with this purchase.
0,Tbh i got the same thing about a year ago but i broke it so i wanted another of the same kind bc i really liked it but then i got this package and it was nothing like b4. The sound quality was decent but the ear hooks and the connecting wires were made of completely different materials that was very uncomfortable. Dunno wat went wrong.
1,Easy to use with great quality
1,"This is the second pair of Senso ActiveBuds I have ordered in the last 48 hours. The first set that arrived was a dud and would not even power on and after completing a factory reset, they would show they were fully charged, but there was no response when trying to activate the device. I reordered the headphones and Amazon delivered them THE SAME DAY!!<br /><br />This second pair is wonderful!! I am very much enjoying the quality of sound and the comfort of their earpieces. Thank you for your product!!"
1,"I have to say these are pretty fantastic. Before purchasing, I always check reviews on Amazon as well as outside Amazon (what sold me was the NerdyTech article on them). So far I have had them for three days and have used them for activities of various intensities and have thoroughly enjoyed every second.<br />Potential buyers should be aware that, as with every wireless headphone, there is a maximum distance you can be from your device before there is signal failure. Even so these headphones do a wonderful job of fighting to connect when I walk too far away and the always connect when I'm back within range."
1,"Great balance, rich bass, and comfortable to wear while jogging! I have been using these headphones while I jog for the last month. For those who love to workout and listen to music, I highly recommend using the softer &#34;foamy&#34; red earbuds as they do not chafe your ear. Great customer support as well. SENSO is doing it right!"
1,Works and sounds good.
1,Sound quality is good. Much better than what I expected for $35. Pairing happened right away. Not sure the range but i keep my phone in my pocket or hand and they never cut out. They come with multiple ear adapter piece things(not sure what the term is :p). I had issues while jogging with them at first as they would fall out constantly. They come with a red ear plug feeling adapter that worked great for running once I used those. 6 miles and they didn't even budge. Those ones cancel outside noise really well so make sure to pay attention to your surroundings with those in. Headphones didn't feel uncomfortable at all after wearing them for a couple hours straight. The headphones themselves have a volume control as well as taking your devices set volume into account so they can get ridiculously loud. Definitely would recommend as a nice budget headphone.
1,"Worked out with these today for the first time, and they were EXCELLENT. I didn't have to have my phone on me, they have about 20' radius. They didn't move, and the sound is great. I also used them for a Phone Call, and they worked great. Clear and they could hear me clear as well."
1,"I purchased this product from a friends' recommendation and was surprised to find that it was sold out. I had to wait a few days before I was even able to purchase them, but I'm glad that I did! These headphones feel much more expensive than the price would have you believe. They are very comfortable to wear and are very loud. Honestly sometimes they seem TOO loud, but I am not used to in-ear buds. All in all I would recommend this product."
0,"These headphones aren't great. They lose connection very easily. Whenever I was at the gym if I moved my arm in between the headphones and my phone, it would start skipping. Also, it took forever for Spotify/podcasts to connect to them, even though they said they were connected. Finally, they will no longer charge. I tried charging them over night at home, as well as in the car, but they say &#34;battery low&#34; whenever I turn them on. I bought these only 2 months ago. Would not recommend."
0,"Product didn't arrive as described, with missing in-package components (the three foot charging cable was for a different device). For the $ the sounds is fine."
1,"Very happy with these. Sound is good, very comfortable, and great price."
1,"Works great!  Good enough sound quality and good fit with the assortment of ear pieces included in the box.<br />It's nice to be detached from the iPhone for workouts, walks, yard work, etc.  Bargain price and very good quality."
1,My son got these for Christmas and is very happy with these.
1,My husband loved these! We replaced a pair of beats with these and the are a far better quality. The sound is great and they are dependable.
1,"These are great - much better than the jaybirds I had previously owned - great fit, great quality of sound, and delivery was very prompt - it exceeded my expectations!"
1,I use these for listening to audiobooks at the gym or out walking and they are perfect. Simple to set up too. And I love the price.
1,Got them for my girlfriend and she seems to like them alright so far. She says others have been difficult to keep in her ears as she runs but reports that only one of these buds slides out every mile or so.
1,"These are great! I have had them for a3 months and they hold p great! the battery last a good while. When it dies its annoying for that bus ride home but I just charge it (at work or home) and its great. Quick to recharge, and easy on the ears...no fear of falling off."
0,I have only had this product for three months and it has already stopped working.
1,"Very impressed. Was about to spend my usual $100 for headphones, i thought the pricier the better but gave these a chance and wow."
0,Product stop working properly
0,Worked for about 2 weeks then stopped syncing to any device. Junk
1,Works great.  Paired easily with both devices I use it with. Sound quality is good.  Will be ordering these again if I ever need another pair.
1,"bluetooth headphones that sound great and work while i'm across the house from the device it's synced with? All for the $36 i paid for them?!?! Psshhh, killer deal! So glad i bought these!"
1,"I like the fit and the sound is not bad, but the battery lasts only about a day."
1,"Incredible sound,The ear piece is kinda big, I have had trouble with them fallng off my ears.  I still give them 5 stars because for the price they're the best available with true HD sound."
1,I bought these ear buds thinking they are not beats or fancy ones; but to my surprise they sound excellent and are easy to use love these ears buds I am glad I purchased them I use them every night for bed and when I cook I am happy
1,They are astonishing with their customer service . I really like their product.
1,"My biggest problem with these is that they are FAR TOO LOUD. I've never used them on any setting above the absolute lowest, because even there they hurt my ears after just a few minutes. I've ended up wearing them with the actual ear buds outside my ear and to the side a little bit, which at least is made possible by the ear hooks. They're comfortable, and the buttons work well. I just wish there was any possible way to make them softer in volume."
1,Excellent heaphones for the price.<br />Although it could used a little more bass. But it is almost perfect for my taste.
0,One size ear does not fit all. The earpieces need to be adjustable. Was not a snug fit and was loose while running. Sound was ok but not much bass.
1,"They are complicated to figure out how to put on. Only fell off my ear once, though."
1,Great product. As good if not better than more expensive models. Used them in the rain and no problems at all.
1,Great bluetooth earphones! The sound is very good. Connection to a device is simple. Got these on sale. If you like the freedom of bluetooth get these.
1,Excellent product.....I'm very happy with it.
1,It was well received
1,"These really are GREAT.  Comfortable, loud, nice bass, and they come with a few car accessories and a nice carrying case for them.  Seriously, worth every penny.  I guarantee it!"
0,When on a phone call - the other person couldn't hear my voice. Looks like the fact that the microphone is up by our ear - doesn't help.
1,Arrived on time. Work as promised.
0,"Bad headphones, the connection is horrible, with three feet of distance it starts cutting off."
1,The life of the battery is as advertised!  A+
0,"This was my first bluetooth headphone purchase. I was not especially thrilled.  Sound was fine for the price, but they never seemed to stay in place. And the foam ear pieces came off far too easily. They did not re-connect to my phone as readily as another brand I bought last week.<br /><br />And - the sound on one side partially went out after a bit more than a year. Disappointed."
0,You get what you pay for. Trash sound quality and the Bluetooth range is really small. Battery life is ok
1,"Comfortable, good in ear fit alternativesx and good sound. I had some connecting issues with Android devices but then realized it was my horrible cheap smart watch app that was messing things up. I uninstalled the app and now all works like a charm. Highly recommend this headset."
0,"After all the other glowing reviews, I guess had higher than average expectations for these.<br /><br />They're not good.<br /><br />They pair fine, battery is long-lasting enough.<br /><br />But the sound...they are about on par with the earbuds you get handed at trade shows or on airlines. If you like music to sound good, don't buy these.<br /><br />And the fit...earpieces strangely shaped and too heavy to be supported by your ear alone. Not to mention the over-ear hook is completely useless as it is too large to properly fit any normal ear. VERY uncomfortable unless you have HUGE ears."
1,These earbuds stay in place and the sound is great
1,I like em. They're surprisingly comparable to the Beats I paid 150 for a few years back. So far so good!!
1,"Solid ear buds, I have had them a little over 2 weeks and use them mainly at the gym. They have a good sound with a decent amount of bass. The price was what really sold me on them, would recommend to a friend."
1,the sound quality isnt the best but for the money im happy
1,Amazing headphones at a great price.  I would absolutely buy these again.
1,"Amazing sound! Even while running on main roads it is loud and clear. They do bobble a little, one ear tends to fall out more but my ears are small (even for the small headphone size)."
1,These earbuds are awesome. They work perfectly and do not hurt my ears. The sound quality is excellent and the Bluetooth pairs easily.
1,"Extremely light, comfortable in the ear, links quickly with my TV, and the voice notifications are great.  Workout headphones so the audio quality meets my requirements."
1,"I am an endurance athlete, tough on products.  I was pleasantly surprised at value for the money.  Great packaging, accessories, and sound quality is excellent.  I have yet to run//train with them, but hopefully will have positive results.  Very comfortable."
1,Shipping was quick and I love my headphones. Easy to use and sound is awesome
1,"I purchased these back on October 2017.  I use them almost everyday for work and working out.  I thought of buying the more expensive ones only because I wanted something that would take the work I do and that I wanted comfort, long battery life and good sound. At the price, these are awesome. These do a wonderful job and have taken a lick’in in all kinds of weather.  When I’m listening to music I enjoy a nice base and hou’ll Be very impressed especially if you use the noise cancelling foam covers. If your wondering about their customer service, that’s another story in its self.  I lost one of my earbuds and so I thought I’d send an email to see how I would get new ones.  Within an hour I got a response and they’ve confirmed my order and are sending me new bud covers.  I am in sales everyday and this was over the top.  I thought I only did stuff like that.  I am very pleased with the product and the customer service.  I’m not knocking the big guys but I can tell you they would have probably not gone to the extent that Senso customer service did."
1,"It was too big for ears, so wouldn't sit properl. Unfortunately had to return it. But I liked how it looked, shipping, cost, and customer service."
1,"I've had these headphones around two months now and they sound phenomenal. The noise cancellation is incredible, battery life is around eight hours exactly. I recently had the headphones start to fail to sync with my devices, and after a short back and forth with a customer service representative they shipped me a new pair free of charge. It's incredible that they can sell such a great product for such a reasonable price, and still include a one year replacement warranty."
1,Excellent head set.  Bass could use some boost but this is standard for this type of device.  Treble and mids are excellent. The packaging includes multiple earbuds sizes and charging cable.  5 stars for excellent performance and great value.
1,"I love them.  Happy they are water proof,  so they are great when working out."
1,Work great so far!  Ran with them and they are comfortable and love that there are no wires.
1,Very nice and performs as advertised... Charging and pairing was easy... Sounds great and very comfortable...  Pleased!
1,"Great product. I have heard a bit of echoing on occasions, but for the most part,  great sound quality and range."
0,"Really disappointed by this earphones. I purchased them to use when I am running. At first the sound seemed to be fine. The earphones were a bit uncomfortable and were falling out all the time but I thought that I will get used to them. It's been a month and a half since I bought them. Now, besides that they still feel uncomfortable, the sound started to be really bad and it hurts my ears to listen to that extra noise. There is some weird noise on the background of any song and I cannot even turn the sound louder because it gets so bad that it is unbearable. I wish the problem started earlier when I could still return them. Otherwise, it is too expensive earphones  for one month of usage only."
0,"My expectation was high because of the customers review and the rating. But I found<br />this item as ordinary as it could ever possibly be. I used to have a better sound quality headphone<br />for half the price. To compensate for the low quality, they will give you a few dollars worth of chargers<br />and cables and wrap everything together in a nice package. No, I want primarily a quality sound - all other things are secondary."
1,"Good quality and well put together. A bit tinny compared to wired headphones and the bass, if the volume is too high, tends to get fuzzy on the heavier bass lines. Otherwise it's pretty satisfactory for the cost."
1,"My review on March 21: Sensor headphones deliver clear sound and are easy to use.  They are more than adequate for receiving and making phone calls.  I rate them a three because at their lowest setting the volume is way too loud.  I've adjusted my Samsung 7Edge volume and tuning and it is still way too loud.  UPDATE:  Senso Customer Service reached out to me and provided assistance to reset my headset.  The volume issue is resolved.  I am impressed with the quality, affordability of the headset and the excellent customer service."
1,Good headphones/ lasted little over 2 years. I used it mainly during workout. Now the wire started to break and internal wire is exposed and only one side works. Nothing lasts forever but for the price this is as good as it gets.
1,It is good item and the customer service is perfect.
1,"They work great, easy to use & I love them when I workout at the gym!"
0,They do not stay on my ears-I do not see how they can be called sports head phones- the plastic ear loops are worthless and do not keep the earbuds on my ear even on a gentle walk.
1,"the best earphone i ever  had, and got it  for this incredible price."
1,Thanks
1,Nice product holds a charge very nicely. I wish they were more comfortable.
1,"They work very good have a great battery life, I use them on and off throughout my work day and they have not died on me during the day. My only downside is they don't have very rich bass, but hey for the price these are some great little headphones.  I have worn them to the gym a couple times and no issues with my excessive sweating these guys just kept pumping out sound."
1,"Fits snug, comfortable and clear!"
1,Bought two pair and we love them.  Very comfortable and great sound.
1,Great sound. Easy to use!
1,"Such an amazing headphones. The price is amazing, best headphones ever."
1,Wife and I love ours.  Connect up great and very good sound.
1,"I absolutely love these headphones. These are the best headphones I've owned. The sound is excellent, they are extremely comfortable, and the noise cancellation is perfect."
0,"I ordered this after seeing lots of good reviews. Sadly for me, the headphones arrived with one of the silicon bud malformed. Since I need the headphones for my gym I decided to keep it. However it was a wrong decision. The headphones died after about 2 week usage. They no longer charge."
1,Really good deal!
1,"I Use the at work and at the Gym they  Work Great, Sound is always Crystal Clear and you can walk a good 50 ft or so away from your source device before it starts breaking up."
1,I was in a double mind to go with Poerbeats3 or Senso...149$ vs 36$... My friend bought power beast and I gone for Senso.. Seriously telling there is no difference at all.. Senso is very good and perfect fitting. If you are a brand freak and huge bank balace then go with other bands.<br /><br />Senso is simply Awesome and fits in perfect.
1,I BOUGHT 2 SETS OF THE EARPHONES...  1 FOR ME & 1 FOR MY ADULT SON. HE USED THEM ON A TRIP AND JUST TOLD ME HE IS VERY HAPPY WITH THEM. I HAVEN'T TRIED THEM YET BC I WAS WAITING FOR HIS OPINION FIRST..
1,"Great audio, battery life, and charge time"
1,Headphones are comfortable and easy to use. I have to say I don't really care about sound quality cuz I just use them while I workout normally and I'm focused on other things than the music. However the sound quality on the headphones is outstanding. When I first turned them on I was actually blown away by how they sound. Great product for a good price!
1,Afree thing ok
0,"Headphones are garbage, stopped working completely after 2 months. Won't turn on or charge at all."
0,I loved these but sadly they stoped working after a few weeks very disappointed 😔
1,"The headphones alone are worth the price...and then some. High-quality sound and the controls are easily accessible. Add to that the accessories and carrying case, and it's a great deal all around. Highly recommended!"
1,These were a gift for my mother and she loves them. Super easy instructions and the clarity is great. She says the fit is nice and they are secure. Bought them a few days ago but seem to be working extremely well.
1,The headphones are fabulous a great buy for the money
1,Great product to workout and comfortable to wear
1,I love them!! I'm impressed by the sound quality and fit!!!!
1,"I had to write another review these are the Goats!! Battery life is okay just charge daily I use them for work so I have them on for 8 hours a day. However; these things are the toughest I've ever had, I accidentally (I don't recommend) washed them left them in my pants pocket and dried them and they still work and nothing seems to have been malfunctioning and it still hold a charge. I highly recommend owning a. Pair of these."
1,Good product.  Had no problem. Similar to brand name headphones.
1,None
1,"Very nice bluetooth earbuds. Work great at the gym, nice sound reproduction, excellent battery life, and very reasonable price for what you get. Would purchase again."
1,I’m so over the Beats by Dre wireless headphones because the ear piece breaks every time. I sent them back to Apple & they broke a month later in the same spot but on a different ear. This has also happened to my friends. I bought these Senso pair about 3 months ago & there just as good as the Beats but they only cost $29. Why waste money on Beats when you save money.
1,I like the Bluetooth headphones and will be purchasing another pair for my mother.
1,"&quot;ActivBuds feature ergonomically designed flexible ear hooks with gel flex silicone earbuds to ensure your headphones stay comfortably firm in place to guarantee fatigue free ears and tangle free comfort.&quot; This statement is really true!  I wear glasses, and I can still have this pair of earbuds on my ears for hours and not feeling any discomfort.  They just stay on my ears perfectly.  I don't have to readjust their position when I walk or run - they just stay where they are.  The voice quality is crystal clear.  they are easy to hook up with other bluetooth devices.  I really love this pair of bluetooth earbuds."
1,I have had these headphones for a little more then a month now and they are great. I mainly use them for the gym. They are definitely sweat resistant and the battery is long enough to last me 3 trips to the gym without needing a charge. These are my first Bluetooth headphones I have bought and I am very happy with my purchase. I would highly recommend these headphones.
1,"I really like these.  Easy to pair on bluetooth, very good sound quality.  A charge lasts several hours."
1,Exactly what I was after.....I use these when on the riding mower.......great product!
1,I tried two other types of bluetooth headsets for running and had problems with them falling out of my ears.  This set stays put.  The sound is pretty good not great but I listen to podcasts so no biggie.  I use these with my TomTom Runner with music.
1,Great sound and stay on while jogging
1,I bought these when another pair from a different company fell apart. I'm very happy with the quality of the sound and the build. They feel substantial and sturdy. I'm very happy with them.
1,I love these head phones. I use them every day. I wish the cord was a little longer because my neck rubs on it an since it's rubber it pulls the headphones. I just wear the cord in front and it's fine. It's loud enough to hear when I mow. I think the battery last a long time. I probably listen to them an hour a day and only have to charge it once a week. It starts to beep when the battery is about to die. You don't have very long after that before it's dead. I also use it to talk on the phone. I didn't purchase if for that reason but it's a great bonus. Another thing I like is that you can pause your audio on your phone by just clicking the button on the ear piece.
1,"You can actually work out in these things! No more worrying about them slipping off, or putting up with uncomfortable extra parts and unnecessary wires. Now if only they could eliminate the wire between the two sides..."
1,Very happy with the sound quality.
1,Very comfortable with fairly wide range sound. Smart to have all controls at earpiece instead on the wire.
1,"The headphones do what I want them to do. They stay in my ears while exercising, stay connected to my phone via bluetooth without losing connection or making weird noises, and they have decent noise cancellation. The sound quality isn't as good as default apple headphones, but that's to be expected from headphones this cheap. I'm really annoyed by the really loud &#34;paused&#34; and &#34;power low&#34; notifications, but it can be avoided. I've been using them for 4 months and they haven't broken or stopped working at all, which is a good sign."
1,The headphones seem to work well and it comes with a lot of accessories which is great.  The only downside I've noticed so far is that the hooks are rather big.  They don't sit on my ears the way they should and I think they will come off when running. I just got them so I haven't really been able to try them with a variety of different exercises.
0,"Sound quality is good.  It is a little awkward with my glasses, but after a few adjustments it is fine.<br />1/21/20 update, the headphones will no longer charge.  Some cords work sometimes, others not at all, although the cords work with other devices.  The headphones aren't a year old yet."
1,Very impressed and happy with overall quality
1,Love these ear buds. Easy to use and the sound is great. Especially the bass tones
0,"I can't believe there are this many favorable reviews for these headphones. The fact is, a lot of people are going to buy these for working out, and the main flaw is the over-the-ear piece, it is simply too flimsy to hold in your ear. They absolutely cannot withstand any pounding or impact whatsoever without falling out of your ear. Sound quality is ok, battery life is a few hours at most. Pretty lame that these garbage headphones are labeled ""Amazons Choice""."
1,Very good. Easy to use and very good sound quality.  Long battery life.
1,"Headphones arrived quickly and pairing them was a snap.  So far, I've had relatively good luck with them.  I wish the range were a big more - audio starts breaking up at what seems to me to be a short distance.  But they are very comfortable and the sound quality is excellent."
0,after two weeks using it broke!<br />No good!!
1,"Item is great, price point is amazing! My only issue with these is that even just walking the dog when the wind blows causes wind noise. The different ear buds don't appear to be able to fix this issue. Newer versions of the product will need to find ear connectors that conform better to stop the wind noice. I have some BOSE wired ones and the ear buds are perfect and no wind noice is made even in high winds. Other than that, this item is perfect on all other fronts. Buy it and you will not be disappointed!"
1,The product is great and an excellent price.  Customer service is fast to respond when contacted.  I was so impressed I bought a pair for the whole family as other head phone I have bought would not stay in my ears.  I highly recommend SenSo.
1,"So far so good.  Fairly comfortable, decent sound.  A little bulky, but they work well.  They don't fit or sound as good as the Plantronics Backbeat Fit headphone I had (and lost -- grrr) but they were a darn sight cheaper.  They sound better and fit a lot better than the Jaybird X2, which were constantly falling out of my ear.  I needed a good pair for the gym, these do the job and at good value."
1,"Great battery life, sound quality. And a great price !!"
1,They Help if u Have a job requiring Both Hands 🤲🏾
0,Ear pieces come out when sweating after 20 min of running. Had to constantly push right ear piece back in during run. Do not stay in well!!
1,"I've only been using these for 15 minutes, but... wow. These are my first wireless headphones. I had heard can achieve superior performance because they can have their own drivers and amplifiers and circumvent the impedance of the long cable, but I didn't expect this much of a difference! Before these, I had been using the [[ASIN:B00JPK9T1W Klipsch R6i In-Ear Headphones]]. The R6i was my third time buying Klipsch, whose headphones were consistently rated best performance for the money on CNET. The R6i were notable for their very good bass, but these SENSO headphones blow them out of the water [not that the R6i would have survived in water, of course ;) ].<br /><br /> As was mentioned, the volume is very good. In a quiet environment, I don't need to go higher than the lowest level. I'm no audiophile, but as someone who appreciates higher sound quality enough to have tried several &#60; $50 headphones to replace Apple's generic ones, I can say the average person will see a VERY noticeable difference.<br /><br />Naturally, I haven't had time to evaluate the durability or battery life, but I will make an update if they are any different than advertised."
1,Bought for my son and he absolutely loves them!
1,Great sound compared to the Power Beats 2. Great Price and great for use at the gym.
1,I’ve only had these for a week but they are awesome. I love how comfortable they feel (I have walked around in them and cleaned house in them and have they had felt very secure).  The sound quality is great. I have also<br />Used them several times for conference calls and had zero issues.  I have never tried a very expensive pair of ear buds but my coworker just spent a ton of money on some beats wireless ear buds and I think these look just as great if not better due to the price point. I like the case that comes along as well as the charging cords and car charger. I would HIGHLY recommend purchasing these before dropping a ton of cash on the expensive brands.  Overall great shopping experience!!!
1,"Very lightweight, comfortable to wear. Great sound!!!"
1,Its plastic  started to peel off within 1 month of light use maybe 2 times week . Also the bass not that good . $15 Panasonic earphones sounds better.
1,Sound great worth the money!
1,"I'm happy with these headphones: good sound, ease to use, light, really a pleasant experience."
1,"Awesome!!! Reliable, waterproof, comfortable, and great sound!!!! Exactly what I needed for the gym!!!!"
1,"Thank you!<br />The headphones are great. In fact they sound just like beats... But for a mooooore reasonable price! I love it. And it came with an iPhone charger, which is really cool! Thank you again! Really awesome product!"
1,"Worked ok for about 1 year and a month, then the on/off button stopped functioning.  Customer service said they would replace under warranty but then would not budge with it being a month over the 1 year warranty.  Went elsewhere for a replacement"
1,"Needed a set of Bluetooth headphones for work. I was beyond frustrated using the wired headphones which came with my Galaxy S8 due to the wire constantly getting caught  in anything and everything; thus yanking the ear buds out of my ear(s).<br /><br />Let me say I am more than satisfied with my purchase. These earphones perform ALOT better than I had initially expected. The sound quality, clarity and bass level are perfect. The pairing process was simple as every, there are several options for earbus sizes, a nice storage case a charger and other items. The earhook sits comfortable around my ear, the hook material is soft and flexible. Due to being so light and comfortable, one can't tell a set of headphones are on. The noise cancelling is pretty good as well.<br /><br />Prior to my purchase, I scrolled past many, literally several other Bluetooth headsets reading through all the customer reviews and obviously I decided to go with this set. So happy with the choice I made."
1,- Bluetooth works well and connects quickly<br />- very good sound and volume<br />- fit is fine
1,Very bassy. It’s distracting for listening not during activities. The button on the side turns them on and when double tapped it dials the last number. That’s a little annoying. Call quality is great though. They stay in place quite well. The wire is a little sticky and can start to pull a little. The over ear arms are bendable and really help dial in the fit.
1,"I read that the part that goes over your ear is a bit lose (there isn't a wire that makes it able to bend to the shape of your ear), so I was worried they wouldn't stay on my ears securely and would fall out while I jog, which is the problem I have with most headphones. I worried needlessly - I've jogged 4 miles a day for the past 3 days, and these were great! The sound is good, the buttons work, they stay on. Thumbs up."
0,they don't stay in my ears good. I've tried all the different covers...the foam ones do the best for me. The battery life is good however there is no warning of when its getting ready to die. The sound is great.
1,"Not terrible but the signal does cut out every now and then until they get restarted and reconnected via the Bluetooth. One of the parts that goes in your ear broke off on mine and I had to super glue it back on, although it didn't seem to effect the sound at all."
1,Purchased for child in HS and one in college.  Consensus is that these are great value--decent sound fidelity and versatile.  Easy to connect.  Definitely recommended.  The star system is troublesome--they aren't Bose but they are quite good--reason for four stars.
0,Sound quality is very nice for wireless headphones at this price. They feel very well made and the battery lasts for the full 8 hours claimed.<br /><br />**Editing this review because they seem to have changed manufacturers and the quality isn't as good on the new ones. One ear bud is louder than the other and the passive noise cancelling doesnt work as well. They also changed the design of the ear hooks and they're not nearly as comfortable as my old ones.
1,They having amazing bass compared to the other similar Bluetooth headphones you find online.
0,"I could not walk or go to the gym with these earbuds. Sound was constantly dropping out, so if I wanted to listen to a book or podcast I was missing about 1/4 of the conversation. Would not recommend."
1,"The headphones have been working wonderfully for the last 2 years, but they just would not turn on now."
1,Thanks
1,"My observations after months of use<br />(1) Connectivity problems...takes 30+ seconds to establish a connection to my Iphone 6 and now Iphone 7.<br />(2) Low Bass - could use a little more bass in feature versions<br />(3) Range is inadequate; living in a 3 story home ... and cannot connect when I'm in the basement and the phone is on the 2nd level.<br />(4) Goes off and comes on randomly; this wasn't the case for the first month of use.<br /><br />Overall, good product per the price, however, a little improvement will do to correct the problems listed above."
1,"These earbuds are great, especially for when I am running. No need to worry about wires getting in the way. Love the sound quality and design. The noise cancelling works great saves on battery power, which was also great. Did not have any trouble with pairing."
1,"Waited with anticipation for my SENSO Bluetooth Headphones based on the positive reviews but was sadly disappointed with the inferior sound quality. I first used the headphones to complete a technical support call with my cell phone carrier but head an annoying echo after talking. After completing this task, I tried the SENSO Bluetooth Headphones with my iPhone 7 Plus for music but found the sound quality varied with different types of music. For vocals and orchestral music, the sound quality was fair (about a 6 out of 10) but with classic rock and roll, the bass was really distorted. I tried adjusting the iPhones equalizer and nothing really improved the sound quality dramatically compared to other headphones I have used. In hindsight, you get what you pay for and I wished I had spent these funds toward higher quality headphones such as the Bose SoundSport Pulse Headphones ($149) because I had hoped that the SENSO Bluetooth headphones would be almost as good as Bose for 25% of the cost."
1,"Amazing sound, great battery life and the customizable fit / ear buds were perfect! Right out of the box, which comes with a few extra little cool items including a nice carrying case, I powered these up and mowed my lawn. They stayed perfectly in place even with the sweat and I couldn't even hear the noise of the mower. The sounds are crisp, clean and not overpowering."
1,Love them accept that they don't vibrate to notify of an incoming call.
1,Fantastic! Battery lasts for almost 9 hours! Very Descent Sound Quality for the price!
1,They made it 1 year and 2 months and then just died. Waste of money
1,"Pros:<br />- Price is right(ish)<br />- They stay in my ear very well<br />- Mildly noise cancelling (better than I expected)<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Noise cancellation goes right out the window if it's windy (as is the case with most headphones)<br />- The buttons are right on the side attached to the earpiece (as opposed to on the wire) so it is a little awkward to change volume/go to next song without moving the earpiece uncomfortably in your ear.<br />- The sound quality is a little worse than I was expecting. I have a pair of $15.00 earbuds which have slightly better quality, and an $8.00 pair with slightly worse quality.<br /><br />Overall I'd recommend these headphones if you are prioritizing headphones which stay in your ear during a run or eliminate noise at the gym, but I would NOT recommend them if you are into super clear sound quality or you like to skip songs often during a run."
1,works like majic
1,"Sound was not as rich and deep as I had hoped, but the earbuds are comfortable and do stay in your ears. Headphones are also easy to use, and the carrying case is perfect."
1,"These are pretty nice.  They are comfortable, sound good, and are easy to use.  I haven't tried them on a full fledged run yet, but I ran around my house with them on and they were comfy and didn't pop out."
1,Excellent headphones. This is my second repeat purchase. Bought them as a gift both times and were really appreciated
1,"Presentation/packaging very nicely done, especially for the price."
1,Good sound quality.....very difficult to get them to stay in your ears when running. Constantly adjusting them
1,"Everything is as described, maybe better, I have yet to see all the benefits. Came on time too."
1,"Got the ear buds her quickly.  Came as a kit with a case, charging cable, car charging adapter and several different sized ear buds.  Connected to my Android phone easily and they sound great."
1,great
1,"I got my boyfriend this as a gift, he sweats alot when he works out and his headphone wire would get sweaty. But he tried these out today and loves them"
1,Love them - lightweight and very comfy in ears. Lost them and ordering exact ones again - happy with purchase.
1,The sound is great but I doubt the noise cancelling ability as most callers complain that there is a lot of noise in the background. I wish i could balance it on my neck but it’s just plain wires.
0,I purchased these on a whim because of the price and reviews.  Had them one day and the earbud physically broke from the main housing.  Not happy at all.  Sent them back.
1,Good bass and adequate mid/highs. Signal strength as advertised. All for a budget price.... Whi can ask for more?
1,These are the best earbuds I have ever had. I am hard of hearing and have tested a lot of brands and models that can play loud and clear enough for me. These are the best by far! I highly recommend them even over the expensive brands such as Beats which are far to heavy on the bass and not loud enough for me.
1,"I had the AXGIO verson of these headphone, until I lost them. Still good equipment, same lady's voice in my ear. Easy connection, good sound."
1,Stay on my ears!  Good sound quality and battery life. One of my favorite after trying many brands
1,"These are great. I've gone through 2 pairs now, my first pair lasting me a year of frequent use. I use these 8+ hours a day while cleaning pools. The battery does indeed last 8 whole hours of continuous use. They've gotten wet and even be dipped into water and continue to work. The material they are made out of is soft enough to not hurt my ears with constant use. I really can't say enough good about these. Buy them!!!"
1,"These are the best wireless headphones I've owned! I've owned a few different pairs including BEATS brand and these are by far the best quality all around. I feel like the battery lasts forever, as I've used these for a few days straight and have not had the battery run out on me at all. They look good, they sound great and the price is much cheaper than expected for what you get.<br />Buy these!"
0,"I bought these a couple of years ago and they were decent headphones for a short jog or to listen to podcasts while working around the house. They stopped taking a charge so I bought new ones. New ones are much worse. Maybe they changed the manufacturer? Worse sound quality, terrible balance, shorter bluetooth range, and the plastic feels chintzier."
1,I have used these in my hot tub and they work very well. The sound is really good and I have dunked my head a couple of times to make sure they are waterproof and they have worked great.
0,My recent purchase of 4 months has stopped working. I have been trying to get this fixed and even with insurance I have had no luck. I’ve been buying this product for years and now I get no customer service??
1,"The audio quality is very nice with these headphones.  There are a few drawbacks - the fit being number 1.  Compared to earbuds, these fit a bit less secure thus you lose a lot of the low end bass and if you are working out or wear them for an extended period of time (2 hrs +), your ears may feel a bit sore.  I'm not sure if you bought the &#34;name&#34; brand products you wouldn't have the same fit issues.<br /><br />Senso includes a carrying case, extra ear pieces and charging cable (which I love - dual platform is nice) making this a winner.<br /><br />For the price, these are fantastic.  I'm definitely pleased with the purchase."
1,Very happy with this set they are comfortable sound good. I use them to listen to music to text and make phone calls
1,"Great sound, good bass"
1,Great sound. Great battery life. Great fit. Very comfortable.
1,Great Product
1,PERFECT
1,"The best customer service. Excellent product,  good price  and  quality"
1,"The sound on these headphones is extremely impressive for the price.  I've owned quite a few pairs of Bluetooth ear buds, including Jabras that we're three times the cost.  These Sensos beat them all hands down in the sound department.  I'll repost more info after I get a few runs in with them."
1,Very happy with the service and the product
1,Love it!! I work around a lot of loud machines and I can still hear my books or music.
1,"it took a few tries to pair with my Apple Watch, but once i played music it paired instantly.  They fit great. and sound great.<br />I have not ever listed to the Beats set they sell at the apple store for $200, but i am pretty sure i would not find a $160 difference.  i use these for running and workouts, perfect for that!"
1,"Quality product, sounds terrific, and relatively comfortable."
1,"Great value for the price. If you are looking for satisfactory Bluetooth headphones, these are the ones. Good sound quality for the gym, running/walking, reasonable range, acceptable comfort, easy to set up, clear directions, all the necessary components in a clamshell cast. I haven't had them long enough to confirm charge length."
0,"Bought it March 2017 for $37.97 because that’s how much they charge before and it just stopped working after a year! It’s having some problems already with the battery after 6 months of using but I just keep charging it time to time and continue using anyway. But now I tried asking them to just replace it and I’ll send them the malfunctioned one, but they said the 1 year warranty expired already so they can’t do anything about it anymore. So your product is only good for a year!!!"
1,"I purchased these for pool use based on the description of them being  ""waterproof"" but after receiving them and doing further research, I found in the Questions portion that they are not to be used for swimming. I did pair them with my iPhone and liked the sound quality so will keep them for walking and biking."
1,I bought these for my wife so that she could move around wirelessly as she works and excercises.  She loves these headphones as they have a crisp and clear sound without sacrificing the bass.  She has also told me that she connects it to her phone at her desk and can move around the warehouse without losing connection.  We are very satisfied.
1,I am pleasantly surprised by the good quality of these. I didn't want to invest in an expensive pair since I go through these very often. They work almost the same as the high end brands - highly recommend
1,"Have been using these for about a week now and really like them.  These are my first pair of wireless headphones so I don't have much to compare to but comparing them to standard wired headphones, they're awesome.  It's SO much nicer not having to deal with the wire hanging between which bounces around annoyingly when jogging so you have to hold it or tugs and gets ripped out sometimes when lifting.  Loving not having to deal with that at all anymore.<br /><br />I like how these came in a hardshell case with several different ear bud piece sizes and car port charger.  The button functionality on the ear piece to modify volume, answer/end calls, pause music and etc. seems nice though haven't used it much.<br /><br />The only dislikes I've experienced so far is the wire between the ear pieces that goes behind the head seems like it could be shorter.  It's good, though, that they provide a little thing that you can feed the wires through to tighten it on the back of the head.  The first time I wore these jogging I wasn't wearing glasses and the right ear piece kept popping loose so ended up just taking it out and only using the left one.  The other times I've been wearing glasses which helps anchor the pieces.  Not holding much weight to this criticism right now given I'm not sure if I just didn't properly input that ear bud that time or what, but just wanted to be transparent with my views."
1,I am loving this thing. Its amazing.
1,just what I was looking for
1,These are exactly what you order. They're a good quality and sound. I use them in the gym and have no problems with them falling out. This is my third pair I have purchased. Highly recommend as something for the gym or any activity where they may get messed up. Plus there is a lifetime guarantee.
0,Ok. I used them everyday- literally. I loved them until today . After a run I shut them off  . I plugged them in to charge about two hours later and the light that indicates charging won’t light and the head phones won’t turn on !  They weren’t dead when I went to plug them in. Crusher!  I’m going to probably order another brand.  I got them in April and they’re dead in November ? Cmon
1,Previous version was louder?! But nonetheless this is FANTASTIC!!😍
1,Worth the money!
1,Best headphones out there for the price!!!
1,"Item just as described, used them several times already and have recommended to my friends. Feel good, fit well and sound is great!"
1,"I love how soft the ear piece is. The Bluetooth range works great too, thanks!"
0,It died after getting wet. I bought them because they were water proof and they dont work anymore.
1,"I have had these for about a month and while they are swear resisted, they do not hold on the ear very well. They fall off quite frequently. The sound is good but wish they would stay on better"
1,"So far so good. Item does what it's supposed to do. Senso Bluetooth links to my Samsung s7 edge, MacBook and ipad with full function of controls i.e. on off volume up and down and track up and down. Sound quality is quite good. I also like the case ,very useful for protecting the headphones from getting damaged. Overall I am very pleased with the product, I bought it primarily for training in the gym, the buds from the headphones that came with the Samsung would not stick on my ears ( no such issue with the Senso headphones) the symphonic head phones I had did not have controls to work with the phone ( a pain in the butt when you get a call) . Other pluses the cord doesn't tangle and nice Bluetooth range."
1,"Bought the headsets in August of 2016.  They failed in March of 2017.  Who saves all the packing stuff when you have your item on hand?  Email Amazon, they provided the Customer Service 800 #.  Called them, explained the headsets quit.  Did a couple of short exercises to make sure they failed (not more than 5-10 minutes).  Confirmed that they failed and under warranty.  1 week later I have the replacements.  Great Customer Service from Invotec / Senso and Amazon.  What more can one say."
1,I LOVE these headphones!<br />I wanted a pair of headphones that wouldn't be a downer in working out. I got tired of wearing headphones and having my phone strapped to my arm.<br />These are definitely great! They stay steady while walking from circuit training. And did I say affordable?<br />They're also great for blocking out noises!
1,very good value for $$$. Owned for a few months and went bad but seller replaced under warranty.
1,"Why buying the Powerbeats wireless, a piece of....always breaking. I had to exchange them 2 times and the third time they wanted me to pay for the repair, no way!<br /><br />Just bough tus ones and so far the sound quality and the ear stability (I am a runner and needed a good fit for my ears) are superior than a pair of headphones that it is worth 4 times more!"
1,"I ordered  this one and the anger sound core, this senso had the best sound vs anker. This is audible at a distance of 27 ft and then drops further. Anker was good upto 65 ft of distance but even with loudest volume it was hard to hear from the anker. Conclusion I tested both the headphones and senso this model was a he best in sound quality, nice cancellling. I would definitely recommend this one. It is 5 days of use since I bought and I am happy so far."
1,I was very pleased with these Senso ActiveBuds. Great sound and they actually stay in my ears. I highly recommend them.
0,"I regret this purchase. The sound of these earphones is a mess. It sounds like listening to music underwater. I was excited because of the features, but it was a huge let down once I got them and listened to my music. These might be great for a kid who just wants something that looks cool. They’d probably think they sound great also. But you can’t trick my ears. What a mess."
1,"Quick charge, decent battery life (about 4-6 hours of continuous), good mic for phone calls, and they came with a nice case. Inside the case they have multiple sized ear buds, soft and hard and a bonus car charger. Buy em they are a no brained"
0,These wouldn't ever turn on. Wanted to return them but passed date to return.
1,"It came in a nice black sleek case. Texture of case & headphone are smooth. Light weight & flexible.  Fit perfectly for my petite head. Sound system is great. Easy to sync with Bluetooth.  You could hear the recording of voice when turning On & Off button, instead of guessing. Love wearing it while doing my chores where others are around the small space. Great companion for workout & travel."
1,Love these headphones. Uses them biking and walking. No problems hearing<br /> and answering call
1,Best headphones I've ever owned. They are fantastic!
1,"These headphones are decent; the sound is good and they stay in my ears when I'm running- for the most part. I would have preferred if the piece that goes around the back of your ear was a little more firm. It's very flexible and I'm not sure that it adds much support. Generally headphones don't stay in my ears, and it's definitely better with these but the one has fallen out a few times. With some repositioning I'm able to get it to stay in though. Sometimes when I'm running the sound cuts in and out but I think that is more of an issue with cell reception. Overall, they are comfortable and I like them."
1,Normally I just read reviews good and bad both then decide on purchasing. Quick and to point review. Very impressed with these ear buds. First impressions. From the Sensor box they come in to laminated instructions and quality of the ear buds get A++. Plenty of charging options and replacement ear pods included. Nice caring case. Easy to pair with no issues. Sound quality of bass and trebile is excellent. Sound turned half way up and they jam. If they stand the test of time I will be fully impressed. Battery life I haven't tested so can't speak to that. Would I purchase again. Heck yes.
1,"Product as described. Plus the xtras are a great benefit. Unit paired right away with my Samsung S7 Edge, good sound, easy buttons to use and for phone conversations, people told me it was clear and loud. Already recommended them to my wife and son.<br /><br />Thanks!!"
1,Earbuds work very well!!
1,"I had these since 2017 and they just now stopped working (2022)! That's pretty good for a product that's $25. Can't complain, just ordered a replacement pair!"
0,"So I bought these headphones 2 days ago. They were pretty decent. But then when it was telling me low battery. I disconnected from my phone. And went to go charge them, and nothing. I've tried multiple charging spots. And nothing. They will not charge at all. The led light will not even turn on. I even left it charging for an hour. Idk What's going on."
1,"Outstanding product for a great price,. Most wireless headphones come with a huge price tag but these were well worth the cost. Fit great and are comfortable to work out in. Don't have any issues running in them and they also come with a cool little carry case. Well worth the purchase."
0,"These are much larger than they seem. The part outside the ear, with &#34;Senso&#34; on it, is two inches long and 1/2 inch wide at the cord connection. This makes them heavy and highly noticeable. I didn't want that &#34;I'm so busy I have to wear a bluetooth just to keep up with all my many, many calls&#34; look. The sound is also incredibly tinny. The carrying case is nice, though."
1,These headphones are great! Especially for the price.. I workout everyday so I use them all the time!
1,As of now they seam fine. They are much larger than I thought they would be but they fit well. I wear prescription glasses so they have to go over the glasses over the ear. This should be taken into account when buying these. Being that I have only had them for a few days I cant say how long they will last.
0,"If I put my phone in my pocket, these don't work. If I put my phone in my workout arm band and turn my head, they don't work... if I set my phone on my desk and turn away from it, these don't work. What's the point of wireless headphones if you can't move? I've paired, unpaired, turned them off/on, restarted my phone, etc. Nothing seems to help. Worked great for about a week, now, these are trash."
1,"Excellent if they hold up over time then I'll give them five stars, but they definitely are five star quality."
1,these things are great. i dropped the off my bunk-bed onto the tile floor and the case come open but snapped right back together. the sound is great and the battery lasts all day aslong and you didnt use it abunch the day before and didnt charge them. other wireless earbuds i have die withing three hours. i can take these with my to classes and they will still have battery at the end of the day. the over the ear arm is great cause the wont fallout like other earbuds. the cable does drag on my neck but just a quick tug on the side and its fine. because of the arm the cable pulling the earbud slightly wont take it out of your ear either. ive had these for years and theyve outlived all my other earbuds
1,Not sure why people would pay for those expensive headphones. These are worth the price.
1,"They work nice and smoothly, they are a great deal for it's price , just the quality of the case and the general design could be better but definitely they are a great product that would not disappoint anyone"
1,The headphones are fantastic. I especially appreciate the ease of turning them off instead of fumbling with my phone. I used them at a retreat all weekend and could listen to my audio book or quickly reenter a conversation without any notice or disruption. Thanks for a great product!
1,It's great and easy to sync with my iPhone.  Would buy it again.
1,Love it! At work I listen to music and the headphones I had really irritated my ear! These are gentle and are overall good quality headphones!
1,I'm happy!
1,"I rarely write reviews but almost feel obligated here.  I'm SO stoked on these.  I was initially skeptical because if the low price, but bought them due the positive reviews and the amazing r"
1,"The product does exactly what it is supposed to. So Quality is OK to feel on your ear is OK, and the frequency is good as well."
1,"Excellent product for the price, good base and clarity.  I am basing this off of the initial use but would recommend on the performance of first use"
1,Great product
1,"As a runner, I got these as a fairly inexpensive option to listen to music but not worry if they got wet during a run and had to be replaced. Not only have I worn them for two years in all temperatures, from -20F to 90F, they’ve been on in snow and rain, and still work. What finally prompted me to come back and write a review is that I accidentally put them through the washer and dryer with my clothes AND THEY STILL WORK. Just wow.<br /><br />Sound quality is good, they stay on well and toggling pause, advance a song, take a phone call etc. is pretty easy to do. I actually had purchased a backup pair for the day they might get wet and stop working, gave the extra to my boyfriend when he was frustrated with the poor battery life on his headphones, and he is happy with them too."
0,"Honestly, the quality of the sound it really bad. It's much worse and hits a lower range of frequencies than a normal pair of ipod headphones. If you know and care about how your music sounds, don't buy these - they're totally missing the bass part of the spectrum. If you want it for running, it's a great cheap pair. If you want it for listening to music in the office, go with something with better quality."
1,They do not fall out of the ear and stay in place.  It fits the size of the ear perfectly
1,Excellent sound quality! Very comfortable to wear.
1,"Thanks for your attention. Headphone has a good quality when I use with my laptop but the problem is, it is not compatible with my iPhone. I mean for some musics with high bass the quality is not as well as when I use it with my laptop.<br />Best regards<br />Ali"
1,I love these headphones. I really like that they come with some many extras like a car charger. They've been working great since I received them. I'd definitely recommend them to anyone.
1,This purchase was one of the best I've ever made. The sound is great and they're completely comfortable. I recommend if you're looking for a set get these
1,Bought these for my husband. He likes to run but has a difficult time keeping earbuds in his ears. He said these worked great and is very pleased. Delivery was fast and packaging for item was great
1,Like the sound
1,"First off I want to thank their amazing customer service, the first pair I received I had issues with charging and they were fast to assist and the problem was fixed! I even bought a second pair because why not.... The battery life is great, I use them when working out, hiking, when driving as my car doesn't have Bluetooth and even when I'm cooking or cleaning late at night and want to hear music without bothering the neighbors!!"
1,"I'm really impressed, especially for the price. Nice quality construction and sound, plenty of bass, and comfortable. It came with the carrying case and included a wire tie, extra earbuds, short charging cable, 3' dual (mini usb and lightning, and a car charger, all in a very smartly designed box."
1,I really enjoy listening to the earbuds I purchased from you great job
1,The sound quality of the earphones is very good.
1,"Received my SENSO in a timely manner and packed well. I have enjoyed using it during workout and on walks.  Only thing is that randomly volume would cut off while listening to music, not sure why. I like uaing it to make phn calls, volume is great and clear. Overall I am happy and pleased with my purchase."
1,"Great product, good value.  Very easy to pair with my iPhone."
1,"My First BT &#34;Ears&#34;...Just had the 2nd Set delivered yesterday! Awesome product, Amazing service from the Co., Senso, & great  price.<br />Don't need Captions.  Amazon continues to deliver the best products with  best Customer Service Record...<br />I got 10 hours after the 1st full Charge.<br />Just got another BT Headset from SENSO. Nothing wrong with those bought months ago...I just wanted an extra set... I'm HOH & can't afford,(or Want!)<br />HA...Company has awesome Services & a great product."
1,Sound quality is decent for price. Comes with nice accessories. Only thing I can't get over is the ear hooks are not adjustable. Also Bluetooth range is weak. I have to have phone on me for best sound quality.
0,Don’t buy!!<br />Worked for two months than it’s too late to return!!
1,Great headphones! I wear them to the gym everyday and I can count on them to stay in place!
1,"I was very pleasantly surprised by these headphones. You can not beat the price and everything you get for it. They come with a great carrying case, multiple sized earbuds options, and a car hanger option. They were easy to sync with my iPhone, and are easy to use. The sound is great quality, and they do a great job canceling outside noise. My husband liked them so much that he wants me to buy him a pair. I highly recommend these headphones."
1,Work great sounds great
0,"Ear buds worked great when I received them. However, I have barely had them two months and the reception sucks. The connection goes in and out whenever I use them. Don’t waste your $$ here."
0,Worked great for about 2 months.  Now will no longer connect with my ipod.
1,"Absolutely excellent earbuds, especially for this price. Noticeably better audio quality than my previous LG Tone Active + headset which cost me 200$. Amazing range, comfort is decent and fit is decent although not perfect. But can't give anything less than 5 stars for this quality at this price."
1,These are the best headphones i have had. Love the different size choice of covers. The sound quality is amazing and the comfort is so great I often forget they are even in my ears!!
1,Easy to pair and very comfortable !
1,"excellent quality, especially for the price.  This is my second pair after the dog decided that they are also delicious."
1,""" This item is exactly as described. It arrived on time and has performed very well so far. I am very pleased with this transaction."""
1,"I have waited a few months to write this review to see how these puppies hold up. My impressions are overwhelmingly positive. These are the best cheap headphones I've been able to find.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Comfortable, adjustable fit that actually STAYS in your ears unlike a lot of other earbuds I've tried.<br />-Fantastic bass and decent sound isolation.  They're not ""noise canceling"" but they definitely get the job done if you're trying to ignore your mom when she's telling you to do chores.<br />-Actually waterproof. I wouldn't recommend it, but I wore these in the shower a few time and they were totally un-phased. Which means they'll definitely be great for a run on a rainy day...once I decide to start exercising.<br />Solid design - the large central button is easy to find and push even when wearing gloves, allowing you to pause, play, or answer phone calls with ease. Volume buttons are well placed and easy to access.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Though it has excellent bass, the hi frequencies are only so-so. But...you know...twenty bucks.<br />Questionable microphone: Sometimes people on the other end would have great difficulty hearing me even though I hadn't physically changed positions. I'm not sure if this is something that could be improved on my end so I ain't mad."
1,I have bought this product in the past but needed a new one because it finally died on me. I abused it and It worked great!! Battery life is terrific. Sound quality is excellent. Can’t beat the price either.
1,Awesome quality for the price. Even better than the price. I had to order two pairs!
0,the ear wrao is not rubbery it like wire you bent
1,"The SENSO ActivBuds Bluetooth Headphones are the best I have ever had. Delivery was prompt, the fit is perfect, and the sound is great. I also love the placement and operation of the controls. Highly recommended."
1,I fly alot and these work perfect. Very good sound quality and even a little noise canceling ability. Great value for the price.
0,"Worked great at the beginning but around 1-2months later, theres trouble with the connectivity for my LG V30 and my laptop. Not sure why but I guess you get what you pay for.."
0,I returned it because it wouldn't stay in my ears.
1,"These headphones pair easily, have a reliable Bluetooth connection, and great sound quality. Battery life has never disappointed. I am very pleased with this purchase"
1,Love love love these! For the price these have an awesome sound and great quality. Couldn't be happier.
1,These headphones are amazing. Best wireless headphone ive ever owned.
0,"The sound quality is solid, but a huge draw back is the adjustable hooks. Every time you take off the earbuds you have to readjust them the next time they go on. Seems little, but the amount of times you take out one for a second and have to waste time putting adjusting them back in place is crazy"
1,"Really good fit with the out-of-the-box silicone earbuds. They're comfortable and they don't fall out of my ears when running outside or when using the elliptical trainer, NordicTrack, rowing machine or treadmill in the gym. Easy to pair with my tablet and phone. Sound is a little too heavy on the bass for my taste, but I use these headphones to listen to recorded TV and lectures, so it's no big deal."
0,Earbud broke off while in my pocket.  The wiring that holds the earbuds to your ears is finicky and requires frequent adjustment.
1,Great product.
1,"First pair I got as a gift where great, the second pair I purchased seemed to be built a little cheaper. The only reason I had to buy a replacement was because I lost the original pair. The new pair I bought broke only after a few months. Really disappointed."
1,Easy to use and the sound is great. I am very happy with this product and also the &#34;extras&#34; that were included in the box.
1,"Nice headphones, high sound quality, good fit, good price and easy to use."
1,"I use these headphones to work out. I have zero issues connecting (unlike some I've had in the past). The sound is actually quite good -- once you get them on correctly (and that wasn't super easy to figure out for me -- I suppose some people it would be no problem.). It's not noise cancelling, but I am amazed at how much it does cancel, and still keep me aware of what's going on around me during workouts. They are not the ones  want for really getting into my music, but they are perfect for working out."
1,This is my first set of wireless headphones and think I hit a grand slam; love me headset and makes my workouts so much more enjoyable!
1,Good
1,"You get a lot for a great price. Sound is good. Blue tooth reception is ok. Phone in my pocket it's choppy but if I hold it, solid connection."
1,Excelent sound. Great quality
1,"I liked the package it was very well packaged, and it looks like a higher quality headphone"
0,"This earbud will not hold in ear, despite changing earbud cover to small, it still won't stay. I suspect there is faulty design that prevents it from having a tight fit in external ear."
1,"I love my SENSO Bluetooth headphones they are exactly what I was hoping for, they were super easy to connect via Bluetooth to my phone, the sound quality is great and loud, and the ear buds are comfortable. Glad I made the decision to purchase these."
1,Love the product! Has great sound and I got it extremely fast! Awesome!!
1,👍👍👍👍👍..as of now I don't see any issues of senso. It is very  convenient to used.<br /><br />Thank you..
0,"Disappointing headphones. Cannot hold a charge. Light stays on all the time when not charging as well, so battery drains when not in use and disconnected. Would recommend trying something else.<br /><br />EDIT: Customer service sent me a replacement pair of headphones, so service is excellent. But will evaluate the second pair and see how this one fares.<br /><br />EDIT 2: Second pair didn't last long either. Not real rugged. They just don't last."
1,"These work great.  I did have an issue with them but after contacting the seller, i was given a fix to try and it worked.<br /><br />Fast shipping, item as promised and top notch customer service.<br /><br />I will be a repeat customer."
1,"Just barely got these earbuds so I cannot vouch for warranty, battery life, or durability yet.  However, I just had to write a review for probably the most important quality for earphones -- sound quality.  Once I got these buds paired with my phone and started up my Spotify account, I was blown away.  At about 1/3 volume, these headphones were crystal clear.  At 1/2 volume, they were definitely loud enough.  And the bass, WOW.  I will consider adding to this review after I have used them for a longer period of time and will update the review to take into consideration the durability and battery life, but I am certainly satisfied today with this purchase.  Lots of extras and great sound.<br /><br />Time will tell if this was a good buy."
1,"This is my 1st week with the product.  I have taken them on (4) 5mile runs, used them for 6 consecutive hours of yard work,  and have sweated on the like Niagara falls. So far they have not failed me.the ear hook does seem a little flimsy, but other then than no issues."
1,Great sound quality and comfort.<br />Only complaint is that the mic is positioned in a way that it's not really useful. The other party can not really hear my voice clearly or loudly enough.
0,"This is the first Amazon review I’ve written but I felt compelled to warn people to stay away. I bought these headphones because I just wanted something to use for an hour a day when I work out. Evidently that’s a hard sell. When you start to sweat, the sound cuts in and out. After 6 months, they totally died. I was still under warranty, so they sent me a new pair. Those ones died shortly after too. Such a disappointment and these 5 star reviews are very deceiving. With two failed pairs in a year, I just can’t see how they are accurate."
0,Unhappy with this product I bought. Headphones worked great when I first received them. Then stopped working after 2 months. Unhappy with amazon allowing this seller to sell products that don’t work. Would not recommend.
1,Super great sound quality sucky reception if I have it in my back pocket it stutters and pauses every 20 seconds even less but if the phones in front of me on my chest Flawless amazing so unless you're putting it in an armband not worth it don't buy it but it's good if you've got nothing like today I forgot my speaker and I found these in the bottom of my glove box so it's better than nothing and you can't argue the price
1,"These ear buds are a pleasant surprise! Easy to use, great case and the sound is excellent. Being a Bose snob these buds are fantastic for working out. Especially if you sweat like me. The left bud keeps wanting to slide out of my ear. That’s why I didn’t rate them 5 star. Still I’m impressed!"
1,Sound is great and can get very loud. Very easy to use and good at noise cancelling as well. Stays charged very well.
1,Great wireless Bluetooth headphones. I use with my iPhone at the gym and they work great.
0,Poor quality Product worked well for one month then power button broke and cannot turn back on.  &#34;Conveniently&#34; 5 days after the return window closed
1,Great headphones. Use them every day and they charge well and hold its charge. Great sound and fit really well.
0,"To Whom It May Concern,<br /><br />I received these headphones and did not expect anything spectacular due to its price. After using it for a week, it already has problems. When placed in my ears, it seems to never fully sync with my phone. My music will stutter here and there, and the connection from headphones to phone is weak. It's annoying working out and having my music stop and play continuously.<br /><br />Could anyone connect me with their customer service team? I could not find anything online. I am not angry, and would love to remove this review because the sound is great, but I am hoping to receive some kind of compensation in regards to its warranty.<br /><br />Thanks"
1,Fits nicely. No problems with popping off. The sound isn't too bad either. But it could use just a bit more bass. And I wish the bluetooth could reach a little further. But overall not too bad.
1,Very loud base.  It's alright for the price
0,There must be a manufacturing defect - the blue tooth connection goes in and out  - when the left earbud wire is moved it loses sound.  I'm sending them back
1,Excellent battery life. Great sound. I really enjoy not having to connect a wire to my phone. Had an issue after 4 months of use where the main power button somehow got stuck and wouldn't power on. Contacted the company. Within a few days they sent out a replacement set. You can't ask for better customer service than that! They have gained a loyal customer should I need any of their products in the future!
1,"The headphones are decent enough. OK sound quality, but given the price I wasn't expecting anything incredible. The only issue is that when the headphones are at a low battery percentage, an annoying voice will repeatedly say that the battery is low, making them unusable. A bit annoying, but overall a decent set of headphones."
1,"I never expected wireless headphones to sound so good!  I'm super happy with these, and I'm even happier with all the little additions...long charging cord with multiple connectors, short cord for desktop charging, extra ear pieces and mostly the great little case to carry them all in.  Super happy!"
0,"Great while they lasted. I've had about 3.5 months, charged last night, but won't turn on. Hard to find the warranty information thru Amz."
0,They lasted six months for me but it was a great six months the sound quality was great.
1,"I bought a pair for my wife. These headphones  sound the same, may be even a little better than my beats. These are the headphones that I will buy when my beats stop working.<br />It comes in a really nice box . The headphones also come a car charger with two outputs  and two cables<br /><br />Update<br />I  bought three pairs of them. The first pair stopped working after my wife use it in an Aqua Aerobics class. These headphones are listed as IPX7, but the ones that mi wife was wearing didn't resist a splash. She didn't swim with them.  I better be careful with the remaining two pairs and keep them out of the water.<br />These headphones are not IPX7."
1,"Just ordered my second pair.  Perfect for the gym, or around the house."
1,Love these!!!  Comfortable and great sound...
1,I love it. The sound quality is very good and it's easy to use
0,"I don't know if it's common, but my left headphones have buzzing noise. It's not noticeable during the day. But extremely annoying and noticeable at night."
1,Great value for price.  Sound is good and headphones are comfortable to wear. No issues with connectivity.  Have not tested waterproof claims yet.
1,I only just starting using them but I connected them to my cell phone easily. They work fine and it sure is nice to not have a wire hooked directly to my cell phone so that I can listen to music. Thanks for a great product!
0,not fit to the ear
1,"These are surprisingly good bluetooth headphones.  They pair easily and fit my ears very well.  Sound is good but not audiophile but that is not what I got them for. I find it hard to believe that they can sell these for less than $40.  Highly recommend these for anyone wanting bluetooth ear buds for exercising or casual listening.  They stay connected up to thirty feet from your device. And they include 2 charging cables (one has a convertible end for iPhones or miniusb), a dual car charger and really nice case."
1,"I like them, they're loud and I use them to workout in the pool....... Head above water. Great Deal."
1,Came with an awesome multi-charger for both iphone and headphones! Love these! Bought 2 of them!
1,Works good good distance
1,The buds have been very good and reliable. They were easy to learn to operate.
1,Grandson loves them!!
1,I was skeptical about the fitting of the headphones. I'm very happy with the results. Fits well and very pleased with them in constant use.
1,"Sound quality is great. Easy to setup. Use almost everyday. Only downside is some times the wrap around ear part doesn't stay snug against my ear. This isn't a big issue, just something I noticed."
0,"I have to hold my phone directly next to these headphones to make them work, so I never use them. Would not recommend."
1,"This is my 2nd pair of Senso headphones.  My first pair finally fell apart at the charging port. I use them daily in construction and have passed the word to some of my co workers of how good these headphones are for the money. They are durable, sound very good, fit well and the battery life blows away wireless headphones that cost much more. Try these out. You will not be disappointed."
1,Great product
1,"I purchased these for work. I work in a fairly noisy environment. I’ve used these 6 to 8 hours a day for the past three days, sound quality is good as is battery life. I have Bose at home and in comparison these do well. In a world where your expensive earbuds / headphones could get trashed easily, these are a great alternative. I definitely recommend them."
1,"Fantastic Deal for Bluetooth Headset. Easy to use, comfortable, I use them when I'm on my elliptical everyday. Right from the box they lasted 6 days before I had to recharge them!"
0,They won't stay in my ears when running.  They fell off within the first two minutes.
1,Excellent earbuds! I used it right away to workout at the gym and I am extremely satisfied. It is comparable to the Dr. Dre Beats wireless earbuds. It kept me in the zone and focus for my workouts. I have made an excellent choice of purchase and have no complaints. Thank you!
1,"Wow, i was very skeptical about this headphones, but they are just amazing. The hraphone is loud and has devent bass."
0,"Like other reviews have mentioned the product includes a TON of accessories for the price, but its not useful because the base product was awful.<br /><br />With most headphones there is a little bit of wind noise but these sound like someone has a leaf blower next to your ear. On top of that after an hour run I took out the headphones and my ears ached for several hours after taking them out. I may have had a defective product because the connectivity was awful as well."
1,Works as expected! Easy to use and stays in place during walks
1,"I was impressed by the packaging enough to give a 5 star rating before I had even put these on! Seriously, the headphones are shipped in their own zip-up carrying case (pleasant surprise) in a solid box that cannot be easily crushed. There are plenty of earbud options: large, medium and small rubber buds and even some foam buds that closely resemble earplugs. The charger is a double USB 12V car charger with a long cord that is interchangeable so you have the option to charge your headphones or any Samsung or iphone - with just the one cord. The headphones came charged and ready.  Connecting to Bluetooth was a sinche and syncing to my iPhone was simple. I put them on and was shocked at the Bose-like sound quality and comfort. I consider myself some what of an audiophile finding quality headphones is a challenge. These are quality headphones that produce a full, tonal rich sound and are comfortable to wear. My only complaint is that there is no way to adjust the framework of the headphones to accommodate different sized ears. They are not going to fall out on run or even doing jumping jacks for that matter, but I would like the frame to fit more snug to my ears, or my wife's when she uses them. I clearly cannot say enough good here. I am happy with the purchase."
1,I weight train so no running but they stay on my ears really well and do not get in the way. I like the bass and sound quality. If these die after a year or so I would get a new pair of the same ones
1,"Great wireless headphones, amazing price! They were very easy to setup and connected to my smart phone and smart watch without issues.<br /><br />It's worth mentioning that since the power and volume controls are on the right earpiece and I was wearing my smart watch on my left wrist, I initially had some connectivity issues while on a run. Switching the watch to my right wrist solved the issue immediately, as our bodies can cause minor electromagnetic interference. So if you're having issues with the sound cutting out constantly, ensuring your device is on the right side will likely fix that!"
0,These ear buds sound fine but I have been through 3 pairs that all failed due to sweat. Find a better brand.
0,"They're much bigger than I anticipated.<br />Since they're at an angle, they go into the ears in an odd position.<br /><br />I got these for listening to meditation while I sleep, but they're much too big for me to sleep on my side with them in my ears."
0,Nice design but left ear bud is not as loud as the right. Also like other reviews there is a slight buzzing electrical sound in left bud. Returning. Will try a different brand.
1,Amazing!
1,"love these, great for working out"
1,Excellent
1,"Really nice for the price. I've been wanting Bluetooth headphones for the gym, but the price of most on the market put me off of them. I haven't actually been to the gym with them yet, but I've been listening to an audio book as I do housework, and they stay in nicely."
1,"Delivery was excellent, sound quality is awesome, great fit also"
1,"Great sound, perfect length cord, even comes with a car charger!  Great product at a great price."
1,Great product after 3 weeks of use and also great customer service.
1,Just received my Senso Bluetooth headphones. I have been able to use them only once but so far they are everything that I had hoped they would be. the sound is excellent and the distance from my device is good. I am old school as far as my phone (it is a flip phone) but I use the headphones with my ipod and my Kindle and they connect perfectly.
1,"I received these at least a day early! I have gone through at least 5 different earbuds in the last couple years because they end up shorting from sweating. I figured I need to spend a little more for better quality. These are great! The best quality yet. They feel more durable than my others. Super easy to pair, fit perfect. They do not fall out and the sound it clear and loud! Super happy with this purchase."
0,Stopped working within a month of purchase.
1,"Sound quality is good.  Fit is not bad, I like the over the ear ones personally so not a lot of choices for those but they fit pretty well for ones that do not have an adjustment to them as some do.  No issues pairing, and easy to understand controls.  Did have headphones go unresponsive after 2 months, but Tekatron help was very responsive and took care of the issue immediately, great customer support.  Overall good headphones for budget conscious person.<br /><br />Originally was happy with these but after having them replaced now under warranty twice over 8 months, the third pair has gone out as well and I am pretty convinced that they don't hold up to sweat overly well.  The company this time around responded and suggested a &#34;reset&#34; procedure which does nothing when the headphones won't even charge anymore or turn on period, I tried to explain that but followed the procedure anyways to no luck of course.  Now they just won't respond to my emails anymore and I will find another brand to buy.  Maybe for the price it is fair to only get so many replacements under warranty, but just be aware that seems to be the case."
1,"Great depth of sound and ease of use.  After debating over getting Beats for a while, I found these to be just as good at a fraction of the cost.  I would highly recommend these!  The only downfall is that the part that fits over the ear is not adjustable.  It will keep them from falling off your ears, but won't keep them glued to your head if you decide to do high intensity exercise."
1,This is a Christmas gift
1,"Hey folks, received the headphones the other day, and I love them. They are a perfect fit for my ears, can't tell that I have them in. The volume quality is outstanding. And the stereo is amazing. The placement of the buttons are conveniently located and easy to use. The range is fantastic. I sometimes leave my Fire IN MY OFFICE WHILE I AM IN THE KITCHEN FIXING A MEAL AND THERE IS NO (AND I MEAN NO) degradation of sound quality. GREAT JOB. I know I will get many hours of good use from these. Thanks!"
1,Awesome for the gym
1,"I purchased these to hear turn by turn GPS directions while driving my motorcycle, they work perfectly and can be heard over the exhaust and without wind noise."
1,I really enjoy these headphones. They sound great and I love the earplug earbuds. They are made out of earplug material and work very well.
1,"Was not sure I would like these at first, but quickly fell in love with them! My only complaint is sometimes they don't connect right away so I accidentally play my music out loud (have this issue mostly with the Pandora app on my iPhone). Other than that they have been great!"
1,"This product for this price is just amazing! What's more amazing is the customer service they have.<br />So, no wonder this amazing product with such amazing customer service has found a place in Amazon!<br />Seriously, I bought a two headsets recently - one for me and one for my son - to make sure we don't<br />bother each other with loud TV. The quality of sound is just great. It can match many of the expensive<br />headsets in the market. The battery life is great. You can watch almost two full length movies. Charging<br />is very fast. Range of Bluetooth allows me to go to bathroom to take  leak without having to reconnect.<br />But what I was most happy about was their prompt customer service. One night I found it was not<br />connecting to Bluetooh transmitter of my TV. I was going to try out a few things, but I sent an email<br />to their customer service, just in case. They responded back within 4 hours. I was given some instructions<br />to try out. I tried but couldn't get Bluetooth to work and let them know about it. Within the same day, they<br />sent me mail telling me not to worry because I was covered by their one year warranty and then, I got<br />a mail saying that they have already shipped me a new one! I'm waiting for the new one to arrive but,<br />couldn't wait to write this review because I have to be honest for once and say, &#34;Hey, this is a great product and<br />what's more, their service is even better!&#34;"
0,"Mine started losing sound in one side and plastic cover fell of after a week and now had this for bout a month now and I ain't satisfied with this thing ... expected better , I can't even turn it on now so I'm stuck with broken earbuds"
1,Very good earphones. Great quality and stay in the war during a run
0,"Just quit working. Won’t turn on and won’t won’t light up when they charge. I only use these when I run on the treadmill which isn’t often, probably used 90 days in the last 8 months."
1,easy to use. Sounds great for the money
1,"just got it a few days ago, but so far I love the design and they way they feel... Awesome for running or any kind of activity you want your buds to stay in."
0,"They work for a short period of time, then the blue tooth connection keeps dropping out.  The only fix is to reset them as recommended by the manufacturer.  Gets annoying real quick.  Manufacturer wouldn't allow a refund after 30 days."
1,Excellent value overall for what you get.
1,"I've used these almost every day for nearly two years. They work very well, with good battery life."
0,"I agree with previous reviewers. I have bought these headphones numerous times since I have a tendency to lose. However, the pair I most recently received is NOT the same. The main headphone part is now hollow, cheap plastic as opposed to the more comfortable rubber from all previous pairs.<br /><br />Furthermore, when turning on/off, the voice in the headphones is extremely loud and that doesn’t seem to be able to be adjusted. Pretty disappointing in this pair and won’t be ordering again when I do eventually lose (which may happen sooner than later for a reason)."
1,"The headphones have a good quality sound. It does have a little bit more based in trouble, which is not always a bad thing. I'm very happy with this purchase<br /><br />Update<br />After listening to these for a week I am a little disappointed. The headphones cut in/out about 1x per minute. I know these are not the top of the line, but I think it is a fair expectation that they will not &#34;skip&#34; by cutting in/out."
0,It cannot be opened after a few times' use. Bad quality!!!
1,"These had easy access buttons, and were easy to use, but I wanted them to wear while running and I couldn't get them to stay in my ears for anything. During a half hour run I probably had to adjust them six times. Very annoying. They also were more noise cancelling than I wanted."
1,"After just a few days, I am absolutely Amazed by the sound quality!<br />After about 10 days I have but one problem...Keeping them in My Ears"
1,The stereo is what I noticed first and base is nice also .
0,I WAS ALLSET TO WRITE A GLOWING REVIEW BUT THE SHODDY QUALITY OF THEBCHARGING PORT LET ME DOWN AFTER ONLY 2 CYCLES. WE ALL HAVE GIZMOS THAT ARE RECHARGED BY THESE TINY PORTS WHERE WE PLUG OUR GIZMO INTO OUR COMPUTERS SO THAT WE CAN SUCK UP A FRESH CHARGE.THE PORT ON MY HEADPHONES DEFORMED BADLY AFTER ONLY 2 CYCLES RENDERING MY HEADPHONES USELESS. ANOTHER CONTRIBUTION FOR THE NEAREST LANDFILL.IT'S ALL MY FAULT FOR EXPECTINE TOO MUCH FROM THIS $20 PIECE OF JUNK.
1,"These ear buds are excellent.  I use them daily for my gym routine.  I mentioned to another person about them who had just bought another brand and paid a lot of money, how much I liked them he was very upset of the price he paid and the Senso headphones sounded just as good, fit great and the price...  Excellent set..."
1,I have really small ears and these fit perfectly.
1,confusing doesn't always pair together with my I phone
1,Previously ordered a set for myself<br />Ordered again as a gift
1,I look cool with them on and the sound is great..
1,"These are easy to pair and work great for the gym! The package includes SO much for the great price: cigarette lighter dual USB adapter, 2 charging cables, carrying case for earbuds, and multiple sizes of ear buds to fit your ears correctly. I'm so glad I purchased these!"
1,"Dog chewed up the first pair, and back for a second.  Comfortable, stable within ear during exercise, and excellent battery longevity.<br /><br />Audio quality is so-so as there is too much bass (not a flat response), however at this price point no complaint, nor can I even get upset at the dog.  She's a Boston Terrier, therefore infallible."
0,Have had less than 5 months! Purchased after reading great reviews. Great at first then terrible reception. The big disappointment is that they only support the item for 1 month. This forces you to pay extra for extended warranty. I don’t think more than 5 months is too much to expect for decent performance.
1,So far so good with these headphones. Pretty good sound and battery life. The accessory pack and carrying case are handy too.<br /><br />I’ve had these for a little over a year and the battery life has dropped to about 2 hrs.
1,"Husband loves these. Uses them in our workout room and feel good and fit good."""
0,"The sound quality was like static. Contacted the company to let them know, and they said that maybe it will work better with more use. Then they stopped working all together. All within two months.<br /><br />Update, 1/15/20:<br />After being contacted by SENSO here on amazon, I spent the last few weeks having an email back-and-forth with them, they ultimately gave me a 5% off code if I want to purchase something again. Spoiler, I won't."
0,My experience has been that these earbuds are terrible. They won't connect to my Apple Watch. Connected to my phone they cut out constantly. And the audio is so bass heavy and distorted that I can't even listen to them without EQ'ing the heck out of the signal. My pair is going in the trash.
1,"Love these headphones...sound great, pairs well, stays charged for great amount of time."
0,Stopped working. Only 4 months of use. Wear them for finning in the am - 1-3 miles. That's it. : (
1,"Loved this purchase. Teenagers are hard to please when it comes to earphones, but my son loves these. With 2 others coming up behind him, we will definitely order again."
0,"Worked for one day, then the left bud stopped working altogether."
0,30$?! Broke after 2 weeks just died. I would change my review in exchange for a replacement.
1,"Bought 3 sets of wireless earbuds. Good quality and sound for the price. Came w car charger, as well as a nice compact carrying case for everything."
1,"Sounds quality and fit of the earbuds is really good.  The wire seems to get twisted pretty easily.  If not for that, I'd give them five stars."
1,"Love these headphones. Had them for about 4 months before they were either lost or stolen. Great sound quality, and the maximum volume is quite loud, even for a loud teenager. For commuting and exercise, you won't find a more versatile pair of headphones. Comes with a few earbud choices, I prefer the expanding foam style. Fit is comfortable and adjustable. Only issue is the carrying case does not have a clip or other means to affix it to a backpack, etc. Overall the best value headphones I've found."
1,Got these for my son for his birthday. He absolutely love's them. Sounder great! Build quality is above average and battery lasts a good solid 8 hours of constant use. And...I don't have to worry if he breaks them or they end up MIA.. If they do.. I'm only out $30.. not $200 if they were Beats..
1,Love these.. Have had them for some time
1,Works great! Paired with multiple apple computers and Android phone.
1,"The wire between the 2 headphones is a little long, but other than that I love these headphones."
0,They worked great for 2 1/2 months and have now stopped working. The return window was only one month.
1,Great set of earbuds. Good bass. Battery life can be better . I
0,Bought a pair about 3 years ago and loved them. Purchased a 2nd pair last fall and the ear loop is  NOT FORMED!!  One bends them around the are but about 3 minutes into run the  ear loop loosens and they pull off the ear.<br /><br />Total waste for running...wish I had returned them. Just them them away
1,"Very surprised by these ear buds, I was looking into beats, jaybird x2-x3 but I couldn't justify the price I saw these and read the reviews so I gave them a whirl and am thankful that I got them, sounds great, fit well, highly recommend these"
1,"Easy to operate. Clear, crisp sound. Lightweight and comfortable. These are what I was looking for at a reasonable price."
1,I've wanted a pair of wireless ear buds for a long time. I've purchased 2 different pairs in the past but could not get them to sync to my phone.  But thought I would try again with the SENSO Bluetooth wireless headphones and I had them synced to my phone in less than 5 minutes and I love them!!  Thank you.
1,Got these and they worked great for about 8 months- then they quit charging. Called them and they replaced them for free with a new pair which are working great. Just a note- there were a few times when they wouldn’t connect to my phone. I just had to go to settings and “forget” the device and then reconnect. This solved the problem.
1,"Got these for working out at the gym, my corded earbuds keep getting caught on stuff... These sound great, and are much safer to boot."
1,Best bang for your buck! You can't go wrong with this headphone. The music sounds crisp and clear and Bluetooth to boot. No more tangled wires to get in the way when running or working out. I highly recommend!
1,This is my 2nd order for this headset. I purchased my last set for my wife. Overall quality is fantastic and the blue range is such that I haven't yet found it's limit.
1,"Fast delivery, great product....did not need bulky $300 headphones because this does the job...great buy especially for the money...."
1,The sound is very consistent and comfortable on the ears.
1,100% recommended. Easy to use and very good price!
1,Great at work and the gym.
1,Work great! Exactly what I was looking for.
1,So far these work great.  Haven't used them very long but am very impressed with their quality.
1,"I just used this today for my run/walk and really loved them! They stayed in my ears and the sound is excellent. As a matter of fact, I the sound was so good, I needed the volume to go down another notch or two but it was already at its lowest. I use it with my IPhone 6 and it paired without any issues. Unlike the Skech earphones I have and although I liked them because they do not go inside the ear, I always had to have my music on before pairing. Odd. These are a wonderful value, you get a hard case, 3 different sized tips (I ended up switching to medium), a short charging cord, a long one, a car adapter, and 2 cord control clips! I compared these to others that were more expensive, and alomost ordered a different brand because it had the cord clip, then I checked this one again and saw that it was included so based onthe feedback, I made the purchase. I have never liked in ear buds, but I am a beginning runner and needed something comfortable and reliable. These fit the bill so far. The around the ear clips seem flimsy at first, but it helps to adjust them based on your needs, mine after to work with my glasses and once I got them set, they were good. I like the clip for the cord because I can cinch the cord up if I don't want it flopping on my neck. Can I just repeat how excellent the sound is!! Be extra careful though, because when they say noise canceling, they mean it. I recommend without reservation! (That's just my doggie in the pic, he likes to sit on my desk...lol)"
1,"Awesome sounds quality. Great quick function buttons on headset. Overall definitely worth the money. Great product thank you guys! Not to mention the suburb customer service of the Senso Support Team. Six months after I purchased these awesome Headphones they suddenly stopped powering on, the blue light indicated that the unit had a full charge and I still could not get the headphones to turn on. So I reached out to customer service via emailed and I had a response within minutes, I tried to troubleshoot the issue and preform a factory reset but still was unsuccessful, it turns out I was covered with a 1-year warranty and they sent me out a new pair the same day. I could not be happier with the end result."
1,"I don't use headphones very often and didn't want to spend $100+ but I knew I wanted Bluetooth.  I am VERY pleased.  I read a lot of reviews on Amazon before deciding.  While there were similar headphones available in this price range, what made me decide on these was the little case that came with them.  It's small and fits the headphones and extra ear cushions perfectly.  I used them listen to music and watch movies/television on my iPad.  They were perfect!"
1,These work well wear them every time I work out cord is not off balanced/ doesn’t get in the way while performing exercises.
1,"I've been using it since a month and sometimes I think that are really great, better than my skullcandy, but when I use in my daily exercises sometimes they lose connections or had some kind of lag."
1,"Really like these Bluetooth headphones! They arrived with a charge so I could use them right away and the accessory pack was above and beyond what I expected for the price.  Sounds is good, I’ve never owned Beats or Bose but for running I think these sound great and stay on through a lot of sweat."
1,Great product
1,"Phenomenal.  I'll never buy the high-priced headsets again.  These sound just as good at the three $125+ headsets I bought previously.  (All of which stopped working, by the way.)"
1,These are my favorite Headphones for the gym. Great sound very comfortable. Can’t beat the price.
1,I bought these for my wife and she loves them.  She uses them to work out and says they don't fall off and have great sound.
0,"I really wanted to like these earbuds. Good price, highly rated, good packaging , but... lots of wind noise. I bought replacement tips but it didn’t help much. When I finally learned to tolerate the noise, they just died - won’t charge or turn on. You get what you pay for."
1,I really can't complain. These are solid in sound and design. They are comfortable and deliver on every point they claim. I could buy 10 of these for the price of some other higher end headphones. Why spend the extra on a name? These will work just as well and save you some cash in the process. Way to represent senso. Very pleased.
1,"These headphones are great! The call quality is ok not great but good enough. As far as sound for media, I'm impressed. The battery life is on the money. I bought a pair for my wife."
0,"I have owned three of these earbuds. The first lasted for several months and then one side stopped working. I thought they were pretty good for the price, so I ordered them again, thinking maybe it was just something I did that caused one side to go out. The second pair would not charge or turn on when I received them, so I exchanged them with Amazon. The third pair worked fine for about four uses and then the ON/PLAY button got stuck and will not pop back out, rendering them useless (unfortunately just after the return window was up). THESE ARE LOW QUALITY earbuds with poor quality control. They would be worth the price if they were more reliable and lasted. I would suggest Anker earbuds in this price range instead (similar sound, much better range, longer battery life and have lasted me several months of daily use so far)."
1,So far the best wireless headphones I have tried at this price level
1,I've only used the senso earbuds once but I like them. The sound to me isn't quite as described but still really good. I only gave 4 stars because I don't know about the battery life yet.
1,Awesome !! Better than expected. The sound quality is great and the fit is perfect. I would recommend these to anyone.
1,Works exactly like the reviews said it would. Great gift!!
0,"Started off as a decent affordable pair of headphones. After a little more than a year, here are all the things broken:<br /><br />- Audio only out of right ear. Nothing in left.<br />- Bluetooth drops connections all the time. Sometimes mid song or video.<br />- Bluetooth sometimes says it’s connected, but it’s not. Have to power cycle it an try again. Occasionally takes many cycles to pair."
0,I bought this headphones thinking that the hook around the ears would stop them from popping out during my workout.  I couldn't even go for a walk with them in without them falling off.  Very flimsy and loose for people with small ears.  They also kept disconnecting from my phone it I was actually use them.  So if I received a call I would have to put them on hold while I figured out how to get my headset connected.  This was a let down for me.
1,Bought them in April and 5 months into it... it won't charge anymore.. very disappointed. Otherwise love the headphones while it lasted.<br />Update: 10/12: Called the seller and they sent a replacement immediately. Quite happy about that. Hopefully this time it will last longer. Fingers crossed!<br />Update: 11/19: The second set didn't last long either. Won't charge anymore :(
1,"I have tried many different brands of headphones that were twice the cost of my SENSO headphones and I can say without a doubt that my SENSO's have been the best! Sound is great, love the ease of use answering calls, pausing music with the touch of a button!<br />Was a little worried about customer service when I did have an issue, but was pleasantly surprised at the extremely rapid response and resolution to my issue. Guaranteed I will be coming back to SENSO for my next set of headphones."
1,Great for the gym.
1,"I can't wait to use these at the gym! I was skeptical at first because I used them from the box, assuming they were at full charge because they turned on—they kept skipping until they finally died. I charged them for about an hour. PERFECT. OH MY GOODNESS, THE SOUND IS AMAZING THE BASS COMES THROUGH NICE AND THOUGH YOU CAN STILL HEAR THINGS IN SURROUNDING, THE SOUND QUALITY IS SO GREAT, ALL SURROUNDING SOUNDS ARE INAUDIBLE. IM SO GLAD I TOOK A CHANCE ON THESE. I just hope they last me and speakers don't blow out or anything else. YAAAAAA IM ACTUALLY MOTIVATED TO GO TO THE GYM EVEN MORE. Will buy again! **ALSO, the packaging and &#34;extras&#34; they give you make owning these that much better :)"
1,Love them. My son bought a pair and said they were just as good as his old beats. So I got a pair also cause I need to play music while I work!
1,good for the money
1,I gifted this headphone to my friend. He was so amazed by the quality and especially sports purpose. I proudly recommend this to anyone who is really looking to buy gym/sports wireless headset.
1,"Incredible ear buds for the price! They sounds great, fit perfect and the battery lasts forever! I love that it speaks when they are turned on and off, letting you know they are completely off. The also speak to let you know when a call is coming in. Overall I love these!"
1,"As advertised, decent bass, handy controls"
1,"The sound is pretty good, but it doesn't fit my ear properly and need to return it."
1,"Terrific pair of headphones.  They sound great and are really comfortable to wear.  The packaging is compact and the zippered storage case is small and lightweight.  I plan on purchasing a second pair for my wife to use while we workout and go for walks.  The fact that they come with a one year warranty is commendable.  The additional items that are included in the order was a nice surprise, especially the cord that has the USB connector on one end and the convertible connector on the other end (iphone or Samsung type).  Since this review is based on a short ownership time, I will re-evaluate this product after several months of usage, but as it stands now, I highly recommend these."
1,"I recently received my new Senso headphones and can actually say, I love them.  I wanted something that wouldn't fall off my ears when working out and these are perfect, they stay in place.  The sound is excellent.  So far, so good.  Definitely recommend them."
1,"I liked them, a little uncomfortable and I did get complaints of it being hard to understand me but I can’t be sure if it was the headphones fault on that. But overall I was happy with them, they sound great. But they stopped charging after a couple weeks rendering them useless. So I reached out to the manufacturer since they had asked me how I liked them. And they let me return them and offered me 10%(which is only a couple bucks) if I wanted to buy another pair. But it left a bad taste in my mouth and with them being uncomfortable I went with a different set of headphone"
1,"Best headphones at the price, and I would also say at a much more expensive price point too. I have Jaybirds and Plantronics as well. I've have other pairs before those, but these are great! Great sound, great look and great feel!"
1,These headphones are good quality for the price!!
0,"After my old pair broke I decided to get a new pair of Bluetooth headphones and after a reading a few reviews I settled on this one. Ordering was easy, shipping was fast, and I was exited. But all it took was 30 to hate these things. The one thing I need to talk about it audio quality. The quality is attrociouse. It sounds like the sound is being filtered by a potato. I know at this low of a price point I shouldn't expect good audio quality but my old pair that sold for $27 had audio quality 50x better than these. It was cold, crisp, and a pleasure to listen to. But these.... the sound resembles that of when your underwater and you scream. It's so murky and muddy it hurts. I think there's a high possibility mine are defective as no company should get away with something this bad but a fair warning to everyone looking into these. GO ELSEWHERE"
0,"I read a lot of reviews prior to purchasing this item, none of them addressed the problem that because of the shape, if you run outside all you hear is the wind and you have to put the volume to the max to actually hear the music over the wind.<br /><br /> I really wanted to like this item so I gave it several opportunities and ran several times in different wind conditions and all I could hear was the wind noise created by the shape.<br /><br /> We bought two sets, one for me and one for my girlfriend my girlfriend's ears are small and the rubber piece is not adjustable so the rubber piece does not sit on top of her ear and because the weight of the earphone and not being supported by the rubber piece they continuously fell out.<br /><br /> I do not recommend this item if you run outside in any kind of wind conditions or if your ears are small ."
1,Great for the price.  They sync right up.  Bass reflex isn't the greatest but overall decent sounding.  Easy to use for making and receiving phone calls.
1,"These are awesome!  Works great during workouts, plus the sound is amazingly clear!"
1,"The sound is great, easy to setup, price is ok."
1,I've been using these everyday for about 2 weeks and no problems.  I am very happy with this purchase.
1,6 months later and these things are still going as strong as ever! Battery life is still strong and the sound quality is excellent! I chose these as a cheap alternative to beats and I've been very pleased
1,"Excellent headphones.  I have a wired Bowers and Wilkins headphones and Senso outperform them. I have run wearing them and they seem to stay on our ears.  At the price point available at AMZN on June 2017, I bought additional two for my friends.  Unbeatable, if you are looking for value."
0,"The headphones worked great initially.  However, they suddenly stoped working and would not turn on, even before finishing their first charge.  At first I thought the battery was depleted.  So, I tried to charge them but got a blue light indicating that they were charged to capacity.  Still can no longer get them to turn on. When they did work, they sounded good and were comfortable."
1,"I am so pleased with the SENSO wireless earbuds!  I've tried three other sets in the past year and a half and none were of this quality nor did they last more than a few months.  I'm using these with a TV transmitter to better hear the dialogue in movies.  Pairing with my TV transmitter was easy.  The reception is clear, no static as I had with other brands.  I changed the ear buds to the smallest size and they fit comfortably for hours of movie viewing."
1,Good value for the money! Nice quality audio.
1,Connected fast and easy when i turned them on. Great quality sound. Great battery life. Durable
1,"Love it, way better than any other Bluetooth headphone I have owned. Worth the money !!!"
1,"Awesome and the sound is really good, which I am particular about. Wear these for running in the morning and listing to webcasts, etc. When running you can hear the wind blowing by but just adjust them to minimize the rustling sound. You won't eliminate it completely. Also tried to use for a conference call but was told it was difficult to hear me so check your other device volume in advance. This is only a secondary concern, as for me it was running and listening that I bought them for. 2 thumbs up.<br />Update: Feb 21st Have now used these for several Webcast/Skype meetings and the audience could here me clearly which is great..... They also warn you when the battery is low. Have found the rubber insert/cover for the charging port difficult to open but this is a minor inconvenience. Overall 5 stars"
1,Thanks you! Love the SENSO headset. Exceeded my expectations for sure.
1,It's cheap. It works... and It hasn't died yet. Has a little more bass than normal but I like that and so it doesn't bother me much.
1,"For the money, you can't go wrong - these are great.  Best headphones I have ever owned!"
1,"They're about what you expect for 30 dollar headphones. They fit well and sound ok. No complaints, really."
1,beautiful and just as good as overprice beat headset.
0,"These are just good headphones for under $40. I can run or bike with them and the sound quality is quite good. They feel sturdy and although i haven't tested this yet, claim to be weatherproof. i like the controls and it also uses a standard charger that I have in abundance from various other electronics. One of my biking buddies bought these to replace his pricey Beats and he likes them just as much.<br />The frustration with these though is the controls. The headphones are constantly making beeping sounds that I have no idea how to stop. It seems to switch to other functions randomly, and I have a lot of frustration getting it to do what it should do, which is play music.  So I spend a lot of time angrily pressing the button trying to get it to stop beeping when I just want to run and listen to some tunes."
1,Love the headphones. Sound is great. Only negative is thst yhey are uncomfortable after long periods of usage.
1,The sound is great but my problem is that I have small ears so the hook just sticks out over my ear more than it should.  I've tried to adjust it bu pulling and bending the hook in hopes it would fit my ear.  No luck. It's very inconvenient that the hook does not fit my ears and it's not adjustable.
0,"Bought them in January... Died today.... that is exactly less than 6 months of use.....<br /><br />Now the review...<br /><br />Pros: Incredible sound!, I bought these because I wanted to use for working out, I have a pair of apple AirBuds,  I did not want to lose them as they come out of my ear easily. I must say; these headphones have incredible sound, most inexpensive headsets you have to crank up the volume to get good quality sound. Well, you wont have to with these ones, lows are solid and mids and high are clear to the point that the volume can stay consistently in the mid range of the music and it will be pleasant whether you are running or at the gym or simply working with them.<br /><br />Cons: They died today... I have yet to put these thorough real hell, I am an avid runner and most of the time I run in dry weather, I do sweat, but no different than anyone who runs 5 miles at 8-9 minutes per mile.... For whatever reason, when I hit the 3 mile mark today they just stopped working and the blue light stayed on..like solid ON! I was not able to turn them on or off again... so I put them in my pocket and finished running... I placed them in my bag after getting ready and drove to work, just now as I type this review I am attempting to revive them and nothing... the light is now Solid RED! and they do not connect... SO I take they are finished... it is a shame that they did not even last 6 months...<br /><br />I guess is the last time I buy them"
1,"Very good product fot the buck, battery last super long."
0,"I have a Samsung 7.  I don't know if it is my phone or what, but, this is always cutting out no matter how charged up it is.  The only way it works is if I hold my phone up to my ear next to the headphones while I am walking, which kind of defeats the purpose.  This is my second pair.  I returned the first pair after having the same issues.  The second pair was actually worse."
1,"My Powerbeats2 died after soaked by sweat for a year. I think any BT earbuds with a volume control on the strap is susceptible to sweat damage. This one do not have an volume control that is on the strap. I hope it will last. The sound quality is ok, at least for jogging. The ear hooks are a little big and loose for me but I can manage. Pairing seems to be a little slow (comparing to the much more expensive Powerbeats2). Sometimes, I need to re-connect to make my phone switch audio to the earbuds. Overall, it works for me. Could be a great deal for the price if it lasts. I will find out."
0,"Two stars because they stay put on my ears. But I dont like that it does not block out all of the external sound. The charge does not last very long! For the price I paid, I think I would have been more satisfied."
0,"They didn't ever sound very good, and I always had to keep adjusting them around my ear to be able to hear what was playing. I would have to turn them up all the way. Also, the cable in the back kept snagging on everything, including my own skin. I tried using the little black cable clips to shorten the cable, but they were too flimsy, fell off, and couldn't be adjusted without completely redoing them.<br /><br />After a while, the right side started kept getting quieter until there was only a faint sound coming from them. I assumed I had gotten some ear wax on the speaker and tried to very gently brush them off with some paper towel. They promptly died after that."
1,These are just so so! Not really that comfortable or easy to use
0,"After using them for 2 months the headphones started cutting out, they wouldn’t turn on again until charged, even though they were fully charged. Now, after 4 months, they stopped working completely, not turning on, not connecting, but show “fully charged” when plugged in. Save yourself the hassle and buy something else!"
1,"I have comment on this SENSO bluetooth Headphones and is should be corrected by the manufacturer, There is 15 seconds distortion after connecting the device before going back to normal sounds. I have other brands of headphones like beats, sennhieser and I had never experienced like this. Sounds quality is good."
1,Love these ear buds! Bought a set for my daughter and her girl friend and they love them too. Perfect for workouts!!
1,Having the most difficult time charging the unit. The plug is difficult to stay connected.
1,"I got these headphones, because my favorites broke and that model is no longer available. I'm happy to say that I've found my new favorite. They are light, clear sounds, and easy to use with my Android."
1,"I've went through a couple of different brands of wireless sport earbuds in the last year. Ether; didn't fit, or didn't sound good at all, or you could have a conversation while wearing them, and the list goes on.<br />Then, I found these! I've only used a couple times so far, but they have nailed it! Every things on my check list was acheieved by these earbuds and I'm extremely happy! I have to turn it on half volume because they're so loud! In a good way, true crisp HD like you're in the movie theater.<br />If they had ones without the ear hooks I would get a pair for my wife (*hint hint to mfg.*) DEFINITELY RECOMEND!"
1,lets just say we liked them enuf to order another set for another vehicle!
1,Great sound for a great price.
1,and connected to iPhone bluetooth quickly. My cursory inspection and use has been good so far...time will tell about its durability.
1,I love the headphones. Best ones I've had. I love how they are over the ear and don't fall out while I am doing a rigorous exercise.
1,It's comfortable and does it's job. Really easy to set up and doesn't get in the way as I work out.
1,Great product so far and a company that seems to care about their customers
1,Really enjoy the freedom and ease of pairing. Nice carrying case and all the cables you need. I have an older pair of LG wireless but they wouldn'the pair with my Kindle. Good purchase.
1,Love these use them from music to gaming as well as call my family. For the price they are amazing!
1,"Best value for the money. High Fidelity or HD sound. Last year I became aware of bluetooth and came to buy several of them at least 5, one of them was on-the-ear and the rest were ear buds like Senso; so I have a good idea  how good this Senso  bluetooth headphone sounds. Also the hooks over the ears keep these earbuds in place when I walk around my house. Definitely a  best buy."
1,Very clear sound with great battery life. Liked the fact it came pre-charged. Fits nicely over ears. Highly recommended.
1,"Great fit, and great sound."
1,These headphones are awesome they pair easily great battery life amazing sound can't say anything bad about them. Best headphones I own. the customer service is amazing too. thanks senso
1,Comfortable and noise canceling to hear
1,"The problem I have with this earbud is the connection with a smartphone (iPhone 5s in my case). Seems the Bluetooth connection gets established between the earbud and the iPhone, but when I try to play a podcast the sound quite often comes out of the phone itself and not from the earbud. I have to reconnect the earbud with the phone a few times and eventually I get my podcasts played from the earbud. This is annoying as it is unpredictable. Seldom I get the earbud connected from the beginning, but most often I have to turn the earbud off/on multiple times. I can't figure out the rules of the game. Once the connection is established I see no more problem. The earbud can play for hours (4-5 hours at least) on a charge. But the connection problem drives me crazy and I think twice before using the earbud every time as I know I will have to wrestle with it.<br /><br />Update<br />Following the advice from the customer support (reset the earbuds and reconnect to iPhone) totally fixed the issue described above. Now the earbuds are functioning exceptionally well, and I am very satisfied now. Five stars (for their customer support too)!"
1,Like nice simple headphones
1,I bought these for my son . He likes them very much says the sound is excellent and they are mostly comfortable with the exception of the plastic earbuds could be made a little better so they fit the ear better. Sound quality and appearance and price he says they are the best headphones he has owned. I would recommend buying these Over beats I spent $129 on and could have spent only 40 to get just as good a pair of headphones if not better.
1,I bought these because the reviews said said they stayed on and low and behold they really do!  I've never had ear buds stay on until I bought these. The sound is really good also.  I would recommend these to anyone
1,I love these headphones. Comfort is essential in these. No hard plastic around my ears. Very good sound quality. Easy and very fast connection to my iPhone.
1,"These are very good headphones and met my needs very well for several reasons.  First, they stay on the ear so you con't have to worry about them falling off.  They are not tight allowing you to hear sounds around you, though they do not have the robust base of tight headphones.  Bluetooth works well, connecting easily and working for the distance advertised (30 feet).  Battery lasts a reasonable time and I have not needed to recharge for 4 hours, the most I have used them.  Connected instantly to my phone. Easy to operate when they are on, just press the button to start/stop music or answer a call.  Speaking of a phone call, they work fine.  Quality is adequate for infrequent use.  I would get a bluetooth set specifically meant for phone use if that was a key need.  They come with a nice car charger that will replace a very old and slow charger.  A great freebee.<br /><br />Bottom line, this is a fine set of headphones that will meet your needs unless you really want audiophile quality.  They work great for my walks, runs and while working around the house.  One final note, the company, SENSO, has been very active in contacting me to ensure I was satisfied.  Three e-mails to be sure I received my headphones and was happy.  While I hope I never need to take advantage of their service, I am optimistic they will be very responsive."
1,"These work well and are comfortable. They stay on when I jog and sweat, but the things behind the ears are let tight and don't hurt."
1,"These are some great sounding earbuds. I have issues with earbuds staying in my ears, and the foam tips work for me. The sound is terrific."
1,Easy set-up and headphones sound great!
1,It's only been a day but my sister really loves her headphones
1,"These headphones have very good quality of sound. The right headphone fell apart on me (literally) after a few months and the volume control button fell out, and I wasn't able to find it. I am still able to adjust the volume through my phone, so it's not that big of a deal. Overall, I'm still satisfied with the purchase."
1,Package looks great. works very well.
0,Loved them for the two times I used them for my runs. Then they died. Just completely didn't work. Here is the GOOD news... I called the 24/7 number and they are sending a new pair. So hopefully it was just a fluke.
1,I've tried a bunch of similar bluetooth earbuds in this price range. These are the only ones worth buying.
1,perfect
1,"These are the best headphones I have ever owned. When I first put them on, I was amazed at the sound quality that was coming from these little headphones. It's got a rich sound and really good bass. The price was great. The companies customer service is great. I do not regret this purchase at all."
1,"The head phones work very well for the most part. The ear hooks are okay, kind of finiky to fit around your ear at first. Some connectivity problems depending on the device that I am paired with. Overall I like them. sound quality is good and battery life is great. Charges quick too."
1,"I love my headphones, I wear them everyday for work & to play my music & talk to my friends all 8hrs."
1,"Loved the headphone , I have had them for couple of months but for some reason once charged they wouldn’t turn on. I have to commend the senso customer service , quick on answering emails and when they couldn’t resolve my issue , honored the product warranty to ship me a replacement! Not to mention the replacement arrived in 2 days! Probably the best customer service on amazon aside from a great product."
1,"These headphones are exact what I wanted. The sound is much better then the OEM earbuds. The day I received them my wife immediately demanded a pair for herself. We are very happy with them. A main reason that we went Bluetooth was working out with wired ear bud was irritating these headphones aren’t, very comfortable and they stay on while running a high intensity workout."
0,"Worked great for 2 months. Was a great accessory to my peloton and made rides so much better than using a wired headset. Battery life was even pretty impressive....<br /><br />...then, one morning, completely dead...just a dead battery right? Plugged in for a full day, and next morning still dead. Can't get it to respond at all to any inputs. Can't be revived."
0,"These headphones are just okay. I was really expecting more but they work fine. My issues have come when my phone is in my pocket, when it is farther than 5 ft away from me, or when I'm off wifi. When I bought them just a couple weeks ago for Prime Day, I saw that the ratings were outstanding but I'm not so sure.<br /><br />Update 9/22/2017 - I'm really struggling with these earphones. Some days they work and some days they don't. I called the 24/7 number the first time this happened and they said to redo the connection with my phone so I did but after a few weeks, it's doing it again."
1,"The headphones are an excellent purchase. The accessories that come with them are more than I expected and are very useful.  I have always had a trouble with in the ear earbuds as they keep falling out and this soft over the ear how old are keeps them in place perfectly.  When I charged them up and turned them on,  the Bluetooth showed up immediately  on my iPhone and my iPad and with one press on the screen they were paired.  I did not find that the bass was overbearing or dominant at all in my set,  but I do  favor acoustic music."
1,"Battery life listed at 8 hours.... not much over 4.5 - 5 so far, overall -- Okay for the price I paid."
1,Love them so far!  Packaging is great and definitely worth the price.
1,"These work well at the gym, but as soon as I'm outside for a walk with my phone I'm my pocket, they beep until I'm a half-mile from home.  They also beep in the house.  I think they're trying to pair with other devices or are responding to my phone recognizing other devices, but I can't find a way to make the beeping stop.  So annoying."
1,"These are quite good. Nicely balanced sound, comfy with good battery life. Very nice package for a good price."
0,"Although I always read a lot of reviews before purchasing a product, I don't typically write them. However, beyond frustrated with these things, I'm finally going to voice my opinion.<br /><br />First and foremost, the bluetooth connection is terrible especially outside. The sound cuts in & out every time there is a gust of wind. The same is true if I'm wearing my phone to the side or the back of my body, or if I bend at the waist. As my primary use for them is working in the yard, they're almost useless. Crouching over to garden... forget it!<br /><br />Secondly, every time I move my head the cord drags on my neck unseating the earbud a little at time so that every 5 minutes I'm readjusting them back in my ears.<br /><br />Basically the only time I have no issues with these earbuds is when I'm in the house doing very little and the phone is worn in front of my body. Then the sound is decent enough for the money. But this clearly isn't enough to recommend the product."
0,"I was satisfied overall. I had no connection issues, the buds fit comfortably in my ears, and the sound quality is fine however when talking on the phone callers always complain about the sound quality. They complain that I sound like I’m under water, mumbling , or the noise in the background is too loud. I did a reset as the seller suggested as a possible remedy but it didn’t help. Still have the same complaint from all callers."
1,Very good. very comfortable and recommended
1,"Really happy with the product. Comfortable earbuds, easy to use buttons."
1,Fantastic.
1,ExcellentR
0,"Been using it for just over an year and the earphones stopped charging.<br />So far the product has been working great, no issues with sound quality or battery life. But just after 1 year, when the warranty ends, my earphone stopped charging and completely dead. I would expect this earphone to last longer."
1,"Fantastic clear sound, good bass level, and stay on while jogging, excellent headphones with no skipping"
1,These headphones are great. They're definitely waterproof also.
0,"mine has static in the bluetooth. people on my call tell me to turn it off.<br />its exactly one month since i purchased this and there is no return or exchange button here. I will be happy to exchange this and provide another feedback if it works okay. but this one did not work for me.[[ASIN:B01G8JO5F2 SENSO Bluetooth Headphones, Best Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7 Waterproof HD Stereo Sweatproof Earbuds for Gym Running Workout 8 Hour Battery Noise Cancelling Headsets]]"
0,"The sound quality was very poor. Lot's of crackling. I was very surprised, considering all the positive reviews."
1,They work like a charm.
1,Good and cheap.. Not the world's best quality but for the price they are top notch
1,"I have used these in a few different settings so far , such as on an outside run, in the house and in the gym. I have pricier name brand wireless headphones with the hanging collar and the other wireless ear buds seem to have a farther range but they are also clunkier and more expensive. SENSO HEADPHONES are great for the price and they do the job. The controls are easy and comfortable to handle without having to take the ear buds out. The weight is nice and the wire behind the head is comfortable. The loops around my ears keep the buds from popping out on the run.<br /><br />Update 2019 : They still work well but I warn you that they may disconnect from your device and you wont be able to use them. Delete them from your device and add them again and that should help them reconnect."
0,These do not stay on the ears while running
1,"So far- so good.  I used them this morning during my exercise routine.  They fit well and stay on my ears. I like them, they are very light weight and easy to use, I didn't even know I had them on after awhile. I like the controls and being able to answer my iPhone while in use.  Also, they automatically sync with my IPhone when I turn them on and I don't have to reconnect every time to bluetooth, just turn on and I can play my music.  Don't expect them to sound like your stereo at home but they have good sound.  Cable is very flexible.<br /><br /> Instructions were clear but very tiny print, I had to get out my magnifying glass to read it.  Took me awhile to figure out that the Dual Port Charging cable didn't really apply to the product but the auto adapter and cable are a nice extra that I have put in my glove box.  I charged them before using, lets see how long a charge lasts now."
1,"I like the SENSO Bluetooth Headphones so far. I have only had them a few days. They were delivered on time, as promised, and in excellent condition and are working well with my iphone. Fingers crossed all continues to go well. Thank you!!!"
1,Love them.  I use them at work and for working out.  It's great with my new pixel phone that does not have the Jack.  I might get a second pair so I can leave one set at work.  Thank you
1,Fit comfortably and do not move or fall out during a hard workout. Great sound quality and a good battery life.
1,Great product after 3 weeks of use and also great customer service.
1,Seems to disconnect from my phone alot and has OK sound quality.
1,"I bought the Senso Active Buds to use with my new Iphone 7 during workouts. I used the Senso Buds during my intense workout at the gym yesterday. These Buds stayed on my head and were way more comfortable than the over the ear headphones I previously used. I was pleased with several advantages over my over the ear headphones; I could keep my phone in my gym bag while working out and reception was great, even as i traveled  as far as thirty to thirty five feet from my phone. I could change volume, answer calls, and change songs without ever having to touch my phone. I am extremely pleased. I am writing this review because I am very happy with my purchase, not because I got any type of benefit from doing so!"
1,Earbuds charge quickly. You get 3 sizes of earbud tips & I finally have a comfortable fit. Directions are clear & easy to follow. Syncing was a breeze& worked the first time. Love the little carrying case.
1,"With all the Bluetooth headphones to choose from,  I chose these due to the positive reviews I saw.  So far they sound good.  Fit right. For the cost I am very happy.  I will definitely purchase the SENSO brand again!"
1,Nice sound for the price. But the ear covers or what ever are very flimsy and dont do much of actually holding onto your ear. Had a pair of beats that looked juat like these it was the reason i got this pair was cuz they looked like my beats but cheaper.. all in all they do the job just wish the ear piece molded to your ear like the beats
1,Nice for the money
1,Couldn't get the earbuds to stay put. Returned product.
0,If you are moving more than 5 mph the sound of the wind completely overpowers the music since the design is so non-aerodynamic.
1,"Great for running! They stay in place the whole time.  Functions and buttons work well.  Happy for buying them, no regrets."
1,"Ive bought 3 pairs now and they are terrific especially for the price. They are superior to ones I paid 5 times more for - for sound quality, noise cancelling, and function."
1,"Best money I've spent on Bluetooth.  Sounds great.  Phone use is the first time I've been able to use a set,  all others made my speech grumbly."
1,"wonderful sound, I use it all the time when I go to the gym ."
1,Bought two headsets for my boys and they love the fit and sound quality. Great product for its price.
0,Left ear speaker goes in and out. The around the ear piece is floppy and does not keep the ear piece on your ear. Will not buy again
1,Great sound and great fit
1,Arrived on time. The buds have a great quality sound.  They stay in place while running and jumping. I am so glad I purchased these and so is my husband. He was tired of buying those neck collar devices. Thanks for an awesome product at such a great price!
1,Like
1,Bluetooth connectivity is a problem when I have my phone in my pocket and turn my head. Good battery life. Used mostly for running.
1,Perfect for the gym. Good sound quality. The cord needs to be shortened by sing an elastic band to prevent hte cord from falling voer the shoulders when biking.
1,Used with iPhone 7s+...perfect combo!
1,"They don’t hold in my ears well, but I have that problem with all headphones. They do come with multiple sized plugs"
1,"These are good for the money I paid for them.  The cover sometimes pops off one, but is easily put back on.  Sometimes when on the go, the sound cuts out if I turn my head.  Overall, they do what they are supposed to and the sound is clear.  They are an inexpensive headphone for me because I am prone to losing them.  They also sent a car clip for hands free phone use, which has come in handy."
1,Fit well and excellent sound.
0,"I bought this primarily for walking where my phone resides in my pants pocket. For some reason the headphones would not work when the phone was in my pocket. Made it about a block on my first use and turned around to get the wired ones. This was my first Bluetooth headphones purchase. Returning them asap. Unusable. Just broken up sound, choppy and kept disconnecting."
0,"I would give it a 2.5 though its not available. Great for music when its not beeping in my ear, and it doesn't always do the beeping noise. Really bad for talking on. If you live in a congested area it gets all messed up with the wireless waves.  It's always connecting or disconnecting."
1,Love these. They have great battery life and make life so much easier when I'm running!
0,In less than one month the right earbud fall off and I contact senso and they assuming that was broke by accident I rarely write review on amazon but I don’t recommend this headset to be use for working out I will prefer to buy something else
1,They are easy to set up. The base is excellent! And the a priced right. I highly recommended these headphones.<br />Today 8/12/2017 my headphones will not turn on or bind to my iPhone. Spoke with Senso and they are working with me to resolve the issue. Something about going to factory reset setting.
1,good
1,Just received these and they work great. Good sound and they connected easily.
0,Bluetooth connection is not working after two months of limited use. I tried the factory reset as well as everything the manual suggests. Will the one year warranty be honored?
1,They have great sound but don't stay in my ears real well when running. Little disappointed that way.
1,Mine stopped working after a month BUT!!! they sent me a new one and worked perfectly! Thank you!
1,"These headphones are comfortable and reliable. When I had an issue, the customer service was very quick and helpful."
1,I was pleasantly surprised about the sound quality. Good product for the price.
0,"They worked great at first, then after about 6 weeks of normal use the left speaker stopped working completely.  I could wiggle the wires a bit to make it play for a little while, then it just stopped entirely."
1,These things really work well. On my workout they might garble a few times but they seem well made and do a good job. They connect fast and are easy to use. My wife spent $150 on hers and these seen just as good. I would buy again and recommend then to anyone looking for music during their workouts.
0,"They are TOO bassy, but I got used to them. They also slip off my ears more than other bluetooth headphones have, so I'm upset because I bought these specifically so they would stay on my ear better.<br /><br />UPDATE: These headphones broke off IN MY EAR! unbelievable. That was the final straw; absolutely terrible product for the price."
1,These headphones are awesome.  They connected to my devices easily with no problems.  Sound quality is fantastic! I would definitely recommend these!!
1,"Got my order a week faster than the original delivery date. They don't fall out while running and amazing sound quality. Only problem is tried using them during a call and the person on the other end keep saying my it's windy on my end although it wasn't. But I definitely recommend, if you want a headphone that doesn't fall out while exercising with amazing sound quality. It comes with a case, extra charger and extra earbuds at different sizes."
1,"Great product, packaging and accessories"
1,"I really like my Senso bluetooth headphone, good job guys."
1,Great sound quality.  Loops need to be a little stiffer.  The earbuds move away from your ear when running.
0,"Indoors, I can easily walk around my apartment without any interruptions. But, as soon as I step out of any building, the music starts skipping, rendering them useless for running or even walking outside (I usually carry my smartphone in my pants pocket when walking, and in a small pouch at waist level when running). The only way they work is by holding the cellphone on my hand less than a foot from my head, which makes it lose the advantage of being wireless."
1,"Overall, these are good earbuds. They sound fine, they paired without issue, and battery life is good (I can get pretty much a full day of use on a single charge). I only have one complaint: They are LOUD, even at the lowest volume. It may not be an issue for everyone, but for me it makes them unusable/uncomfortable to use for much more than YouTube."
0,"I don't know why these are so popular- they almost always have a dead battery even after i just charged them the day before. After I turn them off, I see the little icon showing on my phone, and I check them--just to see that they have turned themselves back on. Probably from bumping the case or something. I do NOT like these"
1,"Fit is great, sound quality is so-so."
1,I bought these sensos for my son and he absolutely loves them. They arrived a day earlier than expected amd for the price they are unbeatable! I'm sold!!
0,"Worked great for 16 months, unable to stay connected for more than a minute before it turned itself off, without saying ""powering off"". One week later, unable to power on."
1,"Love it, I used this cery day for workout. Battery last a long time over a week 1+hr/day. Sound is awesome, very light. Highly recommended."
1,"I absolutely love these ear buds. I've had beats before and they gave out pretty quickly and the sound quality wasn't what I was looking for. In my opinion, these buds are way better than beats."
1,I was going to return them because the instructions on how to charge headphones was inaccurate. The red light did not come on indicating they were charging. I called tech support and after numerous attempts they agreed they would not charge. They were sending me a replacement set and a return postage sticker. I decided to try them a day later and they worked excellent. I listened to music for over 7 hours. I am guessing somebody charged them then returned them. The red light now comes on when charging but the blue light never luminates. I love these headphones and decided to keep the replacement set to give as a gift. Great product for the money.
1,"This is my third try and finding quality wireless headphones that are reasonably priced and I'm now done looking.. Great fit, good sound at a fantastic price. Well worth the money and highly recommend them."
1,So far they are excellent great sound and the phone was crystal clear with comfortable ear fit.
1,"They sound great, comfortable."
1,These seem to hold in my ears better than the rest.  Battery lasts about 6-8 hours and charges quickly.  Overall I'm very pleased.
1,"Fantastic wireless ear buds. The sound quality is great, and I reccommend the red foam buds that come in the set. They last for hours, and have good range. I haven't actually worn them long enough in any one use to kill the battery, but I'd say they have at least 8 hours battery life, if not more. The adjustable ear cuff is also pretty great, but it is a bit fiddly especially if you have more hair, or put your hair up.<br /><br />They are super obvious, and may not be good for work if you need something more discreet."
1,Grrat for the price. Not sound qiality of beats but a much nicer price tag. Would be better if the ear hooks had metal so you could change the shape.
1,Very satisfied
0,"Would be okay if it weren't for the fact that they have a spotty connection to devices even on a full charge. I got these on Tuesday. The sound is slightly less bass-y than Sony earbuds from Target for reference, but not bad. I can still enjoy songs when they are not skipping around and disappearing. Is the price worth it? I mean, I am free to jump around as I please while wearing them, but the spottiness does detract and pushes me to never want to purchase earbuds from Amazon again."
1,Use them in the car mostly. Easy link. Great sound.
1,"After a few weeks.. I have to say I'm fairly impressed.  Quality construction, great sound, 5 hrs of battery life, and easy connectivity.  So far they've lasted through several sweaty workouts and cycling trips.  My only issue is that they don't always feel secure in my ears.  The hooks don't actually touch my ears, so the only thing ever keeping these in place is the buds.  I do wish there were clips included.  There are little pieces,to help control excess length of cord, bit they don't work very well.<br />But overall, a great product, price is more than a bargain for the quality<br />Also includes a great case, two usb cords, a car usb poet, and includes two memory foam ear buds along with the standard rubber selection"
1,Work Great!!
1,"I bought these and truly love them! I am a long distance runner and they stayed in place, mind you i sweat a lot. I did have issues with it turning on after 4 months and i contacted the sellee and the same day i got a response and by the next day i got news one shipped to my house, they really mean when its a 1 year warranty."
0,"These headphones had a decent battery life and sound quality. However, after about a year of using them with running and cycling, they're dead! they won't turn on at all anymore, even when fully charged. Definitely disappointing they only lasted a year. Their fit could also use some improvement. I felt I was constantly needing to readjust them as I ran."
1,I love these earbuds. They work really well.
1,I absolutely LOVE my SENSO wireless headphones!  As a fitness addict I workout a lot so a ton of sweat hits these babies.  The sound quality is so clear and loud...just the way I like it when I am training!
0,Broke immediately and didn't stay in my ears
1,So far I've used it while working out and it pairs with my iwatch. I use it daily. I have nothing to compare it with being this is my first Bluetooth headphone but for the price I'm very satisfied
1,Great sounding headphones for the price. However the right side is a bit lacking in volume. Maybe a defect not sure? Would not recommend for die hard bass heads. Throws off balance.
0,"I'm highly recommend this wireless headphone. It's good and comfortable !! It holds perfectly on my ears when I workout and on active status. The sounds was just right compare to the price you can't have more complaints and it sounds having base to me. I'm satisfied with its quality. I got this headphones about few weeks ago and I've used it since then and I never want to use back the wire one when working out. It's just awesome and no line bothers! However, why I rated only two stars was because that I just took a look for the User Guide book today and realized that I am missed one of the items which is Wire Tie. It should include in the package but it does not come with. Should I return it and purchase again or I can just contact the seller/company?"
1,"Works perfectly for me! I use them to run, they never budge, the over the ear function is soft and not a hard plastic that helps keep them in place, and they deliver quality sound. Flawless so far for me."
1,"I really like these wireless headphones.  When I saw all the good reviews I decided to give them a try over some more expensive models.  Good decision.  First off, they are plenty loud with my Android phone.  Second, the fidelity is pretty excellent.  They are replacing a decent pair of wired Sony headphones.  They stay in my ear nicely, which is always a problem for me.  They have 4 different kind of buds for different size ears."
1,Superb wireless headphones.  Bass is perfect and the noise canceling is spot on.
1,Great product
1,"They sound great, but if you have a not-huge head, they look really silly on you. The range is great, the bass is GREAT, and if you use an equalizer they're just plain amazing. They don't fall out (though I never ran with them), and they lasted longer than eight hours of nonstop music playing. They also connected right away and never got disconnected. Super easy.<br /><br />BUT, you look like a crazy person if your head is too small. After the third person asked me in a concerned voice what was in my ear, I gave up on them. They stick out an entire inch from the side of my head, and the little band that's supposed to go behind your ear can hardly even reach, so it will never stay and it just hangs there all floppy. The buds stay in without it, but it looks super crazy. I love them, but they make me look like a maniac. I've bought two other sets trying to find some as good as these. No dice. At least now my husband had a great set of headphones...... And PS, I don't think I have an abnormally small head, either. Maybe it has to do with your ear anatomy.... Either way, buyer beware. These may look stupid on you."
1,Amazing sound quality
1,These are definitely the best wireless headphones I've had to date and I'll be getting another pair when/if I ever need another pair.
0,"Ordered my first pair of these headphones and they worked well for a month or so. You need to charge them pretty regularly if you use them every day for an hour or so. I would say every other day if you workout every day. After a month or so my headphones just stopped working - they would not turn on and no light came on when plugged into the charger. I contacted customer service and followed their instructions to reset, but that did not fix the issue. They sent me another pair because it is still under warranty. The same thing happened after a short usage time. Again I contacted customer services, but now they are telling me I have to send the earbuds back to them, at MY expense, so they can see for themselves what the issue is. I asked for a shipping label weeks ago, and still have not received a response. I tried countless times to reset and charge these earbuds but that did not work. They are good for the price and decent for working out - that is, when they work! There are so many companies out there that sell similar earbuds at comparable and even cheaper value that have higher ratings. I may write this company off altogether, but hoping they get back to me soon to resolve the issue."
1,"The sound quality is outstanding, clean mid range and incredible bass response. Long Battery life as advertised."
1,I've had these headphones a few days. They sound good and are sweatproof enough not to give me any problems during workouts.
1,"We love these so much we've purchased 4 sets! They are very comfortable in your ears. The piece that goes over your ear is very comfortable as well. I typically put the cord behind my neck so it's not dangling in front of me. I have used these headphones to talk on the phone and they work well for that. They are great when you are running, mowing the lawn, doing household chores etc. The little round zippered case that comes with them is so nice because you can keep everything in one spot. I can't say enough good things about them."
1,Comfortable. Convenient. Great sound. Super noise reduction effect.
1,"Great set of earphones.  Easy set up, great sound,  In fact, ordered a second set with a different earpiece."
1,"These were a really good price, and I wasn't sure how the quality would be, although the reviews were generally good.  I've been using them for several weeks now, and I really like them.  They fit me well, and they are comfortable and stay in place.  The sound quality is very good, although I find that the noise-cancellation is most effective for conversation frequencies and not as much for other noise (vacuum cleaner, Nordic Track).<br /><br />I am very cautious about how I use them and always put them back in the case.  I think that will be critical, as it is for any earbuds, of course.  They have paired consistently and operate easily.  So far, very pleased and thinking about who on my Christmas list needs a comfortable, light-weight, nice quality pair of blue-tooth headphones."
1,Better than beats! Great sound quality
0,"After less than a year of infrequent use, the battery life has been reduced to 3 minutes of play before the low battery alarm starts chiming"
1,Good battery life and comfortable.
0,Based on all the reviews I was excited to get them only to be disappointed. When I had them in my ears I felt like I was under water (probably how they cancelled out other noise) and had a lot of static. Returned.
1,..as advertised and more.<br /><br />outstanding sound quality.<br />seamless set up.<br />ez pairing.<br />comfortable.<br />the little carrying box is a nice touch.<br />never going back to wires on headphones.<br /><br />very nice product.  thank you.
1,"I was apprehensive at the thought of bluetooth workout headphones at first, but these are fantastic. Most earbuds will fall out of my ears at some point during a run, but these haven't. While these may be small, the sound definitely isn't - I could block out both noise and my gym's terrible taste in music. Definitely pick these up."
1,"I needed some wireless headphones that I could use when I workout. Theses had many great reviews, so I decided to purchase and wasn't disappointed. Great sound quality, many extras."
1,"Great as ear buds, but not so much as a bluetooth. You sound like you are under water and it is hard for people to understand you."
0,"I saw that everyone at my gym was using these, so I bought a pair. They worked great in the beginning. Good sound, comfortable, did not fall out. It's been less than 30 days, and they will no longer turn on or charge. Waste of money."
1,The headphones stay comfortably firm in my ears and has  incredible sound
1,"My son bought these headphones and recommended them to me.  I bought them based on his recommendation, plus the price was good.  I tried them out for the first time today on a run, and must say, I thought they worked very well.  The directions for use were easy to follow.  It was nice not to have the usual tangle of wires from my ear buds and iPod.  The sound quality was great.  I was easily able to adjust the volume and skip a tune, although the sound was consistently good so I didn't need to adjust the volume often.  All in all, I like these headphones and look forward to using them in the future."
1,"Have only had the headphones for a few days. So far they work fine. My only complaint is that it is difficult to open the recharging port. It's very small and I fear the little rubber door will fall off with use. Other than that, sound and wireless range is good"
1,Love these!!
1,"I had a couple of wireless headphones in the past and they were not as solid as this one, it never failed me so far. Recommended buy!"
1,"I've tried many types and brands of earbuds in the past six years.  The biggest problems I had was with the fit..... for some reason all of the past earbuds didn't fit well in my ear and always fell out with any kind of head movement.  I decided to try the Senso headphones based on the price, reviews, and 4-star and above ratings. Three days in and the headphones sound great and STAY in my ears, thanks to the over-the-ear silicone stabilizers.  The fit is very comfortable and the headphones are easy to learn and use.  CANNOT beat the price coupled with quality.  So far... so good."
1,"These are my first wireless earphones.  Love the convenience.  For the price, I can't imagine the sound any better than with these.  Not a big fan of the design, though.<br />On and off switch convenient.  I can hear on the phone just fine.  They do cancel out outside noise pretty well."
1,"Bought as a replacement for my running headset.  Previous was cheap and did not work right after a month of running.  When I received package it was like I got something from Apple.  Very professional-looking in its packaging and came with an abundance of accessories for every situation (wall outlet, car charger).  Received company email after receiving headphones in mail and was impressed.  Haven't had any problems and the material is stable and seems built to withstand sweat from shorting or damaging headphones!  Will keep you all in mind when I need a future replacement!  Thank you!<br /><br />PS. Perhaps attach an elastic band to wires so it feels more snug around head.  An adjustable wire of some sort."
1,Simply fantastic. Will buy another set for backup.<br />Great buy. A+
1,"Only used a few times now, but received fast and as described. Nice quality headphones I would buy again if needed"
1,"Pros - The headphones is very light weight and I do like the flexible ear hooks because I don’t need to worry about a break from an accidental bend. On the right buds is where the controls to change audio, skip songs, answer/end phone calls, and turn on/off resides, which do feel comfortable to reach for whenever I need to use it. The extra earbuds that is supplied is essential for different ear types. The battery is more than long enough, from when I bought it to now, I’ve yet to charge it. The cord between the buds look a bit “flimsy” at first glance but appears to be a durable cable, and the sound is more than sufficient to my liking. Lastly, as a bluetooth headphone, it sells for great price compared to pricy options out in the market. The car charger and lightning cable bonus are pretty great as well.<br />Cons - As mentioned, the there are three different extra earbuds to come with this as I’ve tried all three to find a “perfect” fit. None of which really “locked in” nice and firm and I would find that sometimes my buds are rotated forward or backward (These are all subjective). HOWEVER, I had ZERO issues of it falling off, especially when I’m doing cardio or running a few games on the basketball court. Secondly, I’ve had minor issues of detecting the product via bluetooth, on my phone, even after following directions for pairing and/or resetting. After sometime, I’ve connected it to my iPhone 6 and my MacBook. Third, connectivity. As advertised, it does remain connected up to 30ft and sometimes a bit after. HOWEVER, I’ve had many instance when my audio would be “breaking up” as if signaling is affected. This would happen whether my phone is directly in my pocket or on the side of me during a lift of cardio session. It happens randomly but it is not enough to deter me from my activity, however, a minor nuisance. Regardless, I can’t say my issues with the connectivity is consistent with all other units with the numerous positive reviews on this product. But these are cons pertaining to my experience with my specific unit.<br />Conclusion - For the price I paid for in comparison to other pricier options, this is a excellent purchase. I do have a pair of powerbeats 2’s and these activbuds work just as well as them. I would recommend these buds for individuals looking for headphones of quality and not looking to make a dent in their savings. The cons that I’ve experienced is not enough to be suggestive of unsatisfactory purchase. Overall, I am satisfied, trust the other positive reviews, and at worst, you have a 1-year warranty and EXCELLENT customer service."
1,"You can hear it skip sometimes, like it starts to  get out of range but your phone is right next to you . The sound is decent"
1,"The range is good...as advertised, but no more.  The ability of others to hear me on calls is the best of the headphones that I have purchased."
1,So far so good
1,"I bought these to replace the  JBL Headset I thought I had lost. [[ASIN:B015XA2XDI JBL Reflect Mini Bluetooth In-Ear Sport Headphones, Black]]. I like the SENSO ones, and they are quite good value, but they are a bit big and heavy, and the hook over the ear is soft and thus does not actually hold the earbuds in place. So as you are running they tend to fall out. As a result I cannot really use for exercising as I though I might.<br /><br />But the headset is fine otherwise,  good sound and good battery life. Just not the best for its advertised use case.<br /><br />Luckily I found my JBL, and I use that for excercise, the SENSO for commuting."
1,Headphones work great.  The only item I would improve is the charging port cover is hard to remove when charging but otherwise the headphones are easy to pair.
1,Great product. Easy to setup and operate. Very comfortable to wear.
1,"i use them all the time and they are my go to headphones, wish i could wear them when i mow but they do not fit under my noise cancelling headphones i bough to wear when i mow.  other than that they work awesome"
1,Outstanding product!! The price is unbelievable! Great deal and product! Can't go wrong!
1,"I use these all the time to listen to podcasts, hockey games, and even music. On the bus, at work, at the gym, and at home- connection is solid and strong, charge life is decent, and sound quality is great for the price. I did have to tweak some of the equalization on my phone as there isn’t a ton of low end, but adjusting the EQ helped with that a little. You can hear things around them at lower volumes, but it’s not a huge issue and could probably be solved by swapping ear pieces in the kit or turning them up. Carrying case is sturdy but will occasionally turn the power on if it gets pressed in my backpack.  Overall, great headphones that I use all the time and don’t feel bad about them getting a little dirty, shoved in my backpack, or beat up."
1,It is easy to pair to devices. It is lightweight. It is easy to answer the phone  It stays in your ears.
1,"Sounds great just find the right earbuds and tweak the egualizer.  I cut fairways on a golf course and they will last a full eight hours and the range is very good, Had a little trouble when doing yard work around home  just disable WiFi and they don’t cut out.  Been using for over a year"
0,"Tried jogging with this twice, and gave up. does NOT stay on or in the ear. slips easily out."
1,"As with many other reviews, I find the sound quality outstanding. At $30, these are a no-brainer."
1,"I have been using these headphones for about a week and they have performed very well. They have all the controls I want or need -- might not be enough for some people. They are comfortable, and I like the ability to find the single control button without a lot of fiddling."
1,Seems to do what stated. Not a real user of Bluetooth so guessing
1,Headphones have a great sound to them and are staying on my ears while jogging and walking and even indoor rowing! I have had others where the buttons fail to work sometimes but these are working very well and no lag.
1,"Bought these as a back up to me Beats headphones.  Now I have the Beats as a back up to these.  Senso's blocking of ambient sound better, thus for me the tone is fuller on the Sensos. Fit very comfortable, controls well placed, good battery life and I like the audio cues when the battery is reaching exhaustion and for connection with phone."
1,Love the sound very satisfied
1,I ordered this product again. Because I lost my first one.I love these headphones for the price and the quality you can go wrong.
1,"Was not expecting this quality from $30 head phones. The ergonomics are great. With multiple options on earbud size, you wont have problems finding a perfect in ear fit; with the exterior, even shaking violently doesn't make em move a fraction of an inch. Volume is superb as well as quality. Only problem i have is flat wire connecting the toe, makes for a more difficult low-profile on the ""rat tail"" when utilizing the wire tie- hardly a pressing issue though. Lastly, the easy of use on the buttons makes managing volume and phone calls an absolute breeze.<br /><br />Overall: excellent product and worth the investment!"
1,Good sound and good fit. Very comfortable and not so heavy
1,"I've bought three pairs of these headsets. Every single one of these has failed and now will not charge - it's very frustrating. They are good priced, and they work well. There has been an issue with the battery, but I reached out to support and they have replaced the defective set."
1,Very good quality headphones!
1,good value for the money. I only use them at the gym so I didn't want to spend a lot. battery life is good.
0,2nd pair in less than 6 months. Won’t hold a charge. Don’t waste your money.
1,"I have Powerbeats3 by Dre and swear by them. I wanted to have a second set of buds as a back up, though, and not wanting to spend another $150, looked for a more affordable/budget option. Senso came back with a lot of positive reviews, so I gave them a try. While they are certainly not as comfortable as the Powerbeats and the sound will never reach the same rich quality, the Sensos are a really great bargain alternative! They sound better than the much, much more expensive Bose Soundsport or Jaybird x3, in my opinion. They are a bit uncomfortable and start to ache on my ears after about an hour...and they feel on the cheap end (material-wise). But small sacrifices to make for $30!"
1,Only downside I have to these headphones is my 3 foot charger cord  is damaged it seems where the lighning adaptor plugs into the charging side has frayed the cable to it exposes the wires<br /><br />Update have been using these for a little bit now and have no problems they work as intended for bluetooth headphones for simple use they are great for the price i dont run so i have not tested them that way however i use them for casual listening and when i mow the lawn and they are awsome
1,I've had several earbuds that were supposedly great quality but these are the real deal! I'm a fitness trainer and competitor so I'm constantly sweating on a daily basis and need my music or movies for motivation - these have not let me down. They are comfortable to wear and the sound quality is phenomenal! So glad I found these and at this price even better!
1,Great item ! Likes to ride tractor and listen to music
1,Overall a great option for the price. All in all I'm loving them the range is astonishing and almost never cuts out like allot of Bluetooth headphones do. The sound quality is decent nothing to write home about but in no way bad. However after a few days the left ear bid has developed a very faint buzzing sound when audio is going/ the headphones are activated. So that's whybim giving 4/5
1,Like the sound quality just wish they would make ear loop more rigid to keep it snug in the ear.
1,Amazing product! Works perfectly. I'd definitely recommend this to any one else.
1,"The music plays well and it does sound good. My only gripe is it is hard to ensure it does not move around my ear. I tried all three of the buds to get a snug fit but as I run I noticed that occasionally the earpiece would move causing it to shift a bit out of my ear. I occasionally have to re-adjust the earbud in my ear during a single run.<br /><br />I am a male that is 5' 9&#34; 170 lbs. So I am not a small guy or a big guy. I would expect them to fit a tad better. Either way, I will still use them :)"
1,I love them.  They have great sound.  No problems pairing with Bluetooth.  I use them everyday now.
1,The amount of extras that came with these headphones is great! Two charging cords and a dual charger port for use in your vehicle is a plus for me. The product was neatly packaged and arranged damage free. Instructions are clear and they work as described.
1,The sound quality is amazing.
1,LOVE these!!
1,"I've been using the headphones for a few days now, and I've really enjoyed them. They are easy to connect to your different devices (so far I'm at 3 different ones that I've connected to), and they are comfortable to wear. They also come with several accessories, including three different eartip sizes, two wire ties, a carry case, a charging cable, a cellphone card wallet, and a cellphone car mount. It's a lot of value at a very reasonable price!"
1,"I like these ear buds except for one thing, not enough bass. They fit tightly and work really well during my workout."
1,"This is my fourth set of wireless headphones, which I use almost exclusively for running. I've only had them a week, but so far they are very good.  Great sound and very easy to use.  Most importantly they stay in my ears and do not fall out, which was a problem with the other headphones I had."
1,"Love the headphones.  Light, compact with good sound at a great price.  Thank you"
1,Loved the headphones never had an issue until the left ear started having a wiring issue. Contacted them and already getting a replacement the next day. Great service and product.
1,"these things are awesome! Last long,  bass is great.  Works for all types of music, games, movies etc. Pair this with my galaxy s8 plus.  Best ear buds for the money.  I recommend using the foam ear inserts it comes with"
0,"I got this to wear while working out.  Tonight while exercising, the sound became garbled for a short time, then stopped completely.  Now none of the buttons respond to presses.  It appears to charge, but given that the buttons don't function, that is not useful.  I guess ""sweatproof"" is a bit of an exaggeration."
1,"LOVE these little gems! So many excellent features! Takes up very little space in its small round case! Comes with 2 usb charging cables and a dual usb car charger. Super comfortable silicone ear pieces that hold the buds securely on/in your ears. Comfortable neck cable connecting the buds (important for frequent airline travelers). Surprisingly good sound quality for the price with the correct earbud tip fit.<br /><br />In short, these are ALWAYS  in my bag. Never leave home without them!"
1,"Bought these because a friend recommended them! I’m glad I did, they are loud clear and they seal in your ears very well! They also don’t have that heavy peice on the cord connecting them so they won’t fall and rub your neck! Highly recommend these for someone who can’t stand blue tooth like I can’t! These almost fixed all the problems i had with blue tooth headphones! 🤘🏻"
1,"Got these for my daughter for Christmas and she loves them. She wanted the B__t's brand, but I was not going to pay hundreds of dollars for something that has such poor ratings or paying just for a name. These had a great rating from hundreds of people."
1,"This headset is fantastic. I use it every day at the gym and the sound is phenomenal. The first pair I bought did turn out to be defective, but the seller was extremely pleasant to work with and a replacement pair was shipped out very quickly."
1,Very pleased with these Bluetooth headphones.  I use them for running and they never lose connection like other brands I've tried.  They're also priced right!
1,Got them for my son and he loves them.
1,U love it ... long battery life.. great packaging .. rally does the job
1,Without a doubt these are really great headphones they are so comfortable you can actually forget you have them on and the sound quality is awesome I am very happy with this purchase the shipper was very fast and the packaging was great the item was even better than  described would highly recommend and use this shipper again
1,"Overall the sound quality is good - however, they are a little uncomfortable on my ears. The blue tooth connection is solid however and the cord is just the right length so that its out of the way. The last two features outweigh the discomfort for me."
1,"Very comfortable, hardly noticed them while wearing, battery life was as long as my phones (LG V30)."
0,People always complain on voice quality. I stopped using it :-(
1,Much easier to use and the sound quality is better than my other wireless earbuds
0,I purchased this headset to pair with mu S7 but it constantly cuts in and out to the point that it becomes useless. I thought that it was my S7 causing the issue so I paired it to my iPod and got the same results.
1,"Very nice headphones and I love the packaging.  Was pleasantly surprised at the nice carrying case, extra ear buds, and bonus items for cell phone.  Earphones synced right away with my iPhone and the ear piece fits nicely with flexible ear loop. Been working in the barn all day away from phone and never disconnected. Work good with phone as well"
1,Excelent
1,excellent quality. the shape sits firmly in my ear. you can tilt the earbud to increase or decrease the level of bass in your ears. the buds are comfortable in my ear for long periods of time without it becoming irritable. the Bluetooth connection is secure w/ a variety of products I connect them too. I plan to make them gifts for friends
1,"The earbuds are light weight, provide clear sound and just enough noise dampening to help me ignore outside distractions without totally cutting me off from what's going on around me. I used them in the gym for a good two hours and they never slipped out my ears. Better still, they were comfortable to wear from the beginning to end of my workout. I'm looking forward to using them on my next plane flight to listen to music and watch videos!"
0,"At first, I was hoping that some of the problems would be resolved by a full charge, as that's what the instructions stated could be causing any noticeable technical glitches.  Sadly, that wasn't the case.  The microphone hardly worked, and the sound canceling feature did little more than create a small white noise, while leaving all the external noise not at all diminished. I returned it."
1,"Great headphones to run or even to use them in the office, totally recommended"
1,I purchased one for my husband and he loved it so much that he bought one for me.  This company Tekatron provides great products and  excellent customer service.
1,Good!! I like the product! Good quality of sound. Useful for training kickboxing recommend
0,I'm so disappointed....I purchased these earlier this year and I really liked them...the last two days they don't charge...light won't come on to indicate charging....I left them plugged in overnight....that didn't help.....
0,"Loved these but just quit working, after a month.  This is the second brand that happened to me.  I honestly don't think they make blue tooth headphones that last yet at least not for the I phone 7, at least the way I work out. It is like the batteries wear out, it will light up when plugged in but won't turn on."
1,Excellent
1,I am very impressed with the headphones. Very good sound quality for the price. Lite weight and comfortable. Paired to my iPhone in 5 seconds.
1,- Excellent quality<br />- Good sound<br />- Comfortable<br />- The carrying case is so useful and other accessories<br />- Decent bass
1,"Great headphones, I was worried about their ability to stay in place during my workouts but I've taken them on trail runs, on the treadmill and all over the place in the gym and they do just fine. The waterproof rating on the headphones is nice because I just rinse them off in the shower and go on my way.<br /><br />The sound of course is why you buy headphones or speakers or any other audio device. And these have incredible sound! However as can be expected when the sweat starts pouring there is some distortion purely due to the excess sweat, the headphones themselves hold up and when wiped off are back to their excellent sound."
0,The left headphone did not work!!!!
1,Excellent
1,Was nervous about these headphones due to price but great value
1,"The blue tooth head phones are very high quality. Great sound. The seller seems eager to help if one encounters any problems with the head phones, but I have had no problems. Great product."
1,"These headphones are an incredible value! They sound great and work pretty well. My main struggle with these types of headphones is that they don't stay in my ears very well.<br /><br />The rubber that wraps around the ears isn't very stiff so for people who already struggle with the rubber type of earbuds are going to continue to struggle. The wrap around piece keeps it in the general location, but isn't stiff enough to hold it in the ear canal. As a result, when I'm running, I'm constantly pushing these things deeper into my ear. Without an airtight seal in my ear, the bass goes to crap and I go from listening to booming Lindsey Sterling to something out of a Super NES game...<br /><br />I give my genes 1 star for giving me crappy ear canals, I can't blame the company for that. I just wish the wrap around portion was stiffer to hold it in better."
1,So far this has been a solid pair of wireless/Bluetooth headphones. Easy to operate and the sound is surprising! I should note that the instructions are short and cover only the basics. It took me a while to figure out that the phones must be disconnected from the previous device before they can be paired with another device. For the money they are great. We will see how long they last.....
1,&#34; Very nice headphones! Great sound and nice case too. I was impressed with these! &#34;
1,love the sound.  They kinda move around a bit tho when running
1,It falls off my ears sometimes and sometimes difficult to pair with my iPhone device but either ways I like it.
1,Just as described. Awesome set of ear buds at a great price.
1,Love the headphones. I bought them to run and hike with. So far so good. GREAT sound. Pleasantly surprised!
1,"We were skeptical  when ordering these, however, they far exceed our expectations. I gave mine to my husband and he is always critical about everything.  He loves these, nice clear sound and phone calls are amazing, he walks a lot and likes to listen to music, his other headphones would twist and skip. The only time these skip is if he turns his head . He always has trouble with the earpiece staying in and being comfortable, they usually hurt and he can't stand them for long, these are very comfortable and stay in, he has used them to walk, make calls, and even has them on when hitting golf balls. He would never have been able to do that with any other headphones. I ordered another set and should have them today.  We drive a lot and are quite often in different cars and have to communicate with each other, will be interesting to see how they do for this, we generally use LG headsets but they turn on the neck especially in winter, hoping these are the answer!!"
1,I purchased these for my husband just 2 days ago. So far no complaints. Great noise cancelling and great sound for music!
1,Well worth the money!!!
1,"Love this product so much, I bought one for my wife and 27 year old daughter. My wife bought the $299 Bose but liked the Senso better so she took back the Bose."
1,Nice works well with my iPhone 7plus
1,I thought these worked pretty well. After a couple months the volume button on the top started sticking so I couldn't use it most of the time. I run long distance and can say that they lasted through a lot of sweat. Yesterday though I plugged them in to charge because they wouldn't turn on and the red light showing that they are charging won't even come on. I thought it might be the charger so i tried another one but it did the same thing. For the price i paid for them i thought they were decent but I was hoping I'd get more time out of them.
1,Seem to have great battery life  and good quality sound. Went on a 40 minute run ans they stayed in place and dry.
1,The ear loops were uneven. They sounded great but sent them back for a refund d
1,Way better than I expected. Now to find the right Comply ear buds that fit them!
1,"works great, sound is great."
1,"I love these buds so far....they worked just fine in a steam room tonight, and the sound quality is excellent."
1,"Excellent product, and even better customer service!"
1,"Sucks I lost these, cuz the sound was loud and great quality. Only thing that sucked was the microphone."
1,"Good headphones for the gym.<br />Comes with a bunch of accessories and multiple sized ear inserts.<br /><br />When it comes to sound, it is... decent.<br />There is a good amount of bass, but it suffers in the mid range and high end."
1,"I got these because I work in an office that's noisy, and I didn't have much luck with the other Bluetooth headphones I purchased (a bit snug around the neck, some microphone noise). These were reasonable at first - charged well, fit OK (although if you have small ears, don't bother - the silicone clips are too big and the boxy bodies of the headphones are painful after a few minutes). The sound quality, if they fit you, is really good - I listened to everything from Cindy Lauper to Seal on my 80's mix and the sound quality was amazing. Even a few folk, pop, and country tracks I tried were good, and the voice fidelity is good for audiobooks.<br /><br />Much to my dismay, they are going back. Why? That big boxy ear piece. I have small ears even for most women, and after about an hour wearing them I had to start fiddling with them to keep my ears from throbbing. If they were in the right position for sound, they were awful for comfort, and vice-versa. I also noticed that they changed my ringtone (in my earpiece at least) and read out the number calling - fine if you like that, but I get so many junk calls at work that I have my ringer off for most calls and I don't need to hear their numbers as I send them to voicemail."
1,"Great headphones with clear sound. It gets 4-stars because of the answering issue. The only issue I have is when I receive a phone call. When I answer the phone, I have to wait until the message stops repeating the number of the person who called. The person on the other end just hears dead air and wonders if you really answered the phone call or thinks you hung up."
1,"So far very happy with the product.. Have not put it to the test fully, but preliminary results are good so far."
1,Fall off ears easily. But battery life is amazing. And quality of sound is great. I would give 3.5 stars but it only lets me put 3. Not 100% satisfied with this product.
1,Great Product......You Can't Beat the Quality for the Price You Pay.....I Wasn't About to Pay $200.00 for a Pair of Beats that I'm Gonna Sweat and a Workout In......
1,"I repurchased this way ago, and I must say this product is pretty durable. The sound quality is excellent under that budget — overall satisfied."
1,Easy to use. Great audio quality. I plan to purchase another one
1,"Finally, a functional sports bluetooth. I am very satisfied with the product and delivery. I will be ordering another pair."
1,I got them for working out and not have to worry about wires  and I absolutely LOVE them.
1,Is wonderful it works perfectly shipping was great it what i expected thanks
1,"For the price these headphones are amazing. The sound quality is alright but for 30 dollars you can't really complain, also they are completely noise cancelling. The ear hooks are a pretty flimsy but surprisingly they stay on your ears even during intense workouts. I've done plyometric workouts and weightlifting and they never fell off. The battery life is also pretty great, you can have the volume up loud and they last 8 hours which is two more hours than most other brands. These also come with a carrying case, 3 different ear tips, two charging cords, and a car charger. This is a great deal and I definitely recommend them to anyone who wants a good pair of Bluetooth headphones and not spend hundreds of dollars."
1,Quick delivery and as identified. Great sound. The ear piece rubs on my ear with extended wear. I have them in about 3 hrs at a time.
1,"Update 03/22/18 - Company contacted me with trouble shooting advice and when that failed to solve the problem, they promptly shipped me a brand new pair. I am about to try them and will update, but I felt the excellent customer service exhibited deserved an updated review.<br /><br />For the first month, these worked as advertised. Great for my workouts as I was unhindered by cords. However, after the first month, the music started to “skip” or cut in and out rapidly, like portable CD players do when they are bumped. I recharged the headphones thinking that was the issue, but it only continues to worsen. Impossible to listen to music. Luckily I purchased a warranty, so I will be returning/replacing. I wouldn’t recommend this product."
1,Great product easy to set up<br /><br />Sounds excellent easy to use well-made
1,These headphones work great for exercising at the gym or running on the track.  They come with a case and the expected cords for charging.  I don't see how you can find a better set for the price without going into the high dollar headphones.
1,Great Sound. But the range is horrible
1,Happy so far!
1,I bought these for a friend who is training to run the New York City Marathon.  After using them the first time she called me right away and said she couldn't believe how great these headphones are.  I purchased these headphones for myself after speaking with her and I love them as well!  If you buy this product you will enjoy them!!
1,Fast shipping and awesome product.  Exactly what I wanted and expected.
1,"These ear buds are incredible!  Crystal clear, wide range sound and comfortable.  Perfect for active or leisure use."
1,"This product exceeded my expectations. In every area! The sound quality is amazing, the kit and storage case are quality and an awesome surprise! The ease of use is so intuitive i had them paired and running with no issues. Truly an excellent product. I recommend them to everyone"
0,One of the ear buds does not work
0,"Lasted 3 months before they stopped working. Pretty comfortable for the price point but kind of finicky with connecting to my phone sometimes- had to turn them on and off a few times to get it to connect. I guess for $35, I couldn't expect them to last forever but 3 months was quite a short run."
1,"Absolutely love these headphones for working out. When getting ready to buy them I read a lot of reviews saying that there was a lack of bass. However, after reading other reviews I went ahead and got them anyways. Now, know that I had just broken my powerbeats 3 and was looking for less expensive option because I don't have $200 to throw at earphones right now. So none the less, these headphones sound, perform, last, and feel exactly like my Power beats 3 for waaaay less money. The only thing you need to know is that you definitely have to switch the size of the bud depending on your ear, but when you find the right one, you will know. I can honestly say that these earphones are exactly the same as any other pair out there for 6x the price. Don't look any further and give them a try! You won't be disappointed!"
1,"Fantastic headphones. Really great sound, and MUCH better at blocking background sound so the person on the other end of the line doesn't get all the feedback and their voice never cuts out on my end. Definitely recommended!"
1,"When I first received my headset I was impressed by the quality. Great value for the price. I truly fell in love with them. The sound is good and it even comes with a nice case to keep them in. Unfortunately after 2 months of use the headset stopped working. I reached out to Imvotek and they responded immediately. After unsuccessfully troubleshooting, the representative sent me a replacement that I received a few days later. Great customer service."
1,"Worth the price.  Sound quality is as good as my wired headphones.  Haven't gotten it wet yet, but that's my intent!"
1,Works great and sounds awesome. very lite and can wera for long periods. I sometimes listen for hours around the house doing work and they feel great. Just a lil large but still worth it.
1,"At the $36.97 price point these are unbeatable.  I use them at the gym, running outdoors, mowing the lawn, and around the house.<br /><br />Pros<br />-Price<br />-Fit my ears perfectly out of the box (other earpiece sizes are also included) and, most importantly, don't fall out when I run<br />-No BT connection issues so far.  I mostly use them with my phone in an armband (about 12&#34; away) or in my pocket (about 3' away).<br />-Clear, full sound.  I listen to rock, punk, country, hip-hop, podcasts, etc, everything sounds great.<br />-Battery life is great.  I use them about an hour a day and charge them every couple of days just to be safe.<br />-The big, easily accessible pause button on the right earpiece is very handy.<br /><br />Cons<br />-Just one: The cord that connects the two earpieces will twist itself into knots behind your head if you don't smooth out all the kinks before putting them on.  As long as you take a second to make sure the cord isn't twisted first, you'll forget it's there.  If you don't, it will eventually bunch up behind one of your ears and become very irritating.<br /><br />HIGHLY recommended if you are in the market for inexpensive BT earphones to throw in your backpack, gym bag, etc."
1,Great headphones for the money.  Just got them and like them a lot.  Excellent battery life.
1,"Very pleased with this product.  If you are expecting audiophile sound do not look to find it with these. If you want great quality and an excellent price with adequate music reproduction.......ear buds for doing yard work, running or working out at the gym you can not go wrong."
0,Broke after 1 yr
1,"Work and sound fine. I only get about 3 hours use out of them, but I only use them for working out so it is fine. Good value."
1,"These earbuds are the best quality vs cost product at this price point! I read CNET's review, which recommended them highly, and I did some additional research. I bought one a few months ago, now I've come back to buy more for my family members! I've been completely impressed with them! ❤ Among 3 sets, one had a small technical issue. I emailed with customer service about it and it was amazing how thoughtful and responsive they were. They sent troubleshooting ideas that I tried, then I sent my amazon purchase order from my history and since the purchase date was within one year, they sent a replacement set. The other two pairs have had no issues whatsoever. I will absolutely buy senso again."
1,Amazing product. Works just as described - audio better than the average Beats headphones.
1,"I sweat ridiculously when working out.  These ear buds have lasted over 14 months now.  Only issue I have is inconsistent pairing with iphone 7+.  Sometimes it is pairs fine, while other times I have to 'force' the pairing through iphone settings.  I'd likely buy again if the pairing issue is resolved in newer models."
1,Earbuds work. Sound quality is very mediocre. You get what you pay for.
0,"Bad aftermarket service. If you lost charging cable, you would not be able to buy or get a replacement from seller, which means you would not be able to use your earphones. It is a waste of money. And also, the quality is not good, because it sounds discontinuous. The battery is not good either and it can only be used less than 2 hours."
1,Got them today.  Rode my jetski all afternoon.  Played great.  Perfect.  Exactly what I wanted.  Sounds perfect.
1,They fit fine and worked great for the first few months.<br />Now they pair with my devices but for the first minute have a skipping sound that makes the audio unlistenable.<br />After the minute they work fine.<br />Buttons work great and battery life is pretty good for small size.<br />If not for the skipping I would give 5 stars but this is very annoying.
0,"Bought these about 6 months ago at first I thought were good but after running for a bit noticed they dont stick to your hears well while running, they slip, sound is good quality, but the worst part is they die when at 50%. I would get notification of ""low battery"" at 50% and within 2 miutes they turn off. I would turn them back on and 50% appears on my phone screen when paired with my phone but would turn back of because of a ""dead battery"" at 50% decent for the first 6 months, but long term at least for my experience,  no bueno."
0,"Poor design, the ear hooks are  too  flexible. If the headphones don't fit your ears perfectly, the hooks don't help them stay on the ear, they just fall off when you run."
1,These ear buds are so good I bought 2 more pairs for my kids! Sound is great works with phone calls but mainly use for work outs. Price is awesome for these.Thanks to all that review products that is how I found and purchased these. Buy them you wont be disappointed!
1,This product far exceeded my expectations. Incredible sound quality and comfort.
1,I love my new headset! Reasonably priced and best of all the headset feels like I don't have it on! No headphones falling out!!!! Wonderful!
1,"I wear these headphones for all kinds of weather conditions and so far they work no matter what. I can use them in the gym, and they are affordable when I misplace them."
1,"Let's just say these earbuds are great if you want two sub-woofers directly in your ear. For rock and alternative music, they sound tinny and very bassy. I've never had to use the equalizer on my phone, but I had to turn the 60 Hz frequency all the way down around -8 dB to get a normal amount of bass and increase other frequencies.<br /><br />With that out of the way, the headphones powered up and paired with my phone in just a few seconds. Fit is comfortable and the wire isn't intrusive. I wish there was a way to tighten the wrap around my ears, but they'll keep them on my head in the case that they fell out of my ear. They have a good weight and design.<br /><br />The extras weren't necessary, but look high quality. I don't have a micro-USB or Lightning compatible device (I have USB-C), but the cable looks very nice and allows you to switch between the two (micro-USB and Lightning). Haven't used the car charger but it looks nice; I already have a good one but I'm sure a friend will snatch these up. The case for the headphones are good quality with a nice faux carbon fiber look - great if you want to take them in a bag or backpack.<br /><br />All in all, these headphones are great if you want to take your music with you, but don't expect great sound.<br /><br />Update: The sound is actually decent if you heavily modify it with an equalizer, though not many people know to do this. Not sure if all apps and phones have one, but if you have Android and Google Play Music, you're good to go. Not entirely sure if I believe any of the reviews on this product - be aware."
0,Skip while running and cause an echo when speaking on the phone.
1,"Nothng not to like, from the secure carrying case to the quality of the headphones The folks who make these awesome devices, from the owner on down, have been as wonderful as the headphones themselves.  They have sought out more than just a product review they genuinely are interested in customer satisfaction and that is impressive. Thank you"
1,Works great fast shipping
1,These headphones are great. Worth the money.
1,"Very well built and good sound quality. I received my headphones and had an issue with the left earbud, static sound when pausing music. I contacted customer service and they were very helpful. They had me do a reboot of the headphones but that did not work so they sent me a new set since they were under the 1 year warranty. Overall this is a great product and comes with great customer service."
1,Sharp looking earbuds.  Works very well.  Sounds are terrific.  Customer Service A-One!!!
1,I like these so much that I ordered a second pair for my hubby.  I like that I don't have to worry about one of the pieces getting lost.  They also come with a nice case.
1,Have had this product since Christmas 2016 (about 2 months).  The product works very well and a battery charge last for many hours.
1,So far I’m very happy with the product would recommend
1,These are great for the price! They don't get in the way while exercising and I rarely charge them!
0,"I recently purchased a V-moda Forza wireless headset when it was released, but due to various issues I had with the headset I returned them. I've had a reliable set of Mpows for over 2 years, but I needed an upgrade or at least an improved battery life headset. So I tried a few Bluetooth headsets and compared including the Anker Slimbuds ($21), OldShark 4.1 magnetic headphones ($32), and the Senso $37 headphones with over 12,000 reviews. BTW, I chose to compare specifically these headsets since each has a manufacturer's warranty and an easy to reach website to contact the manufacturer if an issue arrises in the near future. Some of the better reviewed headsets had issue with finding the manufacturer's website or warranty info in the first place.<br /><br />In terms of the headsets themselves, I liked some things about all three, but after spending some time with each headset I've concluded that the winner is definitely the cheaper Anker slim bids, though the Oldsharks were a close second. Surprisingly, I expected a lot more from the Senso headphones in terms of comfort and sound quality since it was the pricier headset, which unfortunately it was not. Though many have been happy with these headphones, I found too many issues that may not be obvious at first, but are more noticeable when comparing to 1 or 2 other sets of headphones.<br /><br />1) The Senso's unlike the Ankers or the Oldshark uses and over the ear hook to keep the headphones in place. This along with the actual shape of the headphones seemed bulky and not as secure as the inner ear fins provided by the Ankers and OldSharks. Unlike the other two headphones, these did not sit as securely or comfortably inside the actual ear as I would have expected.<br /><br />2) The buttons were a bit harder to press and use than I would have thought. Though the play/pause button was ok to use, skipping songs was really a bit more of an issue.<br /><br />3) I may not have correctly triggered it, but unless I am mistaken, there is no Siri integration with these heaphones unlike the other two I tried. I don't use it often but I do need Siri abilities from time to time.<br /><br />4) Both me and my Spouse compared all three headphones, and thought there were some minor differences between the Oldsharks and the Ankers, there was an obvious difference with the Senso's in a bad way. The music and lyrics sound garbled/muffled, like you're hearing the music through water when compared to the other two. Though both the Oldsharks and the Ankers did well and excelled at differenct aspects of treble and bass, the Senso's just sounded bad with the very same music.<br /><br />5) One reason I felt that the Senso's would possible be a good option is that they are listed as 0.2 ounces for weight, when compared to the Ankers and Oldsharks 0.5 ounces (really 0.6 on a scale). I weighed the Senso's, and they were the heaviest at 0.7 ounces. I knew they wouldn't be 0.2 ounces, but I didn't expect them to be the heaviest either.<br /><br />5) Lastly, I've noticed with certain BT headphones (including the V-moda Forza Wireless) that some BT headphones' volume control buttons affect the actual volume from the sound source (iphone volume), whereas other headphones have an independent volume to what the audio source volume is. The Ankers I'm happy to say control the actual volume directly on my iPhone, whereas the Senso's and Oldsharks have their own volume but does not control the volume from my phone directly. I've noticed having inversed volumes (Max in the headphones, low in the Iphone or Vice versa) can create some audio distortion at times. And although the Max volume one the Senso's + Max volume on the Iphone= Louder, it does not necessarily mean greater sound quality.<br /><br />Overall, disappointed to say the least. From the reviews, I really thought I would have a hard time deciding between the three headphones, but the Senso's were easily eliminated from all aspects. Besides some specs and sweat/water proof abilities, there were no noticeable improvements that the Senso's had over the Ankers or OldSharks. Again, these differences may not seem noticeable unless you compare to an Aux headset or other pair of headphones which I recommend to compare with if you do purchase these headphones."
0,"There seems to be no way to return these headphones. After a few weeks when on phone calls these headphones make a loud clicking noise and it makes it impossible to talk to anyone. I would like to return or exchange this item, but because I can not do that I am giving a 1 star for the product and the service of this item."
0,"Very disappointed with these headphones. They skip like crazy. Can't use them anymore. I came on here to try to return them, but the window has already passed. They worked for about a month, and I really did like them. They are comfortable, but didn't last."
1,"Great product. I’ve only used it a few times, but they sound great and work as expected."
1,"The headphones work great. I haven't used it in water, but it's great for the gym. I've been wanting Bluetooth headphones for awhile and the product is worth the price."
1,Seems to work well for my use - doing laps in the pool (not swimming under the water) - sometimes a little tricky to get it to pair and doesn't seem to want to pair to 2 devices but otherwise for the price does a good job
1,"These headphones stay put, pair easily, and sound great. There's really nothing more to say."
1,Better than average sound quantity for a Bluetooth set but subpar to most wired sets. The sound is too soft and muted. Good set for an occasional use at the gym where the quantity doesn't count - only convenience.<br />Just to add a bit more. The louder the sound the more distorted it gets.<br />Not sure where all the 5 star reviews are from. If this is 5 then it's out of 20.<br />Sorry guys but you need to work on the sound quality. I'm sending mine back.
1,"These sound great but don't stay in my ears that great. Before you get any ideas, my ears are normal."
0,"PROS:<br />The fit is great, they are very lightweight, comfortable and almost like they are not there.<br />Connectivity to the phone (iPhone) is fast. Did not lose connection once out of 5+ times that I wore them to work out.<br />Price is great.<br />CONS:<br />Well, after a few times of wearing them, and being very satisfied. The audio started to break. Just to make sure, I checked internet connectivity, it was fine. I checked Bluetooth connectivity, it was fine. I checked app behavior (Spotify) it was fine. Finally, I realized what triggered the issue. Whenever I tilted my head down (constantly when running) the audio will break. As long as I constantly kept looking straight ahead I could avoid the issue, but obviously, when running outside, that's never going to happen.<br /><br />I have posted this review/rating because of my current experience. I will be fair will update my review based on the results of my return/reorder experience, as well as the performance of the replacement set. Stay tuned."
0,To listen to music is great. When on a call the sound is okay coming in but the sound going out I have been told sounds like I am talking under water. NOT CLEAR AT ALL.
1,"I was going to get Apple AirPods, but fear losing one or both. With the Senso connected together they are more secure & less loseable. Sound is LOUD. Much louder than my Apple ear buds with or without Bluetooth adapter. Battery life is great. And they reach out to you TWICE before the first week to make sure you're satisfied. I'm buying another as a backup to use while the other one is charging. I use them about 12-14 hours per day."
1,Very good value for money
1,"Well Done, loved the follow-up."
1,Best headphones I've had. Something about the soft design allows just enough air in for a perfect sound. Better than beats any day. They don't hurt your ears and are submergable.
1,Great headphones.  Sound is great and they stay on without slipping. I would definitely recommend.
0,"Purchased: Ordered on June 25, 2018<br />Date of defect: July 15, 2018<br />In less than a month, the right side wire has lost connection.  Very disappointed.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Long range (much longer than any other ones used in the past)<br />Battery charge last very long time.  LOVE IT.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Absolutely NOT for running.  You can hear wind noise HORRIBLY.<br />One of the wires lost connection in less than a month."
1,Decent sound for the price
1,Very happy with the headphones they fir my ear and they work perfectly
1,Great quality for the price. Was not expecting them to be as nice as they are for so cheap but they work so well. The four different styles of earpieces will fit anyone's ear and they are very simple to operate with great sound quality.
1,Don't waste yur money on big name brand earbuds. These senso buds are just as good but a fraction of the price. They create a suction in yur ear. Don't fall out.
1,WORKS GREAT BUT HAS THE TENDENCY TO PICK UP BACK GROUND NOISE AND DROWN OUT THE VOICE OF THE PERSON USING THEM
1,Good quality for the price
1,They don't stay in very well. Haven't had time to fully commit to a hour run with them but will edit if sweat interferes with performance.
0,"Pros: as earphones, they are small so you can wear them and still lean your head against something like a pillow.<br />Cons: the audio started to crackle after just a few months of use and the quality degraded quickly until it became simply unusable."
1,"I just got these today and I played a few songs, honestly they're great. The arch keeps the buds in my ear and the sound is clear and good quality. Even better is I simply love that the box came with a phone mount, caribiner clip, a stick on card holder for a phone, and what I love most is the case. It has mesh inside for the spare rubber buds (thank you!) And even the case itself. It's a nice carbon fiber finish with red accents. Awesome product so far!"
1,"Wow! These may very well be the best deal in audio headphones. Incredible price point and high quality sound with all the extra amenities. I'm a long time Beats user who repeatedly paid 8 times what these cost and finally got tired of the reoccurring problems I had with them. The Senso earphones are so comfortable. At first I wasn't sure about the more flexible ear wrap piece but it is very moldable and stays where you put it. Packaged nicely, good sized and sturdy zipper case, USB charger, Car charger, sliding tie piece to tighten the loop if you wish, multiple size earpieces.<br />Your quality is appreciated. Thank you!"
1,So fare the best sports earbuds
1,"Sound good, not great. Connected easily and are comfortable. would buy them again"
1,These work great... I ordered 2. 1 for myself and 1 for my wife. I work outdoors and they stay in my ears perfectly. The sound quality is outstanding.
1,Used them a few days now and they are great. Fit well and the sound quality is fantastic. Good bass and very clear. For the money they can't be beat.
0,"I was a littler nervous about purchasing these headphones as it seems with this stuff you tend to get what you pay for.  Unfortunately, I have had these for two months and one of the ear buds has stopped working.  While they worked well when they did work, they did not seem to fit in my ear very well when running even trying the different tips.  I liked the package that came with it and the accessories, case and charging cable are nice.  I would have probably give a higher rating if they still worked.  Unfortunately I have gone back to my old headphones and am looking for a replacement.  I did contact support and will update the review if I hear back from them."
1,"Well I have had these for almost two months now and just submitted a warranty claim to the company.  They were GREAT the first time I used them.  Easy to connect to iPhone 6+, went on a 5 mile run with no issues.  Every time I use them (3 days a week) the blue connectivity becomes worse and the battery does not last more than 30 minutes (yesterday was only 5 minutes) when they are fully charged.  I have submitted a claim and hoping to work with the company to get a new pair under warranty."
1,not impressed in the least by the sound quality even compared to other bluetooth buds in the same price range. seem to have good battery life is their only redeeming quality IMO
1,"The battery life is fantastic! They paired easily with my iPhone 8, the fit is super comfortable and the sound is really great! I work in a metal shop and the noise cancellation on these is top notch so far."
1,I had this at five stars becasuse first bluetooth headset that worked for longer than a week while running. Now have to revisit. Since it stopped while running and after tried charging it asnd only the blue light comes on not red. I give up on all bluetooth headsets while running.<br /><br />I am now giving this 4 stars. Since it magically startred working again andc they did get back to me and offer to make it right. Still do not no what went wrong so leaving it at 4 stars.<br /><br />Stopped working again. Guess I am done with bluetooth headsets while running.<br /><br />Contacted vendor and sent me a new one. This one is working great. Guess I got a defective one.
0,"Worked well at first, but now one earbud won't work."
1,"Good sound, good bass. Holds a decent charge that lasts. I do wish the ear hooks were a little more stiff as they're too flimsy and dont do a great job at keeping these in/on your ears. Frequently have to adjust back in/into ears during workouts."
1,"Dispite their strange email to me to review their product only a day or two after I receiived it and obviously not enough time to review anything I'm now ready to give you / them a review on this product.<br />After having used this product for a couple weeks now I do like this product. I use it driving to and from work listening to audio books or music in my car.<br />Pros - Nice sound, easy to use audio controls and I think they are fairly comfortable to wear for an hour or so.<br />Cons - Somewhat bulky and there is an obnoxious flashing LED light. My drive is in the early AM i.e. still dark out. This headset has an LED (light) that flashes every few seconds which throws off an annoying strob-light effect in my cab &#34;and&#34; bounces off the corner of my eye glasses. This is very annoying when driving. The fix? I put a little piece black electrical tape over the light. Much better now.<br />As for the battery life, I'm only getting about 5.5hrs before I'm hearing the battery low alert from the headset (5 hrs is more than enough for me).<br />Regardless of the cons I've mentioned. I would definitely recommend this product. Good price and after two weeks it's workiing well. Four instead fo five stars for the battery life discrepancy."
1,Looks good. Nice product.
1,"I got these for my husband because he likes to walk at lunch and they said they were water resistant or water proof (we live in Seattle), they've been great for him! He uses they ALL the time, they have great sound quality and he's had no complaints."
1,"Great product and sound quality. Not the most comfortable if you wear glasses due to the earpieces on these headphones, other than that, I have no complaints."
1,"Two running sessions in with these and they work perfect, with the foam tips provided you barely notice they are on."
1,Got these as a gift for my husband! He loves them!
1,"Great sound. I was worried about bass, but for me these headphones deliver excellent sound quality."
1,Very nice.  Although you should note that the ear clips are bendable lol.  Sound is really goid
0,"Do not pay attention to the 4 star review. Most of the high rated reviews are from over six months ago. I bought these for my girlfriend for her birthday, and the bluetooth connection constantly cuts out when she is out on a jog. We tried a factory reset as was recommended and it did not help. These headphones cannot even perform what they are advertised to perform due to cost cutting and a significant drop in quality."
0,The reviews were really good for these so I figured I'd give them a shot.<br /><br />Fit - they don't necessarily fall out of my ears when I workout but they don't exactly fit in my ears with any of the other size buds. They do still get the job done in terms of noise canceling.<br /><br />Sound quality - im not sure if it was any better the first two times I used them but the bass in my music is so horrendous I can't hardly stand even listening to it. It's half static when it comes out.<br /><br />You get what you pay for though.
0,"I purchased these for working out as well as helping me with sleep issues. I have music or podcasts on a timer so I can sleep without interrupting my husband. The largest issue is the battery. As soon as it hits 50% (as indicated by the battery icon when connected to Bluetooth) it start blaring an incredibly jarring BATTERY LOW every minute. The last 50% is quickly drained and BATTERY LOW keeps cutting through any audio you are listening to. Or, in a couple cases, a no longer deep sleep<br /> It takes about 7-10 minutes of repeated BATTERY LOW interruptions before the earbuds die compleatly so I don't know how much of that is the battery percentage being inaccurate or the constant BATTERY LOW interruptions between audio. Don't waste your time or money on this product. Not worth the headache."
1,"Sound quality is not good att all ,they get distorted real easy."
1,Very happy with this purchase so far. Tried it while doing weight training and they did not get in the way at all. I am going to do HIIT today and will update. Great headphones!
1,Works great for me... love to use at the gym.
1,"Lightweight and durable.<br /><br />I've had more than 5 pairs of wireless bluetooth earbuds and the Senso ones are the BEST. It's true that they have about a 30 foot connectivity radius. I definitely recommend the blue/black version.<br /><br />I run about 70 miles a week, and usually my ears get sweaty. But these earbuds stay.<br /><br />The only problem now is finding a good iPhone armband...<br /><br />Also customer service? WOW. They got back to me in 2 hours on Christmas Eve."
1,"Had a pair of earbuds that only stayed charged for 2 hours, these have lasted over 9, LOVE them!"
1,Great value. Quality and comfort compares to much more expensive alternatives.
1,Great headphones. No issues pairing with my phone and they're super comfortable.
0,"While using, they cut out &amp; back on."
1,"Great headphones for the price.  I've had them about 2 weeks and gone on 6 or 7 runs with them.  Took a bit of adjusting with the different size tips but once I got the right size they stay snugly in place, pairing with my iPhone 6s took 10 seconds.  Battery has only been charged once and still shows some life left after about 6 hours of use.  Sound is good, not great (a bit muddy), but for the price the overall rating can't be beat."
1,"Bought these as a gift for a family member, so far he is really happy with them.<br />He likes the features, sound quality and fit."
1,Works good for the price.
1,"Just received them so these are initial impressions. Only reason not 5 stars is I want to see how they hold up.<br /><br />They come with a nice case, a dual USB car adapter, a short charging cable and a 3 foot dual use cable (USB to lightning or mini USB). I didn't expect the extras so it was a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />They are well made and very comfortable to wear. I have worn them to the gym on the treadmill and they<br />stay put. They were easy to pair with my iPhone, the controls easy to use and the sound quality is good.<br /><br />Update: My teenage grandson liked mine so much I ordered a second pair for him. He is very pleased with them also"
1,"I needed a good pair or wireless headphones to use during my workouts. I read the great reviews these headphones got and I couldn't agree more. I've been wearing them off and on for a week or so. The sound is incredible and I've experienced no ear fatigue. Plus they stay put during active workouts. All the extras like charging cables, a selection of various ear bud sizes, car charger and more make this purchase hard to beat. I am more than impressed  and pleased with this pair of Senso headphones. I hope to have them for a long time."
1,I happy about this product I recommend  arrived  on time sound excelent buy it don't think to much
1,"This is my first pair of running headphones but I'm very very pleased with the quality of the product. They stay on well and I don't have to fidget with them while working out which is often my issue. I think the sound quality is also great and I was pleasantly surprised to receive a car charging port, two chargers, and a carrying case which I wasn't expecting (obviously didn't read the whole description). I say buy it if you want a solid quality headphone that stays on well for a very reasonable price."
1,My husband and I absolutely love these little headphones. They work better than most of the over the head wireless headsets.  I also love the fact that even if I turned the volume up the person next to me is not hearing my music. The only issue I have is that when I'm working out and sweating the cord sometimes sticks to my neck or shirt and pulls the ear plug loose from my ear. But overall they are a perfect fit for those who like bass.
1,"Hey everyone.<br /><br />I purchased these because I drive a lot and my car doesn't have Bluetooth capability. In my state, it  is very frowned upon to hold your phone up while driving so a Bluetooth headset was the best option. Big beats headphones would certainly have gotten the job done but for driving I don't think total noise cancellation is such a good idea. These seem to serve my purposes fine. As other reviewers have stated, this product has very good sound and feels soft and comfortable. The design is appealing to any one who moves frequently, whether you're a house wife who's got to clean room to room all day or a professional runner.<br /><br />BUT: Because I purchased this product for driving purposes, hands-free dialing was the feature that ultimately lead me to buy these. The hands-free dialing is very misleading. They have a feature where you can hit the main button twice to dial the last number you called, and that's it. There is no voice dialing., so you'd better hope that the last person you called is the next person you want to call or else you're going to have to ask Siri/Cortana/Ok Google.<br /><br />The good news is if you've got hands free dialing on your cell phone you can use the feature without pressing any buttons. For instance, I've got an iPhone  6s that allows me to &#34;Hey Siri&#34; without pressing a button, and that feature on the iPhone translates fine to the Bluetooth headset. Overall I'm really pleased. I'm also posting pictures of the instruction manual in case anyone wants to take a glance at the features before they purchase. Cheers!"
0,"For me, the comfort and fit was sub-standard compared to my Plantronic which I've used for years. Also the sound quality was horrid. This was a dud I'm afraid."
0,Invotek sent a non-working used one instead of a new one. It is poor customer service to mix used and new equipment without telling buyers (or poor product management.)  It had 'Jeff' on the box from in red marker.  The box was missing pieces and the headset was missing buttons. Too bad. Will order a different brand.
1,Too big for my ears
1,"I am completely impressed with the packaging, all accessories included, the comfort of the SENSO headphones, how they're designed, and how the operate. I have only used these headphones for a couple of weeks, however, they are easily considered the best headphones I have used for the value, quality and the price. SENSO should be taking over the market by doing things right. Totally impressed!"
0,Stopped working after a week. Dead!  Wont recharge. And no response when I try to get a refund or new item.<br />The best ear phones the short time it worked.
1,"Just received these and am very happy, went for a run and they stayed in my ears very well. Sound is very good and I would recommend these."
1,Great value.  Easy to use
1,comfortable and fits well!!
1,"Really like the headphones. You get what you paid for and so much more. In the description it warned you that they don't work very well if you're not within a three foot radius however a couple feet here or there doesn't make too much of a difference and I like that. They do tend to fall off a little bit if I try running however I think that just has something to do with my ears rather than the headphones themselves. Sound quality is really great, it can even block out surrounding noises. Perfect for working out. Easy to use and charge. I'd definitely recommend to someone looking for bluetooth headphones."
1,Best wireless earphones I have purchased!
1,"Great product, very satisfied.  I will definitely recommend it.<br />This is the second one I buy.  Love it."
1,"I can honestly say, I was pretty sceptical about a pair of $20 bluetooth headphones. But I was very surprised!! The overall quality is amazing, they're comfortable, sound great & the battery life is fantastic. I also cant say enough about the customer service experience, they've replaced 2 pairs of headphones for me, even though the first pair was my fault entirely. I highly recommend these headphones!"
0,Earphones worked for a day and then stopped pairing. Real junk.
1,Senso buds
1,"Great look, sound and quality. Agree with the positive reviews which helped me select this item."
1,it's very good
1,"Love these! Why did I wait so long to purchase?!? Stay in while jogging, walking, lifting."
0,"I can't figure out why these have such a high rating. Maybe it's because I'm a bit of an audiophile, but these earbuds don't sound good at all!"
0,Liked these to start with but after having them for only 3 months they won’t charge nor hold a charge now.
1,I have had the headphones only a few days but I am very happy with them.
1,Love my new ear buds  and they are really great fro the price and all you get! My only suggestion is a tad firmer earpiece the bendy over the ear piece is just a tad toobendy and could be a bit firmer and still vry comfortable
1,"I got these for Christmas because I needed a pair of bluetooth headphones for when I go on my runs. When I saw them on buzzfeed and various other websites, I decided to give them a shot. They work fine when I am just sitting stationery, but when I use them while running, they fall out of my ears within 10 minutes of my starting. After 30 minutes of putting them back into my ears every so often, the sound quality gets a little weird and fuzzy even if my phone is less than a foot away and they are fully charged. The hooks are way too long for my ears, and the earbud itself is also too big. I do not recommend these for anyone with small-ish ears, but if you have normal sized or larger ears, these are a good quality lower price option"
1,Love them!!! Product blew me away!!!! You won't regret this purchase. I am using them for gym time and I love it! Going to give them out for Christmas presents also. Great product. :)
1,Awesome
1,I've had a pair similar to these before and I love them. So I've enjoyed them before and lost them as well.
1,Its OK but does not have the Headphone advanced features I expected.
1,So far soo good after a few weeks. Holds charge well and very comfortable
1,"Very good sound. The battery lasts a long time per charge.<br />After 6 months I had an issue I believe to be battery-related. After a short time attempting to remedy the matter, they sent me a new pair. They say they have a no quibble warranty..... They are correct."
1,"Great, fast service and appears to be a great product at a great price!!"
1,These are reliable and well made... but way too bassy. If they can fix the equalization on these they'd be perfect.
1,The Bluetooth connected right away. Clear sound. I use them when I run. This far they have been perfect. The ear bud has a comfortable fit and hooks around my ear so they do not fall off during my run. This was a good purchase.
1,"It fit awkwardly in my ears. The issue appeared to be more with how my ears are situated on my head than the product. This style typically does not work for my abnormally small ears. The sound, though, was good, and the product should work well in other situations."
0,I bought this product becasue of a large number of the high positive reviews. Product arrived as promised. The usb charging cable could not be inserted into the connector on the earpiece. It appears that the female connector in the earpiece was deformed. No way to charge the device so no way to even try it. The plastic cover over the micro circuit board also popped off while I was trying to insert the charging cable. I returned it immediately.<br /><br />Quality control should not have allowed this item to leave the factory.
1,"I work overnight maintenace and needed something wireless so i could get thru the night, so far these are pretty awesome. The sound is clear, the bass hits better than most wired headphones in the same price range. So far after one night of use, they lasted just over 8 hours of none stop playing, Not sure how much longer they would of lasted off a single charge.<br /><br />They are comfortable, the 'softness' of the ear hooks doesnt seem to be a problem, If i had to list a negative? I would say the wire is a little to short, But its my first time with this style of buds and might just need to ajust."
1,"I upgraded from an older set of Senso headphones (cat got hungry), the flexible ear wraps are very nice. All in all, great headphones."
1,I bought this product for my 14 year old grandson . He LOVES THEM .  Great sound !!  100% SATISFIED !!
1,Very impressed with the SENSO Bluetooth Headphones!!  Very good quality and durable!
1,Comfortable!
1,Battery life doesn't seem to be as long as expected but the clarity is excellent. Good highs mids and lows
1,Like them so far...a. bit bulky but good quality. I would recommend them to a friend.
1,As advertised
0,"Everything worked awesome until today. Been using the headphones on and off over a period of almost a year.<br /><br />But today, I was ready to go out and exercise and headphones won't turn on."
1,"These headphones work great! I purchased these after reading all the positive reviews and with the price of $36, I couldn't pass them up. I bought these because my department had been moved into a shared cubicle space. Wired headphones plugged into the computer were very limiting. With these, I can listen to music while working and not get tangled up in the cord, but they also aren't so noise cancelling that I am still able to hear if someone is trying to talk to me. I've also used these at home while cleaning. The only downside is you have to keep the phone in your line of sight, otherwise the Bluetooth will start to cut in and out, but you can get a nice distance away from the phone. If you're on the fence about these, I would definitely recommend them."
0,"They were great until the the volume cover came off! Only bought it in July, see pic so you can see what happened! This should be replaced for free!!"
1,I was expecting Bose grade audio so it is not bad but the base would be nicer if it was a bit deeper. I will follow up on battery life in future reviews.<br />Nice it comes with the car charger and such though.
1,Great headphones! Easy to set up and use
1,easy to setup... I give the sound a thrums up.
0,"After 3 month of use, stopped working and now it's not even charging."
1,These headphones are great.  Came with lots of accessories and a nice case.  Sound is good.  Pairing with my phone was a breeze.
1,"Good sound quality for my basic needs (gym, bus rides etc.)<br />I like that they're pretty loud, but don't really lack sound clarity.<br />I love the foam ear bud - so comfy! the overall design is pretty comfortable too.<br />battery has been lasting pretty long for me, but I haven't used it continuously for too long."
1,These fit well and stay on my head when I jog.
1,"Sound is great, no complaints with the quality.  I have smallish ears, and they are a bit oversized for me & don't wrap around my ears well; this is not a comment on the quality of the headphones."
1,i love using this to drown people out
1,"Nice sound. Pretty good fit in the ears. Reasonably easy to operate, although the volume buttons are a tad small. Very attractive packaging."
1,"I really like the sound quality of the wireless earbuds, however for people with small ears they do not fit very secure. They kept falling off, which was irritating. The over the ear piece is not adjustable or bendable to wrap around. But again, they sound super good! Noise cancellation FIVE stars! I don’t hear NOTHING! That was the one thing kept me giving it 5 stars. Your ears may be bigger than mines and fit perfectly, mines not so much. I have to find another pair now, I need something more snug. I wish they came with changeable over the ear pieces they would get 10 stars from me!"
1,"My husband has a pair of Jaybird wireless headphones that he paid much more for and they constantly fell out of my ears during my workout. I have used the SENSO headphones for a variety of workouts, including HIIT training, yoga, kickboxing, and running and I did not have to adjust these once. That is HUGE!  The sound quality is perfect for me. I have had a few instances where I received a distorted sound, but it was from the bluetooth signal being blocked. I moved my phone each time and it corrected the problem. If you need a pair of wireless headphones for working out and you don't want to be bothered with readjusting you need to buy these."
1,"​Thanks, Kenneth:<br /><br />Congrats on a great product!<br /><br />First charge & pairing went flawlessly.  Have not (and probably will not) use mic function ...but it's good to have.<br /><br />As a THANK YOU for reaching out, please watch for an email concerning our media-oriented podcast, Brandwidth On Demand.<br />I'm happy to offer you a FREE &#34;incubator&#34; podcast marketing flight.<br /><br />Details to follow at your company email."
0,mine came with a ear wax!!! the headphones were used and full of ear wax. ugh!!!
0,"I have previously purchased a pair of these headphones, and was very happy.  Unfortunately, I ended up losing them, and so decided to repurchase them.  Something has changed.  The ear-hooks are now so weak, they don't effective work as a ""hook"".  They too easily just bend out of shape.  I used to have no problem running with my old pair... but with this new pair, I can't even keep them in my ears while working out on a bench.  Additionally, with this new pair, I have to charge them much more frequently.  Right now, I have to charge them about every other day."
1,I am very satisfied with the quality of sound and being able to listen to music without having a cord in the way while I'm working outside.
1,"I understood that these were nothing compatible to more expensive noise cancelling headphones but, as expected they were what I wanted for the price. I am very happy and will buy them for my kids."
0,Died out of the blue after few months and it's too bad because they were AMAZING for the price. Will revise if can get manufacturer (not seller) to stand by warranty.
1,"I love these little guys.  Sounds great and I can now leave my MP3 player at home.  I can't get the pause/play feature to work, but other than that, I'm very happy with my purchase."
1,So far loving them & hope they hold up to expectations.
1,"""Second pair bought. Awesome sound quality."""
1,"So far, they're okay.  I must have weird ears, because when I run, they tend to slowly work their way out of my ears.  I have to keep pushing them back in.  When I'm working out, they stay in.  My old earpieces worked great.  They never moved when I ran.  It's nice to not have to worry about the headphone cords getting caught when I'm working out.  I'll give it some time before I give my final word.  3 stars so far."
1,I like my new Bluetooth earphones I just wish that they did my earlobes better.
1,"Seriously fking great if you want comfortable ear bud style headphones. Holds a long charge and gets good distance from my phone. Main thing I love is the foam style ear piece. I wear these all day at work and they never bother my ears. Tried 5 brands off Amazon so far that were under $100, these by far are the best"
1,"After going through 2 pairs of Beats headphones, I was done paying up for a brand name. These headphones deliver unbelievable sound quality, never lose connection, and fit comfortably in my ear. In my opinion, you can't find a better price point for such a quality set of headphones. Do yourself the favor and ditch the &#34;brand name&#34; game and go with these -- you won't be let down."
1,These are awesome!! Very happy with them!!!
1,Great product and great value..I was so happy with the purchase I ended up buying 3 more...one for each of my family members ! Five stars for Senso Bluetooth Earbuds!
1,The voice quality is great and it stays on your ears very steady.
1,"I liked everything about this set of headphones, except the sound... I ended up returning for that reason. For this price, I think that they are worth it!"
1,Works great
1,It is hard for me to understand what $149 Apple pods do better.
1,"Great quality, excellent packaging. Stays in ears firmly while running. Great sound & easy to connect to Iphone."
1,Sound is somewhat iffy. Clear but earpieces get uncomfortable with prolonged use. Quality definitely has room for improvement but headphones were only about $30. Definitely better to save money for something more comfortable and reliable.
1,"Arrived on time. Works great, quality sound and I like how I can answer using the buttons on the headphones and also pause and change tracks. Good buy for sure!"
0,"The sound was great when they worked for the first couple of months. They stayed on well when I did anything from running to lifting. My biggest issue with these was the quality. My first pair lasted maybe six months. I wrote to the company and they sent me another pair. The pair I received looked like it had been chewed on by a dog on the earpiece. I let it go because it wasn’t a deal breaker. Then, low and behold another six months go by and they won’t turn on because the rubber had torn and the cable fiber split in half. If I wasn’t at the gym using these, they were stored in the case it came with. Supremely dissatisfied and I hope no one else has to experience this frustration."
0,I had the product for 14 days. I did 10 workouts. I sweat through them. Not a good product.
1,These are great cheap headphones. They definitely cut down the sound. Not like the expensive noise canceling headphones but enough to enjoy what you’re listening to. I wish they had longer battery life.
1,Love these. The sound is better than a more expensive pair that haven't lasted very long. I hope these have better longevity . My only negative comment is that the very nice charger that is sent doesn't fit the earbuds. There is another charger included. I'm not sure of the purpose of the nice one.
1,Best Bluetooth headphones ever! I have already told my friends.<br />Thanks. Keep up the good work!
1,Buy now. ... This is an unbelievable deal for what you get.<br />The sound quality is very good for the price however I sometimes need to to hit the multifunction button to get a full connection once music starts playing..<br />The multiple sizes of earbud tips  is very nice for getting that perfect fit.<br /><br />The value for the money is incredible.<br />I'm going to order another set for my mom.
1,"They're good headphones, nice sound to them. But my only complaint would be the right side bass already blew out. Otherwise good headphones. Nice enough deal for the pricing"
1,"I bought these wireless earbuds for 19$ and I expected it to be mediocre. Well, these are actually very good. First off these come with many accessories like a car charger, iPhone/Earbuds charger, and a carrier for these earbuds. Now for the earbuds themselves I have only been using them for a few days but from what I have experienced so far they are good, they fit on your ears and don't hurt your ears after 30 minutes-1 hour of usage. They also have good range and the Bluetooth connection never just dies randomly.<br /><br />5 Star this is actually a legit review so yeah l0l"
1,"One of the Best Headphones i've ever have. They have a nice bass which i like and to top it off, its a pretty good noise canceling headphones which i wanted and its for a good deal. the only problem is that it feels way different than my 1st one which someone stole from me and my second feels too different. hopefully its just that its brand new or it can be a fake."
1,These turned out really good!<br />Very easy to use and very comfortable and convenient. The sound is great and the mic works amazingly. I have nothing negative to say about this item.
1,"The headphones were pretty good; I thought everything was coming loud and clear, but when I was on the phone with my mom, she swore everything was staticky on her end. The issue isn’t as bad now, though. The hooking around the ears was awkward, but I managed.<br /><br /> The tough part for me was whenever I wanted to use just one side, like at work at my desk, it would hang heavy to one side, if I’m not careful, will tug on the cinch that’s on the back; in fact, I lost one for that reason. I thought you can just hang them around you neck when not in use, but they will shift from one side to the other. It’s been yanked by my seatbelt, scarf as I take them off. Plus, they don’t always stay connected; my phone will ring, and instead of being able to touch the button to answer, I have to pick my audio source on the phone to hear. It’s a great pair of headphones for the price, but it was also a little awkward because this is my first pair of headphones like these; normally I’d been getting the LG ones that hung solid on your neck."
0,Poor quality. Lasted a month and the button broke and it won't turn on. Can't return it.
1,"I love it, battery life and everything else are good."
1,to listen to music while I work.
0,I returned these...they were so flimsy and would not stay in place.
1,THE BEST I EVER HAD.. Great product. Sound is amazing. Gray battery life fast charging. I will order it again...
1,Great product and GREAT price if less than $75.
1,Purchased for privacy. They work great. The price was also great .
1,Great Bluetooth headset for the money.  Company very responsive to customer satisfaction
1,Bought these for my wife while she works out in the gym and this is what she said:  Great sound! Easy to work! Don't fall off! Sweat proof! Overall best pair I've owned! Very satisfied!
1,"Better than expected, but just wish it had a forever battery life.<br /><br />It's been a bit over 5 years now.  The plastic holding the two ear pieces together have begun to peel off (The ear phones still work). The battery life seems to be okay after 5 years, maybe last about 3 or 4 hours of listening time. the earbud cushion have fallen off, and on my 4th set due to just it falling off.  Now i squeeze a small drop of crazy glue on them to keep them from falling off(I can never find a perfect cushion for them).  After 5 years it's still kicking, not like when it was in it's youth, but still great for the gym. Well worth the money."
1,"Great for working out , music is very clear and very valuable headsets"
1,the headhpones are pretty good for the money
0,They broke in like 2 months.
1,Got these for my boyfriend. He uses them at work everyday and is impressed how great they work.
1,I think the fit and sound is great. I actually owned a pair of beats last year and think these are better. They are lighter and were easier to connect to iPhone.
1,"I am a college student and I use these headphones about every day. Either walking to class or going to the gym, they are perfect for any type of activity. If you are working out and would like a pair where the cord is not in the way, these would be helpful. They are Bluetooth and have a small cord, so they can still hang around your neck and will not be in your way.<br /><br />The headphones have great sound quality for the price. The base is good and not over the top. If you are looking for something to help you cut out sounds around you, these do a great job. These headphones have a voice action control, which is nice because it tells you when your battery is getting low, when the headphones are on/off and when someone is calling you. They will stop the music when someone is calling, to give you the chance to answer.<br /><br />Many people have difficulty finding headphones that are comfortable and that fit well. If you are like me and have small ears, finding headphones that do not fall out is impossible. These finally fix that problem. They have hooks that wrap around your ear, helping them stay on. It comes with different size buds, so you will be able to change to what fits you best. Not only do they fit my ear, they are also very comfortable. I have had them on for over 3 hours and never felt any discomfort. If you tend to sweat a lot, you will not need to worry. These headphones are waterproof and will not cause discomfort or damage.<br /><br />The battery life is impressive for these headphones. I wear them for about 2 hours every day and I only have to charge them about once a week. It only takes about an hour to charge. These headphones are easy to connect to your smart phone. The first time you have to let them sync. But every time after that, they will automatically sync when you have your Bluetooth and headphones on.<br /><br />The only con I have about these headphones is the charging port. It is tough to open and it takes a little bit to get used to. It is very flimsy and could easily fall off. If you don’t mind the charging port to be showing, it might be easier to just take that off.<br /><br />Overall, great headphones for only $30. I would highly recommend if you are looking to not spend much, great sound, good quality and comfortable headphones."
0,I was pretty content for what I paid for when I got these headphones. I'm a bit disappointed at the moment as I can hear a sort of &#34;humming&#34; sound whenever there's bass in audio. I'm not sure why but the sound quality is not the same. I am tempted to buy another pair and hope that it was because of sweat or damaged in my pocket but at the same time I hope it's not because the speakers get blown easily or are faulty. I enjoyed the battery life but not the faint humming they have now :(
0,When I buy it for the first it was very nice but now material are not good.
1,"Great headphones! Very high quality,  noise cancelling.  I would definitely buy again."
1,"Sound EQ is terrible, you need to adjust equalizer on your listening device.<br />Otherwise, they're cheap and useful."
1,"One of the best headphones I’ve ever owned, you won’t regret it."
1,Loving them so far.
0,"don't buy, i thought buying a bluetooth with wired earbuds would circumvent the issue of one earbud going dead, but lo and behold still happens.  after a couple months the right earbud, the one with the charge port no less stopped working. on top of that amazon will only offer a 80% refund because it broke after 30 days.<br /><br />noise cancellation is weak too, does a poor job blocking ambient noise. sound quality was ok but tinny while it worked."
1,"This is the second set I’ve bought!  They’re easy to use, comfortable to wear,good tone.  All as promised!!"
0,The control on/off stopped working after about 15 times used.
0,Couldnt stay connected. Static-y when it was. Returned pretty quickly.
0,Skip of sound when I walk with phone in my pocket. And the wind noise is loud. Maybe good in gym but do not work outside
1,"I saw a guy wearing the Beats version of these and they looked great and functional. I looked up the price of those and thought. &#34;not so fast&#34;. A little research led to these babies and boy am I glad. I am very aware these types of devices are going to be covered in sweat, jostled and dropped and I did not think paying $200 bucks made sense. These buds are very well designed, come in a great case with all the needed cables, and they sound very good. The light and flexible ear wraps are comfortable and hold these pretty securely. I bought these so I could listen to music to propel my gym workouts and to cover up the &#34;clang-boom&#34; of the knuckleheads who think that picking up heavy weights and dropping them is good exercise.<br />Now I get to explore my  free Amazon Prime music collection while getting fit and I don't have to be distracted by the Neanderthals dropping their weights! Hurray."
1,My package was stolen off my front porch so never got to use them.  But I'm sure they're great lol
1,The sound is crisp and sharp. They are a little bulky.
1,"I bought the Bluetooth headphones for my son for his birthday and he loves them.  He uses them while working and has had a couple of different brands and told me that these are the best he has had, so thank you."
1,They are awesome and the battery lasts about 7 hours. It is a good buy.
0,"ok it has a very good sound, noise cancelling and all. the thing is the lowest possible volume is still loud for me, and dont get me wrong i like it, but sometimes i need to keep it down to be aware or just to not get my ears used to so much loudness and hurt them. So I wouldn't recommend this for daily use... and the other downside is that the part that goes around your ear (in each headphone) is useless beacuse its just really soft rubber that wont wrap anything to stay put, the earplug itself goes so deep (sometimes it even hurts) in the ear that it doesn't need the wrapparoung ear thingy. and if it did need it would be usefull since that rubber won't hold anything.<br />sooo Not what i was looking for, i wanted to run with these, ill have to look for something else that wraps and holds to my ear while i run instead of going deep inside my ear..<br /><br />After 1 year of moderate use the left side isn’t working anymore..."
1,"For the price, the sound from these earphones is great. My reason for a non 5-star rating is that they don't stay in the ear canal very well. I've tried wearing them to crossfit and I'm constantly having to fidget with them to keep them in place. When running they bounce out as well ."
1,Needed something that fit to my ear. Not me trying to fit in it.
1,I own these as well as the S-255.  One thing that surprises me is the bass. These things sound great.  The battery life is a huge plus. It really is 8-9 hours.  Would easily recommend these.
1,"Purchased this item just for temporary use but upon receiving and use of the item the sound quality, durabilit, and design of the item amazed me. I guess this is no longer a temporary item. I highly recommend the Senso Bluetooth headphones for every runner that doesn't want to spend so much. Let's face it! It costs too much to enjoy running."
1,Nice sound. I use it for the cycling trainer. Buttons on the side are a little fiddly - easy to accudentally pause the training when you adjust them in your ears. Different bus sized provided which is really good. Overall a really nice package.
1,They are great and comfortable. The sound on them are amazing.
1,I love these! Only thing i wish they had is a skip button on them
1,This is my 2nd pair because my first one was stolen.
1,"These are a little chunky and plastic, but if they worked well it would be overlooked. In this case, they do not work for cycling as the wind nose renders them unusable. It sounds like someone is blowing in to the microphone and drowns out whatever you're listening to. Also, the controls are not easy to use with gloves."
1,The first pair I bought tended to get warm during use and lasted less than an hour.  I contacted customer service and they shipped another pair to me immediately.<br />The earphones are very comfortable.  The mic works well for phone use and the sound fidelity is well above the average.  You cannot beat these earphones for the price.
0,"I ordered these several years ago and unfortunately my puppy ate the the first set. She's okay. And the quality was great! Then the second set and accidentally closed them n the car door. I reorderd my third set because the battery life and quality was great for the value.<br /><br />But the set that came the charger cable did not fit the the device and I returned it for replacement. The replacement set did not fit either. I found the cable from the first and second set and it fit.<br /><br />When you turn on the headset you hear an Asian accent voice say ""Power on"". The first two sets did not have an accent. Truly a sign that this is made in China. Because the set does not hold a charge like the original one purchased, I'm ditching these and looking for something more reliable."
1,Great product. Fantastic value for a very high quality product.
1,worked well
1,This earbuds sound awesome and stay in my ears comfortably when I'm working out at the gym. Got them for an awesome price so I bought my wife a set and she loves them too!
1,"Really comfortable to use during workouts, I really like them!"
0,Wicked painful on the inner ear and alot bulkier than what good gym headphones are suppoed to be. I’d recommend saving up and upgrading to the jbl reflect mini bluetooth headphones for 60 bucks. Theyll outlast their year-long warranty and you’ll actually want to wear them to the gym.
1,These headphones sound great !easy bluetooth connection. I am so suprised for the price the quality and they are loud ! I have never heard of senso before mos def happy with my purchase. I am glad i gave these a shot instead of spending all that money on beats
1,Love them! Great that they included smaller pieces to fit my small ears. Work great
1,So far so good.  These are my third pair of bluetooth headphones that I've bought in the last two years.  The other two broke.  What I like about this pair is that the on/off switch is large and audibly notifies you when you've disconnected from your music source and when you've powered them off.
1,Excelente estoy feliz
0,Was very sastisfied until last week when it stopped working.
1,I like these a lot. I use them for listening and working out. I have hard to fit ears and the only ones that work for me are the foam pads. Luckily these headphones came with the foam ends along with several other kinds. The quality of sound is very good compared to others I have. Good bass and good overall clarity. I especially like the over the ear clips that help keep them in place when I work out.
0,If i could give it a negative star i would not worth the money at all
1,"I have only had these headphones for a short amount of time, but straight out of the packaging I started listening to music within seconds. Immediately had a 5 hour listening session trying to find something that didn't sound good on these headphones, listened to everything from hip hop to metal to salsa to merengue and everything in between and everything sounded crisp, clear, and loud even without cranking the volume. And also most importantly the headphones never were uncomfortable even having them on for the 5 hours straight. &#34;These are the best headphones you can get, even better than other expensive ones.&#34;"
1,This is the 3rd pair Ive purchased. My mom saw me wearing mine to cut grass and liked them. She said she’d love a pair for Mother’s Day. Very good quality for the price. 1st pair is over 3 years old. I lost them and bought another. The first pair got found and still wrk perfectly.
0,"Battery life isn't as long as I had expected. I feel like I only get a good 6 hours of listening time. The battery indicator that shows up on my iPhone isn't accurate, either. the voice starts saying &#34;low battery&#34; around 30% (according to my phone), and once it starts to say &#34;low battery,&#34; you've only got about 5 minutes of listening time left before it shuts off.<br /><br />The Bluetooth connection on these headphones is terrible. The connection is interrupted BY MY OWN BODY. If I turn my head away from my phone, which I wear in a belt on the front of my body, the audio gets crackly and cuts out until I'm looking dead-ahead again. Forget 30 feet - maybe these will connect at 20 feet if there's nothing but air interfering. Maybe.<br /><br />Some bluetooth headphones don't specifically say that they work with Siri (to activate it, anyway), but you can get it to work, like the last pair of QY7 headphones I had. You just have to hold the multi-function button *just* long enough to activate Siri, but not quite long enough to shut the power off. I can assure you, this will not work with these headphones. I've tried just about everything.<br /><br />Other headphones have the ability to scan tracks, or to skip back 15 seconds on podcasts, but these do not. They work exactly as advertised - you can only skip whole tracks backward or forward by holding down the +/- volume buttons. Don't get your hopes up that they'll work in any different way.<br /><br />The one thing I really do love is the ear hooks, which is the main reason I bought these. They are much softer and more flexible than I imagined, but because they are a rubberized material, they seem to hold onto your hears more by the grip of the material, not so much as an ear &#34;clip.&#34; They feel much more secure when running and working out than other in-ear headphones. I've also had a hard time wearing the cord over the back of my neck with other headphones, because eventually they'll creep to one side and one ear will be pulled out. Haven't had that problem with these. Maybe because the cord is smoother, and most likely because of these ear hooks keeping the ear bud IN my ear! The only problem I've run into is fitting the ear hooks when I wear glasses running. I'll forego the ear hooks on my next purchase.<br /><br />They have a good waterproof rating, but be warned that if you shower with them or they get more than just a little wet, the audio gets crackly until they dry back out again. I feel comfortable showering with them if I'm not going to wash my hair, so that's a plus, but not if I'm going to have water directly splashing onto them."
1,I bought this after trying a coplue of wireless earphones (TREBLAB & MPOW ) and sony wirless head phone and this product is worth the price. However if you are looking for great bass then i will recommend TREBLAB XR 500 which has the same design and feel. But if you are looking for Good sound and battery life and then this earphone is great. The only complaint i have is the siri compatibily to make calls and volume controls which doesn't work with this model.
1,Great headphones.  The previous review I posted was meant for a different pair of headphones by a different seller
1,"I have owned several different pairs of bluetooth sports headphones but nothing compares to the value, quality, and generosity of these so far.  The price is a good balance - all of the others I bought were way too expensive.  Yet, the quality was the surprise - I thought for the good price I would get poor quality but the care put into the construction of these, the packaging surrounding them, the audio output (including noise cancellation), the carrying case to protect them, the way they seem to be durably made to last a long time, and the extras included, simply blew me away - it was a delight.  Finally, the generosity of the company - providing extras (the car mount, the card holder, and even this arm band) were a total surprise - something I haven't seen a company do in years - I wanted to express how appreciative I am and simply cannot express the surprise and joy it brought me.  Please don't change anything - keep a good balance (so that you earn well but customers save enough), keep working on quality, and don't let accounting folks tell you that delighting people (with extras) will lead to decreased bottom line - it will cause your product to get recommended to others and will continue to be a bestseller, well reviewed, etc.<br /><br />(NOTE: I've owned these five days now - will update this review if any negative experiences or more positive ones arise over time)<br /><br />Update 6/8/2019 - It has been a few more days and I've exhausted the battery first time  - charging now.  The first chink in the armor is found but it is really a design choice.  I got a warning 'low battery' during exercise and was hoping it was like an hour away warning and would happen every ten minutes or so.  The warning was about once every two minutes.  And I was about six to eight minutes away it seems.  Then device shutdown leaving me a little bit miffed.<br />I doubt firmware updates can happen on these - so want to make a suggestion for future batches of this product: Please have it announce battery level much earlier and less often (hour away ideally, every ten minutes).  Add a 'battery about to run out' (or 'battery critical') at the six-eight minutes mark.  And ideally, if possible, have it announce battery level (yes, 'high', 'medium', 'low', 'critically low') at initial power up.  If you make a set with these features, please let us know, I'll gladly buy another set (and will use these as my backup then).<br />Not enough to take any stars away - I'll work around it but would rather not run out of battery via surprise again in the future."
1,Worth every penny. Don't waste your money on big name brands.
0,"I couldn't say. They never worked, I plugged them in charged them a bit. Never kicked in to pairing mode. Lousy brand, they make Woman's shoes. Weird but true. That's like Sony making high heels. Lousy lousy headphones and price is ridiculously high. Dollar tree headphones work better."
1,I like and recommend this product because once the battery is full I can use it for eight hour working shift.
1,works perfect
1,"Great for the money. If you want extremely good sound, go elsewhere"
0,"These headphones look good but can't handle tough conditions i.e HEAT. I received these in May and love to run/cycle indoors and outdoors but they have stopped working after just 2 months. These headphones simply can't handle sweat. I run and consider myself an avg sweater, but these just stop working after about 35min of running or cycling due to sweat. It is now almost 2 months since I bought these and they have stopped working. No return possible so just wasted almost $40!"
1,I enjoy the sound and the range of connectivity is outstanding. Retaining hooks are flimsy however and the headphones dont stay in my ear. They require frequent adjustment. I use them at work and my hands are always dirty so readjusting them isnt something i want to do a lot.
1,"Bought two pair of these, one for working out and one for traveling. Love 'em!! Great sound, great fit, great price! The only reason I didn't give a 5 star rating is durability - I haven't had them long enough to know how well they hold up, So far, they've been super!"
1,"Best wireless headphones! I had a pair of jay birds, which I hated and never used. So uncomfortable, never stayed in place. I was extremely hesitant to buy another pair of wireless headphones, but these were highly recommended by my friend. I use them in the gym and they stay put, no matter how sweaty. I lost my first pair – ordered a second!<br /><br />[EDIT] - had an issue with the new pair, excellent customer service, resolved within hours!"
1,I was surprised at the sound quality and at such a great value. It also is vary well built stays out of the way when you work out and stays in your ear. I have had other sport Bluetooth headsets befor but I can say these are promising to be the best I've ever had and used. And they are not expensive. It truly is a five star product.
1,Couldn't have been easier to set up and use! Listening to music I enjoy while working out is a treat.
1,Really good headphones. Great when I am working out.
0,Worked great for a while but the bluetooth stopped working after about 8 months
1,Great product.  My last headphones where Jaybirds and cost about three times as much.  I like these much better.
1,I use them for running and cutting wood and they work great.
1,Excellent wireless headphones!
1,On time and impressive sound. So far no issues at all.
1,"These headphones are an excellent value.  Not only do they sound great, I have found them to be comfortable and secure.  Invotek really spoils their customers with everything else that they include in the box."
1,"Excellent value and performance. I purchased these headphones because my wife works from home and I didn't want to disturb her.  I use these headphones to,listen to music and watch tv.  They work beautifully.  Pairing is a cinch and the packaging is also excellent.  The sound quality is very good.  Considering the price, you can't go wrong purchasing these headphones.  I would definitely recommend."
0,When they worked in the 1st month they were good but now they wont hold a charge to turn on! Would not buy again!
0,You get what you pay for. Had it for less than a month and the volume up/down buttons have stopped working. Had no connectivity issues otherwise but physically the headphones are very flimsy and the ear-clips are some of the most uncomfortable I have ever used. Be advised the seller also likes to send review reminders (received twice thus far in less than a month). Would have kept the headphones had it not been for the volume button not working but glad it spazzed out now than a few months down the line.
1,"These are the most complete set of bluetooth headphones for running that I have come accross and I have tried several pairs ranging from $20 - $100+. They score highly in terms of comfort, sound, ease of use and packaging/accessories. I am going to purchase another pair for non-running use! Very nice product."
1,This were a birthday gift from my husband. I have really been happy with them! I wear them while running and it’s so nice to not have to deal with tangled cords from traditional ear buds. And a really great price!
1,Great wireless headphones!  Have been using them daily for a minimum 2 hours a day and only have had to charge them once in the past week.  Would highly recommend!
1,It worked great for about 4 months and then one day it stopped holding a charge. I received excellent customer service from the company in resolving the issue.
1,"product is outstanding... sound is good, and it's easy to use... great for walking or in the gym.<br /><br />one thing i did that the manufacturer might want to think of is i added one of those little plastic aligator clips so i can clip it to my shirt while i'm working out or walking, or pretty much anything... this way i i don't have to worry about it if the earpiece falls off.<br /><br />good product"
1,For the price I am not sure there is a better product in its class. The battery lasts easily 12 hours and the sounds quality is pretty good!
1,"Excellent price, Excellent product. You get so much more than u paid for. As good as Beats...but for less money."
1,Great for listening to music. Have been told I sound like I am talking through a tube.
0,Was very sastisfied until last week when it stopped working.
1,"Work awesome.  I use them at the gym, running, riding the bike, skiing, you name it. These headphones are great. Battery lasts forever and they charge quickly.  I highly recommend these."
1,Awesome headphones. Great sound and exception noise cancellation. I use them on my runs and they are great.
1,"thank you for your prompt replacement of my senso ear buds.. i love this style, but this pair wouldn't hold a charge"
1,"This was my first purchase of bluetooth earbuds. I reviewed several products from the low to high range and checked the feedback on the various products. I found several features that I felt were important for reliability and performance. They were durability, Android and Kindle Fire compatibility, sound quality, sweat resistance, and secure fit in the ear. Price was also a factor in my consideration because I did not want pay a lot and then be dissatisfied with the product. After reviewing the various earbuds and reading the feedback, I selected the SENSO S-250 earbuds because they advertised the features I was looking for as well as being  at a very reasonable price. They had the highest waterproof rating (IPX7), good playback of 8 hrs, Integrated Mic, control media playback, and hands free calling. The earbuds arrived promptly and I was impressed with the packaging. Usually you unpack the product and throw the box away. The box was well worth keeping to store the various components, booklet, cables etc.  I was impressed with the quality and feel of the product.  I installed the smallest set of ear tips and they stayed securely in the ear while I exercised. I also exercise on an elliptical/ recumbent machine and sweat quite a bit. I was concerned because the earbuds would get wet, but I simply wiped them off after exercising and I did not have problem with the moisture. The earbuds connected to my Android phone and Kindle Fire with no problem. The sound quality was much better than I expected. The base sounded great and yet was not overpowering. The vocal was clear and the volume levels had very good range. It was much better than I expected from a small set of earbuds. I feel it was a very good value for the price and I am very satisfied with my purchase of the S-250 earbuds. I have not yet had a chance to try them on a phone call.  I should point out that I have a background as a Manufacturing Engineer and dealt with quality issues as part of my job so I'm pretty picky. I would like to point out that I paid the advertised price for the earbuds and did not receive any compensation for my feedback."
1,"I have smaller ears and they fit perfectly!  Now I haven't tried any other brands, but to me the sound is great."
1,"Most earbuds fall out, and are uncomfortable.  These are comfortable and the sound is great.  It is a well engineered product."
1,For the price they are great.  They Don’t fall out either
1,"I keep losing them and I keep reordering them... it's with it though,  I love these wireless headphones!!! 😘 great sound and clarity!!!!!"
0,Had the older model and liked them but the ear plug tip broke.<br />So ordered another pair but when i received them noticed the ear hooks were different.<br />To bend them just right it is annoying and will not hold its shape.<br />Very disappointed.
1,"Its okay. When running, it falls out once every 3~ minutes, Cuts out sometimes and the right side is considerably louder than the left side. I hope theres a fix to the inbalance of the headphone sounds."
1,"Comfortable, well-made and decent battery life.  Multiple ear cushions (more than typical) allow for customization which is nice.  Also, does a decent job of blocking out ancillary noise (though not &#34;noise cancelling&#34; in the typical 180 degree out of phase sense... however, those will be well over $150).  For sound quality, freedom from being tethered and comfort... these are a solid value."
1,Great headphones. I like the moldable ear piece so the fit around your ears. I use them while working outside all day.
1,Very satisfied with these
1,I had a pair before that i loved. I broke them and felt i had to get a new pair. This paid people say they cant hear me.
1,I loved my new headphones.  They are very easy to connect.  They quality of the sound is great. They fit well and stay put with exercise.
1,"I've been using these for a few months and I love them. They have a 7-8 hour battery life and the sound quality is great. definitely, recommend."
1,The headphones arrived on time and were very easy to set up to my bluetooth.<br />I am very happy with the headphones and it was great not having to deal with the cord connection to my phone for my work out.
1,Really great earbuds with amazing sound and easy to operate. They are very comfortable. I love the case and all the accessories that came with them as well. Can't beat the price for this quality of sound. Highly recommend these esrbuds!
1,THey are absolutely the best pair of Bluetooth headphones I have ever had.
1,"So far been using it for a couple of months now and it gave me some problem with connectivity, contacted the company and they told me to reset the device. Plug it in to the charger and hold the on button then disconnect it and synced it to the phone again. Well I tried that and it didn't do me any good so I told them that and they are sending a replacement. Very pleasant experience."
1,Most comfortable and best performing bluetooth headphones. I work out hard in the gym and can't stand wires in my way or those big bulky headsets.  The SENSO totally rocks.  Great sound and long battery life. Exactly what I was looking for and I highly recommend them.
1,"I love these ear buds. Easy to use,  comfortable to wear and great sound."
1,Love them and great for working out and for work if you are moving around and need to answer calls.
1,"I've been using these for over 2 months now. These SENSO Headphones are a big upgrade over my previous 'connected' earbuds!<br />Positives: reasonable price, easy to set up and pair with your phone,very lightweight, stay in place while running/walking, microphone works great, sound quality is great, love the pause button and recharge time.<br />Suggestions: I tend to run with the wire in the back of my head. The wire tends to 'twist' and pull on one ear as I run, and I have to keep re-positioning it. I think that a small alligator clip that you could attach to the wire and clip to the back (or front) of your shirt would solve this problem.<br />Overall, I am very happy with this purchase, and would recommend it highly!"
0,This Bluetooth was only good for 2months and I went a gave them a 5 star was telling wonders.I mean this product does last over 3 months.
1,These were very easy to use and set up.  Seem to work great in an exercise environment and the added benefit of being able to answer my phone and have a very good conversation was and added bonus I wasn't anticipating.<br /><br />Also I would like to add that I had a small issue with headphones and contacted customer service and they responded within an hour with resolution to my issue.  Not only did they resolve the issue they followed up to make sure I was completely happy.<br /><br />I would buy this product again without hesitation.
0,"Hooked these ear buds up to the TaoTronic 4.1 Transmitter/Receiver so I could watch TV. They hooked up pretty easily and I got great clear crisp sound. I turned off the TV to do a few things around the house and when I came back to go to bed I turned on the TV and put on the ear buds but got no sound. I had to re-pair the two devices, and this time when I got sound it was distorted and had a hum/hiss in the background and would cut out now and then. I tried several things to fix the problem to no avail and ended up just using my wired headphones.<br />These are really nice comfortable ear buds and when the sound first came on it was clear and loud. I must have gotten a defective set and will be returning them. Too Bad...."
0,I wish I could send it back. Only works within 5 feet otherwise disconnecting. False advertisement.
1,I purchased them based on the high rated reviews. I was not disappointed. Great value.
1,"I have enjoyed using these headphones. Obviously, they are not the best, but they are definitely a set of reasonably priced, wireless headphones that function well for the average user.<br /><br />Pros<br />+ Connect to multiple devices without issue.<br />+ Clearly displayed when on and connected.<br />+ Easy to use, turn on, and connect to a new device.<br />+ Decent battery life.<br />+ Decent microphone.<br />+ Comfortable! Have had no issues with either the earpieces or the over-ear loops being uncomfortable.<br /><br />Cons<br />- Soft buzz/white noise in the earpiece. For me, it is in the left earpiece. If they are turned on, but no music is being played, it is not there. However, as soon as I hit play (when connected to any device) there is a constant white noise that is quite noticeable, especially when music is quite or in between songs. This is the most annoying aspect, but I tend to eventually block it out and ignore it.<br />- Band that connects the two earpieces takes getting used to and breaking in. It is a material that catches if you turn your head. For example, if I turn to the left, it will often grip my shirt and I feel the cord pull on the right side. It has not yanked out (due to over-ear loop), but can be annoying because I have to reposition it each time.<br /><br />For the average user seeking a pair of wireless headphones for exercise or regular portable use, while also not wanting to spend $50+, I would recommend these headphones - they get the job done."
1,"Good value, would buy again."
1,These are a great value for the price. Truly impressed. I've owned jabra and plantronics and these are just as good.... will report back on battery life...
1,The sound is terrific and the blue tooth set-up was very easy.
1,"Comfortable, lightweight, loud. These are a great value. You definitely get your money's worth. They syn easily during set up and immediately every time I use them. The square shape may look bulky, but I forget I'm wearing them at the gym and running. I even wear them for hours at work with no issues. If I get more than 5 walls between me and my phone there is Bluetooth static, but the range is good walking around the office. I highly recommend these."
1,I like them a lot.  They sound great and fit very secure. Both important to my exercise routine.  I also appreciate the quick charging!
0,Product broke in a few weeks of use at the base of the ear piece - it just snapped off. Otherwise - great sound and loved using for my runs. Just wish it was heavier duty attachment.
1,I guess I'd love it if I had bigger ears.  The sound quality is great.  I love them to run in as well.  My ears are small so when I work out they never stay in place.  They are great for me when running or just talking and not moving much.  Won't blame the device for my ears.  LOL
1,"Overall an excellent value.  I use this headset for running and based on the last two 10k runs, I had no issues whatsoever with these falling off or the cable bouncing against/irritating my neck.  The foam-earbud especially will fit to the shape of your ear canal and stayed in place.  It fit so well that it filtered out most of the external voice so you'll have to be careful if you want to hear a bit of external noises. As other review suggested, there is a wind noise when running outdoor but I ran indoor most of the time.<br /><br />The headphone works great and connected to my phone without any issues.  Great sound quality and different earbud sizes ensured a great fit.<br /><br />I received a newer version of this which doesn't come with the car chrager and charging cable but instead a card pocket and car mount for your phone.  Upon contacting Customer Service -- they were very responsive and straight up with this transition and opted to ship out the accessories that was listed in the Amazon description."
1,Theae headphones are surprisingly good. They sound good to me and come with lots of extras! Definitely would buy again
1,Best wireless ear buds I have owned
1,"these wireless earbuds are amazing for the price. they come with a carrying case multiple different eartips, and it also come with a magnetic phone mount for your car for some reason. the audio qaulity on these is also pretty good, but these are not audiophile quality. i highly reccomend these as they are basically a cheaper version of the Beats"
1,"Connect easily, sound is decent, sweat resistant enough for the gym.<br /><br />If you want high quality, amazing, mind-blowing sound....spend $200+ on something else.<br /><br />If you want an affordable, reliable product that does its job, I recommend these."
1,"The headphones are really great, I've had the beats and in camparison to them, they are pretty dang close to each other except the price difference. I like these 100x better"
1,"these are great headphones with great sound and very easy to use with my iphone.  I was concerned about the headphone's ability to be good for talking on the phone.  as a matter of fact, they are great.  There is no problem hearing me.<br /><br />i originally purchased the Bose wireless ear buds, and i returned as they were not comfortable.  The Senso earbuds are great!  once i put in the smaller size cushions, i was fine!!<br /><br />Highly recommended!"
1,"Got more bang for the buck with these ear buds, can't say enough good about them"
1,Just received and they are exactly as described. Packaging is excellent and the quality of the product is superior. Have used several times now and find the fit and sound quality far superior to any other wireless ear buds I have tried.The range is fantastic.
1,Fast shipping.  Good sound quality.  They fit my ears perfectly.  Thank you
1,"I have had these headphones for two years now and finally have to retire them.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Good sound quality<br />Pairs easily<br />Lasts 2 years without an issue<br />Battery life has lasted, I got about 8 hours new and about 6 hours used<br />Comes with awesome accessories. Makes it worth the buy alone.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Improper fit- unless you have large ears, they will not fit properly for long runs. If you are weight lifting or walking you won't have a problem.<br />String (wire) length- slightly long so it will stick to your neck and pull on the ear when you turn you head.<br />Material quality- The wire is finally starting to fail. The sound in the left ear piece is intermittently transmitted through the wire, making the headphones too annoying to use.<br /><br />Overall a good buy for the price. Two years of use (5 days a week) for this price isn't bad. No buyer's remorse."
0,"I had no problems connecting to any devices with these pair of headphones, I just don't like the fit of them. They're pretty big and uncomfortable. I don't think I have small ears but these seem to fit better for someone with really large ears. Even when I adjust the buds, they still don't fit quite right."
1,"Hello, my name is Jorge.I want to say, Thank You  For this Senso, Bluetooth headphone. I am so happy with my new Senso Bluetooth. It is a high quality product. And I recommended everyone to try  this Senso Bluetooth. Thank you."
1,"Yes received my Senso headphones, nicely packaged! After reading instructions, which did not indicate, that they needed to be charged first. Easily Bluetooth sank them with my I phone 7! They were fully charged already. Turned on my music, if my vast music collection! And I can say, they sounded even, more spectacular than the ad boasted. Crisp high treble, and perfect low bass notes! I consider myself a music  aficionado , and the sound  is awesome, far exceeding  my expectations! These here headphones are excellent, easy to use, and control the. Buttons. I listen to two newly  acquired albums, while preparing dinner, took one short phone call, one button push to receive the call. Pushed same control button to end call, and song picked up where I left off. I will tell my friends about these headphones, and I predict many more sales! Thank you so much, for making these headphones for me!<br />  One happy customer, Robert Ahrens 😎"
1,The first pair I bought seemed to be broken. The left earpiece (the one with all the buttons and ports) was very distorted. To the point where any song at any volume just won't sound right when listening through both earpieces (the right headphone works fine). The distortion or buzz is less noticeable when watching a youtube video.
0,Charged headset after I received but it never powered on.
1,"I ordered the wrap around headphones originally, and when they arrived, they were exactly as advertised. I however have smaller ears, and the wrap around rubber part did not secure them well for me. I emailed them about the issue, looking to get a different pair.<br /><br />I believe about 30 minutes later I had an email apologizing for the inconvenience, and asking how they could help. They offered to send me new headphones for free, which I believe are the S300 instead of the S200.<br /><br />I had the new headphones in about 3 days, and they are incredible. I workout about 5 times a week and use them every time, as well as when around the house, mowing the lawn, etc.<br /><br />These are awesome headphones for the money, and frankly, I bought into the whole Beats fad when I was younger, and was less than impressed. I however am very very impressed with these.<br /><br />Thank you!"
1,Very goid Bluetooth and great sound
1,Sound is quite good.  Easy to use and variety of earbud sizes.  Works great for treadmill and upright working out.  However the loop that goes over the ear is very flimsy and they tend to fall off when doing floor exercises.
1,Good quality
1,Bought these to pair with my Peloton and they work great. Was debating buying a WAY more expensive pair but am so glad I went this route. The sound quality is great and saved a bunch of money.
1,Loving them
1,Great price and service.
1,"Very good product but, needs to add a USBC connector for newer Android phones, other than that it syncs well and the clarity is awesome."
1,We have purchased multiple sets of these headphones they work great.  We did have a problem with one set losing sound in one ear but the customer service was outstanding and a replacement set is on the way.  When we contacted customer support they replied within hours with troubleshooting steps and when those did not work they said they would send a new set.  All this happened within days. Very impressed with customer service and with the product.
1,They are great
1,"They are too flimsily around the ear, does not fit me well tho they seem like a well made product. Wish they fit better they are smartly designed and seem very high quality."
1,I have smaller ears and this is my third style/brand of wireless earbuds I've tried in the past few months. I returned the first two brands because they wouldn't stay in my ears. I LOVE THE SENSO buds. The fit AND sound are awesome and they are waaaaaay less expensive than the other two brands I tried. (Those were Bose and Plantronic.)
1,"Super easy to set up. Terrific sound. Plentiful accessories (like chargers, cables, etc.). I just got them yesterday, so I can't really attest to the &#34;actual&#34; charge capacity, etc., but if it really does sound this good for 8-hours when charged, I'm thrilled. AND at a fraction of the cost of similar products from Apple or Beats. Get 'em!"
1,"Love it!<br />I personally have only 1 problem, not with the actual product though but, when I received my headphones everything (wireless headphones, eartips, charging cable, 3-feet dual port charging cable, carrying case, & dual port car charger) was present minus the wire tie."
0,"The sound is horrible, and more like a bee hive. I don't feel like using it so bad. The bliethooth connection is good, but the sound that comes out of the box looks like those headphones from the 1980s."
0,"so I bot these to swim...not submerged much though they claim they are fine doing so.  Bot one pair, died on 2nd swim.  they were decent about replacing..  2nd pair just as bad...  1 swim, no longer charges.  DO NOT buy if you plan on being near water, ok for running, etc"
1,Sound quality is amazing! It's convenient and I love that it stays put during my hard sweat sessions.
1,"Odd looking, but they really do fit well and are not a bother to wear for long periods of time. The sound is fine and the battery recharges well.  I do wish something were different about the connecting wire, maybe stiffer?? don't know, but I am just an old fussbudget.<br />As a accessory, they are great, work well and come with 2 storage options - a cardboard sliding drawer for by the table, AND a really NICE zippered carrying case for out and about.  Yes, I would get them again, and probably will if and when the battery dies.<br />  Colors would be a good new option."
1,"Like the earclip, stops the headphones from slipping out of my ear."
1,"Bought this for my husband, and didn't realize that it can sync up to our smart TV via bluetooth. So he can watch tv while the baby and I are sleeping without the loud noise. It's a great product that I just bought another one today from the lightening deal!"
0,After a couple of weeks the voice thing stopped working
1,great for the price.
1,"These easily stayed on my ears for all 10 miles of my run. They are light weight and the sound quality is plenty good enough.  I could still hear wind noise on a windless day (wind was from my slow running pace!), but that is OK.  I will warn people that these cannot be worn if your cell phone is in your left shorts pocket.  The bluetooth constantly dropped the signal which was so annoying I wanted to stab a pencil in my eye.  After 5 miles of fuming and plotting how I would return them and write a scathing review, it occurred to me that the bluetooth receiver is probably on my right ear and the signal has to travel through 3 feet of body tissue from my left pocket.  Sure enough, when I switched the phone to my right pocket everything worked great.  My eyes are forever grateful."
1,Worked well and had good sound.  Broke within 2 months.
1,Love these
1,Awesome headphones!!!
0,Broke after one use!!
0,"We have had these headphones less than a year, and my husbands stoped working completely and mine are on the fritz, they go in and out..  Invest in something else"
0,The earpieces are too flimsy and do not hug the air making the earphones fall out all the time
1,After constantly replacing wired earbuds I finally decided to try bluetooth.  They work great!
1,"The product is fairly decent. The price isn't much, the noise cancelation could be better, they're comfortable, but the volume range is pretty limited. Overall, it is a good set of headphones to have at the gym when you don't want to risk damaging something expensive."
1,"Priced right, sound is great, comfortable fit"
1,Sounds great as headphones. People cannot hear me when using bluetooth to talk on phone.
1,"Awesome value at $36. Easy to link to your phone and the sound quality is more than acceptable for the price. Lots of accessories included in the box. Recommend for travel,pool and beach or anywhere. Just picked up another pair for my wife as well."
1,I like the headphone generally speaking. The base is a bit lower than I was expecting as I typically listen to audio books.
1,"These are excellent.  Comfortable with decent sound quality.  I use them to run, they are stable and fit well. Pairing is easy, daily on and off and pairing, easy.  This is the 2nd pair I've owned (the first pair went for a long cooling swim - my fault) and if anything I am even more pleased with the model upgrades from the first to second pair."
1,The sound is good and they hold steady in my ears through weight training and cardio.
1,grt
0,"It connected to my Pixel which is difficult to do, so I will give it that. The sound was good as well, however the piece that goes around the ear is a flimsy piece of rubber that does not hold it in your ear. It is not adjustable and has no stability at all. It is a loose, very loose piece of rubber that does not hold it in your ear."
0,Calls using these suck!!!!
1,"They are quite comfortable and were very easy to understand the setup. My son also bought a pair,<br />Ike's them so much he bought an additional pair as a backup."
0,"They are wireless,  that's the only thing going for them.  If you're looking for noise cancelling,  these are NOT for you!  Edited to add that the description  lists these as water proof (I wouldn't try to find that out) and noise reduction (which they are definitely not).  The loops to go around the ear are too big to actually fit correctly."
1,"Delivery of the product was as posted. The set up for the headphones was not too difficult.  And the sound is fantastic.  For $35, I was nervous about the quality. I have used the headphones only a couple of times, but I feel I've received a great quality product. Thank you."
0,It is not soft in ears and it is a little heavy when I wear it.<br />I don't like it and I don't recommend it. I regret for this purchase.
1,"I bought these headphones about a year ago.... so have had some time with them now and here is my thoughts:<br /><br />Pros:<br />- packaging is nice<br />- you get some nice kit along with the headphones (eg the car charger and cable are pretty nice, seems like good quality tho I haven’t really used them much and just charge at home)<br />- they las a reasonably long time and charge in a reasonably short time<br /><br />Meh’s<br />- sound quality is so-so.  The base is overbearing, the treble is muted and sounds distant. Highs are definitely rolled off. Sounds stage is cheap sounding.<br />(Am I an audiophile? Not really... I have a few high end cans and try to buy the best in my albeit limited budget so have some experience with both good and crummy headphones)<br /><br />Bad:<br />- the ear clips (whatever it’s called that goes around your ears) are garbage.  They have the support of a wet noodle. Headphones consistently work their way out of my canals and have to repeatedly be pushed back in, both during workouts and at rest.<br /><br />Final verdict:<br />Meh.  They’re what you get for cheap.  I have a few pairs of this style, mainly because I wasn’t satisfied with these and wanted something that wouldn’t fall out of my ears all the time.... however the sound of these is slightly better than those.<br /><br />I would not recommend these. I would not buy them again if the ones I have conk out. (I’m always on the cusp of giving them away but then I have to spend more cash to replace them and they’re not terrible).<br /><br />They work, but just so.<br /><br />Hope that helps (in the scheme of 30K+ reviews, statistically 60% of which are fake... seriously. Look it up!!... happens almost across the board).<br /><br />Cheers."
1,Very good sound quality for the price. Great for running!
1,"I ordered 2 pair which were opened on Christmas morning.  Each recipient was very excited to receive them.  However, I have returned 1 pair as the right earbud did not work properly with no sound at all unless pressure applied to earbud and then it was intermittent.  I have reordered hoping there is not a problem with the new pair."
1,Works better than expected. This has been my 3rd. Pair over the years. Awesome noise cancellation for loud construction environment.... they can almost double as safety plugs
1,Anniversary gift for husband to go with his new Fitbit...he loves them!!  Pro: noise-cancelling.  No cons.
1,"Good sound. Deeper bass than any other low priced earbuds I've tried. Great value too. It comes with a case and car charger. The only thing I don't like is that the ear pieces are just soft silicon that are non-adjustable and they don't fit me well so offer absolutely no support. The ear pieces just flop around and get in the way of my glasses. Otherwise, these earbuds feel like they are good quality and well built but this also means they are on the heavy side."
1,"I’ve had these for a little over a year now and I still love them. Good sound, comfortable and the battery lasts."
1,Great sound quality with rich tone.  Pairing and set up were very easy.  The fit is solid.  I use them to workout and they remain in place in with vigorous activities.
1,"I just used these earbuds for the first time. 100 mile motorcycle ride at speeds up to 70 mph.  Great sound, no problems with wind noise and ver comfortable.  I wish I had bought them sooner and saved myself some money and hassle of the previously purchased earbuds that kept falling out and didn't have the quality of sound that these do.  Cost and quality equals outstanding buy. Waiting on the three year warranty I purchased for about 6 bucks. If no problems with registering for warranty then I will recommend highly and probably purchase more for my fellow firefighters!"
0,These headphones sound is fine but they fall off in almost all my workouts.  The earpiece is adjustable and you would think they would stay but they just dont.  Still using them because i cant return.
1,They work great and are about the only wireless that seem to stay in my ears while working out and getting sweaty!
1,"Just got these, so far great!  My only question with the instructions is how to use the wire ties? Guess I'm a dummy :("
0,"Paired nicely with phone and fit well in my ears when jogging. After 5 months, one ear bud did not work. After 12 months it could not hold a charge."
1,"I liked this product even thou it didn't work with my MacBook pro, it worked perfectly with both my iphone and android phone.<br />Ii'm pretty careful handling them but after 6 months of light use now the sound is only coming from one ear, so i'm gonna contact senso and come back to update this review."
1,Best ear buds I have ever used.
1,Attractive and functional package.  Head phones work great and seem to pick up blue tooth signals up to 50 feet away.  I think they are a bargain!
1,"Nicely packed and really like the extra earbud sizes included.  Easy Bluetooth pairing with an iPhone 6, btw the multifunction button is on the side of the right earphone.  Had them in for 30 minutes and super comfortable , barely notice them.  Volume and track controls work very well.  Call quality is fine and these get plenty loud.  Caller had no problem hearing me and I had no problem hearing them.  Started listening to my playlist and rock, pop, and some classical.  Btw, I listen to the same 10 to 15 songs almost everyday on a pair of decent mid range Sony buds.  The Senso's have a nice mid range, but low frequency bass drum, bass guitar are not impactful.  The high frequencies are smooth but I think they are very slightly distorted/crackling, however I only really noticed it on Metallica's And Justice for All via Apple music, didn't notice it much on other tracks.  No comment on battery life, will post a follow up."
0,"I had these for a few weeks, then one day they melted while charging."
0,My kiddos bought these for me to swim with.  It says they are waterproof.  Not true.  Very disappointed.  Couldn’t wait to get to the pool.  So let down.
1,"After some initial trouble getting my iPhone 7 ( which was probably the phone's fault) to pair with these headphones, the rest of my experience has been great. They are comfortable to wear and provide great sound and insulation from outside noise."
1,I loved it! everythig was perfect!
0,"I run a lot, and after about 35 minutes or so, they pretty reliably lose their bluetooth connection and it can't be restored for around 40 minutes. Tried a lot of troubleshooting and a replacement set, which had the same issue. I don't over-charge them or plug them into quick charge outlets, it just seems like a glitch in the product. Definitely not trying out a third pair! They tend to lose connection in the middle of a long run or workout which is very frustrating. Good customer service team, however; very fast and responsive and offered me a coupon to replace my defective sets. I wish the product was better, when they work the sound is good and they're comfortable to wear."
1,easy to setup and to use.<br />I've only used them twice with my iphone music - once sitting at home and once on a 50 mile bike ride.<br />Sound is very good and controls even riding with biking gloves on are easyu to use.
1,Best set of bluetooth ear buds for the money!  Sound quality is amazing and the ear buds have the extra feature of having the ear clips to keep them in place when you are out and about on a run or walk.  Can't be happier with my decision to purchase the SENSO Bluetooth ear buds.
1,Great battery life. Good sound. Water resistant. If put in properly they stay in ears when with sweat and high impact.
1,It is the most comfortable earbuds I've ever used.  I have Jabra wireless earbuds but SENSOs quality and comfort is far superior.
1,"This is a really good product. It has a lot of great features, most of which have been touched on by other reviewers. I was pleasantly surprised by how multi-functional the buttons on the earpiece are. They also come with a bunch of charging accessories that honestly seem like bonuses. It can't hurt to have them around! The sound quality and range are pretty good. The only problem I have with it is the little wire that connects the two earpieces. It's quite short and ends up touching my neck. I generally don't like things touching my neck and this can feel kind of cold. In any case, I would really love it if they came up with a fully wireless headset. The right piece can receive the signal from the playback device and then send the stereo signal to the left piece. I'm not an engineer, so maybe this is not a good idea, but the wire is the reason I'm not giving it 5 stars."
1,These are great. Love them in the gym on Bluetooth. Would buy again!
1,Great product amazing sound! Really got my money's worth!
1,Mal esta vez me dalio más caro avia comprado uno antes y este no trae cable USB y no trae gomitas de repuestos
1,"Love these headphones! I have been using these while working around my yard, so lots of movement. They stay in great! The sound quality is excellent. And the volume and song adjustment buttons are easy to use, even with dirty hands!!<br />And finally, I loved all the extras that came in the package! Especially the charge chord designed both for the headphones and iPhone, genius!<br />Also comes with a second chord, carrying case, car adapter, extra foam earbuds! I highly recommend this product. Great value for the money!"
1,"Overall, these headphones aren't bad.<br /><br />Sound Quality: This might have been the best headphones I've ever heard. There is a really nice bass and the sound overall is really clear. It has great noise cancellation so you can't hear other noises, and people near you can't listen to what your listening.<br /><br />Comfort: The headphones were bigger than expected. It came with three ear pieces (Small, Medium, and Large). It also came with a nice foam piece that you can form into the size you want. The hook works well and it stays in your ear.<br /><br />Connection: The connection to your device is simple and easy (Took around 3 minutes). The length though is a little disappointing, it works for around 15 feet away from your device before it starts to become staticky and un-listenable.<br /><br />Extra: The box came with a charger (way to small (3 in.) ), a usb to Apple lightning charger, a car charger, and a small pouch. I was king of disappointed when 1 day after I ordered these head phones, the price dropped down from 35 to 20 dollars. The strand that connects the two together is a little bit lengthy and can get tangeled up."
1,I love my new headphones! They connected immediately to my iPhone and my music sounds great! Thank you!
1,Love the headphones. Went out for a 3 mile run and liked the sound quality. Also liked the way that the earbuds fit in my ear.
1,I had bought the senso bluetooth to replace apair of boom beats that I had lost. Quite frankly I  could not tell of any difference between the quality of sound for both devices. The major diffence to me was the difference in the price and the what I  saved when buying the senso instead of the boom beats.
1,"For the price you pay, the sound is more than decent.  If you want perfect, studio quality sound while in the gym - it doesn't exist - unless you want to wear large, cumbersome, over-the-ear head phones that cost you $300+<br /><br />If you are like me and looking for something you can wear in the gym, that you can run in, jump in and do burpees and all that jazz, then this is the pair you want.  The best thing about these headphones is the reliability.  You can expect them to &#34;work&#34; every session as long as you keep them charged.  Ehh, the occasional vol +/- button failure but it will still play.  Absolutely sweat-proof.  I am a very serious sweater in the gym, often times I walk in with a grey shirt and come out with a black one with sweat dripping off these buds and they keep going.  If the buttons break or won't respond or anything else goes wrong, you can always call Senso and claim the warranty.  That is what I did and they sent another pair out to me very quickly.  I definitely recommend these over those $100+ earbuds any day!  Hope you found this review helpful"
1,Wow I was about to spend 300 dollars on a pair of bose qc 30s. But I saw these for only 36 bucks with great and they're waterproof!? So I got them and I gotta say wow I'm very impressed. They sound great. Only thing that I don't like is that they don't have a voice command option. But besides that I love them. And I just saved 250 bucks. Sorry bose! Maybe it's time to lower your prices.
1,"Battery life is LITERALLY the best thing ever, it lasts so long. The sound is 10/10."
1,I got these headphones on a promo and wasn't sure how well they would sound or work but was presently surprised at how good they sounded. I use them every day. Well worth the money.
1,"These headphones work great! They fit nicely and come with many options in case you need to change the fit.<br /><br />The USB cable is a micro + iPhone 5 and higher cable, very nice!<br /><br />They sound great and the media buttons make it a treat to use at work."
0,I have owned these headphones for two months and maybe a total of 10 times. The Bluetooth will not connect with my devices anymore.  I tried to return them and the return window expired. Do not buy!!
1,Bought these recently for my sons birthday.  He loves them.  He says they have good sound quality and are easy to use.  He highly recommends these as a fantastic alternative to other headphones that are twice the price.
0,The sound is great and they fit well. However after about 10-20 mins on my neck they radiate my neck and make this weird tingling burning sensation on my neck. I had to stop using them. Taking them back
1,"I am happy either with the purchase so far .<br />Plus good customer services, and easy to reach"
1,Very convenient to use and sleek. A great innovation
1,"Bought it for my daughter's Birthday. Headphones keep falling off. &#34;earhooks&#34; not adjustable. Sound is good, but unusable in the gym which was their main purpose."
1,"They weren't lieing when they mentioned HD sound. These sound great and are far more comfortable than my beats. The bass is great but not spectacular. I give these a 9.5 compared to beats, but 10 for the value."
1,"Delivery was very prompt. Overall quality is good will do the job just fine , sound could be louder."
1,They work great
1,Earphones are great sound comes thru nice and crisp
0,"I purchased these for my son for a Christmas present.  I had owned a couple of pairs over the past few years so I thought they were pretty good.  He finally started to use them about three weeks ago.  They stopped turning on after two weeks use.  But, it was more than a month since I had purchased them (before Christmas) so I could not do an Amazon return.  Very disappointed in these.  I guess I am done purchasing this product.  I was going to update this review to mention that the seller replaced the headphones and was very responsive.  That is great.  However, the replacement headphones after a month, melted down (literally) while charging overnight!"
0,The left earphone is never silent. There is always an annoying ringing noise - gives me a headache. But the sound quality is OK for the price.
0,I found the sound to be quite good however they did not set securely in my ears and would likely fall out if bumped ever so slightly.  The soft piece that wraps around the top of the ear is very flimsy (comfortable) but did not in my experience offer much additional securement.  The soft ear bud tips would not insert far enough into my ears due to the design of the headset.  I will continue to use my 4 year old Motorolas until I can find a better replacement.
0,"I purchased the headphones on October 11, 2016, the headphones were very unusable. First, the silicone ear loops are flimsy and will not stay secure around the ears. This did not pose a great deal of dissatisfaction as I was able to overcome this issue by tucking the curved part of the loops above the ears under my cap while running. However, the real concerns with the headphones lays in these serious issues. The battery drains completely in less than an hour of operation from full charge state. The charging port of the headphone is malfunctioning and does not maintain a secure connection causing the charging process to halt. I had to keep wiggling the charging cables until the red LED charging pilot turns on indicating that the headphones are charging. moreover, it became very annoying and tedious process for me to exercise extreme caution every time I try to charge the unit and while placing the headphone down to finish the charging process and to avoid the headphones from getting disconnected again and to come to realize that the headphones were not charging and I wasted hours of valuable time. The company does not have a customer service phone number for product support, rather they resort to a message process form. I was hoping that the company will be responsive and prompt to answer and address my concerns, but I guess I was misled be the highly sophistication and the well-prompted product propaganda.  This is very frustrating and I feel that my money went down the drains. I can’t recommend this product"
1,"My husband LOVES these. They are so worth the money. I looked for a month? Reading reviews, trying out other peoples and then I stumbled upon these. What sold me was the comfort aspect and all the extras that can with them. They are perfect."
1,"I had high hopes but sadly the ear phones  did not fit as I had hoped. I have kind of average sized ears, maybe a little on the small side. I do not like things inside my ears because of an ear wax issue that i have. I read some reviews and the different sizes of ear thingies made me hopeful. I'm an athlete and I run as much as I can. I needed ear buds that don't fall out while I'm running. These ear phones did not pass the test. The rubber parts that go around my ears are too soft plus they don't even touch my ears where they are supposed to to keep them on my ears. I literally had to stop running often to push and try and twist the buds far enough into my ears to make them stay for another few feet of my run before I had to stop and do it again. The sound is good if I can get them to stay but since they don't, the sound becomes like in a tin can as they say."
1,"Huge upgrade to a balky Jabra Sport and exactly what I was looking for!  Audio is much better than I expected at this price point, clear crisp treble and mid range with warm bass and excellent volume controls.  Immediately detected by my Samsung 7S and pared instantly.  Included a functional set of accessories in a compact storage case.  Button controls are in all the right places making it easy to adjust volume, skip tracks, answer phone calls, even has a redial option.  So far not a single CON I can come up but we'll see how the phones hold up after sweating buckets in the hot Midwest summer.  A great value overall and would definitely recommend to friends."
0,Horrible died in one month. The price is what you get.
1,"It works but the size of ear doesn’t fit well and the microphone works great. Whenever I use the microphone of the earphone, my voice sounds like far away"
1,"tl;dr: Great headset if you're never 10+ ft from your phone<br /><br />I bought this pair so I could listen to music while skating (headphones and earbuds were falling out due to the strong centripetal forces from spinning). Unfortunately, the Bluetooth connection craps out if you're more than 10 ft from your broadcasting device (my iPhone). It just gets poppier and poppier until it completely disconnects, which means it's pretty much useless for what I wanted.<br /><br />In it's defense, this headset is at an excellent price point for the great sound quality and the noise cancelling (muffling) it provides. It's also very comfortable to wear, and the over ear wire is adjustable to mold to your ear. Throughout 3 hrs of very active skating, it never fell off, although the earbud did pop out of my ear once or twice. I third the people saying the red foam earbuds are the best; the other ones felt very hard and uncomfortable."
1,No complaints
1,"Works fine out of the box, comfortable on the ears (at least mine) and also comes with different sizes for the ear plugs.  Sounds great and is secure when working out.  I got this at 29 on a lighting deal and they are a good deal at that price"
1,Easy to operate and sound is fine for gym and pool
1,Like the fit
1,"I bought these for my daughter. She said they are comfortable and work very well when she wears them at the gym. She said they connect quickly to her Iphone, the sound is great and so is the bass. The only down side is that the earbuds need to be in her ear a certain way or the sound gets muffled. But overall she recommends them and is happy with the purchase!"
1,"Just as good, if not better than the Beats wireless I had before the wire broke through on the over the ear part of it. Very comfortable, easy to pair. Quality and battery life excellent. Amazed at all I got for the price (car charger too!)"
1,very solid product for the price!
1,These things are great.  No need to buy expensive Bluetooth headphones.  These are flawless.
1,I'm not the most technically intuitive person but I could not get my headphones to pair with my Mac-book air.  They paired easily with my I-Phone and the sound is great.  I'll just need two sets of earphones for my devices.  That's a little disappointing but I'm not sorry I bought these.
0,The sound quality on these is awful. I am going to return them.
1,as advertised
1,"Easy to use, so nice to not have to worry about cords all over the place.  Paired almost instantly."
1,"great deal for the money.  works as expected. came with a lot of unexpected goodies like a nice carrying case, car charger, multiple earbuds, and cord management pieces.  did not come with a usb wall charger but I already have dozens of those laying around my house.  wanted something for the gym so the profile of the ear pieces are not a big deal but I wouldn't use these for my daily commuting needs since it's not very discreet looking.<br /><br />One odd thing was that it came with a short micro usb cable for charging but it also came with a USB to Apple Lightning type cable which makes no sense whatsoever since you can't use it on these headphones. Gave it to my daughter for her iphone."
1,I love these.  Great fit and great sound.
1,Very well made for the price
1,"I use these when I go to the gym. They work great, and are wonderful, even keeping out of the way of my hair when it's swinging to and fro. I don't use them as much when I run along busy roads because they don't cancel out much road noise. But they are great on quiet woodland paths, and in the gym. We've ordered several pair, and love them!<br />Elizabeth Miller<br /><br />I bought a pair to use at the gym, and found I use them a great deal when listening to college lectures for my online program, and when calling home when I'm away. My wife and I love them.<br />David Miller"
0,constantly looses connection
1,Amazing head phones. Best i have found and I have tried much more expensive brands.  You will love these.
1,These are so great! They came with a charger and a nice little case to put them in. they sound so nice and are made so well. i love them. worth all the money.
0,"I bought two pairs of these a while back, one for me, one for my husband, and within 2 months both pairs were dead.  I didn't even bother requesting  a replacement... I'd rather just go with a different brand in general seeing as both pairs from the same brand/model are dead."
0,"These are comfy and pair pretty easily, and the sound quality is OK for the price point. However, the shape and construction ensure that even the tiniest breeze will translate into a ton of wind noise in your ear. Trust me, no one can run slowly enough that this won't be a problem.  I also have sever doubts that this meets an ipx7 rating, which should mean these could be submerged underwater for half an hour. The little rubber gasket that covers the charge port is flimsy and insubstantial, and on mine, it doesn't stay in the charge port, falling out with the slightest handling of the earphone. I don't need to sink these in water, but I sweat enough to destroy electronics that aren't truly waterproof, and there's no way these will stand up to real summer running without getting soaked. Sadly, I'll be returning. These will be OK if you are only using them inside or on an airplane or similar."
1,"Rapid delivery and unit works wel.  I have to get used to where the various control buttons are located.  Otherwise, I inadvertently hit them when making adjustments.  Good quality sound."
0,"Not as expected, sound was not that good and not very comfortable. I dont recommend"
1,These things are awesome!
1,"Pleasantly surprised! Great base, very loud, easy to sync..happy customer!"
1,I really like them!
1,I like it but the ear part is clumsy
1,Nice
0,This is the second and last one I buy. The first one lasted 3 years then the charger plug broke inside and now the second one I purchased in October broke in the same place within 2 months.
1,Bought these wireless earbuds and I am happy to say they work great ! Sound quality is very good and they pair easily via Bluetooth.
1,"They work exactly as expected.  I am very happy with them, as well as the carrying case and extra charging cables."
1,They are comfortable sporty like headphones; wireless and sweat proof!
1,Terrific
0,I had high hopes for these ear buds however they don't stay in my ear (even after trying all three size buds) and the range is horrible. When I put my android in my pocket when I run my these ear buds cut out and disconnect immediately. I will be returning these ASAP.
1,"Great headphones and the sound is awesome.  The only problem I have with them is the minute I step outside the house with my phone still in my pants pocket they begin to cut in and out.  I have not used them on a run or bike ride yet, but I look forward to using them and I'll see if an arm strap helps maintain connectivity that dose not cut in and out so frequently."
1,Product surpassed expectation. Features are very user friendly and the headphones rests comfortably on the ears.
0,Never worked well.
1,Very comfortable. Great sound quality on both calls and with music. Will buy again for gifts.
1,Really excellent ear phones.........especially for the reasonable price!
1,One of my friends thought these were Beats by Dre so that let’s me know that the styling of the headsets are on point. The quality of the sound is way better than expected and the battery life is better than average. I would definitely recommend this product
0,I have a hard time keeping the buds in my ears and the soft clip around my ear. Poorly designed.
1,Great product and excellent value although the highs muffled a bit.
1,"These are pretty good headphones. The memory foam ear tips are awesome. Most headphones will slowly begin to slip out of my ears as I run, but the memory foam tips are large enough to keep the headphones in place while I'm running. I cannot say enough about how great the customer service is. I damaged one of the memory foam ear tips while trying to take it off to clean it, so I contacted the company to see if it was covered under the warranty. It was and they sent me 2 sets of replacement memory foam ear tips! I emailed the company and literally got a response within minutes. The product is solid, the sound is great, they connect very easily to my devices, and seem to charge quickly and hold their charge for a long time."
1,It is comfortable to wear at the gym. Sound is fairly good. I love the price it's really affordble for a good wireless headphone.
1,I use these daily for walking and meetings at work.  The sound quality is great for music and movies.
0,"I was hoping these would be a good alternative to the powerbeats that are constantly breaking from me sweating on them but I returned these after wearing them once. Totally uncomfortable, wouldnt stay on my ears bcause they do not have that bendable wire like the powerbeats do. I would not be able to wear these for more than 20 minutes without throwing them across the room because they hurt my ears so much."
1,"I will never understand those who walk with the gigantic headphones. These are great. The sound quality also depends on the source. I have a nice player with all that equalizer and other stuff, and the sound is just great. Sweat-proof, really fits snug. Won't buy anything else, unless I loose these."
1,I ordered these because of the high number of reviews.  Everything was well packaged but the red foam ear plug was deformed from being compressed in the package.  I couldn't get the ear piece to fit correctly in my ear.  The package does come with 3 sets of plastic adaptors but I prefer the foam for tight fit.  They sound great and hopefully the mfg will send me out a new set of foam plugs.
1,Wonderful headphones!  Comfortable and great sound!  I use them at work and at the gym. No wires to get tangled.
1,"Sent back, too flexible ear hooks."
1,"good fit, stable and easy to work.  mic quality is very good, clear and responsive.  sound quality is decent, good bass response and mids are very strong. the highs are a little on the low end to my taste and at higher volumes music can sound a little muddy.  movies and phone calls the sound is very good and clear.  the ear hooks keep the buds in place very well without causing discomfort or fatigue and i can even wear my favorite sunglasses and i have very close earlobes.  if my phone or if the headphones had a means of a graphic equalizer to adjust the tone balances these would be the perfect purchase in my opinion (again, for music sound and quality and i am very picky about that) and you simply cannot beat the price for the quality.  a very good product and the company is thoughtful from build to components all the way to accessories.  thank you for a good product and best of luck with your company.  i'm looking forward to your other items in the future."
0,Se me dañaron muy rápido
1,"These headphones are good for the price point, but have a few annoying features.<br /><br />The sound quality is decent and they work for a commute, not sure if they would stay in for a run or other high impact activities.  I don't mind the buttons, but they do take an adjustment period because they aren't intuitive.<br /><br />My two main complaints are that while the sound quality is good, if I put my phone in my bag or pocket it will cause the audio to breakup like the connection is not very good.  It sounds like the horrible days when a cd would skip.  It's constant and completely annoying.  My only recourse is the carry my phone.  This works, but is a complete pain that I cannot put my phone in my bag and be hands free!<br /><br />Secondly, the stupid low battery announcements are a bad design and they start when the headphones have 30% battery.  I can almost understand if the percentage is off, but the stupid lady cuts in every minute with &#34;low battery&#34; for a solid five to six minutes before the headphones shut off.  One low battery notification is enough.  Also, if they do cut off because the battery dies, you then have to resync to your phone when they are charged.<br /><br />Overall, they fit the purpose, but if you can afford better quality, go for it."
1,These headphones are awesome! Quality is great and super easy to pair with devices. Comes with a 1 year warranty too...cant beat the price on top of all of that. Plus they even reach out to you through email after its delivered to make sure everhthing went smooth. Truly impressed...Great buy!
1,"I'm very pleased with these headphones so far. Good sound quality, it maintains a good bluetooth connection and it feels like a well made product. I don't know how durable they are, but there's a one year warranty which made me much more confident in my purchase."
1,"Worked great!  Then, all the sudden Less than 6months later they didn’t...."
1,These headphones are awesome for the price. It's a way better than what I had before. I love it and will recommend it to whoever want them
1,Great sound for the price.
0,"Stopped working within 5 months, will not take a charge. Do not buy them!"
0,"I do like these headphones, however after about month and a half they started randomly disconnecting and seconds later connecting back, multiple times in a raw, you need to turn them off completely, sometimes few times. I’m having same issue with my iPhone and iPod. It happens a lot at the Gym, which is really annoying."
1,Love this earphones. High quality sound and very comfortable. They are without a doubt the best pair I had so far. Way better than my beats by Dre I had that recently battery went dead.
1,Great headphones. Long lasting and a quick charge. Last at least 8 hours on a full charge.
0,"kept losing connection, worst headphones I've purchased, just gave up and threw them in the trash. Hopefully mine was an isolated case"
1,"These headphones have changed my game at the gym. It's amazing to be cordless while on the elliptical. The sound on these is a bit bass heavy but really impressive for the price. The charge lasts really really long too. Grab these, you won't be disappointed."
1,Great Headphones and very easy to set up and use.
1,This is a Christmas gift.
1,I wear these at work and they are great. On my second pair.
1,"Pretty good fit, don't fall out when I'm working out, and good sound."
1,"Best product for the first timers. Those who do not know what a noise cancelling ear bud is will be super happy to have this. My spouse had some issue with her phone's mic. I have her this senso product. My spouse is super happy with the battery performance, the way it fits on ears, and the quality of the sound."
1,"These are good for working out in the gym. Sound quality is good and so is the battery life. My only complaint is that when the battery gets down to 30% they automatically shut off, which is super annoying since they still have battery life. Compared to beats and stuff, these are an awesome deal for the price."
1,"I have had such a hard time finding the right ear phones and these are pretty close to perfect. My husband dropped $200 on ear phones but I was not so willing to spend so much. These are a great price and great quality. The only con is having to squeeze the ear holder tighter to your ear so that it won't fall. Overall, great product."
1,I love the noise cancellation.
1,I got an appreciation email after ordering and I didn't have any issues with the order so I never had to contact any further. This is my second pair of these headphones that I got for a friend. They have amazing sound and battery life and the first pair I have is going strong after over a year of use!
1,Very good sound quality.
1,Works great
1,"I had 2 stars for this initially. I am updating my review.<br /><br />I had some issues with the left earbud being louder than the right one. I got some reset instructions from the vendor and the problem seems to have gone away. I think this is an anomaly and not the norm. If just in case, you run into this problem, please get in touch with the vendor within 30 days.<br /><br />This does not have Bose sound quality but surely at its price point this headphone is very much value for money. It is robust for all your gym visits and daily work use. It has decent battery life. Their packaging is also very thoughtful of the customer with a bunch of extra accessories. I bought another one for my dad. He enjoys it too. Both blue and red colors look good."
1,"This is the 4th set that we  have ordered, i have one at work and one set at home. My wife has a set and our granddaughter now has one. These sound great and hold an excellent charge and fit comfortable."
1,"Unbeatable price/value , very happy about it."
1,Great product for the price.
0,I bought these wireless earbuds for my daughter. She loved them until one ear bud stopped working after just 3 months. I tried emailing customer support with no response. I tried calling and just got a busy signal.
1,"Works exactly as described, good sound, good price, comfortable, good battery life. I'm happy with my purchase."
1,"Great head phones, mine seemed to short out after a few months but the seller Tekatron immediately replaced them. Sound quality and battery life is good."
1,"Sound better than expected, very comfortable, bluetooth pairs very easily, battery life very good.  An excellent choice and for the price cannot be beat."
1,"Above average overall. Not bad sound, easy operation, and they provide me with sound whilst i pick things up and place them back down as well as box. Haven't tried running yet. As far as design, a pretty major flaw is that the power button is the senso logo on the right bud, so when i go to adjust it (because subsequently this is the bud that for some reason feels like its about to fall out which may because i have weird ears or a ergonomics thing) i turn the power off on accident, but its easy to turn it back on...Also after awhile of wearing these at work my ears started to hurt, but for working out purposes i wouldn't notice."
1,These are great headphones for the price. Work and sound better than my wired philips headphones that I've used for years on my runs. Battery lasts a long time. I love it!
1,Nice product
1,Great product
1,"Amazing love them! They're easy to use and sound great! Plus, their customer service is amazing!"
0,"Sounded great for three hours, then nothing. I use them to workout. I sweat a lot and bought these due to ipx7 waterproof rating. Now I need to return them."
1,Very light and terrific sound.  Easy to sync.  Bought a second pair after our puppy chewed up the first.  Use them quite often while bicycling.
1,Overall pretty good headphones. Cancels out most surrounding noise. Sound quality is pretty good. I only use it for working out.
1,"The Senso ActivBuds are excellent.  I have been able to pair with both my iphone and my ipad.  The Dual Port car charger and charging cable are for charging other items (ie, iphones, etc.) versus the headphones, correct?  It is a nice bonus.  I have had a much more expensive pair of earbuds from Klipsch and the new Senso ActiBuds are awesome."
0,"Headphones do sound very nice.  However, the charging cords would not insert fully into the headphones so I could not charge them.  Since headphones arrived precharged, I think I was sold a refurbished product."
0,"I had high hopes due to the review, but unfortunately they did not deliver. They have trouble connecting via Bluetooth. It says it’s connected, but still plays out of my phone, not my headphones. This happens all the time and is very frustrating when I want to go for a quick run. The battery life is not great. Overall- pretty bad headphones."
1,"I honestly thought about sending these back because I was not satisfied, but the longer I had them the more i began to like them. They don't cancel out background noise as much as I would like, but they stay in place extremely well. Overall, not bad headphones for the price"
1,Great
0,Unfortunately the pair I received are defective. They worked once and since won’t hold a charge at all. Disappointing. My husband has the same pair and they work fine. Hoping it was just a fluke.
0,"Worked for a little over a year and just stopped (they turn themselves off, even on a full charge). And there’s no way to contact the company after they stopped working. ‘Fanatical” customer support, indeed."
1,Very pleased with this set!  The sound is awesome and they stay well-planted inside the ear while jogging.  Battery lasts a very long time.
1,Waterproof. Fit a little weird on my ears.
1,These are well priced and very nice headphones.  They were easy to setup and connect to my phone.  They are also very comfortable and stay in place even during my workout.  The company has been very good in communicating to me about available support.  If you are looking for a nice set of headphones I highly recommend these.
1,These headphones are awesome! I didn't even realize they would pick up my phone calls or alert me of a text message. These are better than I expected and really hold a charge for a while. Thank you for a great product!
1,Totally recommended this product. Sounds quality is really good and super like cause it's really handy. Love the case tooI I really like it because it comes with extra sizes for ear plugs whgich is one of my problem when it comes to using earphones like this. Super like the sound and it's really clear.
1,I love to be hands free!!!  Having these headphones allows that and so far they are great!
1,great lightweight and the sound is great
1,Update: Headphones still work great and I get no complaints when using them to talk on the phone. Only complaint is the battery life. They seem to work for barely a day before having to recharge them.<br /><br />Great product at a great price.<br />I’ve used this for a couple of days. I have had no complaints while talking on the phone. And the music sounds good enough for me.<br /><br />They seem durable and well made. Like I said before you can’t beat the price. I will buy again. I would still be saving money even if I had to buy a pair every year. I paid $200 for a more expensive brand and they barely lasted two years.<br /><br />I will update if I have any problems. But so far they are great.
1,"Easy to use, sound is good, i like them."
1,More than what I expected and great quality
1,"So far so great. Great sound quality, east to set up and sound didn't fade even when I started sweating during my run."
1,"Excellent headphones, easy to use first rate quality, will recommend them for anyone wanting a great product"
1,"For the price, these earbuds work pretty well. However, I wish the piece that loops around the ears are flexible because it's slightly too large for my ears (and I actually have big ears too)."
1,Great headphones. Comfortable on the ears. Very lightweight.
0,I don't like the quality of the sound.  It is flat.
0,"Not durable - I have owned this item for about 11 months and it has reached a point where even the slightest bump (like normal running) will cause the device to completely power off. Super frustrating! I can now only wear these if I go out for the slowest of slow walks.<br /><br />The wires around each earpiece are now exposed (see photo), which is likely the cause of my issue. Not sure if I received a defective item or if they are all like this.<br /><br />Great while it lasted."
0,They are so loose on my ears. The piece that goes over your ear is not adjustable. So they feel like they are going to fall off at any moment. It makes them clumsy and is not a good fit. Even if they were noise canceling I would know because of the loose fit. The sound is not too bad. I would have returned them but I waited too long.
1,"Fantastic! Great sound quality, built solidly, great distance, ease of use is perfect. I'm very very pleased with these."
1,"Although I returned this item I actually truly liked it. My issues were<br />1. the ear hooks were not adjustable and was too big for my small ears.<br />2. mic was located on the ear area and between my soft spoken voice and my hair covering the mic, others had a bit of trouble hearing me.<br />3. the ear pieces have some good weight to them and I basically use only one ear for phone calls so by them being heavy there was no way to clip the unused side to clothing and keep it from sliding down and tugging on the ear in use side. I purchased separate hooks to solve this issue but decided to send this headset back in the end for reasons 1 &2<br /><br />Positive note: They are of excellent quality, the sound is incredible. If you use both ears be sure to turn your device volume down, yes they are that good.<br /><br />If the mic was closer to my mouth and the ear hooks fit better I certainly would have kept this one. Hated to send them back."
1,read the very user friendly guide... took less than 30seconds to connect an start listening to great music.... almost too easy.....
1,Headphones work great and are rich with features. Customer service was also very responsive.
0,Terrible sound quality!!! Music was distorted with the slightest bit of bass and sounded like I was listening to music from a can. Guess you get what you pay for. No wonder these were $30.
1,good product!
1,Wicked product! A must buy.
1,Awesome product for such a low price!!!
1,"Awesome, beautiful, useful, practical, loved them very much"
1,"So far, these are the best Bluetooth headphones I've purchased. They fit right, battery life seems good, and they get louder than any other headphones I've had in the last few years. This was really important to me because the background noise in my gym can get in the way of hearing my music, etc. Also like the fact that they are connected and go around the ear. I had trouble with previous buds falling out on long runs. For the $ these are a steal! Not to mention the extras that it came with. The car charger and micro USB / lightening cable are a huge plus."
1,Bought as gift for my son and he loves them!!! He plays basketball all the time. Much easier without having to have the wired headphones!
1,Sound quality is poor!
1,"I think the product speaks for itself. Really awesome headphones. This is the second time I'm buying them. I figured since I enjoyed them, why not give someone else a chance to try them out. No surprise that they loved them. Great quality and the best price on the market. Thanks a lot Senso, you guys are awesome!"
1,Good sound output and it fits the ears very well<br />Its connection with appliances Bluetooth is flawless
1,"Simple, perfect, great value!"
1,"I will admit everything was looking good until I try to receive a phone call from them.  The sound quality was great,  they felt good while wearing them and the battery life was to be at 8 hours.  The only bad thing is the mic quality. The person using them during a call sounds muffled. I guess I am back on the hunt for a pair with a good mic"
1,Awesome.
1,"These headphones are nice, they serve the purpose. Sound is good. I love that they come with an extra pair of ear buds that fit my ears without falling out. All the extra accessories came in handy."
1,"good sound, pretty comfortable, easy pairing."
1,"The fit and range is good, but the design grabs a lot of work d noise when jogging. The sound is great when just walking around."
1,I got them for my son and he loves them. They hold around ears perfect. Very pleased with this product.
0,The audio quality is muffled. The mic is also horrible. I owned a pair of these before for 10 years that were awesome. This new pair is horrible. Do not buy
1,"These headphone ate absolutely amazing.  The sound is of a very high quality.  I use these mainly for working out, and I listen to all my audible books this way.  So far I have absolutely no complaints.<br /><br />My previous earbuds did not have a similar 'hook' for over the ear and kept slipping off during intense physical action.  This is a perfect design to counter this.  I also wear glasses and the ear hooks do not at all get in the way.<br /><br />I love that they also provide additional ear buds replacement, and the car charging adapter is an unexpected bonus.<br /><br />These headphones are certainly worth more than they cost in my opinion. I was considering a Beats set as my daughter uses Beats headphones, but I cannot tell the sound/quality difference and these just feel more comfortable to me in comparison.  Really happy I got them!"
0,Stopped connecting to Bluetooth after 1 month
1,"Comfortable, lightweight in nice packaging, with useful cables and accessories.<br />3 pairs of earbuds would fit any ears.<br />Sound is good though treble response could be better.<br />When running the microphone catches a bit of wind noise."
0,The ear loops too soft. Would not hold its shape
1,"These were purchased by and for my 17 year old son. He says it's the best set of headphones he's ever had, which means better than his Sony and Bose headphones!!!"
1,"Great price. Good sound quality. Noise cancelling is ok but not for air travel. Bluetooth connection is easy but not 30 feet as advertised. Overall, it's a great deal at $36 plus S&H. I would recommend it."
1,I really like these headphones. I use them with my IPad for internet TV and the sound is clear and the headphones fit comfortably. I had no trouble pairing it to my IPad and love being able to get up and move about the house while still being able to hear whatever program I have on. Really nice headphones.
1,Senso buds worked perfectly. Great sound quality for the price. Would recommend the Senso ear buds.
1,Very comfortable headphones with a good quality sound and voice conversation  at  very reasonable price. Great packaging too! Love it1
0,Very comfortable. Very good sound but only for listening. No-one that I talk to using them with my cell phone can here or understand me. In order to speak I have to disconnect from Bluetooth..<br />I bought them cause my son had them.  Now I know why I can't understand him on his cell..
1,Really comfortable and sound great
1,"These are pretty good. The sound quality and base are both great, and they shouldn't leave you wanting for much more, despite the price and quality assurances of name brands.<br /><br />I found it easier to both put on and wear these with the strap in front like a sombrero rather than across the back like bifocals. Easier to turn the head without the strap getting snagged, as well as being less awkward to put on.<br /><br />Battery life is good so far, as is volume and comfort. Connects quickly after the first time. The voice could be a bit more natural sounding, and the volume buttons should've been switched, but these are minor niggles.<br /><br />If you must have something that'll better impress the Jones, then go for LG's HSB-810 model with retractable earbuds and JBL sound. But it'll definitely cost you more new, and you won't get all the awesome freebies."
1,Left bud ceased working after two weeks. They are sending a replacement pair out to me
1,"So, first off, for the price, the sound is great and the range is amazing!  I can walk 45 feet from my phone with these in my 1949 (thick walls) home and I still have reception.  But the battery life is funky.  You hold the side button on the right earbud to turn on and off, and a voice comes on and says ""power on"" or ""power off.""  Fine.  But I've found when I clearly turn them off, and I've charged them relatively soon beforehand, they still go dead very fast.  So it seems the ""power off"" really isn't turning it off, and it's draining battery life.  The red or blue light on the side of the right earbud tells you whether it's powered or not, and it's tiny--which is good overall, so there's not some annoying light coming from your ear if you're in a dark space or a library--so that's not the issue.  It just seems to drain battery charge, even when it's supposedly not on.  Upshot:  I'm always charging these things, which is a bit of a pain.  I need to start doing this the way I charge my computer--just plug them in every night.  So if you don't mind charging all the time, these are terrific.  And they STAY ON.  The wrap-around ear band is wet-noodle-y flexible, and once you get used to that, it's a terrific feature, because they don't bind or pinch.  And for folks like me who have trouble getting earbuds to stay in, these REALLY DO.  Good luck!"
1,I give it 4 stars because one of the covers came off after a few uses and continues to pop off
1,So far so good. Had to send my first pair back. I think sweat got to them or either I got a refurbished pair. They made it right and the second pair hasn't skipped a beat. Sound is good and I can only wear them in one ear when riding my bicycle due to cancelling too much road noise. Good product for price.
1,Comfortable and rechargeable !
1,Work great.
1,"Sound quality is great, they fit really well and feel very sturdy and well made. The carrying case is very nice and the in car charger was a great bonus too. Definitely recommend"
0,The sound went out on the headphones 2 days later!
1,"Dollar for dollar a true bargain! The search has not been easy to find great headphones, from the over priced beats version of wireless to jaybirds. I have been amazed. I enjoy the fit the sound, even the carrying case. This will become my go to birthday gift!"
1,I already wrote a review for this so I am not sure why I am getting asked to write another>?
1,Great!
1,I purchased these as a gift for my son.
1,"These headphones are great ! the sound is clear and the battery life is great too, I only have to charge it once -twice a week!"
1,Have used the headphones for 1 day and so far an extremely happy.  Love the fact that they come with 3 different sizes of earbuds and 2 charging cables.  The cord between the right and left head phone is long enough that you can hang them around your neck without the fear of losing them.  The sound is good and a great product for the price.  Would highly recommend.
1,Great
1,Sounds and works amazing...I just wish the hoops over the ear weren't so flimsy.
1,Awesome!<br /><br />Don't have to deal with the cable. I can leave my phone charging and still use the phone on my backyard. Excellent range.
1,🤜🤛
1,"Loving them so far, stay in my ears when I run."
1,"Great audio, super comfy, they stay in while running and the battery life has been great after several months of use. For the price these are crazy awesome"
0,Horrible Sound Quality!! Returned them back.
1,Great product and awesome price!
1,Love them. Great quality!
1,"5/10 you get what you pay for,  crappy sound, would not buy again, only the foam tips fit my ears for running, the other 3 pairs fell out all the time to the point where they became unusable, so don't lose the foam ones !!!!!! i did:("
1,The best part about these headphones is the part that goes in your ear. It really seals so all you hear is the sound coming from what you want to listen to. The noise around you is blocked out.
1,"Battery really only lasts an hour and a half. Besides the battery, good headphones."
0,"At first i really liked these headphones, they worked well. Then after about 3 weeks they stopped charging and stopped working because the battery was dead. I am now going to try and get a refund or replacement."
1,"The earphones are easy to pair and comfortable to wear.  The sound quality is quite satisfactory to me.  I haven't tested battery life, but my impression is that it is what is claimed."
1,"Very comfortable in the ears, easy to set up, and best of all, has great sound! Very happy with my purchase!"
1,"These buds are just downright awesome.  I've been using them quite awhile now and they're still working great.  I hate having to deal with cords while doing anything but especially during workouts.  These not only eliminate any cords dragging around, getting caught on stuff, etc, but the sound coming out of them is just phenomenal.  Most other buds I have to turn the sound to max and still it's not loud enough.  I've actually had to turn these guys down a time or two."
1,"About what you would expect for the price, mediocre sound.  Bass is a bit exaggerated, and treble is virtually nonexistent.  But for 20 bucks, really can’t complain."
1,"Sound is loud, Quality is fair...battery life is good,  the Bluetooth signal is in and out having issues with it"
1,"Fit comfortably, battery lasts for a long time, easy to use.  I run, clean the house, walk the dogs, etc and they stay in place and are comfortable! Easy to set up, charge, feel the sound quality is good!"
1,"Worth it for the price, but the sound quality isn't amazing when listening to hard/loud music."
0,"The headphones worked great, but they quit working after 4 months.  The support only lasts 3 months."
1,"Package arrived as promised. Packed great and no damage. As of today, headphones is working great."
1,I use for walking and needed buds that would stay in my ears. Like the small cord to keep me from losing them.
1,Work very well. Great sound quality
0,"I liked everything about these headphones...except they didn't fit.  They are NOT meant for smaller ears.  Even with the smallest buds, they fell out, and the over-ear loop is too large (and non-adjustable) to hold them in.  I'm returning them."
1,Excercisig working outside
1,These were a present for my Great Nephew's birthday.  He loves them!!!!!<br />Thank you
1,"WOW! Slayer sounds awesome on these things! If your on the fence just buy these! I've gone through dozens of cheap headphones and these are just as good or better then my sisters Bose. Deep bass, good treble and mids, hd sound and the newest Bluetooth 4.1, oh and there waterproof!! I won't be buying another pair of headphones ever again!"
1,Item arrived on time. The packaging looked like it was for more expensive headphones. The range on the headphones was very good. I left my cellphone in the house and walked outside with the headphones and could still hear clear music from the sidewalk
1,Just received my senso Bluetooth headphones and I'm loving them.  The quality of sound was amazing I'm finding it hard to take them off. For the money and quality I will be telling friends and family.
0,I would not buy another pair of these. Very big and bulky. Work fine.
0,"First time I tried plugging in the charger, the charging port in the earbud broke off. Also really bulky."
1,Great headphones!  Fit well and the sound is clear and wonderful.
1,this is my second set and I've been very pleased with the performance.  Mostly used at the gym or while cutting the lawn.  Bluetooth range is very good; I can wonder all over the gym with my phone in a locker and have no problem connecting to my music.  I particularly like the flexible fit ear hooks.  Nice product
1,I like them but they are a little to big for my ear.
1,"Sound is rich & clear, kinda hard getting earpiece sized to your ear. Pleased overall."
1,"These are quality earbuds at an affordable price! And when we had a problem with them, they quickly sent us a replacement! Best customer service ever!"
1,It is very good for the price.
1,Best bang for your buck! Easy and nice to use!!
1,"Snug fit, great sound, great price. Received my headphones promptly. Thanks!"
1,"These work and sound great. Best of all, awesome customer service!"
1,Delivered on time and works great.  Good sound.<br /><br />Second pair I have ordered.  Lost the first paid
1,EDIT: I had a problem with these and support helped me troubleshoot and ended up sending me a new pair. Easy to deal with and very helpful!<br /><br />These are Beats without the excessive sticker price. They fit slightly odd in my ears but they are still the best earbuds I've ever owned. If they break I can just buy 3-4 more since their that much cheaper than Beats...
1,Good sound and battery life.
1,Set up was very well explained to pair with cell. A hugh plus for a 70+year old  person. Bought these after frustrated attempt to set up another brand.with no success. Sound quality is good even in a  jym.
1,Effective
1,"Using these for about a week now, and they are great. My last BT earbuds would fall out all the time, these are lightweight and stay in place while running and at the gym. Sound quality is fine, and the connection is clear and the range is good also."
1,"Received today, and overall, I’d buy them again. They were easy to pair with my iPhone, and they’re very comfortable. The only reason I didn’t give 5 stars is that the part that loops over the ear seems to be really big and it’s not adjustable. I was hoping for a slightly tighter fit. The sound quality is good and they’re easy to use. I only use these to exercise, so I can’t speak to phone call quality."
0,Horrible fit.
1,"Fit is very comfortable, and sound is very clear.  I haven't tried them out on a run yet, but I have high hopes.  Overall great value!!"
1,Amazing quality!
1,Very good headphones. The sound is good quality. Very short time to connectvthe phone.
0,"I have these a short time, a couple months, and they suddenly have gone dead. The pair before this I had four a few years before problems. I like the fit and sound so I am ordering again."
1,So far the best that I have gotten. Still adjusting for the size of the ear thing to get the best out of it.
0,Loved these but then just stipped working i onky used them maybe 5 times
1,Just received my headphones. Absolutely LOVE them. The sound quality is amazing. Having the Bluetooth feature is a huge plus. I travel a lot and not having headphone cords in the way or having to hold my phone to listen to music is wonderful. The carrying case is a plus. Keeps the headphones safe and free from damage. Have not used the mic feature yet.
1,"Exceptional sound, great value for your money, ergonomic and great for exercise or casual use"
1,These Ear Buds are as Described. Pairing very easy and I am new to Smart Phones also worked awesome with my Laptop<br />Good price for an excellent product  which comes with many accessories included in box like Car Charging Adapter
0,Headphones didn't turn on after a week of usage.
1,This is great when i am working around the house I don't have to worry about tripping over cables and chords. I think this is a great item.
1,I use these headphones for the gym and they are just freakin awesome! Sound quality is great fitmemt is great just freakin great. Only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is the car charger it came with didn't work. Other than that I highly recommend these!!
1,"They're better than expected. The sound quality and bass are very nice. They're really loud, I can only listen to them half of the volume. Great buy, specially given the price!!!<br /><br />Updated: 11/2017<br />I’m still happy with my purchase but unfortunately the cable on the left side became loose and the sound will not come out unless I keep moving the cable. I’m very happy since they lasted all this time! I use them EVERY day since I bought them, specially for running and they are great!"
1,I love these earphones. The last pair were broken (my fault)  I ordered another pair ASAP. Can’t live without them. Awesome!!!!!
0,"I bought these from my boyfriends account awhile back and now they're all messed up. Only right ear works. Al static sometimes. Sometimes it won't pair. I definitely didn't get my money's worth. I can't return them because the return date expired. Oh well, finding a better kind now!"
1,"I was excited to get these. They paired, no problem, the first time but after that, they wouldn't. After trouble shooting many times, still they would not pair. Not sure what the problem was. They sounded great when they worked! I'd like to get another pair but am afraid that I will run into the same problem. I can't work out without music so reliability is very important."
0,"I wanted to like these headphones when i got them cause my brother-in-law said he had them for 2 years and they worked great. When I first got them the audio would cut in and out everytime i turned them on for a couole seconds. This made me think that the headphones were deffective but this eventually stop so i ignored it. About 1.5 months in and the headphones no longer charge. Its a shame because the sound quality was nice and they were comfy, but they feel cheap and didnt last at all."
0,"Refuses to pair to a device (my phone) when headphones are inches from the phone. Just today, I've had to do a hard reset on five separate occasions, because the headphones repeatedly disconnected.<br /><br />Avoid these."
1,Good
1,"Not bad, but the over ear part just broke, so I cant rely on it staying in the ear. It simply broke while i was putting it on; it seemed flexible, but it broke. I havent used them much."
1,Very comfortable
1,Good headphones for the price.
1,"Great Headphones. They have been the best ones I have bought and you can't beat the price! And even better customer service. They started to give us problems a few months after having them, after running through some troubleshooting steps with SENSO customer service they still wouldn't work so they are replacing them with no hassle. This has been a quick and speedy process and I really appreciate Senso customer service reps for making this a painless process so I can get back to enjoying music while I work. I can't wait to start using these again."
1,Excellent product as described. Receive quickly and met my expectations.
1,"My first pair stop charging after a couple of months and that was a total bummer. The good news is the senso support team worked really fast getting me a replacement pair. These work great, especially for their price. Would buy again!"
0,the battery wouldn't take a charge after 18 months
1,As a former DJ and a soundman I am totally amazed at the quality of your Bluetooth earbuds for the money that I paid. It was quick delivery and it’s an excellent product for the money and paired with no problem. I’m very satisfied!
1,Works great for running / in the gym
0,"I am continually having issues with the bluetooth connection.  These are not ideal for outdoor or sports activity.  If there's any wind, the connection gets broken and jumpy.  Or if I'm sweating, I have found the connection to be impacted too (despite is saying it's sweatproof).  I wear my phone in an arm band, so the signal doesn't have far to go, and I've used my phone successfully with other bluetooth headphones- so it makes me deduce the issue is the headphones.  There is nothing worse than being in the middle of a great run, for your music to be start jumping, skipping and going in and out.  Once it starts skipping, the connection does not recover or reconnect."
1,"Exactly what I was looking for. Have only had them for 2 weeks, so I can't speak to longevity, but they perform great out of the box."
1,Thanks  my headphones  is really good  the is amazing  i feel  so happy  thanks  again  i will  talk  with  my friends
1,"They are good as long as you are within 10 feet of your phone. Even then, sometimes I turn my head and they start cutting out."
1,I received the order very timely and the connection was a simple process.<br /><br />The operation is first rate and the standard equipment is outstanding too.<br /><br />Thank you!
1,"Headphones stopped working a little under a year. They replaced them in 4 days. I would buy again, great customer service."
1,"The sound quality is good.  The fit is okay as well.  Not great.  But they do stay on.<br /><br />The controls are the exact opposite of every other Bluetooth headset I've owned.  When listening to music, the front button is the ""back"" button to repeat the track.  The back button is the ""skip"" button to go to the next track.<br /><br />The sound up/down and skip/repeat functions are also the opposite.  I'm used to tapping the forward button once to skip a song.  But with this headset, you have to hold it down and wait.  So if you're trying to skip multiple songs at the same time, it takes FOREVER.<br /><br />The quick tap function is to raise and lower the volume, which is something I rarely feel the need to do.  Certainly far less than skipping/repeating songs.  So like I said, the functions are opposite from what they should be."
1,"These are more comfortable than my other wireless earbuds. I love the additional things that came with them: the carrying case, charging cords, and interchangeable fins. The sound is pretty good and connecting is easy with my IPhone 7+. They stay put during runs and other workouts. They're sweat proof and don't get tangled. I'm happy with them. I charge them every other workout and that seems to work well."
1,Bought these as a gift for my son. He loves them!
1,Great Headphones
0,The sound quality is very good but the material is kind of flimsy.  The earbuds are quite nice but the part that fits over the ear is very flimsy and will not stay in place.
1,Great value for money. Good sound. Very comfortable to wear. Easy to operate. Highly recommended
1,"I bought these headphones for my husband.  He loves them! He says they are comfortable and,  the best selling point, you can listen to music or watch videos for hours before you need to charge them again. That exactly why I bought them, perfect!"
1,"I have very sensitive ears, and appreciate this product can be worn without actual insertion of the earbud. Im no audiophile but do believe sound quality is very good."
1,"Good sound and fit, but even better customer service.  Quick response and I highly recommend."
1,"I highly recommend these headphones for running.  I ran with mine consistently for about 10 months, unfortunately they stopped working.  I contacted support for the default 1 year warranty and it was incredibly easy.  No hassle from support and got a new pair ASAP."
1,Hello everyone this Bluetooth's ear phone is very very good I love it there run 8 hour I walking and working  and listen perfect you should buy one thank you bye-bye
1,"Very easy to use controls,  does everything it advertised.  Only issue for me is that the base is a little heavy."
1,"I'm shocked at the sound quality of these blue tooth wireless headphones! I'm a musician, I've had MANY different brands & products regarding music..I just needed a simple pair of BT headphones so I read the reviews and figured I'd give these a try. Very plesently suprised with them! The treble & bass are perfect really and the volume is freakin' great although most likely I'm on the path to hearing loss anyway Lol. Just get them, they rock folks!!!"
1,"I have always used the earbuds that came with my iPhones and just assumed that was as good as it would get.  I ordered these not knowing what to think, I can honestly say my iPhone earbuds are going in the garbage.  Very clear and with plenty of bass.  I wanted headphones that were clear and full, these absolutely fulfill those requirements.<br />As far as noise cancelling, I just put them in and cleaned my church.  I never once heard the vacuum.<br />I would highly recommend these to anyone who is looking for a great pair of headphones on a budget.<br />AWESOME!!!!"
1,"Nice quality, good sound, generous accessories. Better than the price would indicate."
1,"Been using these for a few months now. I get about 1 week on the battery life, using it about 1 hour a day. Great for listening to music while working out at the gym or running, the sound quality is not like a top-tier headphone but it is very good considering the price. It actually blocks outside noise really well. My only complaint is that the microphone does not pick my voice well, especially in a noise environment like a gym. If you try to have a phone conversation with it, the other person may have a hard time understanding everything.  But I still give this a 5/5."
1,"Receive them within two days.  I love the headphones and sounded great.  They were easy to set up with my ipad pro, ipod, samsung phone & ipod nano.  I use the headphones all the time when I exercise at the health club."
1,Good buy
1,It easily beat dr beats 350$ headphones!<br /><br />First 4 hour use expression!!<br />Will update next week if anything noticeable changes happen
1,"Great fit, quick charge, and very clear audio."
1,"I really love these headphones. They are comfortable. Great sound. Very easy too use. They came with a carrying case, car charger, and 1 year warranty. And all at a great price! Thank you Senso!"
0,I run five or six miles a day and weight train (one or the other daily). Thought I found a diamond in the rough with these headphones. Decent sound and loved the fit.<br /><br />These lasted less than 10 workouts before dying in the middle of a run. Not so sure about the IPX7 rating. Returned them via Amazon.
1,Good quality for a good price
1,Ordered these for the gym. They connect with my phone and even my mac book air if I want them to. They usually auto connect when I turn the headphones on which is a huge convenience.<br /><br />My left earbud snapped in half but I emailed customer support and was covered by their 1 year warranty. It didn't take very long to get it sorted out and I now have another new and not broken pair on the way!
1,Quality product (just as advertised) and quick shipment.  Totally satisfied
1,The part that hook around your ear are too weak. They come off easily when I work out. Everything else about the product is great.
1,"These really surprised me.  I have previously been less than impressed with Bluetooth earbuds.  They usually lack volume, fullness of sound, and good bass response.  These excel in all those categories.  They're hot HiFi headphones for audiophiles....but they are very good.  They fit will, sound good, and do the job well.  The battery is very good as well."
1,"work really great, excellent value"
1,They are a great set of wireless ear buds with a even greater price. I've only had the buds for about a few weeks now but sound quality is enjoyable and pretty darn loud so I don't ever need to go full volume and battery life isn't shy of a energizer battery bunny commercial it keeps going and going. I'm also very happy with the charging cables and car plug it brought both look and feel of a quality product.
1,"Used for two days and already on par with the Blue Buds X i used to use as far as sound qualoty, as far as comfort level and staying in, they surpass them. can't beat them for the price."
0,"I was excited to receive these headphone, but they will not stay in my ears.  I put the smallest earbuds on, and they still won't stay in my ears.  I am a 64 year old female."
1,"I was skeptical about buying such cheap headphones, but I'm a few weeks into wearing them and I love them! I use them on a daily basis at the gym! They are super light and comfortable. Here's why I love them!<br />Pros: Super light and comfortable!<br />They connect IMMEDIATELY after being turned on...I still can't believe how fast they connect.<br />Really good sound for how cheap they are.<br />They stay in my ears the whole time, running, lifting, stairs, etc.<br />The battery is GREAT! I charge them every few days or so( my workouts are usually 1-2 hours a day)<br />If you want a really nice, reliable, cheap, comfortable set of bluetooth headphones...Get these!"
1,"Love these headphones.  This is the first pair of wireless headphones I have ever owned and they work great and have realistic sound.  I've never tried Beats, but I can't see they would be any better.  What a deal for the money. I love them."
1,"Super price for what you get, bought for $ 24.99!!<br />Great quality and very good sound. Bought for my husband and he is super happy with his new Bluetooth headphones. Color is pretty much all black and just the logo is red."
1,Best sound of usb wireless I've experienced yet
1,"Works as advertised, however, doesn't work too well with hearing aids. Will have to remove hearing aids in order to use them properly."
1,"Great customer service - within a week of receiving these I received an email asking how the headphones were working.<br />Outside of some issues with people I call being able to hear me over ambient noise, these are a great value.<br />Not the greatest playback control with Overdrive Audiobooks but everywhere else the controls work great."
1,I bought these on July 30 2017. They were and are still my first pair of wireless headphones. I workout in the gym Atleast 5 times a week. These headphones are the best investment I've ever made on gym equipment. The battery still last for Atleast 4 2 hour workout sessions a week. They still sound great. When/if they ever die you can bet I'm getting another pair.
1,"These work amazing just loud enough, great bass."
1,"I'm indicicive w this kind of stuff so I had to finally just buy a pair, I'm stoked on these. Good sound, $40, what else you want for the price"
0,"After reading all the amazing reviews, Inwas excited to get my earbuds.  I used them a couple of times and put them away because I also have Bose wireless.  When Inwent to use them again, they won't connect to my phone and they are hard to turn on.  When I did use them, I would drop calls whenever I inadvertently touched my ear. I threw money down the drain."
1,"Been using these for a few weeks now and truly fit what I need them for.  I hate being tied to my phone via plug in ear buds while I'm working.  These allow me to move around the office/house while on a conference call.  Sound quality is great.  Only thing I do not like is that when an incoming call is ringing, the voice is announcing the phone number of the caller, I'd rather it be the name of the caller or nothing at all.  But minor thing all considering!"
1,For discounted Bluetooth sweat resistance earbuds - they work great. Although they give a clip to tie up the extra cord - I wish it was more like the Plantronics BackBeat Fit Bluetooth Headphones. Outside of having the cord banging the back of the neck - I have no complaints. I run hard and these stay put - unlike the ones with the &#34;wings&#34; only - like the Jaybird X3. Don't believe the ones that claim these 'Wings&#34; only will hold in play - they will not over time - no matter the price. If just walking - &#34;Wing&#34; only place holders may work for you. Need something more like these Senso or Plantronics for active people. For the price - the Senso cannot be beat.
1,"Sound is good. Noise cancelation seems only to work for mic, not on speaker sound. Maybe I read the ad wrong. Next design, put the multi function button somewhere other than where you push the bud into your ear."
1,"These are great for running! I have tried other wireless headphones, but they either feel bulky or the mic causes they to weigh to one side or the other and become uneven. These worked wonderfully. The sound is good and the connection is clear."
1,"The product is exactly as advertised and came with all the accessories necessary. The included charging cable with a lightning/micro USB head is very thoughtful , convenient, and useful. I'm leaving it in my car so passengers can use it whether they have an iPhone or a phone with a micro USB port. The ear buds fit in my ears perfectly and don't fall out while walking/running. Only thing that I don't like is how the LED indicator is a bit small. But you'll get over it once you get used to the power on/off mechanism and pairing. The sound Quality is definitely an upgrade to iPhone headphones and this will be future proof if I decide to go to a headphone jack less phone without dealing with a dongle."
1,"great sound quality. only issue is when one earbud  is out, cord gets caught on neck when turning your head. when both buds are in, no complaints. Bluetooth works very well"
1,I ordered a second set of these headphones because I was very satisfied with the sound quality. I now keep a set at home and at work. The only issue I have is occasionally the wire that connects the two earpieces can get bunched up pulling more to one side or the other. Perhaps a smooth straw like tube would solve the problem or some type of clip.
0,This paired with my iPhone 6 plus easily. The sound is average. I used these at the gym but I stopped because they kept falling out of my ears every time I would get on the bench press. Bottom line is that it did not really impress me.
1,"I'm in love with my earphones, great quality! Great sound. I had just purchased a pair from a local store 59.99 and by the second day, they stopped working"
1,"I tried another brand of similar style and had to return as they kept cutting out while I was running.  I decided to give these a try and have used them a number of times now out running and while doing yard work and they have worked great!  For the price I don't think you can really go wrong.  Volume is decent, they come with a case and several different ear fittings for size.  Right after my purchase I received an email providing me with a number that claims 24/7 365 days live support and a 1 year warranty.  After I received them I did receive another follow-up email providing me the same information."
1,"I would highly recommend these earbuds! They work great, have great sound,they are extremely comfortable to wear, and the charge lasts for hours! GREAT PRODUCT!"
1,These headphones are great. They sound good and are loud and the battery life is great.
1,The  sound quality was ok but had trouble keeping the headphones on my ears even with the ear holders.
1,I use these while walking on my treadmill and the sound is better than the more expensive sets I've had.
1,These headphones are very comfortable and light-weight exactly what I was looking for. The fact that they perform well is an added bonus.
1,"They sound good for the price - but both stopped working on me, the first within a few months, the second within a couple of weeks.  The sound isolating earbuds have a tendency to pop off - and there aren't spares provided, just alternative silicon earbuds which don't isolate the sound very well. NIce carrying case."
1,"Great headphones. I was looking for something with great sound, comfortable, sweat proof and fast charging. These fit all those criteria, and more. They are also noise canceling. The only downside, the headphones need a clip to hold to the shirt collar to keep from falling off. Other than that, its a great set of headphones."
1,Awesome product my son loves them and it got here so fast. It said it would take a week and I got it in 48hrs. I would definitely recommend to anyone!
1,These headphones have as good a sound if not better than your overpriced headphones i.e. Beats. Sound quality is great! You have to stick them in your ears until snug to get a good experience. I wear them to the gym for about an hour or so a day and I find I only have to charge them once a week.
1,"Before I purchased Senso, I purchased my first pair of wireless headphones for a friend a few weeks ago. Seemed like a great idea, so I got another pair for myself as well. When I went for a run, they continuously fell off my ears, and sounded muffled. Then less than an hour later, they  needed to be recharged. I knew I’d never use them again and was sorry I had purchased a pair for my friend.<br />I looked at different wireless brands in the electronics store, but the prices were insane. Some as high as $300.00.<br />I went online and saw Senso and thought I’d give it a try.<br />The Senso Ear Buds are excellent! I was so happy with the fit, the sound, the price and the accessories that I immediately purchased a 2nd pair for my friend. I can’t imagine purchasing anything else."
1,"They're good for working out and commuting. But the left earbud has a ringing sound in it. I thought it was a defect so I returned my first pair. The second pair had it too, so I stuck with them because they're not awful. They have good sound, and work decent (sometimes getting it to pair with my phone is a pain), but don't try to sleep or study with them on. The ringing sound will drive you crazy."
0,Not WIRELESS! Not WIRELESS! Not WIRELESS! Not WIRELESS! Not WIRELESS! Not WIRELESS! Not WIRELESS! Not WIRELESS! Not WIRELESS! Not WIRELESS! Not WIRELESS! Not WIRELESS! Not WIRELESS! Not WIRELESS!
1,"Sound is pretty good, and they definitely stay put while jogging. Battery is good, as well. Happy with the purchase!"
1,"The sound quality is great BUT the part that hooks around your ear is too big even after trying to bend them to fit.... so it won't stay on my ears. I'm constantly adjusting them...and I haven't worn them to workout yet, this is just around the house to test them before I go to the gym. The packaging is nice, quality is nice but I had to give 3 stars because I will have to give them away to someone who has larger ears."
1,Awesome earbuds. I love it! I love the 24/7 customer service.
1,"Great deal, especially for the price. They are lightweight, have several size options on the ear pads for a good fit (one of which is the spongy material that will conform to the inside of your ear like hearing protection), and they stay in place very well. I bought these for running and even after a half marathon, they were still comfortable. The sound is great! Good bass. I love that they don't have any controls on the wire so there is nothing to bounce around as you run. These are my favorite earbuds so far."
1,"Received these headphones yesterday, I am very pleased with the comfort of these compared to other headphones I've used.<br />The sound quality is very good.  Music sounds great with good bass."
1,"Arrived Immediately, wasn't expecting the extra attachments.  Silly me, I had to call because the charging cable did not fit my android phone.  All I had to to do was pull the iPhone end out to reveal the android plugin. However, they answered my call immediately and I was on my way. Good Product I would recommend"
1,"Before I start with the negatives, let's go with the positives first. In terms of comfort, packaging, and overall aesthetics, I was immensely satisfied with the product. The earbuds themselves feel robust and without being cumbersome or heavy. The product also has a very slick low-profile look to it, which I liked a lot, as well as the reliability of the battery (I didn't get a full 8 hours but close to it). So purely from that standpoint, the product is a 5/5.<br /><br />But in terms of what actually matters to me the most--the sound--these earbuds fell TERRIBLY short. Now I'll preface with the fact that I'm not an audiophile; I used $20 Skullcandy sports buds before this product. But the sound in these was so lackluster that it wasn't unlike the $10 earbuds you'd buy at the gas station. The treble in these is fine for me, but it's the mid/low-range notes and bass that made me feel like I had to return the product as soon as possible. Most of the music that I played (from a variety of genres) sounded muddled, so you'll almost certainly need to tweak your EQ settings in whatever music app you use in order to bring more clarity and bass to these earbuds, because they aren't really up to par straight out of the box."
1,These were awkward for me. Didn't hold much battery duration.  Not what I really wanted.
1,5 stars if they were more aerodynamic & generated less wind noise.
1,"These worked really well for almost 1.5 years. I could hear the quality of calls and music well. I was told that sometimes background noise was picked up too much, but that’s most headphones anyway.<br /><br />After a year, I would connect to my phone for a call but then they would disconnect without saying “disconnected”. I thought it was something with the phone updates until today. Today I was told “power on, connected” but then the phone couldn’t find them. I tried turning them off and trying again. Every time the headphones would say power on, connected. Never power off or disconnected. I had just charged them so dead battery."
0,Stayed on well. Sound was mediocre. Stopped charging the day after it was eligible for return.
1,Super fast delivery! Better than expected! Very high quality Bluetooth Headphones accompanied by the cutest set! It sure has improved my running performance!
1,Received as told. This was a Christmas present. They are really pleased w the product and knowing a 1 year warranty comes with them makes it even better. Thanks for following thru and thanking us for the business. We also have a small business and thank you goes a long way!
1,"I like them for running and they stay in my ears too. However, I connection is not good in my fitbelt."
0,"I would give  it 0 stars if i could.  I got 4 of these, because the sound was good and for the price, but 4 months later not even 1 is working! Other headphones have lasted me years."
1,"These headphones were a lot better than what I originally expected them to be when I bought them. They had a small kink in the wire sheath when I unboxed them, but they worked fine so I didn't bother sending them back. For just shy of a year they worked great, until somehow, the sheath pulled apart in my gym bag and the wires became exposed (Note: My gym bag is like Mary Poppins bag if it had been bitten by a werewolf-hulk hybrid. There are days that I'm afraid to reach into it...) Anyways, after I noticed the tear, I emailed Senso, and within minutes they had processed my claim and have sent me a replacement pair. I haven't experienced customer service as efficient as theirs. Nothing can beat great customer service in my book."
1,"I bought these for my husband. He says they are good enough for short time use, especially during work out. For longer use they are not very comfortable over the ear."
1,"So Far So Good! Been used in shower, quick to recharge, great sound quality."
1,They are very comfortable and the charge lasts a long time.
1,"Love these headphones! I do water aerobics in my local high school pool and no boom boxes are allowed.  So I set my playlist and go to town listening to all my motivational music.  Easy to use, fantastic sound, and fit in my ear perfectly. Thank you so much for the phenomenal sound and portability."
1,They are ok headphones. They take a while to connect and they fell super flimsy. the battery life is not as good as they said it would be. IF your looking for just a comfortable pair to toss around these would work but they are nothing to write home about. The extras they throw in are fun but not really what everyone would need.
0,Stopped working after one day. Just returned it.
1,"I love these headphones. They really get you motivated in the gym. To describe the sound quality, I would say they have great bass, the battery life is awesome. These headphones stay in your ears, they have flexibility for your ears. The main thing is these headphones are sweat proof, so I really enjoyed that. I can say don't listen to the other negative reviews. If you want good quality headphones, then I would give these a try."
1,Great sounding for the price.
1,"Best bluetooth headset I could find for the money.  It's not hard to find sets over $100. I use these for jogging and have little issue with keeping them in, maybe occasionally re-adjust them.  Battery last a long time I think. I'll go on several runs without recharging them. I've had no issues with them connecting to my iphone.<br /><br />I feel it does take a little getting used to wearing them, but they've never caused me any pain. Only downside I've experienced is when it's windy. Due to their size and shape, it really captures the wind to the point it sometimes drowns out the music. But on an average day they're just fine."
0,Not good. I connected it with brand new iPhone 8 and people said i sound like i am inside a tunnel. There is too much echo. And for refund i will have to pay $6.29 for shipping which is another shocker. Poor & cheap product and i fell for it. Don't make the same mistake as me. First time i went with non-branded product and now i regret it.
1,Received very quickly. This is a holiday gift for my nephew! My husband and son love theirs. Great price point and work great. Durable.
1,I love my new headphones.  The sound is amazing and the fit is great.  I don't have any problem with them shifting during exercise workouts.
1,Good sound out of these - better bass than TV.  Range is pretty good.  Only complaint is that they only hold a charge for up to 2 hours.  Have to recharge before every use.
1,"I love that everything one needs is in the package. No worries about having to buy a charger for your car, for example.  The sound quality is excellent.  I would compare it to Bose. The fact that I don't have to worry about them getting a little wet is fantastic. I would recommend this product  to friends that run, or do hot yoga.  I am very pleased. The product is well worth the cost."
1,Awesome deal and very reliable. Announcement voice is a little too loud though.
0,"I really wanted to like these, but as soon as I paired them I knew they had to go back. Nice packaging, easy to pair, but so tinny. Perhaps I had inserted them wrong?  I played with them a bit and didn't get the sound quality I hoped for.  disappointing"
1,"I loved these but now they WON'T play media on my s7edge.  The media says it's playing but no sound in the headphones.  They still take calls and I can hear on calls fine, but that's it.  If anyone knows of a fix, let me know because of course they are no longer returnable.  Updating review.  It was the S7edge's fault not the headphones.  I hard-booted my phone to clear the cache and now they are working just fine again.  There is a bit of ringing feedback sound that's barely noticeable, but still an irritation, therefore the 4 stars.  Overall I would recommend these."
1,"I've only had these for a few days, but so far my impression is very favorable. I got these when my set of Beats headphones broke. The earpieces are not a firm as the beats, but do fine at holding them in place. The sound is good, and I actually prefer the controls on the earpiece, as opposed to a dongle on the wire. So far I've had no problem with sound cutting in and out, as I did with the Beats."
1,Not my favorite headphones.  Not sure what button but if I accidently bump it while they are on they call my last recent.  Many strange calls while I was in the middle of working out...
1,"The headphones are great for their price! They have lasted me a long time, and I absolutely adore these Bluetooth headphones!"
1,"Love these headphones! I usually have a difficult time keeping earbuds in while working out, but these are amazing. They sound great too! Purchasing another pair for my husband. I don't want to share."
1,Great headphones. Very good audio quality with surprising bass being earbuds
1,"Other reviews are correct; the rubber bits around the ear are very flimsy. That being said, they work great and I'm very pleased with my purchase."
1,The item is packed nicely. And over all looks pretty good. The only problem with this product is a sound quality . All you can hear is the bass. Very boomy sound .
1,"Awesome sounds, quick connectivity.  $80 off from Dr. Dre Beats with quality sounds.  My favorite for working out, running, walking and even quick privacy at work.  I have Bose, Dr Dre Beats and now Sensa.  110% support available, which i haven't had to use yet.  Dr Dre's Beats for $100 is much worst than Sensa.  I would buy again and or recommend.  I was missing out a long time not buying these.  There is a reason why so many customer like this headphones.  It's quality at terrific price."
1,Got this as a present and they love it.
1,So far so good! Great for working out and the sound is good for the price
1,"Charges fast and sound quality is nice. Not so great for working out as earbuds fall out, which was not a problem with a previous version I’d bought.  Volume is synced to phone so it doesn’t go as low as I’d like. Wouldn’t buy again."
1,Excellent
0,"While I was really high on these earbuds initially, now that the third pair has failed less than five months after they replaced them.  Even though the manufacturer replaced them each time, they've proven to be unreliable because each failure was a different problem.  Sadly, it's time to shop for another, more reliable brand."
0,"Bought these for my runs. They initially sounded great; very loud with a great EQ mix. Unfortunately, the started having problems on my first run with them. Firstly, they don't stay in the ear. I had to adjust them a few times a minute, which is annoying. Then, after about an hour of use, they started cutting out (sound would waver in and out). Additionally, after further use, the right headphone began to lose volume when compared to the left. I think the sweat played a role in this, which is lame because they claim to be waterproof. After a couple more days, the on/off button became permanently pushed in, so it's very difficult to even turn them on now. Wouldn't recommend for running/exercising/sweating in. Might be a good choice for daily use at home or in an office setting."
1,Great sound for a great price. Manufacturer contacted me the day after receipt of product to verify product satisfaction.  I  recommend this product!
1,"I just received my earbuds and so far I love them. I have used them on a run and the fit is perfect and the sound quality is well. I also used them to take a few phone calls and I have no complaints. I am going swimming with the earbuds this weekend and plan on doing a few events like Spartan Race, Tough Mudder, Tri. These are the perfect headphones for an athlete."
1,"Great quality, easy to use, excellent customer service"
1,nice
1,Wind blows right through them and makes it difficult to listen to music while running outside.
1,I bought these ear buds for my husband for a gift and he absolutely loves them! He told me that they are the most comfortable ear pieces he has ever had. Yeah! I hit a home run with these.... Thanks SENSO!<br /><br />-Lori M.
1,"The headphones work great! Sound is awesome, and the pairing process is quick and reliable. My only complaint is that the ear loops are really soft and don't retain the buds in my ear canals as well, but it's not like they're flopping out during runs or anything. Overall, I'd buy them again!"
1,they work great and are extremely comfortable to wear all day
1,For a $36 pair of wireless headphones these are great in my opinion. I tried the $59 lg tone headphones and they were too tinny in sound quality. The senso buds have excellent bass along with the treble when it comes to listening to music on my iPhone. The biggest selling point for me ( besides the positive reviews ) was the fact they're waterproof too. This way if I'm the phone or listening to music while making deliveries and it starts to rain I won't have to worry about having to scramble on taking them off.
1,"Quality is very good, fits in the ear nicely not feeling like you have to push it deep into your ear."
1,Great sound. Awesome quality. Nothing to complain about. Love these earphones and they didn't break the bank.
1,My right side bud stopped working. I contacted customer service and within an hour they were back with a fix. It didn't entirely fix the problem but within an hour of my reply Senso started the process of sending out a new set of headphones. Very impressed with their service.
0,"The primary reason for my purchase of these headphones was to link to my computer to take work phone calls.  From the onset, the headphones would cut in/out and/or sound would become distorted within about 5-10 minutes of being on a call or when listening to music.  The fix to clear the distortion was to turn the headphones off and turn back on; however, the same problem continued.  I also received a lot of comments from people I was on a call with that they were hearing a lot of background noise on my end, so the touted &#34;Noise Suppression Technology&#34; was non-existent.  I reached out to customer support who advised me on doing a &#34;factory reset&#34; of the headphones, which I did; however, it did not remedy the issue.  As a result, I was told they would issue a refund and re-issue me a new set of headphones.  Customer service was very prompt in responding, so I do need to give them credit for that; however, when I received the new set of headphones, I experienced the exact same issues which leads me to believe this was not just an isolated issue.  Unfortunately, I let time lapse on my return for both sets, so I'm out approximately $70 and have two bad sets of headphones.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT."
1,"They arrived quickly and in this cute little case. I like them even though the piece that goes over the ear is kind of loose. The buds need to be adjusted quite often but the sound quality is good. For some reason the Bluetooth looses it's connection with my Iphone quite often, I have to stop whatever I'm doing, wait for it to reconnect and then go back to my music. Other than those minor inconveniences I do like them."
1,8 hrs of music nice
1,Works awesome highly recommend this product.
1,Works well for the most part but there are some major connectivity issues at times. Like riding a bike the audio will constantly cut out. If you cup your hand over your right earpiece it will cut out completely until you remove it. I cant connect it to my computer without any major major lag and inconsistency with the audio. Cant replace it seeing how there is no option to do so. Maybe there is a bait and switch going on here selling defective products.
1,All is good only a problem is when you sleeping and while you talk on hye phone i think it doesn't sound good. I don't know only mine or all of them are same..??...!
1,"The best headphones I had tried, the quality sound the battery OMG the best price for the best product, I'm soo happy to purchase this."
0,"Crap. Bought them 9 months ago, just stopped working. Won't turn on, fully charged."
1,I like ease of the functions. Great sound.
1,Bass Bass Bass! Bass everywhere! A tad too much bass for me... But using an equalizer on your music app should help take care of it as it did for me!
1,"Comfortable, easy to use and great sound."
1,Great battery life sound quality. Just ran a marathon with them and they worked great!
1,I've tried many other kinds of headphones but these are the only ones I've ever liked.
1,The sound is good but it keeps falling out of my ear due to the anchor is so soft it does not stay in my ear
1,"Fast response time, I really like my senso earbuds.  They actually replaced a pair I lost"
0,"Customer service is terrible. The sound went out in my headphones while they were still under warranty. Customer service told me to do a reset. When i told them the reset didnt work they just stopped replying to me, and now im stuck with a broken pair of headphones."
1,So i loved the sound coming out of the right bud n was very happy with the headphones except i had to send them back due to the left bud wouldn't play. I think the product was great but am a little hesitent of repurchasing them in case of the same problem
1,"I have been wanting a Bluetooth headphones for a while, and just did not want to spend a lot of money  on it. I found these, and I decided to give a shot, it's just $20. I'm pleasantly surprised. They still work, and I use them everyday at the gym. I've had them for 3 months now."
1,I like how they go over my ears and stay in place.
1,Love these headphones. I have bought a few others and they were always hard to pair with my phone or were to uncomfortable.<br />These were perfect!<br />Thank you
0,Worked great for the first 3 months or so. But now the left ear bud cuts in and out and it's really annoying. I often end up just taking out that side and listening on the right side only. Not super impressed.<br /><br />Update: They stopped working completely after 5 or 6 months of use.
1,Great for the treadmill. Also awesome in the weight room to avoid conversation and grunt noises.
1,"I've had these headphones well over a year now, I like them a lot. sound is good, stay in the ear nearly all the time.<br /><br />There is one thing I hate about them.<br /><br />The Bluetooth antennae is only in the right ear!<br /><br />So if you wear a smartwatch on your left wrist, or put your smartphone in your left pocket, it will drop the connection, A LOT.<br /><br />These things would be perfect if it had a unified antennae on both ears."
1,"Love everything about these. They were shipped when promised, they work just as advertised and I've been recommending them to everyone I know. They stay in place during all sorts of various works. Using them to speak with on phone calls is also flawless. I have zero complaints."
1,There great and water proof
1,So far I am extremely pleased with my senso headphones -I am not very tech savvy but this was easy to set up and use:)  I think I will be purchasing one for my husband and son too !
1,"Use these just for the gym (treadmill, etc.).  Work very well!"
1,"So far so good on these bad boys.  This is my 1st pair of bluetooth earbuds and I took my time deciding on a pair.  I use them primarily for work so I'm not commenting on the sound quality for audiofiles.  The quality of sound is actually pretty good for the price.  A few of my friends have bluetooth earbuds that dont sound good or the mic. doesnt pick up your voice well.  I've called several people and they all say they can hear me clearly.  The only downside for me is that they do hurt your ears after 30 mins of use.  I sort of remedied this by putting them in a certain way.  I believe I turn them forward which is more of a natural fit for my ears.  There is a button on the side of the right ear that allows you to turn on and off the buds.  It also allows you to end and take the call.  There is a volume button also on the top of the right earbud.  They seem to charge quickly and they come with 2 charging cords.  One that is short and has a usb on end and a micro usb(typical android connection) on the other side.  There is also a longer cable that has a usb on one end and a combo micro usb and micro usb on the other end.  All in all good earbuds for the price.  Sound quality is good for the price you pay, but probably not what someone is looking for if they are interested in hi def audio files."
1,"Awesome sound, price and support!!!!! I was a Beats guy all the way and I lost my set a few days ago and did not want to spend 200 bucks. I read the reviews on these and decided to try them. I am super pleased!! No more Beats for me !!!!"
0,"The range that I experience with these is a bit less than the 30' advertised... For me it was about 1' to 18&#34;. They work when I'm holding my phone up, but if I put my phone in my pocket they skip constantly, and nothing is more aggravating. I can't really see a use for these.<br /><br />That being said, the sound quality is pretty average, maybe decent for the money. If you get them to fit right they are listenable enough, but that's only if they aren't skipping."
0,"Had great experience with this product in the past, but received two defective units in the last month. Charging port broke off inside in both cases. Tried to get satisfaction with the seller without success. Have to go the Amazon return route."
1,"I am happy with the product however the range is not adequate, I can only walk a short distance away from my synced device before the sound crackles and eventually goes out, VERY disappointing.<br /><br />I recommended this product to a family member who bought it and has no problems with range/static. I didn’t use the product until nearly the last date it was eligible for return so guess I’ll have to love with it 😟."
1,Yes these are legit and work great! I could use a little more bass but I hear all the dynamics of sound and people hear me fine.
1,Battery last for at least 6 hours. Love it
1,I bought these for my 20 yr old son for his birthday.  He LOVES them!  They are perfect for his work outs and uses them all the time.  He is very picky about the sound quality and fit and he has had no problems with these.  A GREAT BUY!!
1,"Bought these for my husband for his birthday. They were amazing headphones. However, we’ve had them less than two years and they won’t charge anymore. Very bummed."
1,The last pair I bought stopped holding a charge after 2 weeks. I love the headphones so I ordered this pair in hopes it wouldn’t happen again.
0,Product stopped working after 2 months. Have received no response when writing in warranty claim on website.<br /><br />*actually tried buying again because I like the way these headphones fit and I am experiencing trouble with the second pair as well.
1,Love the flexibility of the wires and over ear holder
1,Over the ear is the way to go for me. No chance of losing them
0,"I got these for the gym based on a ton of great reviews, pair with the price, which seemed like too good of a deal to pass up. I've never been thrilled by the in ear style Ear buds, as they never seem to stay in very well, and are just uncomfortable. These were no exception, unfortunately. My real issue though, is that they sounds like crap. I've never scrutinized headphones I buy for gym use that hard for their sound. In fact, I've always been pretty happy to use the freebie earbuds that come with your iPhone. The only reason I made the jump to wireless is that Apple got rid of the jack, and I like having multiple sets of headphones available. (One in the car, one in a travel bag, etc). These headphones sound muffled and not crisp at all. If I'd have spent $170 on these, I'd have returned them the next day. I still may."
1,Good quality
0,"The sounds quality is okay. The base is too flat. The design of the headphones creates a lot of noise when walking outside even with very weak wind. When walking outside and listen music with these headphones, the wind noise sounds like I am riding on a motorcycle."
0,"I really wanted to like these, with almost 20,000 reviews they have to be good. These hurt my ears after 5 minutes. The disc-shaped plastic that the earbuds attach to rub against my ears and press against the cartilage constantly. When I press the red button to answer a call it presses the earpiece into my ear even more and really hurts. The sound was okay, nothing spectacular. And I have to pay $7 to return these through UPS even though they're a prime product?"
0,"Has several issues that make these headphones unpleasant.<br /><br />1. The ear sizes supported are too large. The smallest size is still too big for me. I'm not a tiny person.<br />2. The lowest sound setting is a little too low for a quiet office. The second lowest setting is way too loud. I tried precisely controlling the sound level but the headphones only support these large discrete sound levels.<br /><br />If you have big ear canals and poor hearing then these are great. Pairing is trivial, the buttons work great, the sound quality is good. The build quality seems acceptable if not excellent for the price."
1,"So far these have worked great! I haven't really put them through the paces yet but, pairing was a cinch and sound quality is good. I haven't used them to answer calls yet so I can't say how well they do. All in all they're good wireless headphones for the price."
1,Love these. Work great for listening to music while exercising and answering the phone.
1,The earbuds are everything they claimed to be. I am more than satisfied with this product and have recommended them to my family and friends. The shipping was insanely fast!!
1,"Had these now for three months, and they're excellent, especially for their price. I think they're supposed to be noise cancelling, but after having used the Bose QC headphones on aircraft, these do not come close in the noise cancellation department. That is, unless I can figure out a way to push them deeper into my ear canal which I don't think I (or anyone) should do. Anyway, for the purpose I purchased them for, as a blue tooth headset for my cell phone, they are perfect."
1,"amazing quality, amazing batter life, great base. Very impressed."
1,Got this pair for my husband cause I love my pair! He loves them too! Great product!
1,I love these headphones and bought a 2nd pair for my son.
1,Very with the quality and items included in the packaging. The sound was also very impressive. I am extremely happy with these headphones.
1,"I've used Bluetooth headphones for a few years now and these are the best ones I've ever had! The sound quality is great, the design fits my ears, and the controls are easy to use. I am a very active person and usually have to buy a new pair ever 2-3 months but these are high quality and much more durable than other headphones. I will update my review after a few months of testing. Great purchase!"
1,"These headphones are amazing. If you are looking for something with clear and loud sound quality, you just found them. They are some of the best headphones that I have ever owned. The only flaw I found was that, after a long while, they can become a bit uncomfortable in the ear lobe but if you just adjust them a bit then you should be fine. I would highly recommend these headphones to anyone in the future."
1,"Easy set up, work great, fit well."
1,Great
1,Great sound quality. Stays on my ears. Happy with purchase
1,"Easy to pair. I'm impressed with the bass quality!! I've never had earbuds produce bass quality as deep and rich as these... The low tones are something you'd expect from an over the head large headphone set.<br /><br />These things are going to take my long distance runs to a whole other level.<br /><br />The noise cancellation qualities are impressive as well. Haven't had them long enough to test battery life, but considering the size I expect to charge them after every use."
0,Ear phones broke after 2 months of use. They were taken care of perfectly and then just stopped connecting to blue tooth randomly.
1,"Wow! What an amazing set of headphones! The quality of sound is excellent with highs and perfect bass. Very comfortable and perfect for working out listening to music  or just watching a movie. Set up was easy, highly recommended these for the price."
1,"I originally gave these headphones 5 stars but if I could give them more I would. Not only does the battery last for a long time, the sounds is amazing, and they're super comfy to wear. Recently I washed my headphones. I know, dumb right? They still work! They're charging just fine and they still sound super clear. While I don't recommend washing these headphones, know that if you do, they will survive."
1,"Great product, nice accessories and the sound quality is just fine for a Bluetooth headset. Had to come back to them for the 10% discount voucher they promised inside the product, however."
0,Sound quality really poor
0,Heavy on base for audio.  Really bad for phone calls. Caller on other end complains echo
1,"Excellent product, great sound, for the price, you can't beat it. Just as good as many more expensive ones."
1,"Good headphones, comfortable and pretty good audio quality. Stay on your head while working out which was most important to me."
1,Great product. The orginal headset had a faulty microphone  - the vendor shipped me a replacement immediately. Works great. Thanks.
1,Noise cancelling headphone! Fit very comfortably in the ears! So far loving it!
1,"I'm impressed with the clear, rich sound. I am very pleased with my purchase."
1,"Great product, couldn't be happier"
1,Great sound!
1,Great sound easy to install.
0,Headphones worked fine until 2nd night when plugging the charge cord into the port to power up.  The port mechanism loosened and disappeared into the earpiece.  Returning for a replacement.
1,"I've been using these headphones for about 18 months on and off, and regularly for the past 3 months, mostly while working out. I've got to say, for the price these are very well made. At one point about a month ago, I forgot I had them in the pocket of my hoodie, which I threw in the wash. I thought I had lost them and looked for them for an entire day. My wife found them while she was folding the laundry the next day, just as I was considering ordering another set. I really did not expect them to work anymore, but they fired right up and sounded as good as they did the first day I got them. I was pretty astonished that it made it thru a super wash cycle, then a dryer cycle, coming out unscathed. It's been a month, and they are still working perfectly fine. They certainly are not for audiophiles or those that want truly stellar sound, especially not at this price point. They're for casual listening.<br />As far as negatives, the wire that connects the 2 sides is too rubbery, which causes it to keep catching on dry skin, clothing, etc. If the connecting wire was made a bit slicker, this issue would probably go away. Not a huge deal though, all the positives outweigh the small negatives. The other negative is that the microphone is practically useless at this point, as the person on the other end of the line can't hear me speak when the earbud is in my ear. I have to bring the mic side of the earbud closer to my mouth so they can hear. However, I don't know if this is because of the wash/dry cycle, as I had not really used it for the calling functionality until after that happened."
1,"Item delivered as promised, sound quality is great. I don't have any high end head phones or ear buds but with these who needs them.  Nice quality at a great price.  Oh and a year warranty? Can't beat that.  I will be buying from these sellers again."
1,"Sound and loud, very clear,  so I’m happy.  Jus hope they last at least a couple years at the most"
1,Overall great sound. Amazing packaging and really enjoyable in general.
1,They are loud like I wanted.
1,"First, very impressed with the packaging.  They were shipped in a very nice box.  Everything needed  was in the box...nice carrying case for the headphones with different sized ear pieces and usb plug,  The instruction booklet was easy to understand.  The headphones were easy to pair with all my different devices...Mp3 players, phone, tv.  And...most importantly...the sound quality is very good.  All this for a very reasonable price!"
1,Great Quality and Sound
1,I bought these for my 14 year old grandson and he didn't take them off the night he got them.  He was do pleased with them.  The next day his mom confirmed how much he loved them.  The quality was outstanding for the price.  So glad I canceled my order for a more expensive brand that received poor reviews and ordered these.  I was a hero.
1,"it is very good sound, no noise, dependable, very attractive,  I love it  easy to use freely to use without worry, or destruction i have recommended for more than 7 people"
1,Good sound!
1,Great product
0,"I made the mistake of ordering these a few weeks before I joined the gym.  Now that I'm using them, I find that I do not like them.  They do not stay on my ears.  Several times during my workout (walking on a treadmill) they fall off.  The fit is terrible, so I don't hear the music very well.  But it's too late to return them.  Now I begin the search for a better product."
1,"Very clear, easy to operate, comfortable to wear.<br />More than I expected. Highly recommend purchasing."
1,Excellent product and delivery time!
1,Only used then one or twice so far but they seem good for the 30 ish bucks or whatever I paid. The design is a little bulky but I guess that extends the battery life
1,They charge quickly and stay charged for quite a while. Easy to connect to my phone via Bluetooth.
1,SENSO Bluetooth Headphones
1,Thea work great!
0,"Like the Beats brand, these stopped working after a few months of use but at least I didn’t spend $300 bucks on these. It worked great while it lasted."
1,"Wow, totally blew me away!  Sound quality with these bluetooth headphones is absolutely amazing.  Very rich sound with the right mix of bass and treble.  Easy to set up and operate.  Have used twice at the gym, lifting weights and elliptical machine, with no slippage.  Accessories included are a very nice touch.  Very highly recommend!!"
1,"Great Bluetooth connectivity, stay in ears, good sound quality. A+ for the price."
1,"Have used these a few times around the house and so far impressed with their comfort and sound quality. Senso has a done an excellent job in the design, materials and packaging of these earbuds. They appear well built, so I'd expect them to hold up. Hard to beat at the Amazon price point. I'm considering grabbing another set or two...Bluetooth range is more than adequate at around 30'."
1,"Great pair of earbuds for the price, worked well for almost a year, connected to just about any devices I wanted. Battery life was ok, not amazing or anything but they did last a good amount of time. Almost never a problem with falling out or off my ears, stayed well and didn't ache or anything after long periods of time. The wire connecting the 2 earbuds together began to tear away about a month ago and has slowly went since. Now only one side works. Great buy until now, if I get a new pair like the description says I will move the rating up but until then, staying at a 3."
1,I love them..fast shipping.
0,I love this headphones at first. The fit is great the look is great but there's a lot of issues here.  The first issue I have is with the accessories so the charger for the headphones stopped working after two uses. The iPhone charger stopped working after about a week of use. The headphones themselves are great other then that fact that at times they sound like I'm under water. The microphone on them is usesless you will hav e to scream so the person you are talking to can hear you. The back piece that holds the wires together is always on the edge of getting lose(it literally comes of every use).  I recommended this headphones to a co worker before I realized this issues. I hope he's comes out better and that mines were just a bad batch. If not I'll feel terrible and have to buy him a next pair.
1,I forget to charge these things for weeks and they still work. My ears are shaped weird because they like to fall out sometimes.. but I think that's just me. Great sound quality though.
1,Very good fit. Sound quality is great for Bluetooth buds. Mic pickup is solid. Very happy with my purchase.
1,Great set of earbuds. Exactly what I was looking for.
1,Works great.  Battery last a long time.
1,"The fit and sound are great. Excellent bass with music and clear and crisp voice. There is mild noise cancelling that keeps out other sounds. While they look a bit bulky, they are light weight and once in place are very comfortable and don't fall out. The Bluetooth connection is easy with no lag. Easy to set up. The charge lasts all day. These are amazing for the price. I have many sets of headphones/earphones. These are as good as some of the high end ones."
0,The over the ear loop is not adjustable and it keep falling off my ears when I am running.
1,"I love these ear buds. I misplace my 1st pair and missed them so much I have to order another pair. They fit well, although I'm not real crazy about the pieces that wrap around your ear, they sound great and the battery life is awesome."
1,"these wear very nice and work as expected. the carrying case, the foam ear buds and cell phone holder is a nice extra"
1,These are the best active earbuds I have found. They work for days before needing to recharge. And the sound is great!
1,"I've owned a few pair (Over the ear and in the ear) BT headphones over the last 10 years.  These are the best I've owned so far because of the sound, size and cost.  The ONLY con for me would be the battery life.  I can only get about 2 days (avg 5 hours per day).  I use them when I ride, my bike or catch the train into work and while at work.  I don't use them at home because there's no need to.  The buyer would like these.  I didn't buy the ear plugs because I'm too afraid of loosing them (1 or both).."
0,Stopped working two months after purchase. Not pleased.
1,"Good sounding wireless headphones, especially for the price. Going from my Bose QC15's to these shows their distinct lack of highs and mids, and they sounded muddy out of the box but are getting better with use. The biggest issue I have so far is that they are far too loud at the lowest volume setting for use in a quiet room, library, at home, etc. At the gym, they're loud but fine since lifting and running requires some volume to block out noise around you. First week has shown good battery life- time will tell how they last! But for the price they are comfortable and work very well."
0,"The battery isn't great on this product at all, but the sound quality is<br />."
1,Excellent product referred to friends
1,I love my new ear phones. The sound is amazing and the fit is really good.
1,These are great earbuds for the price. They sound decent and feel good in your ear. The design is such that they never fall out of your ears. The battery life is pretty good too. Last all day. The only thing that lacks is the low end. Other than that they are a solid buy.
1,"Great ear buds, especially for the price, certainly comparable to beats."
1,Very nice headphones. Get a little wind noise when cycling but the connection never cuts out and they work as advertised.
1,Amazing product
0,"I don't understand how these can be the #1 best selling and have such positive reviews.  Despite reading many reviews saying that while using these with the AppleWatch and walking/running they would cutout and lose connection, I bought them anyway.  Sure enough, on my first run they cut out every time my left wrist would move back and forth.  Now I know I need to lose some weight, but I can't believe that my body is so large and dense that it should block a signal from my left wrist to right ear!<br />The only reason I gave it 2 stars is that they were comfortable to wear and they stayed in place while I ran."
1,"Lasted nine months until they stopped working--the on/off button basically broke.  While they worked, I liked them a lot."
1,use this all the time and great
1,For the price this is the best esr Bud headset I have ever owned If you want to completely cut outside sound<br />I use these constantly they block out the wind very well And the sound quality is excellent<br />I actually got on line right now to buy a second pair.<br />Highly recommended
1,Great for working out.
0,"Not that great of a product. Intermittent quality issues all the time. I normally connect these to my phone which I carry in the breast pocket of my coat (about a foot away from the headphones), when walking in the city get nothing but static sometimes. Poor connection. Also not noise cancelling in the least bit. Will be returning these and would not recommend."
1,"I connect to my smart TV and it works well.  It easily pairs. Unlike my other Bluetooth headphone, I don't have to disconnect this to one device to connect to another one.  Also, I wear a pair of glasses. I wear this under my glasses and it does not hurt at all.  Sound quality is good for my purpose: to watch TV. Would recommend."
1,"I bought these headphones based on the reviews and they were not wrong. They are SUPER nice quality, great sound, they stay in my ear and are very comfortable to wear. They are snug when I am moving my head around. I would recommend if you are looking for a SUPER quality headphone at a great price. Also, I appreciate the extras that come in the box: hard case, cell phone card holder, car mount for the phone, extra silicone ear bud covers."
1,"second pair already, they are good, but seem to have issues very quickly, already need another pair, that will be 3, time to look for a different brand altogether."
1,items delivered on time and good sound quality
1,Would not work if one ear was under water. Wanted to use it for swimming laps. Apparently I misunderstood it's waterproof capabilities. Thought I remembered it would be good up to 2 feet under water. Buds would stay in place as long as I wasn't swimming. I would like to do a
1,There awesome headphones but just a sugestion the light on them you can't see it anyways so it should be on the back not the front. I use glasses and the light bounces off the glass and its a little bit anoying. I just tilt them so that doesnt happen but is not as comfortable that way.
1,"Great head phones, as I am an avid runner and rock climber.....they work great...awesome sound, very easy to connect to.......battery life is really good as well.....and.was really surprised of the quality for such a low price.  I would definitely recommend these to anyone especially those with an active life style."
0,hates these
0,"In no way noise canceling. The power indicator lies, always shuts itself off when the indicator says it's at 25% still. Sound quality is ok. These things are uncomfortable, even the smallest one is hurting my ears after an hour, had no problems with other in ear headphones."
1,Excellent quality. I was very impressed with these headphones. The range is great as well as the quality. All materials are very good quality and the extra items that come with it are very useful.
1,"These are the best wireless earphones I have ever had. The sound quality is excellent, they actually stay in your ears, and I've done a couple workouts with them and they are holding up well."
1,"Update:  Battery life is great- didn't use it for a couple days and battery life still good.  When using headset icon shows battery life on iphone.  When powering on/off voice says power on/off and says connected or disconnected immediately.  Bluetooth connection is fast.  Very pleased with my purchase.<br />Amazing headphones!  This is my 4th purchase of bluetooth wireless headphones. I finally found one that does not disappoint me.  Senso is the best!<br />The sound is incredible.  Easy to pair, being able to change music tracks is easy to do!  Blown away by what was included in the purchase.  The hard case comes in handy.  No need to worry how I am going to keep it from getting lost or damaged.  Great for exercising at the gym or outdoors.  I sweat a lot - Senso is ideal for me.<br />So happy I purchased these."
1,Light weight and easy to use
1,They were OK. However about 2 months after using them consistently they just stopped being able to charge and I could no longer use them.  Not good and you get what you pay for.
0,"I bought two pair of these headphones. Both times they worked fine for a couple months, then the bluerooth wireless started dropping. When I am in the middle of a run the music stops and the bluetooth needs to be reset. Very annoying. Need to buy something else."
1,"Great fit, easy to workout with"
1,"So far these are great.  I have only used them a couple times since I received them, so I am writing my review based upon that.  1st of all, the packaging and instructions were great.  I love that they come with two different charging cables as well as the AC adapter for the car.  The long charging cable even has an output to charge the iPhone (I am an android user, so it's pointless for me), it's a nice feature.  It came with three different size ear buds which is also great.  I really like that it has the little things that allow you to cinch up the wires closer to your head (forgive me, the name of the little thing is escaping me at the moment.  The case is great so that I am not just tossing them into a pocket of my gym bag.  They stay on/in my ears nicely, and I generally have issues with getting ear buds to stay put.  The sounds quality is nice and the buttons function nicely.  I hope to be able to come back in a few months and confirm that these are still great!"
1,Good product
1,"Love these headphones! They're slightly less fancy than my previous pair (having no integrated volume controls is a tad annoying), but they work for the intended purchase! I have no problems with them in the gym or other activities, and I can normally go roughly two weeks between charges. They fit in my ears well and they weigh nothing."
1,exactly what I wanted.
1,"I've owned two pairs of Bose earbuds...bluetooth and noise canceling.  Now that I've had the SENSO's for a month, I'm determined not to purchase another Bose product.  It's not that they don't produce a decent product, but their lack of willingness to stand behind the warranty and to honor a commitment to righting manufacturing wrongs has me choosing this cheaper and nearly equal quality earbud."
1,Seem to work really well. Fit well even on big ears.
1,"These are must if you want Bluetooth and are active.  I workout using them. I run, etc. They always stay in my ear. Come switch multiple sizes of ear inserts so no need to worry about fitment. Comes with a car charger plug."
0,Product didn't work.
1,"I purchased these headphones about 6 months ago, and still use them today. I mainly use them when at the office, which is great. The only problem I have had is with connectivity while outside or excessive movement. The sound clarity is great for the price."
1,"I use this headset at the gym.  It's nice to know that I don't have to fiddle with the fit or the sound during a workout.  I appreciate the quality of the product, but especially appreciate the solid customer service of the company.  they reached out to me twice to be sure I was happy.  Way to go!"
1,WOULD BUY AGAIN
0,Worked great.... for four months. Now they won’t take a full charge. We’ve tried everything and will only keep enough power to last 5 minutes.
1,"Slightly heavier than I would like for exercising.  Were fairly comfortable while biking however running I used paper tape to ensure they remained in place.  Earbuds are comfortable but also am unable to wear hearing aids with them - not a big problem as I often exercise without the aid.  The USB charging cable was easy to use; the buttons are easy to find / discern function.  Positive voice when on, off, and connected rather than beeps which could be misinterpreted.  Pairs quickly with iPhone7."
1,"I loved it. The best part is that you can bend the rubber hook thingies (idk what they are called) to fit your ear, I have used them while running 2 miles and they stay in place. It connects to my Bluetooth perfectly. It also tells me what battery percentage it is at and warns me when it has a low battery."
0,too much hardware to wear around my ears. and they don't seem to stay in. good sound though.
1,I always appreciate it when product manufacturers think outside the box (and then put it IN the box).  The headphones work great (took them out on a 10k run and they performed perfectly).<br /><br />They arrive well packaged with a great combo micro USB/Lightning cable and plenty of ear top options.  The instructions are simple and I was upban running in no time.<br /><br />The sound is good (we're not talking Studio headphones here) and I used them to talk on the phone twice and they are fantastic.
1,"I bought two of these and they works great and its affordable! The only thing I dare to wish this product had is tighter fit around my ear so I don't have to adjust it to make it tighter. If you adjust the fit while in water, it still works but you'll hear the water going in and out."
1,Obviously not like iphone earphone and beats headphones. But it is good while gym and working outside.
1,I can't get regular earbuds to stay in my ear.  I was looking for inexpensive earphones that could hang on my ear and have a rubber tip to go into my ear.  These do both.  The fact that they are wireless makes it even better.  Only used a couple of days but so far they are great.  I have had no trouble with the controls and the sound is good.
1,I have had these for over 1 year now and I must say these are some serious bang for your buck! I rate items based on value and for the money these are great! Sound quality and volume are good and the battery lasts for a whole week of workouts. Very impressed for the price. Earpiece has cracked after a year of use but still works fine.
0,"did not meet expectations, couldn't find a ear piece that seems to stay in ear. part that goes around ear seem to loose shape/setting ,if you will. Tried for a month then noticed return window was closed  ...LESS THAN 30 DAYS ALOWED 1/24-2/22 PRETTY BAD"
1,Works well. Good sound quality. Tricky to get adjusted to the ear at first.
1,"Awesome volume, deep bass.... Almost too much. Clean, powerful signal. Comfortable to wear.  So far, so good!"
1,Easy to operate. Sound really good. Came with great cables and ear pieces.<br /><br />Very happy with my purchase !
1,"These head phones sound great, for what they are. I have bought these head phones exclusively. However, the quality is lacking. After just a few months, the USB adapter or charging port inside the head phones broke.  I bought another pair, but it will be the last if I have this problem again."
1,"Totally amazed at how great these headphones sound. I don't particularly like earphones because they usually don't fit, stay in or sound good. For that reason I looked for an inexpensive pair  to see if I would actually use them. My plan was to upgrade to a more expensive possibly better set if I was consistently wearing these at the gym.  Change of plans!!! These headphones are awesome. They fit perfectly, stay in place and sound great! What a bargain for the price. No need to spend more $$$ looking for a good set. Paired easily, no difficulty in using. Comes with a carrying case, extra ear pieces, charging cable and more. You won't go wrong buying this product!!!"
1,From the first day I got them I was very excited to see the amazing packaging and the cool design of the headphones after using them for a few days at my worksite which is Extremely Loud I was able to listen to my music in peace these headphones actually work and the design is Way Cool not to mention the fast charging time and the excellent range that I can walk away from my phone and still hear my music without any skipping I recommend this product to anybody looking to stop the search for headphones.
1,We've just had them few days but the sound is just amazing.
1,"First Bluetooth earbuds I've used. They work well. Not sure about the noise canceling, perhaps I ordered the wrong ones for that."
1,"very easy to use, only used them once so far but i loved them"
1,"Works great, no issues. I broke them and will be getting new ones soon."
1,Shipped fast and great quality! I have an iPhone X these Bluetooth headphones work great when I’m listening to Spotify and answering phone calls. The battery life is very good! I went two plus days on and off and they never died. The car charger that come with product can connect to Apple products and also can charge head set at the same time!
1,"Awesome headphones, really innovative technology and comes with awesome accessories"
1,We are yet to try and test the headphones. However the bonus items mentioned in the product description are missing.
1,"I have had these for about 8 months. they go skiing with me and also every day to the gym (so they are almost always wet). I wouldn't normally have taken the time to post a review, but last month these went through the washer AND dryer after I accidentally left them in the pocket of my gym shorts, and they still perform flawlessly. I am so impressed with the durability and quality of these headphones that I had to share my experience. Highly recommend!"
1,"Excellent purchase for the money.  I haven't had a problem with them yet in 2 weeks of almost daily use.  You need to make sure the ear pieces are the right size as they will slip out of your ear while you're running, but otherwise, these headphones are great."
1,Unbelievable product at any price!
1,Overall better then spending $200 for Monster beats. The battery life is about 2.5-3 hours. I can walk a good 30feet before I hear any issues. I rather keep buying these vs spending $200.<br /><br />Here is an update to my original review: After 6 months the first set failed. I'm on my second set and 6 months into it one side is giving cracking sounds.
1,""" Good Quality sound even at low volume, very happy with this purchase,"""
1,"I received these headphones on Saturday 1/28/17 and immediately wanted to try them as I have researched the best headphones for the best value, and thought that these could not be as good as the reviews stated. They are better than I could have imagined! Right out of the box I was able to pair them to two different devices quickly and easily and the sound quality is incredible. The functionality of the buttons are easy to understand and use. The headphones are very comfortable and fit perfectly. I called my wife to see how the sound quality came through regarding the microphone and ability to make calls, and she could hear me clearly and there was no echo or interference (with the first call there was, but that was due to a poor signal, none at all on the second). I rarely post reviews for products, but in this case, I wanted to share my review for anyone that is thinking about purchasing this product, it is a fantastic buy, I could not be more pleased."
0,"Absolute garbage.  Just like all the other low priced headphones on Amazon.  After reading the reviews, I decided to give these headphones a try.  I just got them in the mail last night.  Charged it, took them out for a run, audio was cutting in and out the entire time, and it was turning on and off on its own.  These are my third set of low priced headphones from Amazon.  I could of bought myself a pair of Beats by now.  Big mistake.  Do not waste your money.  Save your time and money, buy a quality set of name brand headphones."
1,This is the 5th time I am buying this product. I love it. The last two times(including my most recent purchase) have been a bad experiences. The earphones stop working all of a sudden. The current one I have is less than a month old and it is just my 4th run with them and they stopped working. They dont switch on.
1,"Holy smokes!  These buds sound AWESOME!  I had some 10+ year old Ultimate Ears buds and one of the armatures finally cracked and broke.  10+ years of service so I won't complain.  That said, I was in the market for new buds.  I had no intention of buying new UEs as I just don't have the money or desire to spend $300 for ear buds.  I also wanted to finally go wireless to pair with my LG G6. The Senso price was right, but I was concerned with the output.  After 20 seconds of listening to my first song through them, I was grinning from ear to ear.  Audio tech has really advanced since buying my old UEs!  Dare I say these $40 units sound BETTER than my old UEs?  Yes, I dare!<br />Paring was easy (took less than a minute) and for the price you get a bunch of accessories.  Very impressed so far.  We'll see how they hold up over time and use."
1,Bought this as a gift for my wife. So far she is happy with the product. &#34;
1,"I typically avoid earbuds because they never stay in my ears. I was interested in these due to the earpieces. When I use the smallest earbuds, it fits perfectly in my left ear. However, my right ear canal is apparently smaller than my left ear as even the smallest size barely fits. But, they haven't fallen out/off yet which is more than I have been able to say for any other earbud I've tried.<br /><br />The sound quality is about what I expected, given the price - if you aren't paying top dollar for bluetooth headphones, don't expect amazing sound quality. They aren't exactly noise cancelling, but that is perfectly fine with me. I wore them when I went for a walk and I could still hear cars and the like - which is actually a very good thing. But quieter noises (like other people talking) were inaudible until I took one of the earbuds out.<br /><br />The one downside I've noticed so far is that the bluetooth signal is a bit weak. I habitually wear my purse on my left side. However, the receiver for the headphones is in the right earpiece. The bluetooth signal kept cutting out intermittently until I moved my purse to my right side. I've had bluetooth headsets before and they've never had this problem, albeit they weren't earbud-style. Perhaps it's just a limitation of the size of the receiver, but it makes it very awkward for people like me who keep their phones on their left side out of habit/comfort.<br /><br />Edit: I went for a short bike ride with it on some local trails - there was so much wind noise that I could barely hear my music. I've had similar problems on very windy days (I live in a part of the country where high winds are fairly normal). If you're only planning to use it indoors, such as in a gym, it's a great headset. But otherwise? Not that great. I am returning it as it doesn't fit my needs."
1,pros: wow! It was more than i expected. it came with a dual car charger for your ipod and for your ear buds. love the case! came with different sizes for the ear plugs. has it's on charger. sound is pretty good. comfort very good.<br /><br />con: i haven't run with them yet see if they will stay put.<br /><br />overal : love them
1,"Great headphones. They are comfortable, easy to use, they sound great, and they stay in place when I run."
0,"Used this mainly as my running / gym pair of headphones.  They work really well for staying in your ear, drowning out background noise, and decent voice quality.  My complaint though is they only lasted 4 months before it started getting loose wire connections at the base of the headphone (where it connects to the other earphone)... now the sound basically jumps around and is unusable :(.  Really liked the pair but they should have lasted way longer; I am not rough on my products."
1,Awesome product and even better customer service. Wish I could give them more stars 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
1,Works as expected!  Nice design!  Best wireless headphone in the market
1,Great sounds!!! I love it. Perfect companion to the gym.
1,Good Quality. Nice Lows. Wish they were a little more comfy and blocked out more sound. But great for $30 headphones!
1,Worth for the money.
1,This is an incredible device. It's easy to use and very comfortable for my ears. The HD is really good. I  recommend it with my eyes closed and something very important was that SENSO's customer services (Mr. Kenneth) gave me a wonderful reception. God bless
1,I really like these for use with my walks. I try to walk every day and use them regularly. Don't really know about the battery life since I recharge them after each walk.
1,They work great!! Thanks a lot!!!
1,Love it
1,It's hard for me to find headphones that don't hurt my ears. These ones don't.
0,Terrible sound quality. Uncomfortable to wear. Buy something better.
1,"This is one of the best &quot;blind purchases I've made on Amazon.com.  The accessories, the storage box, and case make this a lovely item.  The sound quality is great too!"
1,These are a Christmas gift so I cannot review them. I’m sure my daughter will love them though
1,These are great they work awesome!! I walked quite far away from my phone with them on and the music kept playing. I highly recommend!
1,"These are good earbuds.  They are comfortable and truly block out environmental noise - I work out in a college gym and cannot hear MTV with these on.  Yay!  The sound is fine; the controls are easy to use.  They even come with a car charger.  I don't know how long they last (only had them a week) but as of now, I'd recommend them."
1,"This is my 2nd time ordering these ear phones for my husband (he accidentally slammed the 1st pair in the car door).  As much as he loved the 1st pair, he actually likes these even better because it comes with an additional pair of foam  buds (the part that goes in your ear) that compress and expand to fit your ear perfectly.  His exact words were &#34;the inner ear gription is top notch.&#34;  He also loves that they connect to both his personal phone and work phone at the same time."
1,"This product is very great, it comes with high quality, extra ear pieces and is overall an amazing product. I got in 2-3 days from ordering it. I look forward to buying more products from SENSO in the future."
1,"Had the product for a couple of days now and have been using it often. Purchased the product because of review and wanted something to run with. Physically I find the product excellent and the additional cables with iPhone car charger and the portable storage is really nice. I love the fact when you turn it on a voice prompt you it is on. Also a voice tells you when it is connected to your phone instead of a kind of beep, I find that is a nice touch. Sound quality is good and taking a call is also good. My biggest disappointment is the bass. If you love bass this is not the product for you. Other wise overall the product is great."
1,Work great and sound great! I use them on my morning runs and haven't had any issues yet. Especially with heavy sweat.
0,headphones died after being fully charged after  I played 2 songs.
1,I like the fact that they really are noise cancelling. I didn’t hear the gym attendants announce that the gym was closing until someone had to come up to me. It was slightly embarrassing but you really get what you paid for.
1,I've used these pairs for a couple workout sessions now. My old pair would always breakup when I kept my phone in my pocket while working out.  These haven't had any distortions like my previous pair. Love them!
1,"1 word describes these.  Awesome !!! If you doubt they are waterproof  , take a shower with them."
1,First let me say I am roughly 80% deaf so I was worried that these would not be loud enough for me to use ... I was wrong.  They are extremely loud and work great for me.  They are as loud as my over ear headphones with 2 amplifiers running on them without any added amplification.  Most in ear earbuds are extremely uncomfortable for me after extended use but the changeable buds that come with these are extremely comfortable and I can wear for hours without any discomfort.<br /><br />I purchased these and a bluetooth transmitter to be able to enjoy watching tv with my family on family movie night without maxing out the volume and making everyone else uncomfortable.  I have yet to run the battery dead and have used them for as long as 6 hours straight.  I am able to walk through the house and still get a good signal for the most part however sometimes it has trouble when I am in the farthest room roughly 30ft away through multiple walls so pretty good range and reception.<br /><br />The only con I have found is that sometimes I have to unpair them from my phone to get them to pair with the bluetooth transmitter but not really difficult to do so I didn't take a star for that.
1,"The headphones are amazing, amazing bang for your buck"
1,"I am very happy with my earbuds.  They were very easy to sinc with my TV and give very clear sound.  I have had them for a month and have not had to recharge them yet, but I don't use them very often...just when I want to watch TV in bed and not disturb anyone with the noise."
1,Awesome Sound!!!
1,"These work amazing. Always have a problem with earbuds falling out, these fit perfectly"
1,WOW!! These are the best ear buds for the price. I have three other bluetooth earbuds ranging in price from 20 to 120 dollars. All have been a disappointment to say the least. But the Senso earbuds have far exceeded my expectations. Definitely would recomend these if you are looking for an excellent pair of wireless earbuds.
1,"Charges quickly, pairs easily, works like a charm. Nice!"
1,Nice headphones for the price.
1,Arrived before shipping date<br />Light and comfortable in the ear<br />Good packaging<br />Good bass<br />Easy to use
1,Dollar for dollar it is a great product.
1,"I bought these headphones for my wife for her birthday. She has told me she loves them. She likes the way they feel. She has alway had problems with ear buds falling out of her ear so she really likes the shape of these. She said they are comfortable when working out, also she said the sound quality is great. Nice bass and good volume. Based off my wife I'd say I made a great purchase."
1,Great customer service! Headphones are great!
0,Use to give me goosebumps due to harsh should when it used to reconnect with my iPhone
1,This an excellent product for the cost..
1,"I was a bit skeptical that these would work very well for being so affordable, but I have been extremely impressed by the rich sound, comfortable fit, and easy controls.  I got them for working out and they stay on very well when jogging.  You can't tell from the pictures but the ear pieces are soft flexible rubber that fit comfortably over the ear. It is very lightweight too.  I highly recommend for the price and quality."
1,Very easy to use and comfortable
0,"I just took my first run with my new SENSO Bluetooth headphones. They work great, sound good, and are easy to use.  The box included a nice case, different size earbuds, etc.  This is a very complete product at a great price.<br /><br />After 6 months of use, the Bluetooth connection is very shaky.  The only way I can maintain a consistent connection is by holding my head very still, which is obviously very impractical for workout use."
1,Great product
1,"It is awesome,  better than anything I've used even above it's price range.  Great product highly recommended."
1,"So far, very nice. This is honestly my first review ever. I am only responding  because I am very impressed at this point.  The. Packaging is better than apple and so far the quality is as good,"
1,Excellent product..i used for one day and im really happy....when im not using them i just put the buds inside my shirt...
1,Battery life is great. Five hours later and battery is more than half. Sounds quality is good too. I am very happy with my purchase.
1,"UPDATE: They have finally reached their limit. After about a year and a half they have broken, they will not stay connected to my phone or even stay on. I guess you get what you pay for with these.<br /><br />I used to bye $10 earbuds from amazon but I kept losing my iPhone dongle (which is also $10) so I decide to get wireless headphones. I also needed something better for an active life (not always worrying about a wire when working out).<br />I've had these headphones for about a year and I've used them at the gym, on the plane, in my room, etc. The sound quality isn't anything terrible, I don't find my music to be dull or empty but not 100% like Bose headphone quality (expected). I'm able to run/lift/bike and have no problems with them staying in. Sometimes when I leave my phone to grab more weights the sound starts to break up but the range isn't terrible, almost helps me remember to take my phone with me when I leave an area.<br />Battery life is good and charging is really easy. May look a little bulky in the ear for some people but for me I like that it lets people know that I'm clearly listening to music and not just ignoring them. Good product for the price, already recommended it to friends:)"
1,"Great headphones, quality sound and easy to us...love them!!!!"
1,Awesome sound quality and very comfortable to wear.  Great deal with tons of extras.  Will definitely recommend to other friends.
1,"Great inexpensive bluetooth earphones used for listening to music while running. No these are not &#34;high-end&#34; earbuds - but, in my opinion  they have all the necessary functions and provide a good balanced sound in both high and low frequencies.  I bought several sets of the MPOW Cheetah earbuds for my kids and they love them, but I personally found them to be too weak the the bass frequencies.  These Senso earbuds stay in place well while running, and come with a convenient carrying case, extra charge cables, ear pieces and a car adapter.  Overall for the price, a great deal.  Very happy with them so far.  Hope they keep working for a long long time!"
1,A great value!  These headphones work really well. They fit comfortably and stay in place while running.
1,They work beautifully with my IPad. After 5 weeks the headphones no longer connected. I emailed Senso. They replied in good time and their instructions fixed the problem. Very happy with the product and Senso customer service.
1,Excellent!
1,"Extremely pleased! Incredible sound! Outstanding price! Well made! Fits extremely well in ears. Will not fall out while running. Comes with case and a variety of accessories including extra ear pads, charging cords, etc. Buying another pair for the Misses...  Thank you!!"
1,"I work a lot outside and have tried probably a dozen types of bluetooth headphones. Just like my rating I would give them a 3 out of 5. I don't think they're all that comfortable, the piece that goes over your ear is really big and non adjustable. I would say I have an average sized head for a guy and the over the ear piece is really sloppy feeling. I think you'd have to have a very large head for them to be snug. They're also a bit bulky on the sides for what they are in my opinion. I will say these work good, sound good, and have plenty of volume. If they made the ear piece adjustable and slimmed them down on the sides i'd give them 4 stars."
0,"This product stopped working less than one year. It won't become blue tooth discoverable, just toggles on and off. also, the light is lit both blue and red. I would spent a little more for better quality."
1,"""Works as advertised. Very fast delivery. Very satisfied."""
1,"Apple forced me to make the jump to bluetooth, SENSO made it tolerable and at a low price. I love these little guys more than any wired headphone I've ever used.<br /><br />I've had one small bug which I'm not marking off for: I've used them probably 60 times in the 2 months but 1 or 2 times I had some connectivity issues. Powercycling the device fixes it. Seems like a bluetooth problem.<br /><br />If anyone compares these to the airpods, put it this way: You can buy three for the price of one set of airpods, for a combined battery life of like 26 hours.<br /><br />Typically I get about 7 hours off one charge. Ear buds are comfortable, comes with a car charger for this and lightening (what the heck? what a great value)--oh and it has 2 USB ports so you can do both at the same time. Comes with a case too but these are so darn robust I've sat on them twice now and they've held up.<br /><br />Sound quality is good too but since I take them running/mountain biking I may not be the best judge. They can get pretty loud if you want but the in-ear quality is such you wont need it.<br /><br />One problem: My wife has stolen them a few times. Buy at your own risk! I just bought a second set."
0,"died after 2 months use... to be fair i was using them about six hours a day five days a week.<br />they were always on my head never mistreated kept stored in the case when not in use, charged at home every night.<br />its a shame too for the amount of time they did work the sound and features were great.<br />I will not be buying again"
1,As advertised!
1,"It's pretty good, but once I have it on for. While my ears start to hurt because the way they're made but it's still decent."
1,I enjoy it without all the wires dangling in my way when I'm trying to work out.
1,"everything came as expected.  a picture of how to wear the headphones and showing how to access the headphone charger would have been helpful, but I am old.  paired easily with my iPhone."
1,working good till now.. been couple of months now & no problem as yet. they have provided diff sizes of ear buds so that a plus.
1,Really neat features. Light weight and just what I wanted.
1,"Awesome earbuds! Sound, battery life, durability, comfort all check out! There could be a redesign on flap that covers the wicking."
0,"One star should of been zero. When these arrived there was a piece broken, I put it back to together and charged them, they worked great, now they will no longer accept a charge. This is only the second time I charged them. Save your money on this piece of junk from China"
1,I give this Bluetooth a 5 stars they work great battery life is good and the sound is awesome
1,Very good sound at a reasonable price.
0,"I bought a pair of these headphones a couple of months ago and loved them. They were great quality, the quality was amazing for the price. They still work.<br /><br />I went and bought a pair for my grandfather to use because he knew how much I liked the ones I had; but upon receipt found the quality of the headphones to have significantly decreased. The over the ear arm that would hold on your ear would not hold in place enough for running like they used to. And above all the headphones would not connect to anything. With some playing around I somehow managed to mess up the bluetooth connectivity to my original pair of headphones and can no longer pair them. Was a very satisfied customer that raved about these headphones but due to the recent change in quality will tell you to save your money and invest in a better set! Please change back to your original quality senso!!"
0,Quit working already! They were great until after a couple weeks they no longer take a charge!
1,Great product! Works well! And easy to operate!
1,"Excellent product and service, they sound great and are easy to operate. Had a slight problem hassle free prompt service, great"
1,"This is my second pair of bluetooth headphones. I wish I could remember what my first pair was, but I bought them on Groupon after reading on a blog that they were &#34;the best&#34; running headphones. They were $70, the sound was okay, and the buds fell out of my ear always. Luckily they have been stolen abroad and this time around I was more hesitant to shell out more than $50 for a pair of headphones.<br /><br />These are 100x better than my old ones. They stay in my ear the entire time I run on the treadmill. The sound is amazing in my opinion. It's clear and loud and if you like music with bass, the bass is strong with these headphones.<br /><br />The only things I DON'T like is that the buttons to switch to the next track is in an awkward position(on top one of the buds). I wish it had buttons on the side of the cable."
0,"First off let me say this was a pretty difficult review to write since I have mixed feelings on this product.  Let me just start out by saying that these headphones sound great, feel great, and charge fast.  One of the best headphones for deep bass and full sound.  When I first tried them I was amazed at the sound for the price and couldn't wait to take them for a jog.  But here's the knock, when I put my Pixel 2 in my pocket to jog, the sound kept cutting in and out.  I quickly called customer support and they told me other than defaulting them there was nothing more I could do, so I returned them.  After seeing all the high reviews I was very disappointed."
1,"These sound good and thanks to the different size ear buds that are provided, I could find a pair that fit my ear canals well and stay put while I work out. I also accidentally ran them though the laundry both washing and drying.. Yet they still work perfectly. Great bang for the buck.<br /><br />Edit: These went through the washer and dryer and still work fine. Amazing!"
1,"These were my first set of wireless earbuds and i wasnt impressed. After all the 4/5 star reviews i thought id give them a try and wasnt impressed at all. First off, the wires are way too long, who needs 4 feet between headphones? So i could either tuck them in my shirt or let them get caught everywhere. Secondly, the sound quality was terrible. The bass drown out the actual music. My wired earbuds are way better. Now ill be on the search for something more adequate. I suppose for the money these will do but not for me."
1,"The sound quality is mediocre at best, but that isn't to say it's bad. You can't expect excellent music for this price, but again I'm not dissatisfied on that point. The bass is pretty good if you appreciate that. The battery life is also mediocre. I can listen for around 5-6 hours before it needs a charge. If you run for thirty minutes that's two or three weeks on one charge. I do hobby woodwork in the garage and is fantastic at noise canceling. I can hear my music fine over the table saw and router. They fit my ears pretty well. If I go for a run I don't have to adjust very often. Good deal for the price."
1,"Excellent sound, eight-battery hour life, and water resistance to overnight rain showers (left them out on the porch by accident).<br /><br />They wouldn't hold charge after a few months, but SENSO took care of that! I emailed customer service -- a new pair of buds was delivered four days later."
1,"Headphones fit well, setup was fairly easy once you become familiar with the controls. Great not having wired headphone poking out of clothing."
1,For a long time i have been looking for headphones with this quality. I recommend this excellent product to anyone that is looking for a good pair of headset.
1,"I've been running for competition and health for over a decade but I never owned blue tooth headphones (you never miss what you never had, but now that I have it I'll never run without it). (1) Comfort: Excellent. I didn't even notice they were on. Easy to put on, and they never slip out or fall off. I never had to rearrange them as I almost always did with earbuds. (2) Sound: Excellent. The music I run to starts off with AC/DC's Hells Bells. The sound was crisper and clearer than any headphone before. The surround sound is excellent. I will say that at first I found the sound a bit light on the bass. It took a few miles to get used to it, but from then on the sound was perfect. I think I shoved my previous earbud in too tight. (3) Bluetooth: here is my one question. Several times in the course of an hour run, the sound would give out for 1/2 a second. I think I lost connection. Its not the music because I've ran to this playlist for months. Is it my iphone, or new headphones or some external interference? Don't know because I'm new to blue tooth devices."
1,"These are awesome...I know most will compare to Beats, but these are sweat proof, sound great, have a decent battery life and are a fraction of the cost.."
1,"I bought these specifically to wear while working out, and they are quite well suited to that purpose. They are very comfortable to wear, the controls are easy to reach, and most important of all, they have excellent water resistance.<br />I sweat quite heavily, and that is what killed my last set of Bluetooth earphones. The Senso pair have handled my perspiring without any issues.<br />The sound quality is decent. It doesn't equal my previous set, but those cost almost four times as much as these do. And for exercising, the sound is perfectly adequate -- clear and undistorted."
1,"Great sound, comfy earbuds. I love that they come with different sizes as well. Great product."
1,These things are awesome and I got them for a great price with Amazon Deals!  They work very well and have a decent range to them. For cutting the lawn and working out with them they are life!!!
1,This is a great set of headphones. I am going to order more!
1,"I was very skeptical about these headphones. I'm generally not a fan of bluetooth stuff because the battery life is so short and charging headphones all the time is annoying. But I thought I'd give these a try because traditional headphones are a bother when trying to do a long cleaning session because the cord gets caught on my kitchen drawers and rips out of my ears and that crap HURTS! But music while cleaning is essential because music makes everything suck less, am I right?<br /><br />Anyhow, A youtuber recommended these, and I trusted her and gave them a shot. I LOVE these! First of all, they came in a nice sturdy box with a case, 2 charger cords, a car charger, more tips for the ear pieces, and instructions. That's a lot of stuff for this price! I was like &#34;ok, lots of stuff, so the actual product must be crappy&#34;...NOPE! I charged them, they charge quickly by the way, and I set out to see just how long I could use them before they died on me. I wore them during my workout at the gym with no problems, then on to my job- still playing throughout. I then went home and made dinner and cleaned up and they were STILL going strong! (I keep 1 side in my ear playing and let the other hang around my neck when I'm at home or at work where I may need to communicate to or hear others) It was just starting to tell me the battery was low when I was finally ready to settle down and watch some tv with the family in the evening. So, these last me my entire day! They add joy to my life, because as I said before, everything sucks less with music in your ear all day. I just charge them at bedtime when they finally do die and they're ready for me in the morning. The only thing I can say to possibly improve these is to make the distance of bluetooth capability a bit farther away. If the sad day comes where these stop working completely, i will not hesitate to buy them again IMMEDIATELY! Senso, you've warmed my cold heart for bluetooth devices."
1,Excellent headphones!!
0,Bought this headset just 6 months ago. Not working anymore. Only the right earbud is working. How do I return?
1,Absolutely love them!! Find myself using them even after I’m done at the gym!
0,"I bought a pair of these for a friend last year and she liked them a lot. So, when it was time for me to buy a new pair, I got a set for myself. From day one I have been disappointed with them. The design of the buds causes a great deal of wind sound when running with them, the do not stay seated in my ears, and the sound quality is very comparable to an AM radio. Additionally, there is no meter to let you know how much battery life is remaining. I wanted to like them, but I have actually given up on them and bought a different brand."
1,"awesome, my son loves it"
1,"The short and sweet is you are getting a great pair of Bluetooth headphones that sound phenomenal for their price. Obviously, they will not compare to the high-end models, but they certainly do the job well, even in the bass department. It is easy to use and sync and stays connected fairly well when staying within expected Bluetooth range.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is the low battery alert. It is maddening for a voice signal to trigger what seems like every thirty seconds. A visual or longer interval would be nice.<br /><br />Aside from that, I would certainly recommend purchasing this."
1,Connects easily to iPhone.  Sounds good.  Really like them.
1,I have been using my new headphones for a week and so far so good.  They stay put while I'm working out.  The sound is great and I can't here others around me...winning.
0,Loose power after 10 minutes
1,"Great quality product.  The clarity to hear, and others hearing you back, is fantastic.  They are extremely comfortable as well."
0,Sound quality sucks. I know these were inexpensive but a total waste of money.
1,"I really like the Senso Bluetooth Headphones.  It comes with a nice case that I can carry in my purse and the headphones work really well.  They stay in your ears without constantly having to push them back in.  I will buy these again.  So far, I’m also impressed with the battery life."
1,good for the price
0,"This was my first time purchasing Bluetooth headphones and I must say that I'm very disappointed. These worked perfectly when my phone was stationary or when it was being carried around in my hand (I was testing it by connecting to my Pandora), but as soon as it was my phone was in my armband and I started to run it all went downhill. TERRIBLE quality. Skipping, static, and when it WAS working properly I still couldn't hear anything over the sound of it capturing the wind. All in all, I will be returning this product and looking elsewhere."
1,"I love these! The sound quality is very good and the range is better than I expected - I stayed connected down a flight of stairs. Have only had these less than a week, so can't speak to their durability, but so far, so good. I would recommend them.<br /><br />I posted this review back in February, and unfortunately, one side glitched out about a week ago. Knowing they had a 1 year warranty, I contacted Invotek by email, explained the problem, and they sent out a new pair right away. Got them today, just 4 days later. I hope these last more than 5 months, but I feel certain their great customer service will take care of any problems I have.any in the future."
1,"As noted in other posts, the buds come in a nice package. It was great for them to include a charger cord with both Android (used to charge the buds) and iPhone plugs. They look stylish. Main operation is easy - the right earbud logo is a button used to play/pause and turns off with a longer hold. Whenever I use the volume rocker it requires too deep of a press that can move the earbud out of place. The sound quality is acceptable, but leaves much to be desired. The bass bottoms out and doesn't sound as rich or full as I'd like. Phone conversations are clear and my voice is received well. For $40, this is a good value, however I just wish it had a bit more punch and richness for a better music listening experience."
1,Received headphones on time and in good shape.  They perform as expected.  Would recommend them as a very good product especially  when one considers the price.
1,"The sound is clear, instructions easy to follow,  and they are comfortable on the ears.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B01G8JO5F2 SENSO Bluetooth Headphones, Best Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7 Waterproof HD Stereo Sweatproof Earbuds for Gym Running Workout 8 Hour Battery Noise Cancelling Headsets]]"
1,"The sound quality is excellent. Clear crisp treble and rich vibrant bass. However, I have to deduct 1 star for ergonomics. First, maybe it's just me, but these are the most uncomfortable earbuds I have ever worn in my life. My ears are so sore I can't touch them without grimacing. I've tried the different cushions that came with the product but to no avail. After about 15 minutes, they're unbearable. I'm going to have to return them if I can't find a solution."
1,"At this price, this is the best you can get. It works pretty well. You can even use it without the ear straps if you wear glasses."
1,"These work really well and sound much better than I expected.<br /><br />Update: the earbuds have stopped charging (or at least the charging light no longer goes on). Disappointing after only a month or so. I'm going to contact the manufacturer and see what they say.<br /><br />Update: Senso support sent me a brand. new pair, working great -good service!"
1,Great sound. Great fit.
0,"The headphones stayed in my ear while running, jumping, doing handstand pushups, CrossFit, but the hooks did not even rest on my ear. The whole head set relied on making sure the earbuds were in my ear canal, which was uncomfortable for the size and weight of the headphones.<br /><br />The sound quality and Bluetooth are pour. The music kept cutting in and out, even while I was standing still and my phone was in my hands, about two and a half feet away from the Bluetooth on the headset.<br /><br />Returned this after three workouts with it. It is not worth the money, compared to the cheap wireless headphones that my roommate has. Same price, not as bulky and uncomfortable, and the music does not cut out."
1,"This set only last a little more than a month then, it broke!<br /><br />Maybe ten uses. very bad quality, the switch can not turn it on any more after change. And there is no way to return since it barely passed the one month window.<br /><br />Update: they provided a great customer support and sent me a new one. Hopefully this new unit won't break that quickly.<br /><br />Up the rating to 3 stars"
1,I primarily bought this as a replacement for another well-known brand around the same price that I lost. I bought these for the over ear loops (as I jog) and better battery life. However battery life anecdotaly does not seem to be quite as good as claimed. Sound is not as good as comparable brands for the same $ and the connection speed on iPhone 7 (iOS 11.4.1) is 7 seconds. Too long! I wouldn’t buy them again once they get broken/lost.
0,"Moving from 5 stars (first week!) to 1 star (8 weeks later)<br /><br />My update: After about 6 weeks, they would start to short out or pause whatever I was listening to, as my sweat worked its way into the inner workings. 2 weeks later, I cannot turn them on - the on/off switch has shorted out completely.  I do sweat when I work out, and I was hoping that these were indeed sweat-proof. Sadly, they were not.<br /><br />The original review: The sound is great. The earbuds are comfortable. I've had no issue with them falling off. For me, I wanted these not so much for music but to listen to podcasts that sometimes are too quiet for the gym setting. This blocks out other noises. (Conversely, I don't hear the traffic and other noises much when taking them out running on the streets, which could be an issue to some.)<br /><br />If I were to give my criticisms:<br />- The controls in the right ear are (by necessity) hard to miss when you are adjusting that ear bud. I've occassionally stopped the music or turned it off / on without meaning to.<br />- The bluetooth hookup doesn't seem to auto-remember every time I restart the phone or re-turn on the headset. I have to turn back off and on before they work. Not every time, but frequently enough that I notice it."
1,"I use this when I workout at a traditional gym, Crossfit, or running outside. It stays on my ears pretty well no matter how high impact my activity is. Sound quality is great, it connects to my phone bluetooth with no issues, battery lasts a while before needing to charge again. I also love the case - it keeps it safe & squish-proof when it's in my gym bag! Great purchase."
1,Great headphones! !!! I soon bought another!
1,"My fourth set of Bluetooth headphones. Apparently they don't like going through the wash. This has great distance from your phone, great treble, poor bass though. Fits to ear perfectly. Way better then any other kind I have owned"
0,"Sound was great. However, would not stay in my ears while running. I tried all of the various ear sizes provided. They just bounce out of my ear after a very short time. Also, the ear hooks are extremely flimsy and don't provide any support. Unfortunately, these did not work for me."
0,Good sound but only seem to last 4-5 months.  I've spent the same amount on several pair vs what I would have spent on one really good set.
1,This is my second set of these headphones. By far the best ones I’ve had. I purchased the second set so that I could have them at my work. 8 hour battery is perfect for my workday. A longer charging cord would be more convenient.
1,My Son Loves The Clarity
1,"good for the price.  had connectivity problems a few times, but was solved by just turning off and then back on.  after 11 months, volume in the right earbud dropped by about 50%, which was annoying.  would probably by again at the right price."
1,Just got these headphones. Sounds amazing. Comfortable to wear. Setup instructions easy to understand. Comes with a case to keep everything together and safe.
1,"&#34; I BOUGHT TWO SETS OF THIS REMARKABLE EARPHONES, ONE FOR MY WIFE AND ONE FOR<br />MYSELF. AFTER USING THEM A FEW DAYS WE ARE BOTH VERY IMPRESSED OF THIS LITTLEWONDER. FANTASTIC SOUND QUALITY,LONG BATTERY LIFE AND EASY PAIRING. I HIGHLY<br />RECOMMEND IT FOR EVERYONE A++++ I BOUGHT A MONTH EARLIER A SONY MDR-X650 BT FOR<br />A $100 BUT THIS SENSO'S RECEIVING DISTANCE IS CLOSE TO A DOUBLE IN COMPARISON!<br />NOW THE BAD NEWS: A DAY AFTER I WROTE MY REVIEW, ONE UNIT'S RED MAIN PUSH BUTTON SWITCH<br />FROZE IN THE PUSHED IN POSITION, SO IT BECAME USELESS. AMAZON OFFERED A FULL RETURN OF<br />THE PRICE IF I RETURN IT, BUT I WOULD RATHER PREFER A REPLACEMENT WITH ANOTHER UNIT<br /> AS I STILL THINK THAT  THIS PRODUCT IS ONE OF THE BEST ON THE MARKET FOR THE MONEY."
1,Nice quality and especially its user-friendly wrap. I really like it!
1,Great product very clear sound and good battery life
1,The headphones sound really good and love that they're wireless.
0,"These worked great initially.  I haven’t used them much and kept them in he case. All of a sudden recently, they stopped working. I’m disappointed since they didn’t even have much usuage. They still look brand new. Purchased on 07/19/17."
1,Didnt have any problem so far
1,"These headphones are everything what I was looking for and more.I choose these over the Power-beats, the Jaybirds X3, and the Epic 2, and all I can say is I have no doubt what so ever that the Senso earphones are just as good as the rest but for a more reasonable and affordable price. If you are looking for sport Bluetooth earphones with good audio quality and great build durability then look no further."
1,My husband likes these so much we ordered this new pair after the first ones seemed to be shorting out after several years of hard wear and tear at the gym 3-5 times per week.
0,Good headphones. Good sound. I workout a sweat a lot. After 2 weeks they just stopped working. In their defense - all the Bluetooth headphones I had stopped working after two weeks.... crap.
1,"Outstanding Value!  Highly recommend!  Great Price and Sound Quality. Docked it a star because the previous version I had was ""beefier"" and better built. The current version is plastic"""
1,Liked the Packing and unexpected stuff inside
1,"Good sound quality and they stay in your ear fine until you start sweating, just like any other ear bud I've tried."
0,"The headphones worked beautifully at first, but then the power button got stuck inside and it was all over."
1,Bought 3 for friends but one didn’t work and they won’t replace it!!! Not. Cool!!!
1,"I purchased this item a few months ago OMG, how fantastic! The quality of sound is awesome and the connection with my Windows 10 computer is flawless. I listen to itunes and streaming radio and am able to leave my computer in the living room of my ranch home and be able to walk almost through the entire house, including the basement, with great connectivity. The charge lasts a long time. I am amazed at what a great value these are"
1,I bought these earbuds to listen to music mainly when I'm outside working in my yard. They are very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time and the sound quality is excellent; my music sounds far better with these than it does with any other earbuds or headphones I own. I highly recommend these!
1,Good quality head phones. The earbuds do not feel uncomfortable. Decent enough range and no sound distortion. Saitisfied with purchase.
0,"I was excited to get these before vacation.  Very fast delivery.  When I opened the box and tried them on.,,disappointment.  The left ear piece was twice the size of the right.  It wouldn’t stay on. :("
0,Multiple problems with this product.  We ordered 2 and they both sound of static. One set was exchanged after about a month of use because it no longer charged.  NOT A GOOD PRODUCT
1,These headphones are great. This is the second pair I’ve purchased becaust I lost the first after a little over a year of heavy use. I do a lot of construction and these guys stay comfortably on my ears throughout the day resisting sweat and sawdust alike. I will certainly purchase another pair of these ever wear out
1,This is the best bang for your buck! I started having a problem after 10 months of use and they are sending me a new replacement for it. Don't leave it plugged in to charge as it will kill the battery.
1,"I've had these for a month now and they are definitely worth the money.  Fit is good and the hooks keep them on my ears where other buds fall out.  The sound is very good, also.  I'd buy another set without a second thought"
1,Very comfortable and sound is incredible! I'm very surprised and happy with these earbuds.
1,"Don't let the reasonable price fool you. These headphones are awesome! They are very light and stay firmly in your ears, which is perfect for hitting the bag and working out."
1,These work great after all this time!
1,Awsome noise canceling earphones.
1,"Great sound, battery life and fit for the price. The best feature of these headphones are the ear hooks! They are soft and pliable but not too soft that they don't stay on. The other headphones that I have that have this kind of configuration have ear hooks that have much harder plastic which results in less give. Because of the stiffness the other headphones will start hurting the back of my ears after an hour of wearing them so I'd have to say that these have been the best out of the four different models of headphones that I own.<br /><br />Their customer service is excellent too. They were super responsive when I had a problem with the left earphone and were able to ship me out a new one right away."
0,Stopped working after about 15 months
1,Running. Love how they wrap securely around my ears.
0,"I liked them while they lasted. Good price, comforable to wear jogging.<br />They stopped charging less than 6 months after I started using them."
1,"Loving my SENSO headphones, Excellent price and great quality."
1,"Easy to charge and set up. While I did actually read the directions, it was not really necessary. I am thrilled with the sound and the entire purchase. I am a happy man who enjoys listening to great music while I am sweating like twelve rats wrestling in a wool sock. Hands free SENSO is awesome!"
1,"right out of the box, put them on, hit the treadmill and had an awesome experience.  Headphones arrived quickly!"
1,"I've been using these for...almost a year now? Overall, I'm satisfied with these headphones, and they're good for the price. I usually prefer wired headphones, but I wanted wireless ones for the gym, and these do the trick. I'm not much of an audiophile, and am not too picky about the sound, so to me these sound fine. But, I don't think they sound as good as the headphones that come with your iPhone (my only point of reference--I don't invest in anything more expensive). Side note: the phone car mount that these come with is awesome. I didn't realize it would come in the package, so that was a nice surprise. It's magnetic, simple, low profile....I would give it 5 stars, but that's not what this review is for.<br /><br />There are 3 kind of annoying things about these, which aren't a huge deal considering the price....but they are worth mentioning:<br /><br />First, the charging port is super tricky to access. The little piece of rubber that covers it is really hard to get off, even with longer nails. It also can get in the way of charging if you aren't careful. I once left these plugged in for a few hours to charge, only to find out that the rubber cover was ever-so-slightly blocking the port, and they ended up not charging whatsoever. I ripped the cover off after that.<br /><br />Second, when they start to run low on battery, you only have a very short amount of warning time before they die. You'll hear them say ""battery low,"" and at that point you have maybe 20 minutes before they die. Before that point, it's pretty much impossible to know exactly how much juice they have left, so it's hard to prepare for unless you're really good about charging them frequently. Another warning sign that I've noticed is that they tend to get quieter when they get low on power. I find myself cranking up the volume just before they die, and then after they've had a chance to fully charge I'll notice that they sound much louder, and I have to turn it back down again. Maybe this is true for all bluetooth headphones, I'm not sure, but it is kind of annoying.<br /><br />Finally, they just don't fit my ears well, and I constantly have to readjust them. Yes, they come with different sized cushions, but it doesn't make a huge difference for me. I have always had a problem with this style of headphones (ones that go in your ear canal) not fitting properly, and these are no exception. It's kind of a personal problem, but if you're like me and struggle with this style, you will likely still struggle with this pair. But, I ordered these knowing that this would be a problem, so it's not really fair to judge them based on my ear anatomy.<br /><br />All in all, they get the job done, and are a good deal considering how insanely expensive wireless headphones are. Even though I spent a bunch of time talking about the flaws of these headphones, those really are just minor annoyances, and I plan to keep using these until they break or I lose them. As long as you aren't expecting perfection, you'll be happy with these."
1,"I have only had them a few days, so we will see about their lasting power, but the sound and ease of use is fantastic!"
0,"while they work fairly good, the sound, specifically the mic is muffled. i can hear well, by other ask me if i am far from the mic."
0,Not my favorite pair of headphones.  Definitely not the worst thing I've ever had but they make odd modular noises randomly.  Comfortable on the ear but don't feel right on your neck.  Also if you ever only want to have one bud in it doesn't work well.
1,"it's an affordable and wonderful product for a Christmas gift, my wife loves it, especially, it's a waterproof function as she enjoys music in the spa, thanks for Senso's innovation and ultimate premium service after sale."
1,Great product! The ear buds are a little tight but not that big of a deal. Also the range is about 30 feet of non interrupted space.
1,"some difficulty getting them paired -- had to do the off/on/reboot multiple times to get them to hook up to either ipod or iphone. When they did, music sounded good although occasionally a &#34;hitch&#34; in the music -- I think a bluetooth connection issue.  Comes with multiple eartips which is good, I had to downsize from the standard to get a reasonable fit. The extra accessories were a nice touch and made the package price-worthy.  The mention of 'passive noise cancellation' is just advert bunk -- this has no function of that sort."
1,I received these last week and have used them 4 times and so far so good!  They sound great!  I did notice a bit of &#34;skipping&#34; when connected via bluetooth but that only seemed to last for a minute or two.  They are comfortable and the sound is great!  Would recommend these to all!
0,These are to big for my ears. They kept falling off when i tried to wear them while washing dishes. Not the best if you have small ears. You are not able to adjust them around the ear.
1,"I really like these headphones. They arrived already charged up and  came with extra ear buds and a neat little carrying case. Connecting to my iPhone 7 for the first time was super easy and reconnecting is as easy as turning them on. The charge seems to last all day but unsure exactly how long it usually lasts. I normally like to charge my electronics at night to keep them charged.  I like the design of them, they fit on my small ears and stay on when I work out.  The sound is satisfactory, don't expect beats sounds with them but for the money and convenience they sound good.  They are voice activated so you are alerted when you connect to your phone and when you receive a phone call. It will tell you the number that is calling then it rings.  The range is pretty good, my back yard is about 2200 square feet so when I'm working in the yard, I can put my phone down on the patio table then walk around, mow and even go inside the house without the headphones going out of range.  I'm satisfied with my purchase and would recommend these headphones to anyone who wants to just listen to music with ease."
0,They don't work!!!  I can not connect them to my I phone
1,I’m certainly NOT techno savvy but these are easy to use and comfortable! It makes exercising and running much more enjoyable!
1,"Great sound for a great price,  would highly recommend"
0,Short battery life
0,"In a little over a year the left side no longer works. Tried to contact Customer service but they were not very helpful. They offered a 5% discount to buy a new one (which I will never do, considering it doesn't work). I recommend investing a little more in a quality brand."
1,"I had an issue with charging my headphones so I reached out to customer support. 1. They are very responsive and on point. 2. Once I tried a workaround and it didn’t work, they have immediately processed a replacement. I’m very impressed with the level of service provided."
1,"I loved everything about this product! It worked as advertised, the packaging was great, excellent sound quality, pairing was a easy,the range was good and I love that I could listen to music without the phone in my hand on my me while working out or doing stuff around the house. Good product @great price."
1,"Wouww!!!! Amazing device !!! I got really surprise with this device !! Sound excellent , the bass is awesome ! I'm really happy ! I bought recently beats 3 and I returned it because it wasn't worth for the price it cost ! But this one cost less than 50.00 and much better quality and sound ! I'm surprise and happy ! I strongly recomend to buy! It really worth !!"
1,"Just incredible value! One of the best buys I have made all year. The sound quality is excellent. The battery life outstanding--I can workout for three hours and there is no charging problems. For the price, there is no better bluetooth headphones for the gym."
1,"Fits great, easy to use and sounds wonderful! Charging cord is great too."
0,Doesn’t work
1,"I didn't like they way they hook over my ears. They didn't feel secure to me. I returned them. They seemed to be good quality, but just not for me."
1,"I have tried many headpphones for the gym but nothing compares to these. They are affordable and the customer service is terrific. They truly care about their customers and aim to help them in anyway possible. Headphones work great, last a long time and are great for working out."
1,"This is the first Blue Tooth head phones I have ever purchased and I love them.  The sound is so much better and I love not being tethered to my player.<br /><br />Adding to review- about 5 months after purchasing the earbuds simply quit.  I emailed them and within 24 hours they replied with fix ideas.  They did work so they immediately sent me a complete new set. So while inconvenient, they successfully  handled the issue quickly"
1,"They have great sound, deep bass, battery lasts pretty long too. I have random cutting in and out every so often, kind of like when your phone is too far away. It gets really annoying."
1,"I really wanted to love these earphones. Gave a couple test uses and the ear hooks are just too floppy to stay on the earlobes especially during a sweaty workout. The port flap for the charging port keeps opening. Sound quality is good, otherwise."
1,Thanks for all the great reviews. I'm glad I got these. They stay charged a lot longer than I expected and they sound great. I'd buy them again.
1,excellent value
1,"Excellent product, when music is playing I get zero outside noise (I work in a machine shop and I can't hear any of the equipment) but if I pause the music I can hear my co-workers without removing the ear buds. They're very comfortable and the battery last my whole 8 hour shift with no problem. Very pleased with my purchase."
1,Only used it a couple days but so far its great
1,"Can't beat it, between price and quality it is a great buy!"
1,"Comfortable headphones, decent range, stay in my ears. Overall good."
1,"Honestly, I could not have found a better product:  Pairing is fast and easy.<br />Quality of sound is superb.<br />Being to speak on phone was a bonus.<br />Pleasantly surprised by the speed of mailing  (thank you, Amazon Prime).<br /><br />For the cost of the head phones, I was not expecting to get a dynamic product."
1,Fast shipping. Great product!
1,I’m very happy with the headphone. The sound quality is better than expected and noise cance works!
1,"Wear these everywhere, including when working out - perform flawlessly- incredible value"
1,"Good sound, good range, great for workout."
1,"Very comfortable , the controls work very well, and it sounds great  Very pleased with my purchase"
1,Love the earphones awesome price
0,"For an inexpensive pair of headphones they are decent. I used mine at the gym and mowing the yard only. Best thing I can say about these is they stay in place. There is no bass or noise canceling at all. After 6 months of use, I could only Bluetooth pair with one device, tried with different devices and would get a connected notification but no music playback. Now, a year out they do not work at all, can not turn on. If you do not mind replacing every year go for it, just do not expect quality."
0,"after only the first month, it couldn't maintain the connection and I had to reconnect to my phone and pc every so often.  And now the pairing mode stopped working after two months, very disappointed"
0,Sound is muffled and is terrible
1,"Great sound, great price."
1,Long battery life and great sound quality! Great purchase!
1,"Sound quality is great!<br />Ease of use, great.<br />Connectivity to phone, immediate!<br /><br />Not a negative, but a few wishes:<br />1.  Lots of stuff comes in the box that I already have.  While I appreciate the incredible packaging and extras, how about leaving the extras and reducing the (already low) price?<br />2.  The earpiece cable is flat, so it can twist easily.  I'd prefer a round cable that would hold its shape and not get turned into curly's.<br />3.  Battery lasts forever, but when you hear &#34;battery low&#34; that means you have something like 2 or 3 minutes until it just stops.  A little longer of a warning would be nice so when out running it doesn't happen to shut off well before you get home to charge it."
0,Headphones won't turn on. It's such a shame because it's extremely beautifully wrapped and it looks and feels like a high end product. Guess you can't judge a book by its cover
0,the sound kept cutting out and it broken after 1 month
1,i needed a Bluetooth headphone to use with my new iPhone 7.  I am a jogger and needed a headphone that would work for me when jogging.  The Apple earbuds fall out and are terrible for jogging.  I read the reviews and chose SENSO.  It was the best choice.  They are reasonably priced and  work well with jogging.  Why pay more when these are the best.
0,Worked for less than one year.
0,They really don't work very well. I had to replace my first pair after 2 weeks. The second pair stopped working after a month. Poor product.
1,Love them!!
1,Works well but doesn't fit securely.  This is a good headset but the ear loops are just too soft to keep the earpieces firmly in place.  Just needs a firmer &#34;wire&#34; and they'd be very good.  Could reinforce the connecting loop for greater durability as well.
0,"Right out of the box, the bass on these headphones sounded like it was completely blown out. I can't turn up the volume barely more than a whisper without having the bass scratching and bleeding. Based on other 1-Star reviews, it appears that they are just super unreliable in terms of quality - any given pair might be better or worse than another. I'm going to try to trade these in for a new pair and see if that solves the problem.<br />Otherwise, range and connectivity seems fine, and I like the design and how the hooks can mold around your ear for a snug fit."
1,The sound is great.  The headphones are a little uncomfortable.  They don’t seem to fit comfortably over the ear.
0,"Bought as a birthday present for my daughter. As far as sound goes, they were not nearly as good as the ad on Amazon described. But the biggest problem is that they would not stay on her head under any circumstances. We messed with all the different size ear buds and tried everything we could think of for two hours before we just gave up. They would fall off at the slightest movement or even the blink of an eye or even if she was as still as she could be. They sort of fit me okay but I couldn't get the ear buds in far enough to get a decent sound. They obviously were not made to fit a 12 year old child and as an adult, I had my problems with them too. I had to return them to Amazon and I am just waiting for my refund. I called the service number on the card that came with the ear buds and the rep told me I had to buy a more expensive model to get one that would work for my daughter. Nah, don't think so."
1,Great sweat-proof earbuds for my daily runs.  The battery life is pretty good too!
1,Love it for bluetooth in ear headphones for sport. The mic quality is terrible though.
1,"These are great, super easy to set up and use.  I really like that they're agnostic and all the functionality still works regardless of os."
1,I have them.for a week so far the best I have use
1,I purchased the head phones for my daughter on her birthday. She likes them a lot.
1,Great running earbuds and for the price the sound quality is outstanding. Great battery life!
1,"Generally speaking, I like these headphones. 3 sizes of earbuds allow for a comfortable, snug fit. Sound quality is good, and the Bluetooth range is solid. The only real complaint I have relates to the battery. According to the product description, these phones are supposed to have a battery life of around 8 hours. So far they seem to be getting pretty close to that. BUT, when they get down to 30% (my phone shows a battery gauge for the connected headphones), they make a loud &#34;Battery Low&#34; announcement. This wouldn't be all that bad, except the announcement repeats EVERY 30 SECONDS. So for the last approximately 2+ hours of run time, your music or podcast is interrupted every 30 seconds letting you know your battery is running low. This is annoying enough that it makes the functional battery life of the product much closer to 6 hours than 8.<br /><br />Am I missing something? Does the product melt in your ears when the battery reaches 0%? Why is this announcement so important it needs to be repeated every half minute for over 2 hours?"
1,"Good quality sound, can use the mic to make calls, and no accidentally yanking then out of my ears because there's no cord attached to my phone. Easy setup."
0,Terrible. Stopped charging after a few uses. Do not waste your money
0,Past the return date and already broke.  Just randomly won't turn on.  Bad.
1,"I bought these as a backup to my powerbeats 3.  Pairing is simple provided there are no other Bluetooth devices on in the room.  My only complaints are that when I'm at the gym, the headphones cut out or turn on and off.  Really annoying. My other complaint is that they don't fit quite as snug as my powerbeats 3.  They are nice affordable option if you are not willing to pony up the money for powerbeats."
0,The &#34;flexible ear hooks&#34; is too &#34;flexible&#34;. Bigger than my ear. And can't be adjust.
1,"Fantastic Bluetooth earbuds. At three months, I have had absolutely no issues with this product. These earbuds do produce (more than) ample bass, so I moved to a streaming music provider that offered an Equalizer which allowed me to fine tune the frequencies. Very happy with this product and it's performance."
1,Husband loves these. He commented on the quality and long battery life.
1,Nice buds
1,I purchased these for running.  I really like them. They never fall out of my ears. Sometimes the sound is spotty but overall a great buy.  Love the case and other accessories that come with it.
1,Thank for delivering .  I  like SENSO
1,Great product and highly recommend
1,AMAZING product
0,The item is no good battery dies after 10 minutes of use after I used it then gave it a full charge
1,Works but sound is very distorted. You get what you pay for.
1,Great Headphones!
1,Baller headphones
1,"Literally had this for 5 minutes and already happy. This is like a 2 for 1 deal... with the added dual android/ iPhone integrated charger this was definitely worth the $35. On that note iPhone chargers usually go for $7-$12.<br />Anyways, connected the headphones via Bluetooth in less than 1 minute and started  listening to &quot;Humble&quot; as soon as it connected... with with the volume on my iPhone halfway I could not hear my mom talking to me which I think is good considering she's kind of loud. So, overall volume is amazing , looks are great, added accessories are a plus.<br /><br />P.s. If any bad things happen, I will keep you guys updated."
1,"For the price these are good earbuds the sound quality is good, only problem is that I cannot control the volume from the earbud only through<br />my phone but that really is not a to bad plus they are not noise cancelling but I can live with that. the sound quality is really nice"
1,"I used them once so far on a jog. They fit in the ear well, don't jostle around while I'm moving, and have a good volume control. I'm more than satisfied already."
1,"Great headphones but only lasted 18 months before dying. If you buy them, get the extended warranty."
1,"They held out pretty well until a run one night in a steady rain. Water got into the switch and it started repeatedly activating voice dial.  I let it dry out for two days, charged to get it to activate and the switch was locked on.  Game over.  IPX7?  Nope."
1,The sound quality is great! Battery life is so long. Use the headphone more than 6 hours everyday.  Bought 2nd pair.
0,These headphones do not reliably connect to bluetooth.  They cannot be found on most of my devices.
1,Excelente relación precio calidad
0,Broke after 4 months and very little usage.
1,Definitely recommend them.
1,"awesome Bluetooth headphones, have owned monster, and beats, these are just as good for a much better price, and I would argue these are more comfortable as well."
1,"Comfortable, easy to use, affordable, and great sound!"
1,"Have bought two of these in about 30 months after my first one broke about 9 months ago.  Had some issues with the first one where it would require me to connect about 3-4 times to my ipad or iphone before the connection would work.  It would show the headphone and battery bar icon on my phone but when I played music the music would come out of my phone or ipad and not the headphones.  Occasionally I would even have to restart the apple product and reengage the bluetooth again to get it to work.  It was rare that it connected perfectly on the first try but 2 tries was most common.  The first set eventually broke when it wouldn't connect to my phone at all anymore.  It kept saying searching and my phone would not see it come up.  I tried the headphones on 4 different devices to make sure it wasn't the connecting device that was the problem, but it failed to connect on any so I threw it away.  I bought another pair because for $25, lasting nearly 2 years was good enough for me.  I would absolutely recommend these over wireless beats as I went through three pairs of wireless beats (2 for me and one for my wife) in 2 years.  For the ripoff price beats charges they had better last 5 years not just under 1 year.  Sound quality for these phones and beats were even to me and neither really do much noise cancellation at all, which is fine because I wouldn't expect much out of this type of design.  Of important note, my second pair of these headphones does not have any issues with bluetooth connectivity and I honestly don't think it has EVER failed to connect on the first try, so perhaps just got a bad pair for my first go round (or an unusually lucky pair this time!).  One issue I see with all three pairs (both of mine and the pair for my wife) is that they all fail to show the battery strength accurately on the phone.  The battery bar on the device starts at 100% and then goes down to 75% or 66% or so immediately on the icon on the phone, but never goes below that ever.  Thus I have had many a workout where my headphones died 15 minutes in to my 60 min workout which is very annoying!  For that, I try to keep rough track of my workouts and try and charge the headphones after each 3rd or 4th workout to be sure they don't die on me, but occasionally i still forget.  Have a pair of Bose noise cancelling headphones (that are amazing!) that always tell me battery strength remaining when I turn them on and that notification is always accurate.  Wish these headphones did the same."
1,The work great until the get a random short in the cord which cause them headphones to cut off. This is my second pair that this has happened on.
1,Really comfortable and stays on with extreme exercising sound is what you would expect ok
0,"I ordered these headphones in April 2017. In February 2017 they started to malfunction. First, one of the earbuds stopped working. Then, after a week or so they started dropping the connection with my phone. I would only be able to listen for about 10 seconds before having to reconnect them. I called their customer service and filed a warranty claim. A new pair was sent out and arrived within days. A little over a year later and I am having the same connectivity issues.<br /><br />I will say that they are great earbuds - with a 12 month shelf-life. Not very expensive, but still... I don't want to have to be replacing my earbuds every year. I am thinking that I will invest a little more into headphones that I can keep around for more than one trip around the Sun. Good sound quality, cancels noise, lightweight, and easy to pair. Purchase at your own risk."
1,"Good product, dies quickly"
1,"I just bought these yesterday and they are some of the greatest heaphones I've owned.  They are comfy, lightweight, simple controls and the sound quality is well worth the money and then some....at time I can barely tell they I am wearing them.  Easily connects to two devices."
0,"UPDATE: right side headphones were fading in volume and now no longer work at all.<br /><br />utstanding sound quality, battery life, waterproofing. Couldn't ask for more for less money."
1,"The sound is good, comparable to more expensive headphones. They don’t fit my ears as well, and I find them bulky. I love the case-hopefully will keep me from loosing them"
1,"Very good for the price.  Battery life is a little short...although that is an opinion based on my expectation not to another product.  Over the ear pieces are very flimsy and don't grab my ear well, therefore they rotate forward and come loose."
1,Great ear buds! Exactly as described.
1,"These met all my needs in terms sound quality for playing music and functionality for exercising. Battery was okay, it would last a few hours if I played music nonstop. I bought these at the end of 2017, it's been 4 years of usage here and there, and these are starting to fail now. Last week suddenly, I started having connectivity issues where the earbuds refused to connect to my phone and kept disconnecting. I am still unable to properly connect to bluetooth and use these at all. I would rate these 5 stars overall, but knocked down a star because they are no longer usable."
1,Battery life is excellent.  My only issue is the tiny blue LED reflects in my glasses on each of it's little &#34;i'm on&#34; blinks.  But you get used to it.
0,"Poorly designed, won't stay on your ears for more than 100 feet before they fall off."
1,Very comfortable headphones for the price. Good sound. Glad I purchased these headphones.
1,"Good quality, fits well, like having the earpieces on a wireless cord"
1,"if you wear glasses, hope you have long hair, because the blue light indicator keeps pulsating and reflects in the glasses, so you can hide it with your hair???  anyway, otherwise, very good."
1,I love these ear buds so much I bought a pair for my husband. We use them on our walks and bike rides and they make both activities more enjoyable. I would recommend them as they are a great way to be free of that annoying wire and are reasonably priced too.
1,For the price these ear buds offer great sound and loads of extras come in the package.
1,I'd give these a 2 1/2. I wish the hooks came off. These are really painful to wear even without the hooks over my ear. Not just uncomfortable but they hurt. The sound quality is good and they paired easily with my phone. I'd honestly send them back if I didn't need them so badly right now.
1,"This is quite possibly the easiest pairing of a bluetooth device I've ever had. The ear hooks are flexible, which is nice. They sound great."
1,I wasn't sure if I'd like them but I LOVE them! I use them on all my runs and will use them for my upcoming marathon.
1,Good brand best connection like lot
1,"Decent sound.  They're no Bose though, and I own both."
1,It was amazing
1,sound quality is pretty good. i like not being attached to my device. I wish the mic and controls was on the cable. Mic picks up all<br />surrounding noise and makes it tough to hear during phone calls.
0,"As I have seen with many others my ears too are  small and I’ve always had a problem with ear  buds. I was happy that these not only fit comfortably but actually stayed in during workouts.  Sound quality was also pretty good and overall I was happy with the purchase until they suddenly stopped powering on.  I’ve kept them in their case, I’ve never gotten them wet and they weren’t even used that often. There is no explanation for why they suddenly stopped working.  Initially I thought the battery was just dead but during the last few times of trying to charge them, the blue light appeared as if they were charging but nothing would power on. They won’t even power on when connected to the power source.  Since they’re from a third-party the only thing Amazon was able to do was give me a $20 credit which I appreciate but these were more than $20."
1,"So far so good. I've had a few Bluetooth headphones, these are by far the best for the price. I do wish that the low battery warning would kick in earlier."
1,"The headphones are great.<br /><br />Only two problems:<br />Battery: before my run, I left with what looked like an 80% charge shown on the top right next to the headphone icon (Iphone 7 plus).  About 15 minutes into my run I get a warning the battery is low.  Then I continually get the warning every minute or so till the headphones get shut off.<br /><br />Wind noise: there is a lot of it, you need to crank up the volume to drown out the wind."
0,not charging plugged-in for more than three hours
0,"These headphones are hit and a miss. No matter what, they hold a great long charge of at least 10 hours. The sound is better than most and they are fairly comfortable. The thing that fails me every time is the signal and feed. It is not an issue with my phone. If the phone is in a backpack or one of my backpockets then I have a broken signal to the headphones and it skips. If the phone has a direct line of sight then it's usually fine. As far as working out with them, I'd recommend them if you have the ability to leave your phone out on a table near you. For the type of use I wanted out of them, they suck."
1,"Great price when caught on discount. Stay on well, even with glasses during lighter exercise, but haven't used for extended running yet. Good earpiece variety also, for a nice fit."
1,"This is a birthday gift for my son, he said it is good.  He uses that for running and it is light weight."
1,"""I bought these as a birthday gift for my brother and he absolutely loved them. They have good sound quality."""
1,I really like the product. Lost my Beats headphones getting out of the car a few months ago and went to Amazon and bought these as a replacement. I'm very satisfied. I've bought a back-up set and had my father by a set last month. Great value and great product.
1,"This is my first Bluetooth product so I was unsure how difficult it would be to set up. and I was pleased that the Senso headphones / ear buds were very easy to charge and pair with my phone, and I'm listening to a podcast right now.  I have not tried them with a phone call yet but I expect that that function will also work well.<br /><br />Another test that I haven't done yet is seeing how well they work while running but my experience so far leads me to believe that they will be fine with that also."
0,Ze escuchan los ruidos externos. Las personas cuando me llamaron no me escuchan bien
1,The fact that I have been trying to find a set of headphones that are comfortable yet affordable is why I chose my Senso Bluetooth headphones. They met my goal on both counts!
1,"Great earbuds that sounds awesome, unfortunately they just quit working after a few months. No visible damage or no mishandling they’ll just quit working."
1,"Great product , battery life last about 7-8 hours and only takes estimated time of 2 hours to charge up to full. Thumbs up!"
0,"6 months after I purchased this Senso headphones, it stopped working without any damage to it. It does not turn on anymore! not recommended"
1,Nice ear buds. Ear hooks are flimsy making them hard to them get on. Only complaint I have.
1,Perfect combination of  sound quality and  battery life.<br />also stick nicely to ear during excises.
1,"I got these primarily because of the over-ear mechanism that prevents headphones from falling out while exercising, and 2 months later I am in love with these! Great sound quality, and comes with a convenient carrying case. Auto-connect feature for bluetooth is awesome as well :)"
1,Love the sound. Very comfortable fit. I will definitely buy again.
1,"Wow<br />This much Bluetooth sound for about $36. Received in the usual timely in the usual oversized waste of a box. Charged, paired and now listening to everything I like. The sound is clear and lows are surprisingly low. These rock. I will not only highly recommend head set I will buy again for sure. Don't waste your time looking around, go for it, you will be please.<br />It is time to cut the cord go Bluetooth. Second set of Bluetooth headset the Motorola's I had were uncomfortable and don't sound nearly as good imo.<br />The play time is good and the headset came with 4 total pairs of ear cushions. 🤘 Rock on."
1,"I'm an IT systems professional so I have high expectations with functionality and these Bluetooth headphones haven't let me down so far.  I've also recommended them to fellow IT professionals as well as family members.  For sure, they are worth the asking price.  Very good sound quality, easy function, quick to sync and comfort fit."
1,Awesome product. Make my work more easy! Battery last longer. Worth buying
1,"I am really enjoying these headphones! And, the contents of the box comes with everything you could realistically need: charging cable, car charger adapter, different size ear pieces, a solid case to keep your headphones in, long battery life. Wow!"
1,Easy to pair. Very comfortable. Great sound!
0,Thought this was gonna be a great deal based on the amount of reviews. I tested these out and two shorter distance runs and they cut out a lot. I cannot imagine the frustration using these on a half-marathon.
1,Very easy to set up & use. Great quality product!
1,Love them! Well worth the money!
1,"I've had these earphones for almost a month now.  I use them everyday and shower with them on a regular basis and they're amazing.  The rubber that wraps around my ears took a little getting used to, just different than what I'm used to, not painful. The connect to my phone within 2 seconds of turning them on and the music is crisp, clear and loud.<br /><br />Update, I've had the ear phones for almost 6 months, using them sometimes 2-3 times a day to include the shower.  I'ma have to change the rating because for a little while now the earphones have been turning off / disconnecting from my phone with out notice.  I've noticed that putting them on the charger for a quick charge fixed the issue..  Last night it seems the battery has completely died and will no longer charge.<br />It was a good but very short run."
0,didn't  like how it fit inside ear
1,I love these headphones they are much better than the beats I have. I threw my beats away. These headphones are so good I gotta buy another pair someone stole mine from the gym
0,The clips were too big around my small ears.  I ended up giving them to my dad who really likes them
1,"For the price i paid, so awesome!!"
1,Great sound quality! The charge lasts for ever!
1,"Great product, excellent sound and good bass. Only complaint I have is that I wish the battery lasted longer."
0,"After 2 days of running I find that they have no ability to protect against wind noise--any breeze or greater creates wind sound in the ears sufficient to overtake the music (in my case) that I was listening to.  Additionally, the rubberish hooks that go around the ears are very flexible and slide around making that securing process less than required.  The sound is fine and ease of use is fine but the noise is a deal breaker.  The 3 saar plug sizes and shape would work better if there was an in-ear nesting shape like on my 2 other wired ear buds and the buds themselves had some approximation of a shape more friendly to the ear canal entry.  I've never had a wind problem before --sorry - I wanted them to work well but they just don't ."
1,"I love these headphones they fit perfectly and stay in place while working out and they sound great too! So nice to not have long cords to deal with. Great customer service as well, I highly recommend."
1,Love love love my new earbuds!! They are comfortable and have great sound!
1,"The best price ,best quality. Me encanta!!!!"
1,Yes indeed perfect
1,"Works perfect.  Comfortable, easy to setup and can even activate Siri."
1,I use this earphone almost everyday and never gave me any issue
1,"Really like these ear buddies, they fit we and have great sound"
1,These work great!  i have had these for several months and am very pleased with their Bluetooth functionality and sound.
0,"Wanted to give these earbuds several months before reviewing, so here goes:<br /><br />They worked great until about 6 months in, when the sound on the left earbud began cracking and distorting. I lived with that for a week or so until the earbuds quit on me entirely. They’ll power on but don’t appear to be holding a charge whatsoever. The earbuds indicate they are fully charged when I plug them in, but they power down almost immediately when I attempt to use them.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this product and am disappointed."
1,Great just don’t let them fall out of your pocket then run them over in the driveway
1,"I have been using these headphones for a couple of weeks and I love them.  The sound is great, and the design is perfect as they stay in your ears.  I have had other bluetooth headphones that do not stay in during exercise, so I really appreciate a pair that works so well.  They paired with the iPhone very easily, and they last a long time between charges.  I highly recommend them!"
1,So far so good. Look good sound good.
1,Not sure how great Beats earbuds are but these are exceptional cancels all noise and are very loud
1,Excelente
1,Great sound!  Easy to pair up!  Everything included except I couldn't find the wire tie which was listed on the package contents.  It doesn't make or break my opinion on the product as the SENSO Bluetooth Headphones are perfect for my uses.
1,Easy setup to pair with my phone and tablet.  Great sound and clarity.  Keeps a charge all day!  Very comfortable. No issues with the headphones falling out during walking/running.
1,So far I am loving these. They sound good and were easy to pair with my phone. Volume levels are good and I am no where near the max level and they are still plenty loud enough in the gym.<br /><br />UPDATE 03/27/2017: I accidentally ran these through the washer AND dryer. When I found them in my clothes coming out of the dryer I was devastated because I really like them. I expected the worst and you can imagine my surprise when they worked and took a charge. It was just yesterday but it speaks to the toughness of these earbuds.
1,"Bought  these headphones for my husband he's a really picky guy he loves them so much he wanted me to buy a second pair for myself<br /> He said the sound quality was great, and they were comfortable in his ears."
1,I liked the set that I purchased earlier that I bought a second set. Sound quality is excellent.
1,"Just recently bought the headphones. And so far, very good product!"
1,All great.
1,The best
0,"I have had 3 similar items, and relative to jaybirds these  1) have poor range- just a few feet, 2) a muffled sound i.e. poor response at higher frequencies, like an AM radio, and 3) are uncomfortable because of the over the ear pieces that can't be removed.  An earbud can still fall out of your ear, but wearing these are like getting your ears boxed while running or working out.  Amazon took them back.  The seller did not acknowledge my last 3 email messages."
1,"Amazing sound, great little case and accessories.  Highly recommend"
1,I can now listen to audio books
1,Purchased these for my wife. She uses them on her morning power walks and absolutely loves them!
1,First set of bluetooth headphones for the gym.  Really like them.  Easy to use and sound is good for ear buds.  Guess I've been 30-40 feet from phone and not a issue one!
0,"Read before buying--<br />These used to be great headphones for the price.  I recently bought these as a replacement for my previous Senso pair I had used for years without problem.  I expected to receive the same product but I didn't.  They cut a corner on these that significantly affects the comfort the previous pair had.<br /><br />The ear hooks on the previous pair were covered with a nice rubber coating so during prolonged exercise yours ears never hurt and you'd forget they're even there, the ear hooks are now made of hard plastic.  It's painful and uncomfortable from the moment you put them on.  The other design they changed is that the hooks themselves used to be pliable so you could form them exactly to fit your ear, smaller, larger, whatever the case may be.  These do not form, it's just hard plastic and it's way too large to hold snug on your ears.<br /><br />Really disappointed Senso, you had a phenomenal product.  I checked out your newer version and they look like they suffer from the same downgrades.  Here's an idea, cut out the useless excessories (ex: cell phone card holder sleeve?) and focus on bringing the product comfort back to where it used to be."
1,"Very easy to connect to Your Bluetooth,music sounds great,comfortable,and dose not fall out or off your ears.I love mine"
1,"Good sound quality and Bluetooth connection, not good to run upwind!! To much noise!"
1,Christmas gift for my daughter. Delivery was very timely and she loves the features of the product. Thank you.
1,So far these things are awesome. Round 7 hours listening time per charge maybe more. Pretty good range. Def worth the money
1,"These are as good, if not BETTER than my Bose wireless headphones.  I was awed.  Not to mention the customer service and customer relations are fantastic.  I will be getting another pair to give as a gift."
1,"Sound quality is excellent and I really like the light weight feel of the ear pieces. At first I thought that they were going to be heavy, but they were not.  As with most head phones, fit is everything, and I didn't get that comfortable feel, or perfect fit, that I was hoping for. Invotek recommend buying &#34;memory foam ear tips&#34; as a possible solution to the fit issue. I thought for the price, they could have included them, although I am not sure that they would be any better then what was supplied. I think for the average folks who do not have fit issues these will do just fine. As for the distance of the bluetooth reception from my iPad, it wasn't as good as my cell phone head set. In the house I could get about 10-15 feet away with my Senso Bluetooth headset, and with my cell phone head set I could get about 20 feet away before I started to loose reception. I rate this product better then average so giving it a 4 stars.<br /><br />NOTE: I was not able to get good sound quality using the headset as a cell phone answering device. Sounded more like a tunnel when connected to a caller. I used a Samsung cell for for this evaluation. Playing music was equal to that of the sound quality of my iPad. Not sure why the difference.  So while I was satisfied with the music quality, I was not as a cell phone headset."
1,Arrived fast and they are great quality!
1,Clear sound and comfortable to wear. I haven't had them long but thus far they're doing well with me at the gym
1,I got this as a gift for my mom she sad they are very clear stay charged for a long time and very easy to use
0,"They worked fine for the first 3 weeks; no issues at all. Great sound and decent fit. However...I used them (fully charged) while running a half marathon last weekend and they quite literally sputtered and died about 10 minutes before I finished (around 1 hour and 58 minutes in). This was odd because I used this same pair while running another half marathon (again, fully charged) a few weeks before and they worked fine. I now only use them for short training runs while I search for another higher quality product that holds a better charge."
1,"So far so good.  Easy set up and great sound for the price.  Time will tell if they hold up, but as of now very pleased with the purchase"
1,Good sound quality at reasonable price. Easy to set up too.
1,"Did not expect the sound quality to be so high.<br />Also surprised by how well they stay secure in-ear while running, jumping, etc.<br /><br />The cord connecting them is a bit longer than I'd like, but it does not usually cause an issue.<br /><br />Overall excellent product for playing music - however, I have not tested the microphone or in-call audio."
1,Awesome sound quality. I use these to mow the lawn while listening to podcasts. With no problem hearing everything said during the podcast.
1,"I've owned a lot of headphones and ear buds.  So far, these are by far the best ones I've tried.  They are the first headphones that I can turn the volume up to the point that they are too loud.  In other words, I can actually hear the music and movies.  The are very comfortable and I hardly know that I have them on.  They are easy to pair and I have been able to pair them to my IPhone and IPad at the same time.  The sound switches between the two devices very well. I would recommend these to anyone that wants a great pair of comfortable, inexpensive high quality headphones."
1,"I like these, comfortable, sound is good and battery seems to hold decent. Easy to pair."
0,"My recent pair (5th pair) is my least favorite pair because they changed the design on the part that wraps over your ear to flexible vs rigid, which always loses its shape after a short period so that you have to reshape it so it wont fall out, the wire grabs your neck or chin and tugs on the ear piece causing it to lose its shape around your ear which then causes you to pause and reshape it, major drag when your running or driving, major bummer in design change. probably wont re order them because of that simple but negative change. Otherwise its a great product for the money."
1,"So far, so good. I love that the headphones connect quickly, are waterproof, and are of good quality. I don't expect concert hall quality from headphones at this price. I have only used them a couple of times so cannot speak for the long term quality. 😎"
1,I bought this and it came nicely package and lots of handy attachments however it didn't fit in my small ears. I hate it though because it looks like a great product and I loved the handy attachments and nice case but only for larger ears.
0,"I purchased this headphones because they had so many great reviews and the price was comfortable, only to find out that they have some many Bluetooth connectivity problems. Some times I can’t even get them to pair and when they do, the connection is weak. When I start doing some HIIT workouts, they stop working for moments... is horrible. They might be good for walking or just listening to music sitting."
1,This says it was delivered but iv been checking my mailbox everyday and still has not come. Iv been trying to contact seller. This is my second pair ordering. I had my first pair for about 4 months and they workd amazing. Battery lasted me all day with out having to keep charging. Best bluetooth head phones iv owned. I work outside all year round in boston rain snow or shine and these senso headphone worked through nomatter the weather. My first pair was stolen. So i ordered a new pair same kind because i was amazed how good they work. But i still have not recieved my second pair. Its been over a week now
1,Me wife loves 'em.
1,"First of all, fully charged and ready to go out of the box so I was able to test them out immediately. I bought this pair based on the reviews so here's my 2 cents: great sound quality, sits in ear comfortably and won't fall out even without the ear hook, simple controls, paired with my iPhone 6 immediately, microphone worked just fine in the wind.<br />I mainly got these for running and I haven't been disappointed. The cord doesn't bounce up and down on my neck while I'm out and the sound cancelling is pretty impressive. In fact, be careful if you're running along busy roadways, I can't even hear other dogs barking at my dog when we pass their fence.<br />Overall, easy 5 stars and the 1 year warranty is automatic upon purchase."
1,"Great performance, work as expected."
1,"One thing I look for when purchasing something electronic on Amazon is if the seller comments on purchases that have problems. Sooner or later something you purchase will not work or will  have issues, especially with lower priced items. Customer service is what it's all about.<br />I purchased a pair of these in September and recently began having issues with pairing and charging.I emailed customer support, they got back to me quickly. After a couple attempts to fix them (using their suggestions) they still wouldn't work correctly. They promptly sent me another pair...in 3 days.<br /><br />These earbuds/headphones have now become my go to pair for watching TV and listing to music (I have different 6 pair)  They pair quickly, fit well, last 7+ hours and sound great. All to often company's boost the base at the expense of  middle/high frequencies, this can muddy up voices when watching TV...these have a surprising flat frequency response and I don't have to switch to different pair when I listen to music. What really stands out is how well they stay connected when I walk around the house. I have a couple other pair that allow me to wander back to my computer room (at the opposite end of the house) with minimal dropping out...if I hold my head just right.  These allow me to listen to the TV while messing around on the computers without holding my head a certain way, it's great!  For the price, these are a great pair of headphones and they come with terrific customer support."
1,"Great price and great quality! I love these blue tooth headphones. I use them with my iPhone and my Apple Watch. I’ve used them for every day use and at the gym. They are perfect for the gym, they stayed intact during high cardio work outs and it blocks out all other surrounding back ground sounds."
1,These are excellent. The sound quality is much better than I expected and they have paired with multiple devices with no problems. This is really a great product with a wonderful set of accessories included.
1,Works great when I'm riding the bike.  Music is very clear through it.
1,"i own both Powerbeats 2 and Powerbeats 3 but have had issues with both so i figured that i would give these a try.  These sound just as good as my Powerbeats and the volume is a little higher, when is great for drowning out the house music at my gym as well as the grunting and groaning that  some people enjoy doing while incorrectly lifting weights mush too heavy than they are really handle.<br /><br />I also really like that they can pair to both my iPhone and iPad at the same time.  It makes it seamless when i go from listing to my music on my phone while lifting to watching Netflix while sweating it out on the elliptical.<br /><br />Additionally, the included charging cables, car charger and case are worth the price of these headphones by themselves.<br /><br />The only drawbacks are that you can't access Siri (No big deal for me as i hate that b!@$h anyway) and the ear hooks are rubber without any rigidity so they fall off my ears during high impact activities like running.  I couldn't take more then 3 steps while running without the right one falling off.  However for lifting and working on a cardio machine i only had to adjust them occasionally. But then again i always have this problem with ear phones, so i must have weird shaped ears or something.<br /><br />I would recommend these headphones over the overpriced and sort lived bigger brands any day."
0,"I had 3 pairs and they lasted between 3 and 9 months.  The sound is acceptable for the price, but overall very cheaply made and they stop working in a few months.  The customer service is terrible.  I managed to get one pair replaced in 2017.  More recently, they don’t even respond to emails, let alone honoring the warranty."
1,Very happy with my purchase I have 0 complaints
0,Product failed already; bought June 2.
1,"Have had them for a couple of days and are working great!<br />Sound is pretty good if you insert them into your ears (a bit deep)<br /><br />Great perks are included within the box.<br />The only complain I may have right now is that they take 2-3 tries to connect with my phone, somehow the link is succesful but the headphones are not detected as a sound output ."
1,Good package and shipped on time. I've been using this headphones for months and it's been working fine. Not the best sound quality but acceptable. Easy to pair and connect to my phone but sometimes there are noises continuing for like 30 secs right after connecting to my phone. That's why the 4 stars.
1,They cut out more than I like.  I run at two mile intervals twice a day and the bluetooth embedded in my stocking hat cut out maybe once during each run.  These statically cut out about every 2 minutes.  I wouldn't buy them again.
1,"He tenido una experiencia muy gratificante con este producto, tiene buena calidad y es muy practico."
1,I really like these! I tried several kinds before I got these and so far I like these the best plus they are the best sounding. They connect quickly and work well.
1,Great sound quality. Easy to pair with my Android device. Fit great in my ears with the different ear pad options. Overall very satisfied
1,Excellent quality!
0,"I really really wanted to like these. I was very excited to receive my package but when I tested them I was let down by the audio quality. Through majority of the reviews I believed the audio would be great, but they tend be heavy on the base to the point where music sounds a tad muffled. At first I was relentless to try and make myself like these. I made sure they were fully charged and made sure the silicone eartips fit properly but to no avail they just don't deliver. One reviewer did mention using the equalizer setting on their Spotify app to adjust quality, but to use these headphones on any other app without equalizer settings is difficult. The only thing I really liked about was that these headphones are comfortable. Those looking for a headset that will stay put during strenuous activity, this could be a good choice."
1,Love these!  Excellent sound.
1,"I’ve had these for two years, and I still use them often. I use them mowing the lawn, at the gym, and around the house. They’re a very good inexpensive option that offers good quality for the price. They don’t have “noise cancel” but other noise is definitely reduced when these are in your ears somewhat like earplugs. They include different sizes for your ears. The charging cord included is very short and lost easily but a universal cord works just fine. You cannot charge them and use them at the same time but I’m sure that’s normal. Whenever I take calls with them on the audio doesn’t seem quite as clear as a music app. I’d buy them again."
0,"i ride my bike and work out with these wireless headphones. i sweat a lot. i tried my best to keep these clear of sweat and water, and i don't know if that was the cause of their demise, but it's the only thing i can think of. my first pair would still turn on, but would never pair with anything. my second pair just stopped turning on completely, even though it would charge.<br /><br />these things are cheap, and probably would be good for light use, like if you're just sitting around in bed or something. they're branded as ""sports earphones"" - but on my bike, the wind rips through these things and it's hard to hear. also, the connection was spotty even though my phone was in my pocket. at the gym, they were fine, although i didn't like the cable bouncing up and down - for the price i was ok with this.<br /><br />the sound quality is pretty good for what you pay for. probably the best thing about the headphones. while support is great and they sent me a replacement set, i think i'm done with these things. i need something more reliable and probably of higher build quality.<br /><br />i'm skeptical of these being ""sweatproof"" because the manual says quite a lot about keeping the device free of sweat and water. if they are - then why did they die after only a few months of use? whatever the reason, it's  probably not worth it if you're interested in wireless headphones for the gym."
1,Doesn’t catch all the treble in some of my music but great for the price. The ear coverings are bendable to the shape of your ear but I have to readjust it every time after I put my earbuds away
1,Great Bluetooth headphones for the price.
1,"Took out for a test run. So far so good. Sound quality excellent for price point; skipped out a little even though phone and earbuds were in close proximity - will monitor and if continues, will notify company.  Customer service has been stellar so far re: reaching out to initiate feedback and open line of communication."
1,WOW!! Just started using my new Bluetooth Senso headphones.  I'm blown away.  I love a strong base sound.  These are awesome. Charged them up and I'm plugged in.  Very easy to use and they have great sound.
1,"Have been using these headphones for about a month. They work as advertised and look very robust. I get about 4 hours of steady TV watching on from a full battery charge. Would give these headphones Five Stars if the ear-loops could be removed because my family tells me that they look bulky when I wear them at home. Also, these headphones would be exceptional (Five-Stars) if the Bass sound can be little deeper."
1,These head phones are awesome. Great sound and noise canceling. So happy i purchased these.
1,I bought these so i could work out with my apple watch and was amazed at how good they sounded and how well they stay in your ears while working out. They are also water resistant and i dont have to worry about sweating. With all this i bought a set for my wife and she liked them so much she made me order and ship a set to my son in another state. I was going to buy the $159 pair of apple air pods but they never stay in my ear so i figured i would try these since they had good ratings and was pleasantly surprised for how inexpensive they are. Great earbuds and well worth the money. Would suggest these to anyone looking.
1,Great sound. Easy to get started. Very comfortable.
1,I received my headphones about 3 days ago I work in a building with a lot of noise these headphones are great volume was great love them very comfortable on my ear battery life last all day
1,I have used this product for listening to music while working out on an exercise bike and an elliptical trainer and it has been completely satisfactory.  Be careful adjusting the position in your ear while working out though ... you can unintentionally mute it or change the volume if you touch the right-side earphone in the wrong place.
1,"purchased as a gift for my SO (who works outside)<br />last set of bluetooth headphones died after being used too many times in the heat and humidity<br />these have held up wonderfully now for over a month with no problems and still sound great!<br />would highly recommend if you plan on using these for workouts, or just active work"
1,"Great quality sound, the most comfortable ear buds I've ever warn.... fantastic product , planning on buying another pair for my teenage son 😀"
1,"Amazed by this product! I usually hate in-ear headphones because they are very uncomfortable, but these fit great and stayed in my ears the whole time without falling out. The sound was clear and the bass was booming. Definitely worth buying!"
1,"Excellent sound, great fit and they are easy to use. Would definitely order again. These make a great gift for anyone."
1,Arrived on time and quality was good.
1,"The sound quality is very good, and the build quality seems solid. The head phones are very comfortable."
1,Great headphones. Sound quality is just right. Love it and saved me a bunch of money ^.^ -satisfied customer
1,"Unbelievable comfort. So far easy to connect to my phone. A 4-star review only because it has been one day, but if it this one day continues to 3 years it is an easy 5 stars."
1,Love these work well good sound easy to connect via bluetooth
1,I have only used them a couple of times and so far I enjoy the comfort and sound from them. I have not used them outside or at the gym yet so I can't say how they work while excercising or if there is an echo when outside.
1,"Does not work with voice command, no way to trigger.  Great weight, good batteries, comfortable for my large ears.  The wire binders that come with it aren't great and easy to lose, so I just used little rubber bands."
1,"Excellent value... Have not tried out at the gym yet, but the headphones worked easily out of the box, came with everything they need and a zippered case, sounded good with Amazon Music...  They are not Bose or Senheiser level of sound quality, but the sound is excellent for $35 headphones..."
1,"Excellent to run or go to the gym, cling to your ears, you just have to be careful with the volume, it can affect the ears, the volume better with moderation."
1,"I just received the Senso Headphones yesterday and I am extremely happy with their performance and the easy setup. I highly recommend them, so far."
1,"Awesome. I use them few months and am happy with that purchase. Headphones are great for joggers. They fit my ears. I don't have to worry they fall. No cord - this is the best thing, especially for runners. The sound is good. Battery life is OK. Sometimes a few minutes of charging before the running is enough to have music with me during my runnings. Recommend the seller and these headphones."
1,"I’m on my third pair. These are fantastic for anyone who misplaced headphones like I do! The price just keeps getting better, and so do the headphones. My newest paid has flexible ear hooks and the charging port is much easier to open than previous older versions.<br /><br />Anyway, for the price, these are the best headphones by far. By a mile. Save your money. These are great for most uses."
1,grate
1,Work perfectly. They actually connect to both of my phones at the same time which makes life easier for me. I've been using them for a few months. No complaints.
0,I needed earphones for daily use in the gym/running. I liked the price and i knew i wasn't going to get great sound quality. It was fine for my purposes while it lasted. About a year and half after i purchased it it started giving me problems. The left earbud started crackling and a few months later it completely died.
1,"Fantastic, Great Quality, I have 3 different brands and this one beats them all."
0,"Very comfortable headphones.  They stayed in my ears very well while running and using the elliptical machine.  The sound quality was okay, but definitely not great.  After 2 weeks, the left earbud's volume got stuck on minimum and I had to return them."
1,"The earpiece is a bit large to really secure to your ear, but works well enough. Sound quality is decent for a budget headphone."
1,"This is a great product, but Amazon has many of the same type headphones for $20. I know this because i bought the $20 set at the same time and they are virtually the same. Save the money and buy the other ones."
1,"These are very sweet, light & sturdy, and comfortable (I forget I have them on).  The sound is great, they are easy to set up and charge (took about an hour on laptop).  I have not yet experienced pairing disconnections.  Range seems to be about 30 feet."
1,"3 foot long recharge cable with 2 types of connections has issues because it does not fit directly into Apple devices as claimed. Other than that I like the product. Outstanding customer service, since they have decided to send me a replacement charging cable. Hopefully the replacement cable will work with my Apple devices as claimed."
0,"sound quality terrible and broke in about a week. Also, takes a whole brick to connect with the device."
1,These things went out after less than a month of use. The right earpiece produces no sound at all. High disappointing.
0,Sound good but th charging cables are flaky that it is a struggle to charge them to the point where I am giving up on them. It came with two cable for charging and I've been able to only get one of them to work less than half the time (probably closer to less that 10% of the time).
0,Worked for a while and sounded good for the price.  After about 6 months it wouldn't charge anymore and now it's trash.
0,They don't hold to your ears! They are nothing like the original model.
0,Some may like the way they sound but these sound terrible in my opinion. And I have run sound boards in professional settings before. They have way too much bass and mids and highs are almost non existent
0,"Head phones stopped charging after a few months, music goes in and out"
1,"I love these new ear phones. They arrive on time, and was easy to set up once I read the directions. Hahaha They make things so clear to understand when a video or music is playing. I would recommend this to anyone looking for wireless headphones."
1,"They work well and sound good, are water resistant and not to expensive to boot!  I'm a little disappointing they didn't still connect when slightly submerged, but that's kind of a tall order anyway.<br /><br />They can be a little touchy on maintaining a connection in some circumstances, and aren't the most comfortable earbuds I've used, but then they aren't uncomfortable.<br /><br />But for those two minor issues, I'd have given them 5 stars"
1,I love it.
1,This product works okay for the price.
1,"Comfortable, Easy to setup, and good battery life."
1,Amazing customer service and best product.
0,Very disappointed :(
1,"comfortable, with good battery life. They are listed as noise canceling and that is where they lack. But in a relatively quiet room they work well"
0,"Returning, as I do not like the fit on the ear buds"
1,"These headphones look and fit comfortable and have pretty good sound. Granted, it's not better than some of the higher end models in sound quality; but for me they work just fine. I do have to sometimes lower the volume as there can be a little distortion with bass ; (depends on the song), but again I am happy with the results. I've only had them for a week, so we'll see how they hold up over time. I recommend them for a great starter set to try out."
1,Very good product the sound occasionally goes in and out while working out but its nothing major
1,"***Edit: 8/2/18 my headphones are kaput. I took great care of them, but as I took them off the charger one morning and went about my usual routine of putting them on and getting my day together then no longer turn on. I thought I may have or my wife or son flipped the switch that controlled that receptacle, but I quickly knew that wasn’t the case as my Apple Watch showed it was full-power. I opted for another microUSB that was charging my SkullCandy Barricade Bluetooth speaker. Pulled the cable from its wall adapter and plugged it into the watch docking station and saw that it was good, so was the cable that ran the normal Senso charge. I’m still unsure of it why they died, could be that a year and a half is all the time you get for use. However, being fair, it could be that I had used it on fast charge adapters; I hadn’t thought the inverted wouldn’t be able to handle it and that’s my fault for not verifying. I purchased another Senso set, but for my wife because for that price and the amount of daily/weekly use I placed on the headphones, $30 is beyond fair for their sound quality.<br /><br />I will give it some less than favorable shine for having it give static when my iPhone is on my hip in case and my earbuds were in. This happened intermittently towards the earbuds end of life. Whether outside, inside, away from or near hundreds of pedestrians walking in my path of travel it would occur. Again this was only towards the end of life.  Overall I’m still plenty satisfied with them. I purchased some TaoTronic over ears just to see the life cycle of another brand;<br /><br />&#62;&#62;&#62;Original Review&#62;&#62;&#62;I LOVE my Senso's. Took me forever to write a review but I was tying to test them out and then honestly forgot to review. Sorry Invotek! So I actually held off because I had the anomaly that delivered and malfunctioned. The multifunction button lodged in; never released. I contacted and they got me a return label and shipped out a new replacement. Quality is great and bass delivery for me is excellent. I listen to a lot of rock (chevelle, breaking benjamin, rise against, incubus, etc) and it's deep enough to where my playlists don't sound like a stock radio from the 90s, home to the almighty tweeter. My hip hop can fluctuate but thats due to tons of it being my cd rips and it not being uniform. I should clarify that fluctuate for me is perfect decibel of lows vs overbearing bass that drowns out the bars.<br /><br />The multifunction  of the volume to raise/lower volume and hold to next song I guess would be my only gripe. And that's only because I never remember it's hold for a second and release to next, I constantly and consistently press/release and curse my memory when the song doesn't skip and I get a volume increase when I don't want to listen to some ridiculous pandora pairing on my stations.<br /><br />I have never gotten to fully time my use until it died and needed a recharge, but I know it's well over 4 maybe 5 hours of use with a mixture of Bluetooth calls and music. I swear it seemed like a week of use without a charge a few times (not extreme use in those instances; walking to the office and parking structure, around at lunch and while I'm studying).<br /><br />Also I still haven't changed out the different ear buds so I'm still stoked that I have that &#34;newness&#34; to check and see what difference in sound delivery I get or if it's just to fit ear weird ear canals. :)<br /><br />The accessories are a big bonus for me. Thanks guys. I was right to give you a chance, because the quality and cost are great.<br /><br />PS, if you have to contact customer support it seems like it's back alley, but they were prompt, professional, courteous and seemingly genuine with wanting you to get the best/most from your purchase. Adam, thanks for your help and not sounding like a drone going through the motions. It was appreciated and noticed!"
1,"Great sound! In the past I had had problems getting headsets to stay on while excersising. These not only stay on me,  but the ear piece stays in my ear too."
1,Mic is unusable but good sound for price.
0,Bought one in a few weeks.  The cable is broken already.  Now I can only hear one ear (right ear only!).. :-(
1,"Love, love, love em. I was kinda skeptical of buying these because i couldn't believe they were as good or better than the beats by dre head phones but they trully are. They have really good bass & clarity. The microphone doesnt pick up background noises like alot of bluetooth headphones do & they fit really good in your ear & around the ear. It blocks out the noise around you, which i love, great for the gym. I would definitely recommend for these for every day use & workout also"
1,Thumbs up
1,"Thought they would be good, based on reviews. They weren't... tinny sound...disappointed."
1,"This is an amazing product.  Very clear base and treble, especially if you have an EQ app installed on your device.  My only issue is that the wire between left and right buds could be about 4 inches longer.  Also, it comes with a 1amp microUSB charging cable that's about 6 inches long.....very short."
1,"Love these headphones! After getting mine I even ordered some for my boyfriend.  I can work all day with my headphones in, walk away from my phone and the music stays playing for quite a distance.  Would definitely purchase again."
1,Love them.
1,Good item
1,Great customer service and nice headphones! Sounds great and blocks some outside noise
1,"Nice wireless earbud, lots of extra included. I've had problems finding earbuds that stay in but these work well and come with three sets of  earbuds.  Sound quality is good and they work well in the gym. Good product for the money."
1,"I bought these based upon the fair price (about $40) and the positive reviews. I can say, after using these fairly regularly for about 2-weeks, that they are a great purchase. I didn't expect the over-the-ear piece to be a pliable as it is, but it works well, is supportive, and very comfortable. Also, the microphone works well, but isn't great when outside in a moderate wind... which is probably the case for virtually every headset-based mic.<br />If you are one the fence about these because they are so affordable, don't hesitate -- I love them."
1,It works so well!
1,"I just got my new wireless headphones.  I was impressed with the packaging and the instructions.  Pairing with my iphone was a breeze.  The controls seem simple enough, and I have the volume and forward/back figured out.  Now for the big test.  Today I am off to the gym to try these wireless babies out!  A quick update.  I loved them at the gym, and the battery life was great.  Not the &#34;was.&#34;  I was unable to get the headphones to charge, so I had to return them to Amazon.  However, I am keeping the 5 star rating and assume this was an aberration.  I will be taking pair #2 to the gym tomorrow.  They are so good that they deserve a second chance.  A quick update.  My second pair failed after 45 days, too late to replace them with Amazon.  They simply quit charging.  I called Senso, and after a short conversation they said that the product was covered under their 1 year warranty and that they would ship me a new pair.  I am keeping the 5-star rating.  I hope the third pair is the charm!"
1,""" I've used them three times at the gym for about 45 minutes each time and so far so good. They were easy to configure with my iPhone. Good product at this price point."""
1,Just received these and am very impressed... Great sound and quality... Packaging is also excellent... Worked out and the headphones did not slip from my ears
1,"Of the three Bluetooth headphones I've purchased over the past six years or so, this pair is by far the best for 5 main reasons:  relatively low cost, simple to set up, simple to use, great music sound and excellent audio when talking on the phone.  A great buy!"
1,Works great. Battery lasts forever. Links up easily. Light weight and comfort. Good sound too
1,Better than I expected.<br />One word: Excellent!!<br />Thank you very much!
1,GREAT product. I've spent hundreds on other wireless earbuds only to have them fall apart. These have been great for the gym.
1,"I bought these as a present for me 16-year old son.  He absolutely loves them.  Great sound quality.  It would be nice if there was a clip because he is afraid sometimes that they could fall off without him knowing if he doesn't have them in his ears.  However, I would definitely recommend them.  He says it is great since he doesn't have to attach a cord."
1,"First set of bluetooth headphones I have tried that do not fall out of my ears while running. Very comfortable, and I struggle with most earphones. Sound quality is good. I'm happy they come with a nice case, as this avoids wires getting tangled in my laptop bag. Cant speak yet about battery life as they are relatively new and I haven't exhausted a charge."
0,"I loved this headset when I first got it. They are comfortable, they block outside noise well and they stay put during vigorous activity. The microphone picks up my voice well, although it picks up street noise as well. They work well in high-noise environments, like the Chicago &#34;L&#34;.<br />But from the start they cut out a lot when I was doing anything the least bit active, even just walking down the street. It got worse as I used them for several months, although carrying my phone in a tight waist band helped. I don't have this trouble with my two other Bluetooth headsets, so I know the problem is not my phone.<br />They are also easy to lose. If you take one or both ear buds out to talk to someone, they can easily fall off.<br />But after only six months, the charger quit working, which means the device is useless. The design and performance are nice, but the manufacturer obviously can't turn out a good product."
1,"Heavy on the ears and they have not been staying in place with moderate movement. I wouldn't dare use them while jogging as they barely stay in while mowing the grass. Every few steps reaching up and pushing them back into my ears. Sound is good, they connect reliably so far. Considering the price of other bluetooth headphones they are a bargain and a good place to start but they are less than great for running exercise. Would do if you are weight training though."
1,"Great sound and very comfortable fit around the ears.  Stayed in place while jogging, which was very important.  Very pleased with this product."
1,"Good sound ,quick charge and lengthy play time."
1,Great product and great price!
1,"Pros: Battery lasts longer than stated, and like that it warns you when the battery is low. The fit around the ears  perfectly and the ear buds are very comfortable.<br /><br />I don't really notice the &#34;noise cancelling&#34; but maybe I have the wrong ear buds on the headphones. Haven't switched them out so will need to check."
1,I like these better than my previous pair of headphones.  I use them at work every day.  They also come with adjustable ear pads.
1,"Seriously great headphones!! Yes they hold bass because that's been my problem, I need headphones that bump. I run marathons and not fast so I needed a battery that lasts and I have pushed this one to 6 hours of the 8 hour claim, mind you they still were working I was just done.  They are simply the best I've ever owned. I've owned over 30 different kind and these easily kick the others @**.  Amazing headphones for the price!!!"
0,"I charged the headphones per the instruction (and did not leave it overnight).  The battery lasted less than 2 hours.  Charged it again till the light turned solid blue and left it OFF to take it to the gym.  By the time I arrived at the gym, the battery was low.  Defective.  I bought this pair after reading raving reviews but clearly the unit I received was defective.  One star for poor quality control.  I might give it another try after getting the refund, hopefully they ship me a working unit.  Disappointed."
1,Very good.
1,Great sound and easy to connect.
1,"I was searching for new ear buds, surfing I'd ran into your product and flipped the coin & it came up Heads!! Thanks and keep working for better"
1,It cancels out all noise and the sound quality was better than I expected. The extra cords are nice too!
1,love these headphones - lost the 1st pair and immediately ordered a replacement pair!
1,"We absolutely loved this product! Great fit, sound, and battery life!"
0,Don't purchase this product. You have to shout out for the other person to hear your voice. Worst microphone. Not worth the price
1,great headphones great sound for the price i'm satisfied
0,I use these a lot at work. So much so I have several pair so I always have a set charged up.  Between home and work I’ve owned quite a few of these over the last 4-5 years.  When I first started buying they were great. But in the last 6 months to a year the earbud quality has really gone downhill. I have a lot of problems with connectivity and with earbuds lasting. T he last set I got lasted 6 weeks. Now they won’t charge. Time to look for another brand.
0,"Did not stay in ears, lost connection consistently during workouts.  Would not purchase again."
1,top quality
0,"Bought 2. I live in NW. Rain all the time.  I was hoping it was gonna last me for a year together. But I was wrong. First week of use, no rain, still one side of the ear piece went dead. The second set is still working. Going to 2months now. It does sound great. Still, 1 out of 2 is a let down"
1,Great Product
1,"You cant talk on them, it doesn't have a mic. Otherwise good buy"
1,"Pretty good headphones for working out, running, whatever. I've run two half marathons in them and countless other runs and they work well. Occasionally they will get out of place when running and require adjustment. They don't have a great range, but if you carry your phone close it doesn't really matter."
1,"These work fine, but they are a bit clumsy in design. They're OK for wearing when you're not really active."
1,"Still in my first week of use but so far, they work great."
1,I love them
1,"Amazing , love it , just a bit big but amazing I would  recommend"
1,Has them in now. Loves them👍👍
1,The outside case door fell off after a short while but the sound and fit are great.
1,"Work great, really impressed with these head phones"
0,Stopped working after less than 3 months. I had two of them and both had the same problem. Don't buy it.
1,Work well.  High quality for the price.
1,So far (a week or so) they're the best swimming headphones I've tried.  I especially like the supple ear plugs. They mold themselves to the shape and size of my ear openings so they're comfortable and keep the water ot my ear canals.
0,"HORRIBLE!  Not even close to 30ft range.  Bluetooth connection would go in and out even with phone in my pocket!  And Yes ,SANSO customer service...I did a factory reset like you suggested to everyone else with the same problem, didn't help a bit.  You sell a garbage product so do not wast e your time responding.  Cant send these back soon  enough!"
1,The best part is definitely that the hook around the ear adjusts. So glad!
1,Excellent for running.  Volume remained clear and the headphones did not fall out during my run or excessive sweating.  I'm totally satisfied.
1,"I got these because I wanted to listen to music while I practice shooting hoops. I was worried they were going to be loose or come off as I ran around the court but day #2 and they're steady and haven't slipped off once.<br /><br />I'm running around like crazy, doing lay ups and cutting to the basket and these stay on.<br /><br />I have a iphone 6s and I can walk around the half court with my phone in my bag on the side and there's no issue with the bluetooth.<br /><br />I sweat like crazy so I'll update this later to see how long these last..."
1,I really like these! Very comfortable in the ears. Easy to set up and pair. No long cord connected to my iPhone to get tangled or yanked out accidentally when I'm working around the yard. Sound quality is excellent. Very happy with this purchase.
1,Only complaint is that they don't stay in your ears very well. I often have to readjust mine during workouts.
1,Decent sound for the price. Cannot complain
1,I really like these but here I am 5 months with them and they are shorting out on me ...the left bud is hit and miss...that really sucks as I thought they were going to be a good buy for me but 5 months is not gonna qualify them as a good buy in my books and actually quite the opposite as represented with my 1 star rating...<br />  **UPDATE**<br />I called the company and the service they provide is TOP NOTCH they really stand by their products... they more than made up what may been lacking in the product itself so combining that I cant see how they would not deserve the highest marks..their customer service is just that good..
1,"I can't tell you how pleased I am with this purchase.  I was expecting mediocre performance with these earphones because of the price.  However, I am really pleased with the performance of these earphones.  For this price, the buyer also receives a very nice case for the earphones, a car charger and another cable to charge the earphones.  These earphones outperform many of the other headphones I have had.  Highly recommended!"
1,"My son says they work good, nice fit."
0,Hi all - I got these for my boyfriend who is training for a 10-mile run in the spring for xmas. They broke! He used them a lot and they were pretty solid for most of January but I guess they are meant for light use :(
1,Very comfortable. Synced quickly. Sound is great. People I talk to can hear me clearly. Definitely best Bluetooth headphones I have tried.
1,Great product. Very comfortable. Extra earbud pads for various sizes. Great sound. Made slight bass and treble adjustment in iPhone settings. Highly recommend. Would buy again.
1,My husband loves these. Definitely recommend buying! Great sound. Definitely blocks out noise on the outside. The quality is wonderful.
1,"I can't praise these headphones enough! Having wireless headphones transformed my workouts - no more getting wires tangled on my bike's steering, or on my hiking/running gear. And the range is amazing. No need to strap my phone to my arm - I can put it in the back basket on my bike. At home, I can leave my phone in one room and hear beautifully from the other side of the apartment!"
0,"2 months and the battery died. Slowly went from normal charge, shorter and shorter, then just enough to turn on, connect, and turn back off. Trash."
1,Worked great for the first 4 months. Then I would have difficulty getting them to turn on after charging them. Then I started having trouble getting them to connect. Now I can't even get them to turn on.<br /><br />When the headphones were working they sounded great.<br /><br />Would not recommend if for running outdoors secondary to the wind sound over powering the music.<br /><br />When sweating a lot the headphones don't stay in but I imagine that is the case with other headphones.
1,Love the adjustable ear wraps
1,I returned them because they would not stay in my ear. I have trouble with any soft behind ear headphones. For the money they seem like a great value vs $200 beats. The charging cables they give are great. High value item. The zipper on the case broke the first time I opened them otherwise would have been a 4/5.
1,Picked these up for the wife she really enjoys them.
1,Love using these when I am working out.
1,"Great product. Had a battery problem 7 months after purchase and they processed a replacement after offering a solution to fix the problem first. The process was quick and easy. As for the product, the headphones last about 7 hours per charge which is great. I usually charge every 3-4 days. Great sound, highs lows and mids. Would definitely recommend. These headphones were 36$ last year and now they are 20$. Go ahead and grab this deal... Great value."
1,"Sounds good.  Very easy to program.  Not as low-profile as I would have liked, but they get the job done."
1,Well first to say why did u guys send me this small package in this big box. Now I like the product sound quality is excellent an it's an easy to use item
1,I liked the comfort and sound quality. I was also impressed with how easily they paired.
1,"Quality is high, especially considering the price point. Not only do you get a comfortable set of ear buds that stay on during work-outs and connect to Bluetooth with no issues, you also get some earbud backup options, a nice little case, and two charger options. Great deal and happy with the sound quality so far!"
1,I love them...the sound is great!
1,I can't stand earbuds due to constantly having to adjust them once i start running or sweating but after reading the reviews I figured I would give these a try and they are actually wonderful so far during workouts and the sound is great. Comes with charging assessories and the carrying case. Would definitely purchase another pair.<br />UPDATE ***<br />HAVE PURCHASED 3 MORE PAIRS FOR FRIENDS AS GIFTS<br />Everyone is happy with these earbuds
1,"I highly recommend grabbing one or two of these! Great quality, superior sound, and affordable price compared to those branded ones. No issues at all."
1,"These are great, best head phones I have ever bought. No matter how much activity you are doing and how much you sweat these will stay on your ears and they do not hurt."
1,Its superb.The quality of sound is amazing and easy to use.
1,Great headphones.  Arrived in perfect condition.
1,Customer support is unbelievable! Joshua and Marcia were incredibly helpful! I am a customer for life.
0,"Worked great and felt great for about three weeks on daily runs, now they keep disconnecting every 30 seconds. Maybe a I got a bad one. Most reviews where positive. To bad."
1,These sound better then my Beats. Great buy.
1,The sound for the money you can't beat
1,I'm still testing these out...currently having a problem with the left one staying in my ear- this was while i was wearing around house - cleaning it up. im interested mainly in how good they are when i run. What i do love about them is the very soft ear wrap...if you are wearing a hat - it's much more comfortable than the hard kind but at the same time it might be too soft to stay in place. stay tuned.
1,These headphones are amazing! They are comfortable. Stay in place. Sound quality is amazing. Easy to use for my phone calls. Only issue I have is I wish I could put the cord behind my neck instead on in front. The price was great for what I recieved
1,"Finally a pair of earbuds that stay in my ears while running! I run a lot and have tried at least 5 pairs of headphones and earbuds, and these are the absolute best. The stay firm in my ears and deliver very nice sound. I also like the fact that there is a built in mic. Thanks Senso!"
1,So far very good headphones. Pairing was flawless. Sound quality is very good.
1,"Sound quality is really good, and they stay in the ears during activities. Volume output is impressive.  The power button is easy to use as a play / pause too. The volume controls are really small, takes some getting used to operate them.  I recommend these connected wireless earbuds, and I’ll likely buy a 2nd set just for backup."
1,"This is the 2nd set I purchased. The first was for me...but my wife liked them so much, I bought her a set for when we go walking. The headphones and the customer service with Senso is superb and they followed up to check on both of my purchases."
1,"They work pretty we.. Have been using them when I am shoveling snow and they are very nice. Sound quality is on par with my corded skullcandy. Have plenty of bass. Battery life seems to be good as well. Also have worn them for several hours and they do not become uncomfortable after longer periods like some of the other headphones I have owned. The over the ear piece is a floppy piece of silicone, but it seems to be enough resistance to keep them in place. I will be buying them again if I need replacements."
1,This is deserving of 5 stars. For the price and sound quality this is great. Only thing that could make it any better would be to have the earpiece be adjustable. But for the price it's perfect.
1,"Holds very we'll in sweaty ears without affecting sound quality.  Great buy, well worth it!"
1,Not much base at all with this product
0,The piece that goes around your ear got deform. It won’t go on my ear no more.
1,"Just wow. I waited almost a year to review these headphones because i’ve had nothing but bad luck with Bluetooth headphones in the past. Either they didn’t last, cable shorted out, or the quality of the speakers just because so terrible that they were unusable. These headphones have just impressed me time and time again, for the duarability and high quality of sound. Would definitely recommend to anybody looking for a good pair of Bluetooth headphones"
1,Very good product and a good price.
1,The senso headphones does everything I need and so far are a great product
0,"I was liking this headphones a lot, until after 2 weeks of use one of them stopped working."
1,Flimsy material. Ear pieces doesn’t stay shaped to your ear. The package came with a million accessories that you don’t need. If your like me i just want headphones i can run with that won’t fall off.I guess i got what i paid for.
0,"Sounds like a cheap, muffled set of earphones. Not worth the price. I honestly cannot believe they have a &#34;list price&#34; of $169. These aren't worth the $36.97 that I paid. I will be returning them when I get back home."
1,Very impressed with everything these headphones came with. They are high quality and even have decent sound for the price. Will definitely be getting a backup pair!
1,Arrived on time. Nicely packages with a zip bag for storage. Light weight and do not get in the when around your neck. I use mainly for phone and the sound is excellent
1,Great sound! Hold a charge for a long time! I’m glad I found these before wasting money on Beats.<br /><br />I use them daily while lifting and running. No issues at all.
1,"Great head phones. Surprisingly good sound. Really good battery life and decent battery life. I use them at the gym, mowing the lawn anything. Save yourself the time shopping and just order these head phones. You wont be dissapointed"
1,"No problems so far, great sound, no issues when I start sweating."
1,Great sound and very easy to sync to my Samsung Galaxy S6. Senso keeps reaching out to me to see if I have any problems. So far none and I would recommend these to anyone.
0,"I've had my pair a month and the ear loops are falling off. I only use them in my office, not even to workout. The battery is worse than the specs provided too."
1,Product works perfectly so far and the reason for 3 stars is that I believe satisfaction is rated as a whole experience of product.  And I was quite disappointed when initial delivery date was not met. The anticipation and disappointment experienced by my son as he looked forward to his gift was quite discouraging. I enjoy Amazon and its items but must be hones in any review I give. Thank you
1,I purchased the 2nd one since I like it very much. Good earbuds with reasonable price
0,There is absolutely no comfortability. They keep falling out of my ears. I’ve tried different sizes of the ear cushions. Nothing works. I should’ve know considering how cheap they are. They’re practically impossible to use.
1,great ear buds. easy to charge and use. great clear sound.
1,Bought these for my son. He thinks they're great! Very comfortable.
1,"Shipping was fast, came with 4 pairs of ear plugs (3 silicon, 1 foam), a short charging cable and a long one with a lightning adapter, and a car charger, plus a case.<br /><br />They took a while to get used to, they weren't as comfortable in my ears as my old wired earbuds. Sound quality and battery life are great as well.<br /><br />So why not 5 stars? They came with 2 pieces you can put on the wire to keep it from dangling on your neck, and my cord wants to twist no matter what I do and it's so damn annoying. I tried hanging them to let the cord straighten out, but it's still twisting, and that annoyance stops these from getting 5 stars."
1,"I am super happy with these earphones. Great quality, I feel like I'm at a concert! They are easy to use, comfortable, perfect for exercising, and you have every accessory that I may need with it!  Best purchase I've made in a while. My husband was going to get beats, and for the price point I think he may be purchasing a pair too!"
1,"These are the best headphones at this price point, hands down. I used them while doing yard work and biking, and could not be happier with the performance."
1,"So far, so good.  I purchased this headphone to replace a Play X Store set that stopped working after 3 months.  I received the Senso set before expected and so far have been very happy with them.  They fit better, the cord is more flexible and more comfortable, and the controls seem easier to use.  I'm looking forward to a long, happy sound experience!"
1,I love it!! they work very nice. I ordered two more thx you
0,"Bought in January 2018 and battery already died.  I did not abuse them, just worn while running. Save yourself money in the long term and buy something else.<br /><br />They also never completely stayed in your ear."
1,I bought several pairs for Christmas gifts for friends. Sound is very clear and sharp. Nice sound for an inexpensive set of earbuds.
0,"I bought these because they were cheaper than buying 2 70$ at the time I bought them. they did what I wanted them to and at the same time didn't. I bought 2 of them one for my girlfriend and the other for myself. good sound while listening to music if you held your head just right. the cord from either earbud would wiggle and sound would cut out. and this was only after 3 months of use. it was great for sound while talking to someone on the phone but picked up all background noise and multiplied it by 400% so much that you could hear yourself talk. and on really good days you would get feed back and have to yank them out your ear so they wouldn't bleed. I'd give it a one star but I did like the fit in my ear. they have a 1 year shelf life of use. my girlfriend pair died 1 week before mine did. she would be talking or listening to music and it would hang up or turn her music off. then stopped working. luckily my pair didn't hang up the left earbud died and then the right. another thing is the way the hook fit behind the ear. To me, it fit fine and stayed put however on my girlfriend her ears being a bit smaller the hook kept flopping in front of her ear"
1,"Great sound, excellent fit.  Very good product for the price.  I would recommend to anyone asking about bluetooth headphones for working out."
0,These are good wireless headphones only thing i see that doesnt come with them is a wall charger base but comes with the usb cord and dual port car charger. Sound quality is ok but hey what do you expect from $35 headphones and overall I like them. They work good until a about 1 yr and few months started playing in and out.
1,Sound quality is excellent. They hold a charge as advertised. I'm very pleased.
1,Love these headphones. Connected to blue tooth right away. Love the silicone ear pieces. So much easier on the ears. Would definitely buy again. &quot;
1,"I wanted to use the headphones for a couple of weeks before I posted a review. I have always used wired headphone, so I can only compare them to those. I had never considered getting wireless headphones until I saw a guy using them on the machine next to me. Needless to say he had nothing but good to say about the very expensive brand he had. He said they eliminated the wire getting in the way problem while working out. I knew exactly what he was talking about, having recently broken my wired set by accidentally pulling the cable out at a weird angle. I decided to bite the bullet and was immediately hit by sticker shock. After doing my due diligence I found the highly rated SENSO headphones on Amazon. Not wanting to spend big bucks for the name on the product I decided to give them a shot.<br />After reading the manual I was able to quickly get them tied into my phone.<br />I tried all three earbuds deciding on the most comfortable set that also cut out the most background noise.<br /><br />Working out at the club is so much more enjoyable now that there are no wires in the way.<br />Sweat does not seem to adversely affect them, though my ears don't sweat all that much.<br />I can fully focus on what I am doing and not on &#34;are the wires in the way&#34;.<br />I decided to use them at work to cut out coworker noise and play some background music.<br />Again they worked like a charm. Due to acoustics in our office, I used to be able to hear coworkers more than 3 doors away, I don't hear them anymore.<br />I don't notice any difference in the sound quality between these and the wired units I used to use.<br />I can highly recommend SENSO headphones for anyone on a budget who wants to cut the cord.<br />I won't ever use wired ear buds again.<br />I am next going to see if I can get them to work with a Bluetooth adapter for my ham radio."
1,"The music sound quality is awesome, but phone calls are iffy. I sometimes have to have the phone near my face so they can hear me, regardless of the amount of charge they have. Again, random, but inconvenient."
1,Work great so far!!
1,I bought these headphones two months ago and I instantly fell in love with them.  They are great for working out and help to cancel out any outside noise.  I would use them everyday whether for work or for exercise.  Suddenly this past Friday my headphones wouldn't come on.  I thought maybe the battery died so I tried charging it but it still would not come on.  It sucks because this truly is a great product I just received a defective product.- Update to my previous post.  I contacted Senso and let them know of my problem.  They provided me with a solution to try to get my heaphones working again.  When that didn't work since it has not been a year since I purchased the headphones they agreed to send me another set. Just received my secondf set of headphones and I am ecstatic to use them again
1,These are very good earbuds. The sound is deep and rich. The earbuds are comfortable to have in for an extended period. I would definitely recommend to anyone to buy these.
1,Great fit. Would recommend.
1,Great sound and lots of bass. Easy to use. I like the added earplugs and chargers. Nice add on.
0,This was the 3rd pair I bought. The product quality has seriously gone down hill. Bluetooth range is about 2.5 feet. Battery life maybe 3 hours on standby. Takes a good 45 seconds to turn on or off. Sound quality is just above AM mono. Very sad because this used to be a superb product.
1,"Overall the sound quality is great on these headphones. The ear buds are comfortable and sit in your ears nicely. A lot of times this style of ear bud hurts my inner hear after about an hour of use. The only time they have slid out (but still stayed on my ear) was when I was running 3+ miles and it was easy enough to just adjust them back in. If you are a minimal sweater, you shouldn't have this problem, but I don't really see it as an issue. I sweat a decent amount when I work out and I haven't had any issues until today. ALSO - the magnet for your phone in the car air vent is INCREDIBLE. I know its just an added bonus but I love it and it works so well. I have had multiple people ask me about where I got it and when I said the headphones are great, they went on to buy them as well. You cant go wrong.<br /><br />UPDATE: I am a little disappointed. I bought these in May 2017 and they completely died on me today. That is less than a year of use (not every day, maybe 4 days/week) and I expected these to last longer than 10-11 months.<br /><br />I will be reaching out to the company to see if they will replace them due to the 1 year warranty period. Hoping customer service is prompt. If so, I will update my rating to full 5 stars because I DO think these are really good headphones, especially for the price.<br /><br />EDIT: Once I reached out to the company, they immediately responded allowing me to order a new pair at no cost. They stand by their product and provided excellent customer service. No complaints, will continue to order these and since my original purchase they have gone down in price to about $20. Incredible.<br /><br />Edit 10/2019: i still fully stand by this product. I am using the replacements still. I still think they are great value, I’ve bought them for family members and recommended to friends. I highly highly recommend these headphones. I also still LOVE the car magnet/holder. I use that everyday!"
1,"🌸Update July 12, 2020<br />I was not paid or compensated in anyway for this review.<br />I’m an ordinary customer.<br /><br />Updated review of Tekatron ...Senso Earbuds..<br />Comfortable, durable, excellent customer service and SUPERB sound quality!<br /><br />Affordable too!<br /><br />I like the fact that they’re hard to lose because they have a nice wraparound that hangs around my neck. I’ve never lost a pair.<br /><br />I’m hard of hearing and these are great earbuds!<br /><br />These are comfortable, durable, and excellent value and they don’t break easy. The customer service is absolutely fantastic!<br /><br />I’ve been ordering Senso (Tekatron) earbuds and over the ear headphones or over 3 years.<br /><br />I own about 6 - 9 pair of their earbuds (different styles) and a pair of over the headphones  by Tekatron and I am very pleased!<br /><br />Noise canceling is excellent.<br /><br />This time I ordered the BLUE Senso Bloothtooth earbuds and I already know this will be a fantastic product.<br /><br />Please, please, please always remember to register your product so that you can get a discount code to apply to your next purchase.<br /><br />Tekatron is very accommodating!<br /><br />Customer service is exceptional. A lot of people seem to be confused between the blue, red and black.<br /><br />Some have a soft case and some have a hard case etc.<br /><br />Seriously… I have not found any difference in the GREAT sound quality and the customer service is superb!<br /><br />I don’t like to talk on the phone with these earbuds or any earbuds.<br />I accidentally ended up on a phone call while I was listening to music on my phone.<br />The person on the other end could not even tell I was using a pair of earbuds!<br /><br />The customer service we reach 24 hours and there’s always a friendly voice on the phone.<br /><br />Now I’m starting to colorcode them.<br /><br />The older style I had the over the ear and it was not conforming to the ear.<br />(I think they discontinued those)<br />At one point they stopped working. Tekatron Replaced them within days!<br /><br />These earbuds arrive with little earpieces to fit your ear and other little gadgets that make life a little less complicated.<br /><br />I think this will make my 9th pair.<br /><br />Someone may ask ...why do you need so many pair of earbuds? Answer: My neighbor had a new baby. (Make sense?) And I use the different colors to colorcode them.<br /><br />Older review and still working fantastic....<br />Here is the Oder review...<br />I’ve ordered this product Senso earbuds for several years.<br /><br />I refer my friends also to this product as I find these ear buds to be of exceptional quality.<br /><br />The customer service is absolutely wonderful and accommodating.<br /><br />I don’t think I’d want to order another brand after working with this company.<br /><br />I wouldn’t consider these earbuds completely waterproof but they’re excellent for exercising or just listening around town or your home.<br /><br />These have a nice range of about 30 feet.  The sound quality is superb with excellent noise canceling.<br /><br />Not real fancy but they absolutely are my favorite earbuds. I will order again and refer others to this product. Thank you Amazon.com :-) 🌸"
1,Worked well for 3 months and then failed.  Invotek was very quick to respond and sent me a new pair.  Very satisfied!
0,These don’t work at all with phone calls. Can’t hear people and they can’t hear me.
1,I have only had the new Bluetooth Headphones for a couple of days.  So far I love them.  The sound quality is amazing.  I think they will be perfect for me.  Thank you for the email!
1,"I purchased these for my wife and she absolutely loves them. They stay put during her workouts and the sound quality is pretty darn good. I like the fact that there are no controls in the wire itself "" usually causing the wire to pull to one side"". I'll definitely be buying a pair for myself."
1,"...these are 5-star headphones. I did have to return one pair, but they refunded me completely in addition to giving me a discount code. For the price tag, I'm not sure you can beat these."
1,I really like them
1,Keeps falling out of my ear. It might just be me. Sound is good though.
1,My husband loves them! Great sound and comfortable.
1,"I'm not going to give a detailed review, others have done so and there isn't much to add.  These earbuds sound great, I honestly cannot hear the difference between these and Beats.  I am very happy with the purchase and performance, these earbuds are a fantastic value. I use these mostly with my ZTE Axon 7 phone which has an excellent DAC. Using these earbuds and the phone's Dolby Atmos software make for a great sound experience."
1,"The headphones were a good price and affordable, they are comfortable and play music well but only last about 3 months before they started sounding nasty. Maybe one of the speakers messed up. I will not buy again if they will continue to not work properly"
1,"I really like the ease of use of these earbuds. Pairs nicely with my phone.  Makes phone calls a breeze, workouts with favorite music easy. Sound quality is good considering the price.  I would recommend."
1,"I have been using the wireless headphones for a week now. I wear them when I go running in the morning, I wear them at the gym and I wear them around the house to block out the t.v. If I'm not interested in what my husband is watching. The quality is very durable, the range is as stated and comfortable to wear. I put my phone in my gym bag nearby and I sure don't miss the wires. I could not believe the quality of the product at such an affordable price. I was apprehensive when I ordered them and pleased I made the choice when I received them."
0,I liked the previous version of these. The mold-able ear support feel cheap and don't stay the molded position long.<br />The noise cancellation doesn't seem to be as good either.
1,"Bought these headphones to use both at the gym as well as to take conference calls on my cell phone.  The headphones worked great for both purposes, they fit comfortably.  Couldn't ask much more from a comparably priced headset.  The microphone was incredibly sensitive, which did lead to some feedback issues for those that I was talking to on the phone, but this was resolved by turning the volume down on the headphones.  The headphones worked great until recently, when they stopped pairing with my phone.  I contacted Senso as they were still within the 1 year warranty period, and after unsuccessfully trying to troubleshoot the problem, they sent me a new set.  I would definitely buy from this company again."
1,"These seem to be great so far. I bought them for my girlfriend to use, and she has said nothing but good things about them. They came with a lot of awesome accessories such as charging cable, hard carry case and additional ear cups for different sizing. She has said that they are very conformable and stay put during use."
1,"Excellent, especially for the price.  This is my second pair of these headphones (I lost the first) and my fifth pair of bluetooth headphones.  These are my favorites so far.  I was a little skeptical at first with having the battery and everything on the earpiece, the previous headphones it was spliced into the wire between the two earpieces.  But after trying it out that doesn't bother me at all.<br /><br />These are very comfortable for me and fit into my ears well.  I'm very impressed with the battery, they seem to actually last about as long a promised (most I've had lasted half as long or less than promised after about a week).  They are also pretty good about not draining the battery when they are on but I'm not playing any audio.  The sound quality is pretty solid compared to the others I've had.  They seem to be built fairly durable and the water resistance is nice, I don't dip them in water but they are bound to get a little wet from time to time.<br /><br />These also come with what looks to be a very nice charging cable and a good usb adapter car plug, which is a nice surprise when so many of the electronics I purchase these days come with cheaply made cord that doesn't last."
1,"This is going to be a bit of a strange review, because ultimately the headphones didn't work for me.  I was wanting to use them when I did yard work, but found with my phone in my pocket that at certain times contorting my body certain ways that the connection would drop off.  This may very well be the case with any bluetooth headphones, as this was my first attempt, but I really won't know until I try another brand.  However, the reason I'm giving 5 stars is because their customer service is first rate.  They tried to walk me through varies solutions for the problems I was having and when we couldn't make it work right, they took them back and even paid for the shipping!  I will say that for the price, the headphones sounded very good for both music and talking on the phone.  The bass is a little weak with heavy bass music, but that's to be expected for the price.  My situation my be a problem with application, not the headphones themselves, but if you're looking to try these, don't hesitate, there is really no risk to you at all."
1,Good sound Quality! Second set
1,Great sound and convenient to use.
0,"Headphones have multiple problems.  Within first two weeks of use, battery life has dropped to less than two hours, headphones sporadically un-synch from my phone, and the LED charging light stopped working.<br /><br />On the bright side, the Amazon return process was very easy to utilize."
1,Bought these for my husband who works out in the heat and near water all day and he loves them. He’s rough on them and they are still going strong ! Very clear sound and can’t beat the price.
1,Love these! Also I accidentally washed and dried them and much to my surprise they still worked!
1,"One problem is the built-in messages such as &#34;power on&#34; and &#34;power off&#34; are much too loud for me and I am hard of hearing. Otherwise, they work as expected"
1,"I purchased this item before for my son. So when he asked me to buy it again,  he said that earphone was good the best he has ever had."
1,It works
1,love these! the cord is out of my way when I am doing various things and it has decent battery life before I need to charge it again--easily lasts through 4 hours of mowing
0,"phone charger stopped working after one charge and the head phone quit working after 5 workout sessions.  they started out good and was hoping they would work.  they had good range, stayed in my ears while doing all my stretching and workouts"
1,Great product for an unbelievable price with exceptional service! What more can you  ask for?
1,These are great! I have been very satisfied with these so far :)
1,"Headphones are comfortable, easy to link, sound is good.  Had a problem with them (just plain died after 45 days) and their customer support was truly exceptional.  Heard back from them w/i a day with a fix to try; that fix didn't work and they put a new pair in the mail w/i the next day.  From my first email to support until i rec'd the new pair was 4 days; no hitches, easy communication.  Would absolutely recommend the company and the product."
1,"For the price, these are great bluetooth headphones that have everything you could want. Easy to set up and I look forward to using them every morning."
1,"These were good headphones while they lasted only a year, now on the market for new Bluetooth headphones, they did often static or the bass in the headphones would sound rattling and static , they would loose Bluetooth connection all the time, and no it was not the signal on my phone if it was fine pairing with my Fitbit and Apple watch had no problems only the headphones , then I charge them and try to use them and they would be totally dead that I would have to plug them back in the charger 😒 just a waste of time and headache !!"
1,My adult son's very pleased with these..can wear and easily hear others without removal. Fits ears with no irritation. Sound quality is very good. Very pleased with this stocking stuffer! Excellent buy!!
1,"So far my daughter likes these headphones and they are still working!  She tends to break headphones.  Very durable, good sound."
0,Se dano rapido
1,"Just tried these out this morning and love them! Great sound quality, easy to change the volume/songs/answer phone calls, etc. They also stay in really well."
1,Works great! You can wear for hours. I can hear using all type of equipment. I even had to turn down my phone.
0,It has a terrible sound. The base is horrible
1,Great product at great price!  Had a problem with wire and they replaced immediately with no hassles. Thank you
1,Love em.. last long and charge fast...
0,"I have no clue how well these work because the idiot that designed the cord put an incompatible charger on the outside. It apparently only works with an iPhone. Since I don't have an iPhone, I assumed it was the charger for the headphones so right out if the box I bent the prongs inside of the charging socket. Why in the world is there a charger that is not compatible with the headphones included in the box? Dumb design."
1,Absolutely love them!
1,This is the first time using a Bluetooth wireless headphones. Very good sound and not having to deal with a wire plugged into my iPhone. Also was nice to have additional size ear plugs.
1,Doesn't seem to link up well
1,For the price you can't beat these headphones. Comfortable with plenty of earpiece options. The case they come with is nice and seems like it will do a great job protecting them while not in use. They have really good sound quality with plenty of bass. Comparable to many more expensive options through popular name brand headphones.
1,These are awesome! They sound amazing and stay put even during hard workouts. I'm impressed and couldn't be happier.
1,"I bought these years ago and I am just now needing new ones. I always use them instead of my airpods because the sound quality, noise cancellation & noise leaking are way better. The battery also lasts a very long time. Definitely recommend."
1,great super wonderfulllllll
1,"Very convenient to use.  Wireless is the way to go,"
1,"I've used the headphones for a week, since I bought my new iphone.<br />The SENSO Headphones work great! I love the way it talks to me to let me<br />know that it is connected to my phone. I use it to listen to audiobooks when I<br />run/walk/exercise. I also love the price!<br />The only thing that I've noticed is that I can hear the wind. The sound of the wind<br />competes with the audio sound. I don't know if you can do anything about this.<br />I haven't had a chance to listen to music, so I don't know if the wind causes problems.<br />Anyway, I love your product."
1,Great sound and fit
1,they get broke easyly after few weeks
1,These are awesome!!! I looked into many brands at every price range and I am so happy I got these. These have great sound quality and lengthy battery life. I HIGHLY recommend and wouldbuy again.
0,"These headphones were awesome... at first. Five months later the right headphone has gone out. Something wrong with the wire b/c when I’m active it will cut in and out, same if I jiggle the wire a bit. Very frustrating I was really liking these"
1,"Bass is great but I have to use an equalizer to bring out the highs. Once I make the adjustment, they sound fantastic. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase!"
1,"They are pretty confortable, the sound for the price is great and the range is amazing"
1,Worked ok for 9 months least 3 months though the ear holders became useless and finally one day the on off by then just broke apart when I pushed. But id say they were ok ear buds for the price.
1,"For the Senso folks the design needs some work. While running the Bluetooth connection is erratic , and the earphones and ear hooks when you sweat wobble and then fall off or out of your ear.  You can't beat a molded earpiece but these earbuds are comfy. The sound is very good ,, I give that a 9 out of 10.  I just wish they would stay connected and in / on my ear"
1,"Sleek, easy to use headphones with good sound. The case and accessories were a welcome bonus. Overall, a great product that works well."
1,"Amazing sound quality and comfort. I was worried that it would feel uncomfortable, but not so. Great connectivity from my pocket as well. Glad they were on sale as well!"
1,"Awesome, sound quality is excellent."
0,"The sound quality is certainly not the best, ok for podcasts, but not for music. But even more annoying is the fact that sound cuts out constantly. For example, I'll have them connected to my iPad while reading. Every 20 seconds or so, the sound stops accompanied by little beeping sounds. And I quickly discovered that they cut out  completely when I leave the room where the connected device is. Truly disappointing. I've gone back to my trusty earbuds."
1,Great Product. Great Price.<br />Verified Purchase<br />I have been using these wireless headphones since  December 2017 while running in all sorts of weather and am very pleased with the quality and sound
1,"These are great earbuds. They have the best bass of any wireless units I have tried before and stay in place during rigorous physical activity. Excellent price, too!"
1,"Wanted to like it from all the great reviews, features, and price but had to return it.  It didn't fit my ear well and i had poor bluetooth reception but that could be due to using it on a moving machine like a bicycle.  Significant wind noise if on a bike, jet ski, bicycle, or anything moving above 5mph.  Sound quality was good with good bass response though."
1,Great value! These earbuds have a great sound and the quality of the materials are great. Very comfortable!
1,It's great product
0,"ONLY WORKED FOR 3 DAYS!!!!!<br />Received on 6/6.  Worked good from 6/7 to 6/9.  Now today if I move it sounds like a skipping CD.  It is not a connection issue.  Happening on WiFi and 4G.  If I shut the Bluetooth off on my phone, the speakers play just fine without any skipping.  I thought it may be my phone, but it does it with my phone set down and still and me moving with the ear buds in.  I synced to my wife's phone - same results.  I can use corded ear buds without any issues also.  I recharged thinking maybe the battery was low, even though I have not used them for 8 hours yet so it shouldn't be dead.  Just tried again - same issue. It does this with the phone in my pocket, holding the phone to me ear, and with the phone set down less that 3 feet from me.  If I move the ear buds skip.<br /><br />I emailed their customer service.  I'll see what the response it.  I could have purchased a similar set for $15 less.  Probably should have."
1,"These are great!!! Normally it is hard for gummy ear buds to stay in my ear because mine are so small, but the guy great. I wear these at work all day and then go to the gym afterwards. I have worn them on the elliptical and lifting weights in the gym. They never fall off which is amazing when you drag yourself to the gym and need music to keep you motivated. These are a great buy and battery life is great."
1,These are terrific for the price lots of extras definitely great quality I would highly recommend these!!
1,"These Senso Bluetooth Headphones out beat the wireless beats by Dre at a much lower price, no skipping or loss of signal while ur using them for your daily activities. Definitely recommend to anyone looking for ear buds."
0,"Love the sound quality, ease of use, and battery life. They do not seem to however last on bluetooth connectivity. I have purchased 3 pairs since they are cheaper than other options. If I wear a pair on my short walk to work during a sunny day I have no problems, especially if it is a brand new pair. If I wear a pair during a cloudy or rainy day, I will barely get more than music cutting out every half-a-second or worse. I do not know of many 4.2 bluetooth options as of now, but this was a good option for a very reasonable price, yet I do not think they have that all worked out yet."
0,terrible sound
1,Very happy with the sound quality and Bluetooth connectivity. They aren't the best for aggressive movement (Running/Jumping) as they don't stay in your ear very well.
1,Shipping was absolutely perfect! I got them in one-day at a very good price. The sounds quality is excellent and I love all the extra items in the box. Everything is great so far. Thanks!
1,"This is my first pair of bluetooth headphones and so far they work really well. I use them while running at working out. They stay in place unlike earbuds and not having the cord is super convenient. The range for the bluetooth connection isn't great but its enough to put the phone down while working out, just don't go to far from it. Overall I would recommend especially for the price."
1,Easy to begin using and decent sound.
1,Great pair of Bluetooth speakers
1,I struggled with bluetooth listening devices before this.  Either they would not pair or the pairing was unstable.  This Senso device is easy to pair and the pairing is absolutely stable.  Not only that but the sound quality is excellent and the quality of manufacture seems to be superior.  I like it so much I bought a second set for my wife.  Thank you
1,I am very happy with the performance of these headphones it’s my second set after I lost my first set thanks
1,"I have had these for about a month, I made the purchase after a second pair of much more expensive headphones stopped powering on.  All in all I think they are a good option, especially considering the price.  For what it is worth I use them with an IPhone6.  A few notes on my experience thus far.<br /><br />- Initial set up of the Bluetooth connection is easy as to be expected.  I pretty much use them every day and haven't had an issue with it connecting to the phone when I turn on the headphones.  I did occasionally have that issue with other headphones.<br /><br />- The controls are easy to use.  The power button is on the side of the right earphone, volume buttons are at the top of the same side.<br /><br />- The fit is okay, but not great.  I would like it if it felt more secure but I haven't experienced any huge issues with it falling out of my ears.  The piece that goes over the ear is a bendable not rigid - I think that probably contributes to the way it feels.<br /><br />- To me the sound quality is good, I honestly can not tell the difference between these and the more expensive ones that I had before.<br /><br />- The main drawback from my personal experience the overall loudness of the headphones.  I obviously don't know if it is something related to just this pair I have or if it is an issue with the Bluetooth connection to IPhones in general, but if I am in even a moderately quiet environment the headphones are loud even on the lowest possible volume setting.  I have to turn the equalizer settings in Spotify to the lowest level for it be comfortable for me to listen.  There is a workaround so it is okay, just a little frustrating at times.  I did not have this is issue with other Bluetooth headphones."
1,Very comfortable to wear as I can't stand ear buds.  I use these at work with my Iphone and they work really well.
1,"Love them, work well. My only complaint is very loud wind noise if it's windy out"
1,Why pay $150 when you get close to the same quality for $30 these headphones pair easily battery lasts a long time and good sound quality for the price!
1,Great value
1,Love these headphones.  Great for gym and work out.  Sound very good.
1,"Alright so I just recently returned a pair of &#34;truly wireless&#34; Bluetooth earbuds and based on the reviews I figured they'd be great. I was definitely wrong. They were horrible. So naturally I was hesitant to trust all the positive reviews I saw about these. But I decided to take a chance on them and I'm super glad I did. These earbuds are pretty much on par if not better than the power beats. And for the sale price, you're getting a whole more bang for your buck. The packaging was sleek and professional. The handbook wasn't written in Chinese and there were no grammar mistakes which if you use Amazon a lot to get bargain prices on products, you'll know that a Chinese hand book with sketchy English grammar isn't a good first sign or impression. You'll get a car charger with two different voltage usb connections and super cool 3ft charger cable that has the newer iPhone charge plug and the standard usb/Android charge plug. For those of you who have a Galaxy s8, you'll need an adapter for the Android end. You'll get a really sturdy carrying case that had a stylish foux carbon fiber skin, and inside you'll get several different eartips (including foam eartips which I thought was pretty cool) and the usb to charge your earset. The earbuds themselves are simplistic yet very stylish and comfortable. The only sort of annoying thing is that the hooks don't actually sit on your ear properly, or at least they don't for me. They sort of sit above my ears but with the eartips I'm not worried about them falling out. Also the hooks aren't some hard plastic like you'll get with most wireless sports earbuds. They're rubber and bend/contort to give you a very comfortable listening session. I haven't taken them to the gym yet and I will update once I know how well they sit in the ear and what other issues may arise. As for the sound, it's really really good for a pair of earsets this cheap. If you want a good starter set and don't wanna burn your wallet in the process, go for these. They're worth the hype and money."
1,Seems to be of good quality and a good product
1,These are incredibly cheap for the sound quality you get. They are also built incredibly durable.
0,"Even after re-charging, they aren't working. What should I do now?"
1,"I love these headphones.  I was very skeptical, but I took a leap and bought them. So glad I did. The sound is great and they fit well."
0,Loved these headphones at first but after a few months they started to produce an echo. Now I can only use them on conference calls or to listen to podcasts etc. when I don't need to talk. They are useless for phone calls.
1,"I bought these to use in the swimming pool, but they don't get as good a signal as when I'm poolside. I guess being lower in the water has something to do with this?  That being said the sound is good when working."
1,"Functional, practical. As expected. Prompt delivery."
1,"The sound has been great and they seem to work over a nice distance.  However, I did not give it 5 stars because even with the smallest buds, they are too big for my ears and therefore slightly uncomfortable (I don't think I will be able to wear them for long periods of time).  I have small ears and the ear hooks are too large and barely touch the back of my ears, but they seem to stay put despite this.<br /><br />Overall, they are great for the price and I would recommend them to anyone with normal sized ears!<br /><br />Update: they don't stay in my ears when I run :("
1,"So far so good.  These are comfortable, with excellent sound quality.  Very easy to pair,  but to all of you multitaskers,  only one device at a time. Battery life more than adequate and they warn you when getting low.  No worries though,  only takes an hour to charge back up."
0,Battery’s lasted approx 30 days then quit working. Would not even take a charge.
1,Good
1,"These headphones are a must-have in your arsenal of workout gear.  They stay on, the sound is crisp, and the battery power is long."
1,"Bang for the buck I couldn’t be happier. I’m an audio engineer and know these aren’t designed for pristine sound so I wasn’t disappointed. But with that said, they provide plenty of amplitude and the battery life is really good for the money. The right channel is a tad quieter than when they were brand new but I still really enjoy these. I’m a heavy sweater who lives in the south and I use them daily and after 5 months they’re still going strong. Would recommend."
1,"did not produce the bass it says it will.  returned product.  purchased the Senso Bluetooth Headphones, Wireless v4.1 Sports Sweatproof Workout Running Magnetic Earbuds Secure Fit Noise Cancelling Headset with Mic for Workout Gym Premium HD Sound Cordless Earphones<br /><br />much better in my opinion."
1,"Sound is about OK, not really good compare to apple headset. Got embarrassing when I'm in library listen to music and phone call is coming, get notification from headset and phone is ringing as well, cause attention from all people around.  NO need to ring the phone, but send notification to headset only. Anyway, headset is not secured well in my ears even with largest ear buds provided. Will ask for return.."
0,I received these headphones as a Christmas gift.  Loved them at first as sound was great and they worked well for me at the gym. Now very disappointed just over a month later they have quit working  completely.
1,Great buy. Sound quality is good as is battery life. Equalizer is needed though for best sound quality.
1,My Husband is pleased. There perfect for work!
1,Work great but ears hurt fairly quick b
1,Purchased in feb abs one of the ears already stopped playing music. But the sound was good until now. May still buy another pair.
1,Fit is very good. Sound good for the price.
1,I bought these for my wife and she works out daily. She absolutely loves them.
1,Bluetooth is nice. They are a bit bigger than I had hoped for but the Bluetooth makes up for that. They are hard to hear through if it's a windy day.
1,My wife likes her set when working around the house.  She liked my set and finds not needing the corded ear buds much easier to use
1,Didn't know what to expect but these bluetooth headphones are awesome. Plenty loud enough for a 60 year old half deaf musician and great sound quality even compared to my $400 dollar stage wired headohones. Ordered another pair.
1,"So far, I'm very excited and happy with the headphones. I've only used them once, and they worked well. I hope I have better luck with this brand than I had with another brand."
1,I just tried the new headphones on an outdoor walk and am very pleased. They fit in your ears very comfortably and stay in place very well. The sound quality is good and there is no cutting out like so many wireless earphones.  I will be ordering another pair for my husband!
0,I was disappointed with the sound. The real low and high frequencies were not there. I didn't care for them much and am using something else to listen to my music.
1,Great quality and fair price. Work great and have been using them for more than now. Great battery life and comfortable fit.
1,Easy to set up and comfortable to wear. They feel real secure which was a problem with other headphones. Prompt delivery and follow up after. Would recommend seller to anyone buying.
1,"I purchased a set as a gift to my granddaughter. She raved about them so much, I ordered a pair for myself. I have severe high frequency loss, somehow the headphones work so well musical sounds are so rich in tone. I watched a video in which I could clearly hear everything being said. The headphones are comfortable, and simple to use. Thank you Senso for making a great product."
1,"Nice product but, I have very small ears and ear canals. Was not able to get a proper fit and they fell off and out of my ear, very uncomfortable. Am returning the product."
1,I really really like these headphones. I knew nothing about them before but i am so glad i made the purchase. Small item that packs a a big quality sound!
1,"They look great, they sound great and very affordable pricing."
1,"My second set of Sensos! My son stole my other set and went to the beach for the summer. They connect so easily and wear very comfortably, hold a charge a long time. I use them to prepare for vocal concerts while driving and in other ways. Very happy with this product."
1,"The good:  Audio quality is very good and volume is much better than my BlueAnt headset.  Case is nice and it's a nice touch that a car charger plug is included.  The not as good:  Cord between earbuds seems not as strong as my BlueAnt and it gets hung up on clothing.  Instructions state I shouldn't have earbuds plugged in overnight as battery can suffer, so that's kind of a pain.  When wearing in shower, volume gets very low."
1,I haven't really put it to use yet. I mostly listen to music when working on jobs. I listen to a few tunes while working in my office it sounds great!!
1,Very nice headphones. Fit in my ear nicely and stays in. Charges quickly and keeps charge for a few days.
0,I’m not a huge fan of these the sound is poor and crackling and the left ear doesn’t work well on the set I got.. I’m highly disappointed 😞 also they are not comfortable either
1,Great headphones. Worth the price
1,These headphones are great
1,"Works great, but the range is less than the description says.  I don't mind, seeing as how I always have my phone on me, but it might bother other people.  However, they're comfortable, sound great, and most importantly, stay on when running."
1,Love it
1,"Nice earbuds, they fit really nicely and stay in the ears.  I think the sound is good for someone who doesn't have to obsess with an equalizer for their music. I hope they last a long time."
1,"I like them, they connect easily, good sound"
1,"SO Far:  SO GOOD!!! This is the first headphone set that has worked with the Bluetooth throughout a workout! The audio quality is terrific and the headset is comfortable. The packaging is also very well thought out and the headphones come in a little case with chargers, cables and earbuds of varying sizes. This is my third attempt at a pair of wireless headphones and these are by leaps and bounds the best thus far!"
1,"These earbuds are terrific. Exactly what I wanted, and I'm glad I read so many reviews. They fit well, and are easy to set up and use."
0,"I purchased the Senso bluetooth headphones several months ago in anticipation of using them on a recent vacation.  Charged the headphones and paired them to my iphone without difficulty.  Worked fine for approximately 2 weeks.  Recharged the headphones for several hours, blue light on the side of the headphones indicated an adequate charge, disconnected the device from the charger, pressed the &#34;on&#34; button and it did not respond.  Typically a flashing blue and red light would indicate that the headphones were powered on, but this did not occur.  With the headphones attached to the charger, the flashing blue and red light would go on, but cease when disconnected from the charger.  I suspect that the internal headphone battery no longer holds a charge.  I performed a hard reset by holding the on button down for 7-10 seconds while it was plugged in to the charger and without the charger.  No change.  Would have been a favorable review based on the first 2 weeks of use."
1,Sound good.  Stopped charging/working after 10 months and customer service was great about replacing them.
1,Love the product. Reasonably priced.
1,best headphones in this price point by far.  Several options of buds provided that block out most ambient noise.  Battery lasts forever.
1,"&#34;Good sound quality, and nice style. Charges very quickly.&#34;"
0,"Music sound is ok, not great. You can hear huge difference listening music with iphone 7 speakers and this headphones, though if not comparing the sound is fine, depends what you are looking for.  But it is horrible for making calls, people could hardly hear me, while I am in an empty apartment. Can only imagine what would have happened if I called from the street. Tested on calls too late, cannot return now :("
1,"I was surprised to find that the silicon ear hooks are ONLY made of silicon, very floppy and loose.  I expected them to be useless compared to the older earbuds I had with a wire-like, form-able ear hook, because on those I could pinch the hook to fit my ear and they held nicely.  But, I was also surprised to find that once I put the correct size ear piece on these, they stayed in place very well.  The floppy silicon hook offers just enough stability, I guess, to make it work, and no more pinched ears!  The true test will be after a few miles of running, which I've not done, yet, but initial trials seem to say these will work just fine.  Oh, and sound?  They sound great for the price!"
1,Wonderful headphones. So happy with them I bought my wife a set.
1,Awesome quality and decent looking ear buds.
1,I had been using inexpensive corded earbuds. They were always falling out of my ears and the cord would inevitably get caught on something. These earbuds are great. Sound a whole lot better than my old ones. Highly recommended.
1,As described
1,This is my seconded time buying these. I lost my first pair and am happy to reorder them. They are great quality at a great price. The only thing I might comment on is that the band that wraps around the ear is a little large. I’ve bent mine to form them a little better to my ear.
1,"Amazing value, the cords alone and attachment accessories, sound quality, comfort, great item. Going to order more for friends."
1,"The reviews are all over the place, but let me put you at ease by saying these are very functional, have great sound quality (noticeably good bass), feel good around the ear, have an above average phone mic, and are made with quality materials. For the money, they are a deal! TT"
1,My youngest son “borrowed” my moderately expensive (over $200:00) headphones so I went on the hunt for a less expensive replacement.  I read the reviews on the Senso’s and figured for the price these were worth a shot.  Safe to say that the positive reviews on these headphones are accurate.  The tone quality is excellent.  They’re easy to pair and comfortable to wear.  I will not miss my old bulkier headphones.  Thank you Senso.
1,"The item came with a handy carrying case and all the accessories. Instructions were easy to follow, and its been outstanding for the price so far."
0,The bass sounds terrible and these aren’t very comfortable. At least they were inexpensive...
0,"Im very disappointed with this product i cant tell you if its the one that i got or just in general but the sound was terrible because of the bass it was the cause of this rating and review, it so overwhelming and a bad kind of overwhelming (my father said so too). The headphones themselves  look like knock off beats (i wasnt the one who bought them it was my dads but i tried them). Over all we were disappointed and am going to return them.<br /><br />Besides the base and looks of them the  accessories were a very nice add on and are very great."
0,The left ear bud didn't work.
1,Finally a pair that stays in your ears when you run
1,"They're working great.  I just wish I had a better fit in the ear, maybe a smaller bit.  I believe I got my money's worth."
1,Good sound. Can be a little staticy. Battery works pretty long into the day. I do not like the hangers for the ears. They are rubber and hard to get and stay on.
1,Good product and a good price.
0,My wife ordered these for me and they worked well for the first 2 weeks. But now when I'm working out I hear an occasional static in the middle of the song. Not to happy about that. I'm going to contact the seller to see what is going on
1,These are great! The sound is perfect and calls are clear.
1,"Love them. Amazing quality for the price. Easy set- up. I run 2-3 days a week and the quality of the sound is good, noise reduction works well. They provide many extra accessories that's stored in great a case... overall I am extremely pleased"
1,I bought these mostly to listen to podcasts while walking- they are just fine for that application.
0,When they work they are amazing. After the first charge the charge time reduced significantly. After the third charge it stopped working completely. For the price and reviews I expected more.  The base was super high on it. Don’t expect to listen to anything with treble.
1,You absolutely can't beat these for the price . So far the best I've bought . Sound quality is excellent. I'm a distance runner and these have yet to die on me . Came with carrying case and different ear buds for your choice !
1,They come with a nice case and extra accessories.  These only lasted two months.  Longer than other headphones of this type that I've had.  Worked well while I had them.  I've come to the conclusion that these type of headphones don't last long I have been through about four pairs.  They just quit working and don't turn on.  I'm going to look for  some earmuffs Bluetooth headphones that might be a little more durable.
0,Great headphones for about 6 months until the little metal disc inside the power button breaks off and leaves them useless...also the cord is a bit of a pain in the a$$ it likes to shift completely from one side to the other. 🤔
1,"Great sound, the wires adjust but have broken internally after a month of use. I will probably go wireless on my next pair."
0,Haven’t had them long and they won’t take a charge. :/
1,"These headphones work well with my iPhone 6.  Easy to pair and great connection reliability.<br /><br />However, I purchased an Apple Watch 3 (GPS + cellular) and these headphones do not reliably deliver sound.  The watch in on my left wrist and it must be too far away from the headphones (I have long arms - 38 sleeve).  The sound goes in and out as I walk or run, but the sound is consistent if I hold the watch near my face.  This is unacceptable for me since I one of the reasons for purchasing an Apple Watch 3 was to be able to run without carrying my phone."
1,Total quality! Love the foam plugs because I have sensitive ears.  Great sound. Quick to charge.
0,Bad product don’t last very long sound is bad money wasted
1,Great sound and easy to connect.
1,I bought this headphone for a second time since I have lost my first one recently.  The quality of this product is degraded comparing to the first one.  The very short charging cable came with the box has a wrong connector type but luckily I still have to first charging cable so it not an issue but it would be for you if you did not have the correct charging cable.  The blue LED light on the headphone to indicate the full charged battery is not working.  The LED turn from Red (charging) to no light indicator.  Luckily I have sync the headphone to my phone so I can see the headphone battery full on my phone.  I will try a different product the next time.
1,Best Headset hands down
1,"I have owned these for over a month, and have taken them for runs and they work great. My biggest concern was whether they would slide off my ear and they do not. They are light weight, and good quality. The only thing I feel when running with them is the good sound. Easy to set up; easy to use; just great.<br /><br />Another great thing is the case: it is of hard material and compact, which helps with storage so they don't tangle and break."
1,They work great
1,So far so good. Great sound. Seems to hold battery strength. Much better experience than my previous sports headphones. Very comfortable too.<br /><br />I just ordered a second pair for my wife.
1,So far so good sound is great stays in when working out
1,Good workout ear buds. However there is a constant soft buzz/humming whenever listening to audio.
1,A great device!
1,"What really matters? Audio!! and that is a 5 star for me.<br />Improvements? Yes.<br />The package in the box is sort of overstuffed. I'd prefer a more organized packing.<br />The Senso Pouch is OK The zipper is sort of a hassle and I'd prefer a clip or velcro instead, although the zipper is more secure.<br />The controls in the earphones need some learning to do and you'll be OK.<br />The instruction and troubleshooting booklet needs a rewrite to make it somehow more informative for not so savvy customers (my case) The R vs L sign should be made more conspicuous or visible."
1,Awesome headphones.  Especially for the price.
0,"If you encounter any wind at all, these headphones are not great.  Wind sounds are amplified by the shape of the ear buds, making it extremely difficult to enjoy your music.  I really can't run outdoors with these headphones unless there is absolutely no wind.  Definitely wouldn't recommend using them while on a bicycle for the same reason.<br /><br />I think senso makes other models with a smaller form factor, which may be better for outdoor use."
1,Gave this to my daughter for Christmas.  She is excited to try them out at the gym.
1,"I used the earphones for about 6hrs straight listening a number of different types of music, some talk, and about 5 pod casts.  Sound quality is really good.  All the use was outside.  Although only mildly windy there was no perceptible noise picked up by the earphones.  With the buds firmly is place all outside sounds are eliminated.  My wife tried shoutin at me with my back turned.  Did not hear anything but the music.  The build quality and materials is first rate.  Finally, what is included in the box is more than I expected (i.e. multiple charging cable,ear pieces and a car charger).  I purchased with a substantial discount which made these a tremendous value, as well."
1,These are a much better alternative to spending hundreds on &#34;name brand&#34; products. Sound great and easy to set up.
1,Great product!
1,"Booming sound quality and a so perfect for running.  They can be a little sensitive to the touch and for go a bit too far into my ears.  Otherwise, they get the job done,"
1,"Sound quality is really good.snd they're  Easy to use. I use in the gym and the reception was good. I have a little trouble fitting them into my ears but because they also go around my ear, they never fell out. I noticed they have different buds that I can try, so I'm sure that with a switch they'll be a great fit."
1,"I've only used this pair twice so far while running since I just received them. Comfortable fit, good sound. A little noisy with the wind, but I switched the earbud piece to a slightly larger one and will see if that helps with the wind.  I recommend these headphones for running/jogging/walking."
1,"Had these for a while and they stopped working/charging. I reached out to Senso directly. They got back to me right away with troubleshooting tips. When that did not work, the shipped out a new pair of headphones right always"
1,"Easy to use and good sound. I have been looking for a pair of Bluetooth earbuds for the gym and these are perfect for me. I haven’t explored all the features yet, but so far I am satisfied with my purchase. They even came with a couple of cool free gifts!"
1,I just got them and hands down are the best headphones I've gotten I've had jaybirds jlabs beats skull candy and these are way better for the price and the fact that the company emailed me asking how did I like them they just gained a lifetime customer
1,"I've only used it once Walmart in the yard. I think they were great, stayed in my ears, great volume."
1,This is my second order of the exact wireless earbuds.  I needed a second set so I could leave one at work and have the others at home.  The sound quality and battery life are quite good... much better than one would expect for the price.
1,Love the battery life. About 8 hours is what I am getting.  I like how comfortable they are. They stay put and do not easily shake loose. Overall &#34;nice&#34;
1,"Customer service was kind enough to provide follow email.<br />The product arrived earlier than expected.<br />Overalll, great price for the items provided. (2 charging cord, car charger, case, extra buds, etc.)<br />Item is definitely well done and charged when received.<br />Sound quality is definitely above average and the battery lasts a long time."
1,Nice clear sound and pairs and connects super easy.  These easily will fit in a pocket or the palm of your hand so they're flexible and soft. The only complaint I have is I wish I could adjust the part that hooks over the ears.  I have small ears so the distance between the hook and the earbuds is a bit too long for my ears.
1,I am amazed at the quality of the sound for the price. Definitely better than what came with my iPad and phone. More comfortable as well.  Love not being teathered.
1,The sound is very good and so many accessories! I recommend you test these first.
1,Great headphones for jogging.
1,Love the wireless feature. Great but on deal dash
1,This sport bluetooth is great the Bass is like listening to 15 inch speakers in your car and the sound is great.  When you are at the gym or exercising you will block out background noise so you can focus on your exercise goal ☆
1,"I just used these headphones at the gym for the first time today and I am absolutely blown away.  For the prize, these are an EXCELLENT pair of headphones.  The fact that I don't need to fiddle around with headphone cords is a huge plus when I'm weightlifting and running.  The sound quality are awesome and I love the volume features on the right side that make it super easy to adjust.  Overall these are such a bang for your buck!"
1,Yeah! First pair of headphones that stay in my ears when working out.
1,"For the money, these things are great. I sweat a lot so I never expect my headphones to last too long but, when these go, I'll be buying another pair. They stay connected to my iPhone 8 very well. The connect is almost immediate at start-up. The bass is outstanding and the clarity of other frequencies is excellent as well. The phone calls are clear to the folks on the other end. (I always check this when I get a new pair of headphones.) This is a great product."
1,These are excellent reasonably priced headphones that function with great sound quality for just listening and for telephone calls!  Love these headphones!
1,"So far, I haven't had any issues. They work great."
1,Minden nagyon jó.
1,"had issue with one of the headphone and stopped working, I contacted the seller and after few email back, I received new one since it was on 1 year warranty. The headphone is really good though. recommend everyone."
1,"Very reasonably priced, good sounding, easy to connect and use, comfortable headphones"
1,"Good product, lots of useful accessaries. I recommend it to my friend, and help her buy one more.I would say it is a good experience to use it."
1,"Meh...everything is just - ok. The buds don't fit in my ears well, even with the smallest inserts. The part that goes over the ear doesn't do much to keep the headphones in place either. This could all just be due to my ear shape - I have small ears but they stick out like little satellites (think Will Smith with long hair). The sound is ok, nothing special. I can hear a lot of background noise with these on but this may be related to the fit. The battery life is pretty good though. I've worn them for about an hour a day for 5 days and they still show 1/4 battery life remaining. I was looking for Bluetooth headphones that I could wear while running and have them stay in place. These are not them."
1,I like this.it is my 3rd wireless earphone. I do not know can i use more than 1year. I could use 1year with privious one.
0,They no longer hold their charge after being used 4 times at the gym and sweating.
1,"Have purchased 4 pair.  Love the sound quality, for a reasonable price."
1,Comfortable headphones. Excellent accessories accompany the headphones. The headphones hold about a 3 hour charge.
1,These are awesome for the price! Highly recommend
1,"I've owned several pair of wireless bluetooth earbuds and these rate right up there with best of them at a much cheaper price. The sound is quite good and they are fairly comfortable. I don't use them for exercising, so I can't comment on how well the ear loops work on keeping them in place during vigorous activity, but they seem to stay put pretty well when I'm just moving about the house.  I had a bit of trouble pairing them with the two devices I connected with so far, but with some persistence I succeeded eventually. So, if you but these and have a similar problem keep trying and if you are like me you'll finally succeed. Once I did make the successful pairing they have connected flawlessly ever since. I would recommend them to my friends who are in the market for wireless earbuds.  I can't comment yet on how long the battery charge lasts because I've only used them for a few hours, but so far they have lasted at least 3 - 4 hours on the initial charge.  Failing batteries (which aren't replaceable) after just two years is what caused me to replace my last set of wireless earbuds (another company)."
1,"Fantastic buds! Quality product and for the price I was able to score them at, I couldn't ask for a better sounding set!"
1,Ease of use...good volume very comfortable fit
1,"Just received these today, and they paired easily and work well.  Also received an email with service phone number and one year warranty information.  The phones come with a carrying case, a car charger, usb cable, mini usb/apple lightning compatible cable, extra ear tips (3 pair), and more plus clear instructions.  Excellent sound quality too.  What's not to like?"
0,"The earphones are comfortable, the battery life is as advertised, the sound is amazing, and I really liked the voice prompts when connecting/disconnecting.<br /><br />However, they suffer from a major design flaw, and I've sent them back.<br />When I'm on conference calls, the microphone - which is located right next to the earbud - picks the sound coming out of the earbud, resulting in a feedback loop, and ultimately an echo for all other participants.<br /><br />I've been on 3 separate conference calls, and the issue is very noticeable in the following scenario:<br />- I'm not muted and not talking<br />- Two (or more) other people on the call are having a conversation.<br /><br />In this scenario, everyone hears an echo until I mute my line.<br /><br />Too bad. I was really excited about these earphones."
1,"I'm a bit of an audiophile and a former hip hop producer, and while I did enjoy the deep bass, the treble just isn't there. I EQ'd while connected to my phone and computer and could never balance things out properly. The bass is so intense that it really muffles anything on the rest of the spectrum. I bought these so that I could listen to music and take a phone call as needed while at the office, but the mic quality is awful. I attempted to make a couple phone calls in my office at work and my home office and the audio was so poor that using them for calls simply wasn't an option. I returned them and purchased a similar item.<br /><br />The positives: they have great battery life. Although I didn't use them for long phone calls, I did listen to music on them for 7+ hours a day and found that the battery life on them was around 9 hours, which was more than I expected. They charge quick and are easy to use. The additional accessories were really nice to have, so I'm disappointed that I had to send them back."
1,My son loves them! he said they were comfortable and sounded great! Thanks so much for the quick delivery!
1,"I bought these because I liked the price, and read some reviews about them. Going from Beats to these - I miss my beats . The sound quality isn’t the best . When I try to sync with Bluetooth sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. The volume can’t just be low, it will just go off. They aren’t the most comfortable in my ear . I was hoping for the best , but was really disappointed."
1,"Comfortable fit, and  buttons are easily accessible while wearing.  Sounds amazing and stays in place during my entire workout and 5 miles jog."
1,These sound really good and pair up easy. I like how functional they have made the buttons and the accessories that comes with them is a nice bonus.
0,Owned less than a year and they just stopped working
1,"The headphones are pretty nice, a sleek design that you can put away and take anywhere. However, If you wear glasses like me then you might have to mitch and match earbud sizes so that one side doesn't back out of your ear if you so happen to have one irregular ear shape. The dual ported car charger is nice as well, I haven't run using it on the headphones just yet, but I have used it to charge my cell phone and tablet with little to no problem whatsoever.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Very long lasting battery life.<br />-Pretty darn loud, I can only listen to them at half volume which also helps save battery usage.<br />-Comes with nice accessories that are multifunction and can be used on other devices.<br />-A great carrying case that helps protect your headphones if you need to store them in a safe place, I normally just toss them in and put the case in my pocket.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-If you are using this on a certain android device like an Amazon Fire tablet then you should be sure to download an app called Bluetooth Connect and Play, you will need to assign the headset to control your preferred music app since the headphones have an issue with starting the pre-installed basic music program on your device by default everytime you pause and start tracks. Which is very annoying when you have to take your phone or tablet out just to restart your preferred player."
1,&#34;Great headphones! They completely block out the sound around me. They just took a while to get my order shipped. :( Worth the wait though!&#34;
1,"pretty good. Not excellent, but good for the price. little bulky."
1,"At the sound that these tiny earbuds play the sleek design and the cheap deal this is basically a steal, it's absolutely worth it if you plan on using these on a workout or to listen to at home"
1,I actually haven't used these yet since they are a Christmas gift.  But they seem like very good quality they're packaged very nice and the package is heavy and sturdy! I can definitely tell they're not cheaply made. Ive read nothing but good reviews on these so i know they will be great!
0,"Sadly, they don't fit. They're not adjustable, nor do of the buds fit in my ear. I took their email advice and purchased memory foam buds. Sadly, they were a waste of money, because the earphones still don't fit. May want to check out another brand if you're a member of the small ear gang."
1,"Color me pleasantly surprised. I needed something for an overseas trip coming up, and this is even better than hoped for. Great call quality, too, which wasn't even a feature on my wish list (will be using it for power walking in the mornings, when everyone back home in the U.S. is asleep)."
1,"These are great! I was hesitant to purchase them just due to not knowing what to expect, but the pair I received are amazing. The sound quality is great and I only have to charge them maybe once every couple of weeks- and that’s with gym visits! They stay in my ears and I rarely have to adjust them."
1,"Listen to audio books, works great unless I am running the vacuum, then it doesn’t quite muffle all the vacuum noise."
1,"I use these for my long runs and whenever I'm working outside so I can hear my phone if/when it rings.  I have used these in the past and they have a long life.  I only replace them when one of the ear buds stop working but I probably get a full year out of them before that happens.  For the price, you can't beat that."
1,Awesome headphones great replacement for the beats headset.
1,"I lost my original pair of these headphones. I LOVED them. I went ahead and just got another pair but for some reason, these just aren’t as good. They don’t loop around my ears as well for some reason. Otherwise, same good quality audio and I like that the battery lasts FOREVER."
0,I really liked this product while it worked. I have been using it for less than 2 months and they won't turn on any more. I'll try to make use of the warranty.
1,Good product so far. No static or bluetooth disconnect. 100% would recommend.
1,"I was searching for a pair of headphones that I could use at the gym which would have a fairly decent sound quality but also a good microphone for taking calls. After doing a lot of research, the Senso headphones and their thousands of good reviews caught my attention and I said to give them a shoot. I was not disappointed at all: the quality of the materials is very good, the sound quality above expectations and so far the microphone does the job.<br /><br />Everything from the packing, to the extras in the box and the headphones themselves show a lot of care for the customer and attention towards a quality product! I can only join the other happy customers and totally recommend this product."
1,I love these. I previously wrote a review. Sorry to say it but these are better than Beats. Both the sound and the fit. These are the best way to go. I own a swimming pool service company so I bought more of these for my guys and they love them. Seller was also great. As of this review this seller had them for the cheapest price so I bought them. Great product and great selling experience
0,Product ear covers were sent slightly bent and would not stay on my ears. I dont recommend these for people with smaller ears.
0,"Although, the sound was good while they lasted my senso headphones suddenly stopped charging. I tried different placements to make the earphones charge but no luck. Also, the year warranty is not honored. I have attempted to request for a replacement pair due to this problem but customer service is no longer accessible. False advertisement at it's finest. I understand if you cannot replace a damaged item but do not promote 1 YEAR WARRANTY if you do not honor it."
0,"First Of all,<br />Whats Good.<br />Its sound is good , and battery life is good<br />Whats Bad :<br />Noise reduction in Calls ,, Al most Zero noise reduction.<br />The button that increase and decrease the sound was working at the beginning but now after almost 2 weeks of use they are not working .<br />The main Button by clicking it one time it suppose to stop the video or the sound track , now this function is not working."
0,"When I buy headphones, for work or play, I want good quality sound.  Historically, I've bought Sennheiser and Klipsch ear buds and those are amazing!  After breaking up plugs and wires I thought I'd take a shot at Bluetooth earbuds.  The reviews sounded good and the cost was such that if I hated them or broke them then I wouldn't be disappointed.<br /><br />The UPS guy dropped them by, I charged them up, and then synced them with my iphone.  And sure enough:  they sound like music made from a cardboard box: flat, lifeless, and no range.  AARRGGHH!! I played with the EQ for a while and the sound may have gotten slightly better.  But seriously, it's like lipstick on a pig: the sound still sucked. Bluetooth isn't really made for music but these just add further insult.  I'm back to wired earbuds.  I consider this experiment to be a failure."
1,"Sound quality of these headphones is great.  I was genuinely surprised for the price at the overall quality.  The only thing that I still struggle with and it is not really for the fault of the headset is that despite getting several ear pieces I still do not get a good tight fit.  The ear loops definitely help keep them in place when working out, but I just can't get them to fit well in my ears."
1,"Good sound quality,  comfortable"
1,"I wanted a bluetooth earphones set for sometime and I bought Senso because of the reviews and cost.<br />I was not disappointed. The earphones last for a while and I like how they block out the noise around me.<br />The only downside was that the earphones stopped connecting in Nov. 2018. I contacted the company<br />and they sent me a new one. I don't know why the old ones stopped, but I've very happy with the<br />product and service."
0,Broke after two months. Would not turn on when charged.
1,Well done Senso
1,Easy to install
1,"I was using 2.4ghz wifi settings before I got these... the signal interference was ridiculous! Every time my iPhone would connect to the wifi, the earbuds cut in and out without regard to distance. After swapping to the 5ghz wifi settings, no issues.<br />Battery life is fantastic and they have a great sound. But they are very loud"
1,"Muy buenos auriculares, buena calidad de sonido, buen tiempo de carga."
0,"I mean, these aren't that expensive, but it just fell apart about 3 weeks after the return window closed."
1,"Perfect for working out. I used them when I run and they stay put. Plus the battery run time seems to be very good as well. They are light and pretty comfortable. One thing to note is they come with interchangeable rubber tips so you can adjust as needed which is nice. Also, another added bonus is the USB car charger (which has two USB ports). Sound quality is okay (not a lot of deep rich sounds) but my primary concern was comfort and ability to stay in my ears while running/working out. Perfect price point for these."
1,Was going to get Beats or Bose but couldn’t bring myself to pay that much so took a chance on these and glad I did! The sound quality is great and they stay put in your ears. Highly recommend.
1,"Unfortunately, after only a few weeks of use, these headphones have stopped working. The left side cuts in and out. However, the seller offered me tips to get them working again. When those things didn't work, the headphones were replaced. Great customer service."
1,Have not had the item long enough to really give a detailed report but so far they are working fantastic. Pairing with my Galaxy phone was very easy and very quick. They are very easy to use and a very comfortable on my ears and the sound quality is excellent.
1,Sound quality is great.  Reviews speak for themselves.. would recommend.
1,OK for the price. The sound is good but there is an intermittent drop in signal that only lasts for a second or so. Battery life is very good.
1,absolutely the best Bluetooth i ever bought .. sound great laud and clear .. love it
1,really great sounding ear buds with plenty of bass response.. comfortable with flexible ear grips and options for ear bud sizes...comes with bonus material including magnetic car vent mount and wallet card (not sure how that works tho?)<br />highly recommended esp at price
1,"I’ve had three pairs of these now.  Each stopped holding a charge at about the six month mark.  Unfortunately, there was almost no indication the failure was coming, so they’ve died on me out on a long run (while traveling no less) and in the middle of workouts each time.  Obviously, I’ve kept buying them.  At the price, it was a bit simpler to just get another pair vs. taking a chance on a set multiple times the price with questionable reliability.  However, the third pair is my last – time to give something else a shot.<br /><br />In fairness, for a little over $20, quickly shipped to your door, you get a decently usable set of headphones and a useful magnet mount phone accessory.  For what it is, it’s crazy cheap.  But with that, it will eventually fail on you.  Just know what you are getting and have some kind of backup (e.g. wired headphones)."
0,"Bought in January...broke completely in May. Put on charger, everything was usual and when I came back to get them they wouldn't turn on.  4-5 months of little use.... Should have just sunk the Money into decent headphones."
1,"Compared to the other expensive sets out there , this one is fabulous! for 35 bucks this thing is a steal.. It has been a week since i have started using this... save  your money buying beats or the other expensive one from Bose...."
0,"I did hours of research before I bought these headphones and am so disappointed! The good aspects are that they were comfortable on my ears and didn't fall out. The other good is the company was very responsive when I emailed my problems, The problems? Reception deteriorated when I was 10 feet away from my phone but in the same room. Controls very difficult to feel and to use. Charging port didn't work. No way to tell how much charge is left.  No mute function. Noise cancelling very limited. I ended up returning them and buying LG Tone Pro 770, which is an &#34;around the neck&#34; bluetooth set up, great to use, just $5 more than Senso."
1,"Bought for my 22 year old son for Christmas...he LOVES these headphones!  I wasn't sure what to order for Bluetooth iPhone 7 compatable headphones, my son's review is 5 star!"
0,These worked great for me when I was sitting at my desk and tried them out initially.  When I got a chance to use them for a daily walk I ran into all kinds of dropouts and choppiness.  I have a Samgung Note 5 and play music with Spotify and use the Zombie's Run to motivate my exercise.  These headphones stutter and drop out constantly.  I thought it was a bad network connection so I turned off my wireless  and that didn't help at all<br />When I plug in wired headphones everything is OK.<br /><br />I wish I had found this out before the return-period had passed.  Now I'm stuck with them.  Glad I bought them on sale.
1,Works great. They are eassy to use
1,"The Sense bluetooth headphones are great. Delivery was quick, easy to connect, fit well and the sound is very good."
1,"I think you could use a smaller box to ship them in but other than that nothing else is wrong. It came pre charged and the user guide was simple enough to read. So far these are the loudest earbuds I've bought and I love it! The sound is clear, the fit comfortably and they come with charging cables which is awesome! Though I'm writing a review the same day I got them so in about a month or two or if I spot a malfunction with them I will review them again but I'll talk to the company first if they malfunction."
1,I've had a hard time finding a pair of headphones that don't fall out while I'm working.  These fit snugly (after putting a smaller earpiece) into my ear and the best part is the way you can mold the piece that goes over your ear to fit firmly.  They can be a little troublesome to get on but once they are on they work great! Getting a second pair for my husband who works in construction
1,"I've tried several bluetooth headphones, these are my faves for any type of cardio. Lightweight, dependable, super simple intuitive controls, long (enough) play time per battery charge, and truly sweatproof. The &#34;over the ear&#34; loops are flexible and rubbery - if you're like me, and wear a headband as well as glasses, that design is a lot more comfortable than the harder, rigid designs."
0,Headphones was dead on arrival.  not charging.<br />money has been refunded.
1,They are awesome! The price was great. Got them the day they said they would be here. Very easy to set up when you really aren't a techno guru. Love them. They fit in my ears! Thanks for making my walks enjoyable!
1,"I have had these for about a week and I love them!  They are so easy to use, the sound is awesome and they feel great.  The little buttons that change volume, change tracks, and pause or shut off are all very easy to find and use.  This is seriously the best headphones I have ever used.  Today while listening at work, I walked all around our floor while leaving my phone at my desk, and the connect was barely disturbed.  It was well over 30 feet with lots of walls, desks, computers, etc., in the way.  They are amazing.  I'm still trying to see what the actual battery life is.  Today they only lasted the morning, but I'm not sure they were fully charged so I'll keep testing that aspect.  The 2-hour charge time is great though.  The case and other accessories are also very nice to have.  Thank you Senso people for making  such a wonderful product!!  :)"
0,Great for regular exercise but absolutely do not work for swimming as was advertised. Sound cuts in and out
1,Great. Easy to set up and lots of extras in box. Little bigger in ear than I thought. Def value for money. Would buy again.
1,These buds are crystal clear and stay on perfectly.
1,Very happy and satisfied with product
1,Good sound quality and when i emailed tech support for an issue they helped me quick and effectively.
1,"Comfortable, easy connect to Bluetooth,<br />Delivers good sound but if the wind is blowing when you run with these you get a lot of wind sound leaking through.<br /><br />Also if you bend over to touch your toes during a work-out and your Bluetooth device is in your back hip pocket, the sound cuts out until you get back up."
1,"Battery life is average to short. A good value, great sound."
1,"fits well, sounds great and an amazing price.<br />lots of extras make this a great deal. ( I have not taken<br />them under water)"
0,They were great. Unfortunately they stopped working after only 7 months
1,Very good I like the big on off button on the side and the voice notification when you turn them on and off... so far the best I've ever had and I've gone through a lot
1,"I watched a video on the headphones before I purchased them in the review section that helped me chose these and he was right. I like them quite a bit. My only concern is at times the volume goes down suddenly without any adjustment. I've tried turning them on and off and the volume does not come back. Also when using the Bluetooth feature, sometimes people tell me they hear an echo on their end however my end is crystal clear."
1,completely satisfied
0,Works well with phone but music quality is bad. Music has noticeable lag between ears.
1,"I love my Senso headphones! I use them primarily at the gym, they stay securely in place while exercising and sound great."
0,I received items different than what is shown on the images of product.
1,"Really enjoying my headphones! I like the choice of 3 size earpieces (most come with one pair, which are too big for my ears and dont stay in well) the small fits fine. Sound is great, much better than my last 2 pairs of wireless headphones. Good job blocking out noise when listening to music. Like the cute little case."
1,"I purchased these for my wife and she absolutely loves them. They stay put during her workouts and the sound quality is pretty darn good. I like the fact that there are no controls in the wire itself "" usually causing the wire to pull to one side"". I'll definitely be buying a pair for myself."
1,"I just opened these (Senso Bluetooth Headphones) The packaging is gorgeous and you can read and understand the instructions. Easy to read and decent sized print which is important to me because my eyes are not that strong. I listened to Pandora on my phone with these earphones and the sound was wonderful. I then called a friend and she could here me well. It has noise cancellation. I like the curved over the ear wires because they hold the ear buds securely in place. My experience with ear buds without the wire over the ear always seem to fall out of my ears when exercising etc.<br /><br />They also include a long charging cord and a short charging cord, a double USB port to connect to the car power, a nice attractive carry case etc. A lot of thought went into the packaging, the instructions the design etc.<br /><br />In the past I have had Plantronics and other fancy brands and none of them compare to these and the price for these is incredibly low. Given the low price I did not expect this quality but it is there.<br /><br />I have only put them on and tried them this evening. I do not know how they will last but given the design I expect they will perform well over time."
1,I love how great these sound.  My only issue is that I wanted them for running.  It worked fine when the weather was cold and I wore a hat but now that the weather is better they don't stay in my ears very well.  I realize we all have differently shaped ears but there is no way to customize it to mine.  I am constantly adjusting during my entire run...what a bother!
1,Ear buds did not fit well in my ears but it still provided decent sound. Battery life was good.
1,"Excellent-nice design, great sound quality and very high quality materials . Easy to get on and off. Love them!"
1,Pairing was easy. I didn't like the default audio settings treble too tinny. Made adjustments in Control Panel and the audio now is perfect. Glad I bought this product.
1,Overall these are what I expected.  I was not sure if I would like the around the ear style but I find it very comfortable.  Easy to use.  It syncs easily to my iPhone 6.<br />  My only issue so far is that the lowest volume level is a still to loud.
1,"I waited to write a review until I had used these for a week or so.  Today I sat on conference calls for 3+ hours then worked out and listened to music and an interval app for an hour.  It wasn't until the cool down that I got an alert that the battery was low!  The sound is great on these!  My workout was full of up and down movements, jumping jacks, etc and these headphones did not budge--sweating and all!!  I purchased these based on the top review and he did not lie!!  I have told several friends about these--some that workout and some that are on calls a lot during the day.  The case, chargers and car charger with adapter were amazing bonuses!!!  Amazing deal! Very pleased!!!"
1,"I've had many different head phones, but this is by far the best!  I've referred this item to several at work and all love it!"
1,"These are the best bluetooth headphones I have ever owned.  They are comfortable, and stay in place...and great sound.  I waa especially impressed with the reception.  I walked all around our house, which is fairly large with basement and upstairs, and the sound was perfect.  Great buy and they were delivered as promised. The packaging and accesso were nice, too."
1,The headset are working fine and very happy with the product and quick delivery.
1,Love these headphones. Just what I was looking for
1,Work well so far.
1,"Great product, great price. I've had them for about 3 weeks now and they are pretty good. Good sound and stay on for weight lifting or cross training, fit tight. Great wireless headphones."
1,"I REALLY want to like these headphones. The sound and fit is fantastic (for the price). The headphones also lasted a LONG time without needing a recharge and always recharged fast. I even bought a few pairs as gifts for other family members, as I was initially VERY impressed.<br /><br />Fast forward a few months, and there are some problems. The bluetooth pairing is getting weird, and is no longer convenient or automatic. About half the time, you have to go into your bluetooth settings and make your iPhone forget the device in order to get these headphones to actually connect to the bluetooth. Another issue is that these headphones no longer hold or take a charge very well. They aren't lasting nearly as long on a charge, and it's becoming normal for these headphones not to charge fully, regardless of how long they were plugged in. My headphones, specifically, are dead because they will not take a charge from either provided cable.<br /><br />All in all, they're not really worth the price. Poor build quality makes these otherwise great headphones worthless.<br /><br />[Update: I emailed Senso about my issues and concerns. An actual person replied back, on the same day. Senso support is great to work with; I’d give them an A+. After checking a few things, Senso decided to send me a new pair of headphones. I received that new pair within a week of my last contact with them. I’m excited to see how long this pair lasts. I updated my star rating to reflect this.]"
1,"These headphones are a breeze to set up and fit very well with the multitude of different silicone adapters for the earpieces. The sound quality, however, is just OK. The bass response is very good, but vocals and highs leave much to be desired (they sound somewhat distant and hollow). The included case, lightning/micro usb cable, and car charger are a nice bonus."
1,The reviews were good for these headphones which is why I purchased them. They meet and exceeded my expectations. I love them!
1,I've had a  few pairs of wireless headphones in the past and have been disappointed in their performance. I thought I would give it one more try to find something  that would be comfortable and sound terrific for my workouts. After reading the reviews on the these and seeing how reasonably priced they were I figured I would take a chance on them. I'm so glad I did. Not only are they comfortable they sound terrific. They come with a 1 year warranty and the box comes with charging cords and a charging adapter. Give these headphones a shot. You wont regret it.
1,"Battery life is awesome, fit perfect in my ear, I loved."
1,"Impressive, quality headphones! Unfortunately, Bluetooth problems with my phone made pairing impossible. Returning, but will re-order when phone issue resolved or have new phone."
1,"I bought these to wear at the gym. They sound great and fit so well, I barely notice that I am wearing them. A total steal."
1,Ordered this product based on a recommendation and have been happy so far.  These were a fraction of the price of beats and are perfect for my needs.
1,"Awesome head phones, some songs bass is too heavy and distorts music a little bit. 98% of songs do sounds amazing though. Great alternative to beats which I’ve owned and lost numerous times. Bluetooth range is great as well."
1,Great product. Sound really good. Easy to pair to Bluetooth device. Love the Red and Black colors!
1,"I want to like them for a lot of reasons, but I don't. The nit picky issue is that the little plastic flap that covers the charger doesn't fit back well again after you take it out to charge.<br /><br />The real issue, though, is that the range is awful. I am six foot two and if I have my phone in my back pocket and turn my head, the sound starts to cut out. So it is a little less than a three foot range, unacceptable.<br /><br />Edit:<br /><br />I am still not sure what the issue is, but I left my phone sitting on my desk the other day and wandered off and found I got a good 10 to 12 feet before there was an issue. Yet when the phone is in my back pocket or my backpack 24 inches away I get weird sound issues whenever I turn my head. I am upgrading to three stars as there are no issues when the phone is not somehow covered.<br /><br />Incidentally, I have tried this with different phones so I do not suspect it is a defect in the phone."
0,"Excellent sound quality for what you pay and solid battery life. I bought my first pair and loved them so much I bought a second after they got stolen after 2 weeks at the gym. The second pair came with broken ear piece and was easily refunded. Got my 3rd pair 2 months ago and now they can’t stay connected to my phone for an entire song. I have no issue with my wireless headset or my blue tooth speakers or my vehicle connecting to my phone so I know it’s the ear buds. They definitely aren’t made to last and at the price I can’t say I’m shocked. If you hardly use ear buds these are a great option, if like me you use them daily for an hour or more look for something better that will last."
1,"Only had them a few days, but they are great so far. I lost my more expensive pair, but actually like these better. Great sound and great value."
1,I love these headphones. These sound amazing!
1,I just got these and I love the way that they fit. Sound quality is excellent and most of all the battery life is long enough for me. I was hesitant at first but this bluetooth headphones are definitely worth the price I paid for.
1,"Came quickly, packaged nice, the sound quality is fantastic and the Bluetooth connection is good."
1,These are the best bluetooth ear buds this is my second set because I wore out my first pair from overworked walking they fit perfectly even running
1,"Um these SENSO head sets are good. Yeah good, really."
1,"features matters to me:<br />can save pairing for 2 devices. I can pair this on my windows tablet and my android cellphone. switching devices requires you to manually connect to the bluetooth devices, on windows that is playback devices - right click bluetooth earphone - connect instead of going to bluetooth settings.<br />battery is approximately 5 hours.<br />sound quality was having some trouble at bass at first, then somehow fixed itself after charging. I'm no expert chasing that hifi quality, so this works fine."
1,"awesome sound, great product!"
1,Upper part that wraps around the ear okay but the noise cancellation and music is second to none!
1,Great product for the value.
0,"I have used these bluetooth ear buds two times on an evening run. They paired with my IPhone perfectly and I have yet to have difficulty with the single dropping during a run or work out.. However,  I am not thrilled with the sound quality. The higher frequency is lacking, which makes the music very muffled, the bass and the midlevels are decent."
0,"I have had the worst experience with this product. Went from being a good cheap Earphones , to only one side work. Then to  only turning on not connecting to not charging. Negative 5 stars...."
1,I had these before but they stopped charging. The new pair seems to work even better. Sounds wonderful and easy to pair with my iPad.
0,"I couldn't get the mic to work beyond a bare whisper. Tried to reset the headset and everything. The clarity of sound in the headphones seemed good, but no one on the other end could hear me, even with my phone within 1/2 foot of me."
1,"Sound great.  Adjusted base as suggested in another review and it helped.  Accidentally ran them through the wash on sanitary cycle and they stopped working (though still had power).  Contacted support.  Told me to do a factory reset (plug in and hold down power button 7 seconds, unplug and turn on).  And then re-pair (forget pairing and follow steps to re-pair).  They work!  Yay!"
0,"I don't love these headphones. I have to keep messing with them so that they stay in my ears and to get the best sound. After using them for an hour, I had to take them out because my ears hurt. No wonder they are so cheap."
1,These were for my son's birthday and he is happy with them.  Thank you!
1,really impressed with these earbuds so far
0,they do not work. 2 months out of warranty. they do not care.
1,"I have had these headphones for almost a month now, and am still impressed with the excellent quality sound. They fit my needs very well for providing a bluetooth earphone/microphone combination. The rubber &#34;over ear&#34; pieces are very comfortable. The battery life listed is accurate, and they recharge quickly. I use these headphones for listening to music and for over-the-Internet teaching, and this equipment makes it so much easier to hear clearly and to talk with my students. Because I have really tiny ear canals when I was having problems getting the earbuds for these headphones to stay in my ears, the Senso company suggested I purchase &#34;extra small&#34; memory foam replacement earphone tips. I bought [ASIN:B00659KQSG 3 Pairs, Black - fits extra small to small ears - &#34;Squish Fit&#34; memory foam earphone cushions by Earphones Plus] which fit perfectly and enable me to successfully use earbuds for the first time in my life! The customer service from Senso was prompt and informative. I highly recommend the Senso company and these headphones."
0,"Bad, bad, bad ... Thumbs down! I cannot get them to work"
1,So far so good. Just have to be mindful to charge the battery fully before an event away from home. Used it yesterday while running a half marathon and got the low battery alert after about 2 hours into the event before it died. Had been listening off and on the day before and thought I had 8 hours of use to work with so was not vigilant about the time. Other than that the product works well and the carrying case is handy. The easy to read laminated instructions are nice too.
1,Really sweat proof and has a great sound. The battery life could be longer but its long enough for my workout.
1,Senso headphones work just fine! I like that it came with a case!
1,"I use this while exercising at home, and wanted something to be able to move freely without being teethered.<br />I decided on this one, but it's larger than the old one that I had, which had no battery life left.<br />Despite trying the different size silicone tips, I find it doesn't stay in my ear super well.  I find I'm always tweaking the shape of the over the ear lobe piece, but it doesn't retain it's shape real well, and no matter what I try it doesn't sit tightly around my ear."
1,The extra stuff it came with was awesome! Sound is decent but for wireless headphone I do like them
1,"They are just what I was looking for. I like the fact that they attach to the earlobes, so there are no problems with the buds falling out when I am working out. The company was also really great about following up with an email to ensure that they arrived on time and that there were no issues with the delivery or the product. Thank you Tekatron, you guys rock!"
0,So I loved this headphone initially but recently I have been having some problems with the Bluetooth. Everytime I put my phone ( iPhone 6 ) in my pocket the sounds cuts. I've tried resetting multiple times..
1,So far so good! Nice headphones
0,These stopped working after about 3 months.
1,"For 19.99 I thought it was going to be just ok. It was more then ok, it was a good buy! The battery feels like it last forever, blue tooth connect right away, and the incoming call and notifications where on point. I applaud Senso, why spend 200 for some ear buds when for just 20 dollars you can het a long lasting, comfortable product. Good product indeed, a must buy!"
1,Great earphones!
1,Great headphones. I use them everyday at work. Music sounds great also the Bluetooth for phone calls is really nice. Good price
1,Very good sound quality.  Easy to pair with my phone (Samsung Galaxy S8).  Will take time to familiarize with all the features.  These are the first wireless headphones I have purchased and so far I am very pleased and would recommend them.
1,I am a woman and my ears are small and the buds do not stay in. Good quality otherwise!
1,My only complaint with these is that if you walk a short distance away from your device they're synced to that they start to fade in and out. Sound is great! I work at a textile job and it is constantly noisy with all of the machines and with these in I barely hear the humming of the machines.
1,"Excellent product.  Use mainly for outdoor work and this product fits my needs perfectly.  Easy to use, fit is fine, holds a charge for 6-7 hours maybe longer (I always put them back on the charger when I'm done using them).  Accepting incoming calls is very easy with this device and the caller can hear me perfectly-device announces the phone number for the incoming call so I can determine if I want to accept the call prior to answering.<br />I did have a problem with the charging mechanism on the first pair, but I contacted the company and a replacement pair was shipped out immediately with no problem at all-I had the replacement within 3-4 days.  Great value for the price-I would highly recommend this product."
1,"I have been looking for affordable Bluetooth headsets forever. After trying literally 5 different kinds my search is over. These are great! They are comfortable, they actually stay in my ears when exercising and so far seen to muffle background noise when on the phone. I haven't tested them as noise canceling on the plane yet ( another reason I bought them) but early indications are they will be great. Stay tuned..."
1,I was a little hesitant to buy this brand at first as I had not heard of them previously.  I am quite surprised with the  build quality and the sound.
1,"Very pleased with the sound quality, functionality, and price. I will definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a headset."
1,"Fantastic bluetooth headphones! Great battery life!<br />I listen to music all day with them and they stay charged the whole time.<br />I have weird ear canals and many eardbuds/headphones occasionally fall out; with the over the ear they don't get far.<br /><br />The only downside is the strap the connects the two sides was tightly bound with a rubber band during shipping and it's permanently kinked, that means the strap snags on clothing when I turn my head. (Pencil is pointing at the kink in the photo)"
0,Not impressed.  Crappy product.
0,"Unfortunately, these did not work for me, in spite of me hoping they would due to the low price point. First of all, I had no problem with the audio quality indoors. I did change the iPhone to low base for a more true sound, as they were pretty base heavy out of the box. But I downgraded the rating for these two reasons; 1) The over-ear loops were way too big for me, and not adjustable. They actually rode completely above my ears (I do have small ears). 2) The biggest complaint is the amount of wind noise they pick up. I ran on a completely calm morning, but just the air movement caused by me running was amplified in the headphones and quite annoying. I cannot imagine what these would be like on a bicycle where actual speed or wind was present. Granted, after a little while, you may get used to the wind noise and you can always just turn the volume up higher, but those did not seem like reasonable compromises to me. I returned the headphones and will seek a different option. Note, I am coming from a $140 pair of Jaybirds which I really liked, but they finally died and I was hoping to replace without spending a large sum of cash. I ordered a $50 pair of Phaiser BHS-750 and we'll see what they are like."
1,Love them!!  Works great every time!
0,"The quality of the sound is very high. When the Bluetooth connection starts the sound brakes up for 5 - seconds, then it stabilizes. The buds is coming out of the ears all the time. I tried changing the eartips but couldn't solve this problem."
1,These work very well and excellent sound quality. Got them for the gym and they stay in my ears really nice
1,"Great headphones. These volume of these actually goes high unlike other Bluetooth headphones. Had an issue with them, and received a response immediately, and the issues was solved quickly and promptly"
1,"I bought two..one for my boyfriend and one for me. I am a very frugal spender. I couldn't believe I was paying 35 $ for some headphones,but you know what? No regrets. Easy hook up. Last OVER 8 hours (which means they last longer than my cell phone.) I am getting my money's worth cause i wear them everywhere. Dunno if so far they are water resistant, but they say they are, and sweat proof. If not ill change my rating later. But these are a must buy AND a great gift. I never leave comments. But the president sent the most diligently, meaningful email asking me too. If I see this companies name on anything, I trust it and will buy it no questions asked. When you finish reading my review go ahead, click and order. Cause I couldn't wait for ours to arrive. Enjoy! I know I do.<br />Jerrica"
1,Sound is great.These arrived as advertised. Included unexpectedly was a second charging cable and a car cigarette lighter USB charger.
1,"I bought it five months ago and the device was great, but this week the rainy season started, I went cycling and ended up wetting the device.  Now it doesn't work anymore.  It was good while it lasted.  For those who practice outdoor sports, I recommend a waterproof one."
1,"I only recently received my new wireless earbuds but I love them already. They were delivered quickly and everything has been as promised. They have great sound, they are comfortable and the additional items like car charging block and extra earbud covers are a great bonus."
1,"If you are looking for great noise cancellation, this is not it. But if you are looking for a portable bluetooth earbud for a light workout, this would be perfect. It's light, the cables don't snag, it pairs really easily with any device, and bluetooth will stay connected for a good few feet (but too far and it will drop). It is what it is for the price and it's great for what it is."
1,I have bought several pairs of wireless headphones and these are by far the best values!  I liked them so much I bought another pair for my husband.
0,"They're loud. Some may not think that's a bad thing, until they need to turn them down. On an iPhone you have to have at least 3 boxes of volume before they work, you go any lower than that, they'll beep and switch off. Sometimes stuff is uncomfortably loud and you just have to deal with it."
1,"These earphones work well.  They are a bit uncomfortable at times with the ear tip that was on when they arrived, but there are other sizes provided so I'll have to figure out which one works best for me.  I also wish that the part that hooks on the back of the ear was a bit softer, but all in all, these work well and the sound is very good.  They synch easily with my iphone and I'm really glad I bought them."
1,"I use these while traveling, working out, and doing yard work.  They work great.  The only con I have is that it seems like when it's connected to my phone it always reads 90% (sometimes it shows 70% but rare) then out of nowhere seems to beep and indicate it needs to be charged.  Don't get me wrong, the battery life is great and gives you hours of life but it's hard to gauge how much life is left.  Would recommend!"
1,Love these headphones.  Excellent as I use them between my smart devices and or laptop. Perfect price; great clarity
1,"Just received my headphones the other day. They arrived securely packaged and well before the delivery window closed. After charging, they were easy to pair with my iPhone. They are comfortable and stay in the ear. It did take a while to learn the controls because the buttons are multifunctional, but they do work the way the instructions indicate. As for the sound, they sound good, but I wish they had more bass. For the price, though, these headphones are well worth every penny. Hopefully, they will last a long time."
1,Amazing headphones. I bought these after pulling my wired set off my ears over and over. They are so easy to set up. I leave my Bluetooth on so when I power these on they immediately connect to my phone. The sound quality is great. I've never bought really expensive headphones so I can't compare these to any other but I definitely enjoy the sound. Also I love that these go around my ears and can be molded to fit tightly on my ears. I can't wear earphones that stay inside the ear. They always fall out and my left is smaller than my right ear hole. With this set I don't have to worry about them falling out. They are also very comfortable.
1,Great quality.
1,"I've never used wireless headphones before. I had some old noise cancellation wired headphones that went bad on me. I replaced them with the Senso Bluetooth Headphones & I am not disappointed. They have a great sound and are easy to use. My only complaint is that I prefer foam earbuds that are moldable to your ears, where I feel I can get a deeper bass response and a better protection against noise."
0,"So I purchased these and the same version sold by Otium for 50% less money, and the Otium's were much better quality sound.  Either I got a bad pair, or this firm is riding on its past reputation.  I suggest you buy both, compare them, and return the one you dislike."
1,"They sound good, but they don't fit that well. They also broke and I lost the sound in one of the ears but was able to get it replaced for free without any issues. Unfortunately, my new pair also started having the same issue after only a few months.. It seemed like one of the connecting wires broke inside both times, as one ear was great, they other would turn on/off as I just wiggled the wires."
1,I'm happy with my purchase
1,"Beautiful packaging and they seem to be excellent so far (6 days in).<br /><br />I did notice that if I'm riding at high speed on my bicycle, the air catches the earbuds funny and makes a whistling sound.  It's hearable if you don't have music playing.<br /><br />But for Running / working out (which is what I use them for) they are perfect."
1,"Product is a good value, and very easy to set up.  The packaging is well designed and canotes  value.  My initial impression of the Senso brand is very positive."
0,"Garbage.. broke after three months of use. This is unacceptable. Don't buy these, pay more and get better ones."
0,This is now the second pair I have bought that has stopped working after a few months for no apparent reason. I'd love to have these replaced or be reimbursed the $60 dollars I have now spent on this product.
1,These are amazing. They have great sound and battery life. Very comforatble and yeah all around perfect. I had doubts but i would buy again.
1,"Really nice sound, comfort and ergonomic controls."
1,These headphones have incredible sound quality. I was also impressed by the battery life. They are very simple to use and are far more convenient than the older wired headphones. Just bought a second set for my wife!
1,these are so easy to use! and the sound is good!.. very very happy
0,Ear pieces are not adjustable so they don't stay on your ear very well. And I have an awful hard time keeping them connected to my iPod if my iPod is not in my pocket. Sound is okay as long as the iPod or phone is within 5 feet of you but if you go much further than that they get staticy and disconnect
1,"Great little set with nice, clear sound"
0,"I've now gone through 2 pairs of these, the first pair which invotek replaced with a second pair. Then, the second pair died of apparently the same randomness.  They just quit working one day out of the blue, a couple of times they quit in the middle of a workout."
0,"The Sensor earbuds work great, however. I can not get the Bluetooth to voice activate."
0,I would not recommend this product. I used it not more than 10 times and it stopped working.
1,Won't charge. micro usb won't fit in the buds.
1,The flexible ear part takes forever to form around your ear. It is quite annoying as people buy these for exercise. Other than that the sound is pretty good for earbuds.
1,"The sound is great and they have a far range, but they are somewhat uncomfortable and don't stay in my ears well. A bit too big for me."
1,"These are amazing!  Put them on, put my phone down, walked around the house listening to music and never even got a glitch of reception loss."
1,"Had for 3 days now.  Works well, light weight.  Battery live good. Amazing piece of technology."
0,"35% of the time they cut in & out a lot....  beeps in your ear as it cuts in & out.  intolerable.  works good when it does work.  think I'll upgrade to Bose, use the for"
0,The sound quality is like a bad walkie talkie very disappointed
1,These head phones are comfortable and are easily workable for when I do my running routine in the mornings during the week. They have great volume and don't fall out of my ears.
1,"Sound good, good price, good fit, can take calls with them and calls are clear."
1,"So far I have been very pleased with the SENSO ear buds, the sound quality and comfort are exceeding my expectations. I was also impressed with the accessories that came with this set and so far the customer service has been great."
0,"First off, the headphones are decent for the price, my only hesitation on a 5 star is due to limited treble. That said, they still produce great sound, block external sound and are comfortable to wear. The Seller is amazing. Unlike any other I have dealt with. I had an issue, sent them an email and they responded within minutes. Great customer service!<br /><br />****UPDATE - After using these for about six months, I have to remove another start. I get interference ALL THE TIME while at a heavily populated gym. Whenever someone is within close proximity to me with Beats headset, these are almost unusable."
1,I've worked out with these a few times now and think they're really great! They do a good job of blocking out other sounds and they are flexible so they can fit anyones ear!
1,I've purchased a few pairs of the sesno ear buds throughout the years. The quality has taken a major hit. Nowhere near as loud and the sound quality is way down.
0,"I was so excited when I ordered these because I had not trouble getting to connect to my phone or computer via bluetooth, and was impressed with the bluetooth range (I could walk around my apartment no problem without compromising sound. However, within weeks of using the headphones, one of the earbuds fell off. I was able to place it back together, but it was such a drag to have to do it over and over. Pretty soon after that, sound stopped playing from that ear bud, and then the front end of it fell off, so I was running around with just one work ear bud. I was excited because these ear buds were recommended for runner and did not break my budget, but I now realize it might be better to place down more money for a sturdier, albeit more expensive, product. Very frustrated!"
1,I recently lost my original headphones in flood waters. They were great to use so this new headphones were to replace the loss.
1,Just got them and went for a long run!  Super great. Stayed in place and was able to clearly hear my news podcasts as well as awesome sound for my music. Very happy!
1,very solid product for the price!
1,"Out of the box, easy pairing. SOUND is amazing. I walked about 30 feet before I lost signal from my phone.\ Easy to work. price was nice too!"
1,"The product is awesome!  I have hearing issues but due to the range of volume, I have no problem with hearing all the dialogue on Netflix.  FYI, I tried two other brands and they don’t come close to these."
1,"I was excited to receive these headphones and looked forward to using them.  I put my iPhone in my pocket and listen to audiobooks on YouTube.<br /><br />The sound would keep cutting in and out. The tech guy at target and a genius at Apple told me that the metal in my artificial hip was interfering with the signal and there isn’t really an solution.  So, I’m sure the headphones are fine but I’m really disappointed that I can’t use them."
0,the worst headphones I have ever bought. the sound is the worst and the audio quality of the calls is horrible.
1,Back up to my mpow’s.  Good enough to keep the work distractions away.
1,"Headphones work great, but since they are small, a bit easier for something to happen.  Mine got hung up and broke in vacuum.  Recommend using included protective case when not in use.  Sound quality and battery life are both excellent for the price; in the few times I got to use them."
1,Bought two for my wife and I over two years ago to use while exercising in the gym.  Use them for ~1 hr 5-7x/week.  No problems so far.  Connects quickly and sounds ok to us.  I like that they are secure on our ears unlike ear buds which we cannot stand. We are not audiophiles just looking for a quality sound for a reasonable price.  Recommend.
1,"I paid full amazonian price for this item, and my views here are strictly based on my experience with the product.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Insanely good value: comes with car charger, a nice case, different sized earbuds, a dual lighting/micro USB cable, another (shorter) micro USB cable, a coupon and a one year warranty.<br />-The Headphones have tangle-free wire and very soft and comfortable ear loops (unlike the hard plastics that others use).<br />- These sound great, the volume is one of the highest I've heard on bluetooth, and the sound is punchy, clear and responsive.<br />- Perfect for what I use it for.  Gym time...8hrs of juice gives me about a week of use without having to recharge.  They don't move or fall out on any of my workouts.<br />- I have a smart watch, and use this to take calls while I'm working out, feel like James Bond.  Works really well if you are also using to call or receive calls.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- These aren't $500.00 headphones.  If you are an audiophile that is looking for super accurate sound, you will have to shell out to get that.  You will get great sound especially if you listen to more bass oriented music.<br /><br />Conclusion:  There are few ways to spend ~$30 and get this kind of a haul.  I repeat these are great sounding headphones, probably one of the best sounding bluetooth devices I have used.  I'm very impressed with these headphones, and you will be too."
1,"Great headphones, great price. Lots of extras included."
1,Great sound but battery life is a bit low. 4hrs aprox.
1,As you can probably tell from the title of this review I am impressed with my purchase. Aside from the amount of accessories that this product came with the headphones in cells are very lightweight and easy to wear. Pairing was easy and the sound quality is impressive given the connection. I have already recommended this product to a number of my friends and coworkers.
0,"It's hard to tell how good the sound quality is--these earphones don't fit in my ears. The design is horrible. I can only imagine they tested them with one subject--an elephant named, Dumbo! These things are gigantic and unwieldy.  I do not recommend purchasing them."
0,The volume buttons came off after a few months. Hopefully the company reaches out if they can replace this for me but I'm not sure to reach out directly.
1,"Love these buds. What I love is that was easy to setup up with my Samsung Galaxy A3. They are light, and the sound is good. They fit great on the my ears."
1,Muy buen producto Buena calidad de sonido y buena durabilidad de la Batería como al usar
1,"Great reception and very loud indeed.  Very happy with this purchase, would definetly recommend."
1,Are a good product. A little dificult with the ear attachment
0,These did not work out of the box.
1,Great headphones. Way better than having a wire running from your device to flop around getting caught on everything. I like the additional accessories that come with them too.
1,Excellent wireless headphones just as good and Beats but a fraction of the price
1,Comfortable headphones for running. Sound is pretty good too.<br />One thing I don't like about it is that it does not &#34;mute&#34; wind noise.<br />Overall good for the price. And it came with a nice case with a bunch of ear plug replacements and more.
0,"We've only had these headphones for 6 months and the sounds has started to be come static in the left headphone.  We're very disappointed, especially after seeing the other great reviews."
1,"they work is about all i can say. when i compare the hard-line factory headphones i can honestly say that the hard lines are a better sound. These make my phone calls sound soft but still comprehensible. They are great for running outdoors i guess. the first time i wore them in the gym, i would occasionally get interference and the audio would occasionally dip in and out. I reached out to the support contact and was told that was normal with Bluetooth devices. I now use them when i go running or if i am in the office, not at the gym."
1,Great headphones! Idk why someone would spend an extra 180-200 dollars on other wireless headphones. I dropped these outside of my car and it was left outside in the rain for a night.. next day they still worked! No problems<br />I would rather have ten of these over other expensive headphone
1,"sound quality is excellent, not sure if the bendable behind the ear attachments will last seem like they may bend too much and break . but only time will tell"
1,"I don't like how loose they fit around my ears, but the sound quality is solid and they do block out a look of ambient sounds while taking the ​metro and on airplanes."
1,"The sound of these headphones are very good.  The packaging and the accessories are exceptional. I am hopeful that I will have these for a long time.  (I generally only have a pair of headphones for 3-4 months, I'm really hard on headphones) If I have these for more than 6 months they will go beyond my expectations."
1,Nice
1,"It works. But fit is a hit or miss , depends on the person.<br />There is some weight due to the housing style.<br />Microphone is alright.<br />There is an emphasis on bass, so if that's your thing....<br />Battery life is average."
0,"Wworked perfectly for one year and nine months. Then stopped working inexplicably. If you’re okay with that duration, purchase by all means."
1,Best pair of headphones I have bought. I just used them for a road race. They stayed in the whole time. Easy to use (change songs and volume) while running. Good sound quality. I recommend them for sure. And cant beat the price.
1,"I gave these headphones 5 stars because I've had them for a year and a half and still work great I use them for my gym workouts they last about 4 hrs and the sound is great. Just like any item if you take care of it, it will last."
1,"So far so good. Usually have trouble with headphones staying in my ear, especially ones without the cord. These have been great so far. They connect easily, the sound quality is good, and they stay in my ear. Would recommend."
1,These are very nice except for the ear clips... the ear clips need to be tighter and or adjustable to fit ones ears... I bought these because I workout and the only problem is the clips don't fit my ears good enuff.. please make an adjustable ear clip  or make the current ear clips a lil tighter for smaller ears...
1,Excellent product and excellent customer service
1,"I love everything about these headphones. I use them for running. They tolerate the sweat, have a long lasting battery life and good sound (especially bass response). A few weeks into usage, I believe the charging post in the jack got bent and I no longer could get them to charge. SENSO customer support responded immediately with a brand new pair. They were super easy to work with!"
0,I've owned these headphones for several months but they are now becoming nonfunctional by constantly turning off which is unacceptable during my workouts or anything elae
1,"Ear buds work great, great sound and the wireless range is better then I expected."
0,"This headphone sucks, not working after just one year. It is not charging at all. I guess 1 year warranty means buy another one after a year. Will never buy anything sense again."
1,I bought these for my teenage son who exercises daily and sweats a lot. He wanted Bluetooth earbuds that were waterproof. Yesterday he stated &#34;I love these earbuds&#34;. That's a pretty good review of your product.
1,"Soft, comfortable, easy to use, great sound, very good sound cancelling."
1,Best set of buds I own no negatives so far
1,Have used 1 tim since they came yesterday but so far I am very pleased! Great quality and sound!
0,"I had one pair last two years. I didn't like the ""upgraded"" version so I purchased another pair of the original model. They were constructed flimsier and cheaper like the ""upgraded"" ones. Yes they work, but aren't nearly the original quality.  I'd  look elsewhere for bluetooth headphones if I were you."
1,"They are affordable, the battery lasts & they came with accessories.  Great deal!"
1,"Recently bought a much more expensive brand of wireless headphones, but wish I would have found these first. Great sound, love the carrying case, and fits easily into my ears. Charges very quickly too!!"
1,Never had an issue.. 2nd pair but only becuase my cat ate the wires.... Will buy again and I recommend others to buy it too... Dont waste $200... These are great....
1,"Fast shipping, good value"
0,"I have only had these for a little over two months, and they no longer work. They won't charge, and have essentially turned into a useless piece of plastic. The fit was medicore, and the sound was okay, but now no matter what I do they don't work."
1,Randomnky cut out
1,"I would pick these over Beats any day! High quality sound and very nice sound blocking, they take just a tiny bit of tweaking with your equalizer since most computers and phones try to make up for the lacking bass in other sound systems."
1,"I actually love these Bluetooth headphones.  Ear pieces and over the ear loops fit perfectly.  For me, comfortable, and secure.  The sound quality is awesome.  I don't use them to run or exercise so I can't comment on how they preform under those conditions. Primary use is for my Samsung Tab 4 and my HTC cellphone.  Pair quickly and easily. On/Off button. Volume controls. Microphone.  Blue/Red led indicates current function. Charge quickly. Best of all, when turning ON/Off  you hear (while still wearing) an actual voice saying &#34;Turning Headphones On/Off.&#34;  I have not used the microphone or  calculated the number of run-time hours  before recharge.  I was pleasantly surprised to receive an email from Senso reminding me of my warranty and their 24/7 help line for any issues with my headphones.  Thank You, Kenneth.<br /><br />UPDATE 10-20-2019  Two years and these little Bluetooth Headphones are going strong.  Still take a good charge and the sound is great."
1,"Works great and fairly hardy design has held up well from several months of hard use. When outside in high winds the noise is a bit higher than expected using the well fitting silicon ear buds, which it comes with several sizes and an expanding foam pair as well. The functionality of volume, song skipping and calling using the onboard controls is nice."
0,"I had a feeling the reviews were bound to be too high because these headphones are so affordable. Let me start by saying it's a great deal, to be fair.<br /><br />The quality is pretty incredibly poor though. I have substantial crunch in my ears from the bass at very low levels. I guess it's okay if you're listening to songs without bass, but I bought these for the gym. Not to mention the charging flap on the headphones is incredibly flimsy, I almost want to just yank it out because it gets dislodged so easily.<br /><br />All in all, good for a cheap pair of headphones, but awful if you care about the quality of sound."
1,I have ordered them before last a long time
0,"This is a classic example of a very nicely designed and marketed Chinese product which cuts corners in the most important area - in this case, sound quality.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Nicely Designed<br />-Decent fit & finish<br /><br />Cons:<br />Sound quality leaves much to be desired.  The primary job of headphones is reproducing quality sound.  I don't expect too much out of $40 headphones, but these are just awful.  Seriously.  I have $5 wired headphones which sound WAY better than these.  I also have $20 bluetooth earbuds which are WAY better.<br /><br />My advise for the manufacture, is to put a little more effort into the primary function of the headphones, namely spend a little more on the drivers and a little less on the bundled gadgets."
0,Sorry to say they wouldn't stay in and the hurt my ears. I had to return them. The sound was good however.
1,"I can't comment on noise canceling or moisture wicking. I bought these earbuds so I could answer phone calls while I'm moving around the house or somewhere where the phone can be near me. I'm tired of holding the phone up to talk into the speaker and really don't like holding it up to my ear anymore. So far, so good. I like the earbuds; they're comfortable to wear and I can hear my callers well. For what it's worth, I love the nifty case they came with. That's quite an extra bit of swag for the money."
1,"First off, I have NEVER been able to wear earbuds. They irritate my ears and I have just never found them comfortable, no matter the brand. Needless to say, I was hesitant about purchasing a pair. Well I am happy I did!!! For the first time ever, I have listened to music on my phone while I work, as well as answer phone calls. I am in love with this product. The sound quality is great and they are easy to operate."
1,"I never thought to give 5 stars to a product bought by internet,, after having read a large part of the feedback I decided to order the headphones. Not only arrived on Sunday, the sound of the headset is spectacular, I am not a salesman, but I tell you, if you are interested in buying a headset that will listen well and for a low price, do not even think these are the headphones for you . Believe me you will not regret it"
1,"I have not used them for swimming yet which is what I got them for but I have worked out with them several times, easy to set up, good sound, so so far I love them, cant wait to take them in the water!"
0,First pair stopped working after 3 months.  Second pair broke after 3 weeks (see photo).  We'll see if they send me a 3rd pair.
1,"Simple to use, with good sound quality. I bought them for the gym, and they have exceeded expectations. These will stay in my ears even through sweaty, active basketball sessions."
1,You get what you paid for. Not so bad tho
1,"very comfortable, never falls out of ear, music is ok, would prefer a little more bass, but I care more about it staying in place, and it does so perfectly"
1,"These phones have all the features you could want, and they are very comfortable to wear. BUT they have awful sound. There are no highs, and lows are boomy and muddy. I listened to Béla Fleck, and you could not tell he was playing a banjo. They are fine for listening to old-time radio while exercising, but NOT for music. Very disappointing.<br />----------------------<br />I followed the manufacturer's suggestion and did a reset. Thats fixed the problem. But actually I think the lousy sound came from pushing the buds too far into my ears. I found out that as I put them in, the sound was better!. So, when inserted lightly, it is quite excellent. I think that the sound channel got pinched."
1,The headphone provided fantastic quality and will provide a solid 8 hours of battery power. After a year the headphones finally will no longer receive a charge. Great product while they worked
1,Rarely do you find quality and value in the same package. I use these daily as a runner and avid gym user I find these to be very comfortable and the battery life has been great.
1,"I bought these for my wife and she says they're great:<br />-Fits well and don't fall out while running<br />-Sound quality is good<br />-Don't need to keep adjusting while running<br />-Controls are intuitive<br /><br />She also said the noise-cancelling feature is a bit too much, sometimes making her nervous that she can't adequately hear her surroundings."
1,"My kids used it, I have not they like it<br />HOpe it works without any problems.<br />K"
1,Awesome ear bugs for running!
0,"1. blue tooth connection had to be deleted then re loaded fter 5 days.  has been working acceptably since then.<br />2. Volume unstable.  Gets louder as music or video plays. Happens with amazon video, CD music in the computer cd player, or you tube. Volume for amazon video or you tube needs to be adjusted very low for acceptable listening.<br />3. Charge time is longer than expected and charge lasts much shorter than advertised.<br />  Evaluates as a lot of work to get an acceptable listening performance at this point."
1,"This is a great product, my husband works in a very loud paper factory where he is getting wet (like drenched with a fire hose wet) and these hold up great!! A very good deal for a good working product 👍🏻"
1,"I purchased these blue tooth headphones because more than 5,000 reviewers had given them 5 stars, and for good reason.<br />Even the packaging is well thought out. I have always disposed of the packaging my new gadgets come in, but the tidy box becomes a drawer in which you can keep your accessories stored. And that's just the box! I was alone when I opened the packaging and was literally saying, &#34;Oh Wow! Cool!&#34; as I found more and more included accessories.<br />After getting everything charged and synced, which was very quick and easy to do, I tested the headphones out with a few phone calls to friends to test the mic and sound. They got a thumbs up from everyone I spoke with. I tested some songs with decent bass and was really impressed.<br />Then next test was fit and staying power. Many reviewers tested them during workouts with great results. My test was cleaning out my garage, wearing a mask and eye protection. There was a lot going on in the ear area that could have interrupted the headphones' ability to stay put, but they never fell out. I also have exceedingly tiny ear canals and have trouble with pain caused by the hard parts of ear buds where the soft rubber ends and the hard plastic electronics casing  begins. These left no soreness at all.<br />They came with an offer of 10% off a future purchase if I registered for the warranty (a simple step of entering the Amazon purchase number from my order), and after testing them out, I'm positive I'm going to be buying a pair for my husband. The kids will likely end up getting their own pairs, as well :-)<br />These really are a great product, and the price point makes them available to the masses. Kudos for integrity on all fronts!!"
1,"I bought 2 pairs of these for my teenage boys for Christmas. They abosilutely love these headphones. No need to go buy 200 dollars headphone. These are very comfortable on the ear, and the sound is terrific!"
1,These headphones have been great to me so far. Just had em a week but sound awesome.
1,I've had these for a month or two.  I liked my pair so much I bought my husband a pair.  We wear them while running.
1,"Great all around headphones, especially for the price I got them at. Easy pairing between devices and good sound quality. Also the built in microphone makes talking on the phone very easy while walking or doing physical activity"
1,"Probably doesn't get any better than this for price + quality. I sweat a lot, especially when I run and living in the south. These don't ""wick"" any moisture from my sweaty ears and I'm often pulling them out and wiping them when I can because they slide around when they get sweaty. I wear a hat now when I run so that helps. They cancel noise pretty well, except for the wind ""whooshing"" sound you can sometimes have on a windy day. The sound quality is superb. These aren't Bose or Apple headphones, but I was blown away by how deep and clean the sound was for how much they cost. You're also not paying Bose or Apple prices. Plus, if you're using these to workout/run, you don't need the crispest sound--at least I don't and I'm very picky about audio and headphones.<br />One other thing: My headphones actually stopped charging about a month after buying them. I tried manual restarts and different chargers--everything. So, I contact customer support and within hours they responded, and within days they had shipped me a new pair of headphones that, so far, are working fine. Just be sure to register your headphones on their website."
1,"I love these headphones. They're so comfortable you forget you have them on... except for the great sound as a reminder. They have enough bass to satisfy your need for a full, well rounded sound.... and all at a good price!"
1,Very happy with these.  Work great. Great price. Come with a nice little case.
1,So far perfect. Great sound for bluetooth. Have covered about 500 miles on bike and they have held up well capturing my music streaming. Affordable I thought I had lost them and knew if I had I was ordering another set. Do not feel cheap.
1,Arrived very soon. I ordered midnight and got it early morning. Works well and has a very good sound. Also noise cancelation. Has extra stuff and pretty box. Great and I recommend to others.
1,"Not as comfortable as I would like, but excellent quality."
1,They are a bit hard to get situated into my ears but the sound is pretty darned good. I got these specifically for when I do yard work. I was always getting them caught on the mower or weed trimmer and having my ear buds ripped out of my ear.
1,Use then everyday they charge fast and stay charged for about 8 hours
0,"Ugh... I was hopeful because there are so many good reviews but no such luck for me. I can only assume that many people haven't actually had GOOD headphones before?!?!? They take several attempts to connect through bluetooth... it sounds like listening to a scratched CD. Also with every other bluetooth headphone set I've had, I can walk away from my phone to grab something and it not cut out... I take 5 steps away with theses and no music. And I don't why it says that there is 8 hours of playback?!?!? I had 2 gym sessions, the first, an hour and a half and the second 2 hours... and these things died with 30 minutes left to go, so I got 3 hours of playback before they died.... SO FRUSTRATING!!<br />Lesson learned and returned!!!"
1,Sound and battery are great but the ear bands are too big for my ears and not adjustable so the buds the only thing keeping them in. Which they stay in for the most part.
1,"The power button is flimsy.  I pushed it through easily. The plastic is easily separated to line up the button, but that’s annoying."
1,I love these headphones they are much better than the beats I have. I threw my beats away. These headphones are so good I gotta buy another pair someone stole mine from the gym
1,"Awesome for jogging and general adventuring. There is an issue where if my phone is on the other side of my body, the connection can cut out, hence the 4 out of 5 stars. Sound quality is really great, though I admit I'm not an audiophile."
1,I ordered two of these one for my wife and the other myself. So far we love them and seem to be working fine. The only reason I’m giving them a 4 instead of a 5 is one of them appeared to have been used and repackaged. When I buy something new I expect it to be new not used.
0,Terrible. Uncomfortable. Have terrible bluetooth- phone in your pocket...sounds like a skipping record.
1,"I've owned mine for about a year. They're comfortable, loud (adjustable), and have a good battery life. Mic is good, I haven't had remote callers complain. These earbuds stay perfectly in place during workouts. I don't often write Amazon reviews for consumer electronics, but this truly is a wonderful device, and the best I've ever owned in its class. Highly recommended."
1,As advertised; works great; good quality. Excellent case and charge cord also.
1,"So far I'm really impressed with the sound quality, ergonomic fit. I can't wait to try it at the gym."
1,"PROS:<br />Great price.<br />Nice carrying case.<br />Charging cable doubles as iPhone cable.<br /><br />CONS:<br />You get what you pay for.<br />Sound quality is fair.<br />Can be a little quirky at times, having to disconnect and reconnect to get it to work."
1,"I have only been using them for a few days but I already think they are awesome. I got them because the original earphones that came with my iPhone kept falling off when I'm using them and I use them only when I'm sitting down at my desk in the office. These Senso ActivBuds don't fall off because of the over the ear hooks. Both the hooks and the earbuds are very comfortable. Now I will be able to use them when I go hiking with our dogs. I'm also going to buy a set for my daughter. Did I forget to say that the sound quality is also fantastic? Yes, it is!"
1,Came with a lot of accessories and sounds great!  Easy to pair...  no problem!  Now I can charge my iphone and listen to music at work.  Ditch the dongle!
1,"Love these headphones. They connect easily, multifunctional buttons work well, and give great sound quality."
1,Great product exceptional sound. I had bought the hausser magic buds. But accidentally ran them over with the car. 😭 The magic bud sound quality when talking on the phone was awful the other person said I sounded like I was in a tunnel. These senso are much better at that aspect. The only downside is the center button doesn't seem to activate Siri but not a deal breaker. Music sounds great
1,Good price. Works great! Easy instructions. Very happy with my purchase! 5-Stars all around!
1,"The battery level on my device always shows the headphones being fully charged and then they'll start cutting out and die unexpectedly. That said, they do hold a charge for several hours and I'm pleased with the sound quality."
1,"seems to break frequently, customer service will replace within 1 year"
1,"They work great on my wife's iPhone but occasionally lose its Bluetooth connection. When this happens the little light blinks blue and red together. She has to turn the Bluetooth off in the phone then turn it back on and re-connect. Other than that, they are great."
1,"Typically I use them 2 hours per day, including in a sauna. Bought them on June 21, 2017 and unfortunately they've stopped working. But when they did work, I was very happy."
1,Love these headphones and the price is fabulous!
1,I have found these headphones to be very comfortable and perfect for the gym.  The bass response is quite good and very clear.  The unit charged very quickly and a[pears to have very reasonable battery life.  It has been three days and I have not needed a recharge.
1,"For this price you can't get anything better. I had always bought fairly cheap earbuds and was tired of them always breaking so I decided to invest in slightly nicer ones. Little did I know that I would only be paying $35 for some of the best headphones out there. These headphones are comparable to Beats- the only difference being that these don't have the name/logo. The outstanding noise blocking, waterproof, Bluetooth headphones also come with 2 cables, extra ear pads, a car charger, and a case. One of the best valued things I have ever bought from amazon"
1,"Second time buying these, they're great!"
1,The headphones are great. Very good sound and very comfortable. Always had a problem keeping buds in my ears. These headphones fit great. Short charging period and pair easily with my IPhonee 7.
1,My dad is obsessed with them. 10/10
1,"I bought my first pair in summer 2017 and used them mostly for running and workouts. I bought my second pair in fall of 2017 so that I would have a set at the camper. These have held up through workouts, running, lawnmowing, etc. I really like the over the ear style, as most ear buds fall out of my ears. I just put in an order for my third pair, as I somehow cracked the plastic on one set. Pretty good for headphones that cost less than $30, as they lasted 3 1/2 years!"
1,Not an improvement over old Bluetooth.
0,"my phone has to be on a armband or else there is too much interference to the weak wifi in the headphones.  Have a galaxy 7, so I'm pretty sure it isn't the phone."
0,"They are a Christmas gift,so their not open yet."
1,Wow the sound on this are  amazing love the fit being a  cyclist  they are great stay in my ear
1,Reasonably priced. Connections were easy.
1,Great sound and battery life. I would purchase this again.
1,"Just what my daughter recommended, easy pairing ease of use, good value!"
1,"I put blue tooth transmitters on the TV downstairs and the TV upstairs.  I have a set of earphones for each of the TVs and for my MP3 player I listen to while jogging.  the earphones are great and lightweight.  One of them stopped pairing with the TV so I use that for my MP3 player.  As a curiosity, the newest pair of earphones will disconnect my wife's earphones when she's on her phone or Ipad and connect with them.  I had no idea that the earphones had noise cancellation.  I guess it works . . . when I first received the 3rd pair they were defective.  they replaced them right away"
1,"easy to use, comfortable, sound is pretty good...not great. But for working out, they are perfect."
0,"Bad sound quality. I actually had to EQ out some bass as they were really muddy and bass heavy. Bad battery life. After a few months i removed them from the charger, took them to the gym, turned them on, and they immediately were beeping about low power. Threw them in the trash. Hard pass. I dont normally write amazon reviews but these were that bad."
1,Took the place of my Nose headphones. Less cumbersome while working out.
1,Great.
1,"These ear buds have worked as advertised, extremely happy with purchase. The sound quality is good and all features work well."
1,Excellent
0,"Sound is good, fit not bad, extras included.  But, Bluetooth connectivity is very bad.  Put a cell phone in back pocket of pants and the signal is distorted with every step.<br /><br />Also, these ear buds need line of sight to source.  Even putting a hand between source and right sight ear bud the bluetooth sounds is distorted or connection is lost.<br /><br />Yes, I've tried the reset process.  Did not help.  Sounds like an antenna issue?  Anyway, returning them."
1,Sound is fine but they do not stay in place while running.
1,My son loves these headphones.
1,Very pleased with the buds. Easy to pair to iPhone. Good sound. Comfortable fit. Quality packaging and customer service. And they come partially charged so they can be used out of the box.
1,Love it. It took awhile to. Get use it but now im loving it
1,One charger not working. Otherwise OK.
1,Easy to setup (to bluetooth).
1,Just got these from UPS today and tried them out as soon as they arrived....... Very impressed with the sound quality and volume. These things are really loud. I have a another pair of Bluetooth earbuds and these blow them away by a mile.... Again I'm very impressed.<br /> Glad I made the purchase...
1,"I really wanted a wireless headphone for my workouts but didn't want to shell out $99+ for designer ones because I knew there was a good chance I'd misplace them.  At the same time I wanted good quality.  These did the job and then some!  They stayed in my ears during all my workouts- treadmill, outdoor running, weight lifting- and especially came in handy when doing guided workouts through my phone in the gym.  There were 1 or 2 times where I thought they died- customer service got back to me right away, instructed me to reset and I was back in business. A car even accidentally ran over them (long story) and they still worked!<br /><br />Needless to say after 7 months I did misplace them so I will be repurchasing again:)"
1,I enjoy these headphones. The sound quality is good and they pair fast.
1,"These are AWESOME. Well worth the money. I've had other pairs of blue tooth headphones before and none have been this good. They don't hurt your ears after wearing them, they have great range, and great sound. They hold a charge for a long time as well. I do HIIT (high intensity interval training), run, jump, everything with these and they never fall out of my ear or lose sound quality. Love em!"
1,The eyepiece takes little to get use to when putting it on. The left is not as loud as the right. A little bigger than expected.
1,These are awesome
1,Use for pool exercising
1,"The SENSO's were a great purchase originally for myself, however the only thing that did not work for me personally was the hooks over the ears...they are a little too big for my ears but made ano awesome gift to my husband and he absolutely loves theme! He said the sound quality was amazing!<br />Thank you for providing such quality products! The extra bonus accessories made the purchase even more valuable!"
1,"I bought two of this sports wireless headphone, and satisfy with the quality of the product. One for myself and another for my friend in New Zealand as Christmas gift. I want to make sure the product has no any issue so I did open the one for my friend and test it before I ship it to New Zealand. The sound quality was pretty good, and everything went well too. The shipping time was kind of long since Utah had snow during the time, but it was not really matter to me. If someone wants to ask me whether I would recommend this product to other people? The answer is yes. Hope this product will go well after a while."
1,"These headphones are great! I wear them every day when I work out, I love that they cancel out all of the noise at the gym!"
1,"Comes with case, charger, and multiple rubber covers for different size ear canals. They connect easily via Bluetooth and they sound great. Mic works pretty well for phone calls as well. I wear them in the gym and they never slip out and they are waterproof."
1,"I pair these with my Nexus 6P. Initially I had issues pairing and the audio was choppy when I held my phone at any distance that wasn't right near my head.<br /><br />However, SENSO reached out to me asking how my experience went and I explained my issues. They promptly replied with how to reset the headphones to factory settings and this did the trick!<br /><br />Here are the instruction for resetting the headphones:<br /><br />1. Reset the Senso headphone to factory settings (while plugged into a power source, press/hold the power button for 7 seconds).<br />2. Unplug the headphone from charging cable and power them on.<br />3. Enter the earbuds into the pairing mode and follow instructions for connecting."
1,"Easy to use, fit nice and snug and sound great. Good value for the money I spent."
1,It came with a lot of great little random gadgets but the headphones are pretty big and the right headphone was bent pretty bad. Gonna return and try another pair to see if it was just a fluke. Will update when I get the next pair.
1,"great sound, good bluetooth connection, nothing to complain."
1,"Easy to pair, great sound, made well. I believe I will enjoy them for a long time."
1,Work great and that's what I need. Something reliable and affordable. And that's what I got!
1,Good sound and comfortable.
1,Great headphones easy to pair easy to work. I love them
1,"For the money, these headphones work great."
1,your product  impressed me greatly i wish i had known about them sooner i will be in the market for some noise reduction  over the ear headphones  soon and look forward to checking out your product first. if these headphones hold up to normal wear  and not come apart like my others after  30 days i will be a customer for life
0,I was not very happy with the purchase.  They do not stay in the ear. The part that wraps around the ear is to flimsy and doesn't stay in place and was constantly falling out. Only plus was the battery lasted very long.
1,"Great headphones, especially for the price. I'm not that discerning, but sound quality seems really good to me. However, they're fairly useless as a microphone. During phone calls, people can hear me only if I'm in a quiet area, no one can hear me if I'm driving or in a noisy space (which incidentally is why I purchased them)."
1,"I believe the run time isn't quite 8hrs but damn it, these are the best headphones you can buy for under $35.<br /><br />Charges fast, holds charge, stays in ears. GENIUS idea, the charger has both ends for charging the head phones AND for charging your iPhone. They nailed it.<br /><br />If you're in doubt, buy them. They are perfect."
1,These are great!! I'm super happy with them. Easy to get set up and sound great!!
1,"Too big for my ears, wouldn’t stay in place just sitting still so I didn’t even try working out with them. Not really a quality problem-I just have small ears. Otherwise sound was good. Gave them to a friend who loves them!"
0,"Alright sounds quality for the price. When the battery gets below 30% it will say, &#34;battery low&#34; once a minute"
1,"As an active runner (daily), these ear buds have a great sound and are steady on the ears.  With other brands i hve struggled with constant tugging and adjusting of the earpiece, not with these.  The charge is great and the feel is good.  The best quality is the fit and the sound.<br />Hi marks from this marathon runner."
1,I had absolutely no issues using the Bluetooth headphones it’s audio & build quality is great plus it comes with cables for iPhone charging! Used for working out and doing chores around the house never had any worry of them breaking/falling.
0,"The connection to the bluetooth device (my phone) was inconsistent and would often break up or disconnect, and the headphones stopped working altogether only a few months after I bought them!!"
1,"Great sound, great value. Nice packaging too...."
1,"I had bought the beats earbuds recently and was pretty happy with all but the price. I found these on Amazon and after considering the reviews, bought a pair. The quality of sound is primary to me and these do not disappoint. They sound better than the beats at a fraction of the cost. The right controls in the right places is also huge, and they are comfortable. I wear these for hours at a time, all day at work, lengthy gym sessions and for long runs. I went ahead and bought a second pair so that I have a backup always charged and ready to go. I like background music in everything I do and these are perfect for me. Nice job on a great product!"
1,Excellent product.
1,"Awesome headphones. feels light on the ears, yet powerful sound.  It would be even more awesome if it were to tell you how many hours of talk time was left when you power on the headphones."
1,"These headphones are great, they take some getting used to (for the behind the ear part) but I use these when working out and it's perfect.  Bluetooth range is okay and the sound quality is great."
0,I bought a competing set of Bluetooth wireless earphones a month before and I have to say I prefer the other pair which was about double the price. I bought the SENSO on a lightning deal based on the great reviews and have to say they have not lived up to the hype. The biggest con for me is the lack of bass. The music sounds tinny and not as full. I would not be happy if I had paid full price for them.. Sorry SENSO.
1,Hold a charge well. And not uncomfortable. They do hold up to sweat well.
0,"Hit and miss quality it seems, with only 3 light uses these began shorting out. All reasonable trouble shooting has been done. 4 days outside the return window. buyer beware!"
1,Great sound. Little mo
1,"These headphones are easy to pair and have pretty decent sound.  However, I have a few issues with them.<br />1. I have to constantly reconnect them to my phone. For some reason the connection drops even when I'm standing next to my phone.<br />2. The range is subpar<br />3. It doesn't automatically connect.  If my phone is connected to my car's bluetooth and I step out- this headphone would not auto reconnect.  As a matter of fact, it doesn't respond when I try to manually connect it myself either.  I have to turn it off and back on for it to pick up....annoying<br />4.  It needs weights.... Like seriously. If you only use one earbud, the thing is hanging all down your back.  I don't have that issue with my Beats.<br />Did I say the range sucks?"
1,Didn't expect to be so imprsssed. I am an audiophile and this is pretty good. Wow
1,"The sound for the price is really good quality. The ability to adjust the volume and skip songs from the head piece is a nice feature. The only thing that drives me crazy is the cord that connects the ear pieces. It is made of rubber and sticks to the back of my neck so when I turn my head, it pulls one of the ear pieces out. The alternative is to put the cord under your chin but personally, no. So great blue tooth headphones for the price with only one small draw back. Would recommend if you are looking for quality sound without breaking the bank."
1,"i love everything about these headphones, especially the extras- however, the connection is at times extremely poor.  when the connection is good the headphones are great.  when connection is poor, the headphones serve no purpose.  also, i stream music from my phone which is always in my pocket."
1,"I just bought my second pair of headphones because the quality and sound are very good for the price. I put these headphones through a lot, as I workout every day hard. The battery usually lasts 2-3 workouts about 2 hours each. Ultimately it’s a good buy for the price and quality"
1,"great product, great service."
1,This is the third pair I’ve bought. Given a pair to a couple of friends as a gift. Consensus is that they are great! I have a pair of Powerbeats 3 and the Sensos are ever bit as good. You get a lot in the box as well. This at a 10th of the price? Outstanding. Highly recommend
1,Good quality
1,I like them a lot. No issues so far. Great fit with small buds. I like that it comes with 3 sizes of ear buds. Easy to use. Great sound. Great price. I'm all for small businesses so  I wish you great success. I will s probably get another set down the road for a gift. Thanks
0,Disfunct withing a month. Not even worth wasting $20
1,Sound is great.  I ride heavy equals every day and have to be able to answer my phone.  The sound on the phone calls are awesome and the people at the other end say it sounds like I am standing next to them.
1,"Clear HD sound, good bass, good range and good battery time! Worth the money."
1,Love them!!! GREAT sound!
1,The headphones are great. They don’t slip out of my ears when running or sweating. The sound quality is excellent. I love how I can adjust the volume right from the headphones.
1,"Fantastic product. Well made. Exquisite packaging with all the extras including dual USB charger and all the cables you would need.<br />Item used for hiking:  it stayed in the ear without any issues and it also sounded great.<br /><br />So at the end, would recommend again and was really pleasantly surprised."
1,"These are lightweight and fit the best of any earbuds I've tried. I like the flexibility, sound, ease of use and simple connectivity. Best buds in my book."
1,"This was my second attempt at trying blue tooth headphones and I am happy to say it was successful! While the first ones I tried were hard to use and uncomfortable, these are very comfortable and easy to set up and use. I mainly use them for audio books,  but the sound quality for music seemed good also. The only issue I had was with the charger that comes with it. First of all, it seems way too short, but I was unable to get it to connect to the headphones. I ended up using the cable from my Kindle which works fine."
1,great product and great service. if you are looking for a good pair of Bluetooth headphones to wear during your workouts these are great
1,These headphones sound great.
1,"super comfortable,super light,best buds out there,great stereo sound"
1,"Love the headphones paired nicely crystal clear sound and loud, best pair i have ever had. always had trouble with headphones falling out of ear not these i can do sprints job sleep and walk and these are not falling out. thanks so much for this amazing product!"
1,"Bought these for use in the gym, and I',m really happy with them.  Sound quality was way better than I expected. For the price, you can't go wrong with these."
1,"This brand sounds excellent. For the price and the ease of use it's well worth it. Nice balance in the mix. Clear bass, not muddy. The highs are clear without the annoying edge. I like them."
1,Sound quality is good and they feel real good on my ears even for prolonged periods of use. Using them for gaming on my iPad and there’s no delay which I appreciate
1,"I am impressed by the product so far. Very comfortable, easy set up, and great sound. The product also came in a nice case. It doesn't seem to noise cancel completely, but I am ok with that since that wasn't as big of an issue as comfort and quality. The recharger work easily too."
0,"I've had these for close to a year. The sound is clear and crisp, and unlike several Beats headphones I've tried, not muffled. I made the mistake of following the crowd and buying beats in the past, only to have to return them twice (two different types). These are much much better, and you can't beat (pun intended) the price deal. Customer service was also great when I made inquiry. And delivery was sooner than expected every time I ordered (I ordered some for friend)<br /><br />(UPDATE)<br />Although the sound quality of these headphones is great, soon after writing my last post they stopped working--shutting off sporadically, even when fully charged. I contacted the seller and they were super nice and sent another set. The new set worked well, but about two months ago I had to stop using them for phone calls because persons on other end complained that they couldn't hear me when on the blue tooth. Last week I noticed they started shutting off sporadically, just like the first set, and I haven't had them a full year.<br />Although the sound quality is good, it seems that there's a defect with the design of the product, given my repeated experience.<br /><br />I downgraded to 2 stars from 5 to give credit to sound quality (when working) and customer service, however, the best product is no good if doesn't perform as it's supposed to"
0,"MUFFLED SOUND<br /><br />BUT music sounds absolutely terrible. Muffled beyond belief. Its like you put cotton balls in your ear and then put mediocre earphones in after. Stay away if you want to listen to anything other than talk programs.<br /><br />It is true that it is very comfortable. Even more comfortable than Bose in-ear headphones. But ignore my previous warning at your own risk. Who wants to deal with the hassle of a return? I thought I did, but still have not got around to it. I wish someone would combine the comfort of this design with higher quality sound."
1,3 years in and let me tell you they still sound amazing after all the heavy use and especially for exercise. The only reason im giving it a 4 is because the last months the cable cover has but slowly tearing apart and exposing the cables. Hasn't affected its performance but I fear a cable might break in the next 2 years.
1,"Love these!  Got them a couple days ago and this morning was my first gym workout with them.  Very freeing to not be tethered to my phone.  They are truly noise canceling, and very comfortable to wear.  Too soon to tell about the battery life.  Easy set up, paired quickly and easily with my phone.  My husband liked the sound so much he is going to get a pair himself."
1,Wow. Good sound quality. Perfect for the gym. Easy to use. So much comes in the package too! It's a lot for a small price. Very surprised.
1,"I really like these headphones!  They fit very well - the flexible, over the ear piece makes them remarkably comfortable, as well as the angle of the piece that actually fits in my ear.  I love that they have a carrying case included, and the car charger and cord is a bonus!  The reason I only give it 4 stars is that I think the multifunction button is a little awkward (I have to push REALLY hard to turn it on and off), and it doesn't &#34;say&#34; that it is in pairing mode.  I can adapt to both, so I think it's a great product!"
0,"These things honestly are junk. Claim of 50 ft Bluetooth range, but ONLY under ideal conditions, otherwise it's about two ft. Don't bother using them outside, because they cut out non stop unless you hold it chest high. Sound quality is poor for this price range. Very muddy bass notes, muffled highs. I've used numerous LG Bluetooth ones, Samsung's, and a few cheap Chinese knock offs, and these are by far the worst ones I've used as far as getting a clean signal. Thank god I only spent under 40 bucks on em. Definitely not worth list price, or even close to it."
1,"i found this senso headphone better than bose and samsung in clarity, separation and they are noise free."
0,"This pos is hot garbage. I bought it not even 4 months ago and hardly used it, but the battery is already shot. Waste of money. DO NOT buy this."
1,"I was deciding between these and the Skullcandy bluetooth earbuds. I went with these because they seemed lighter and more practical for my activities while wearing headphones/earbuds. Also the price was a bit cheaper. I really like Skullcandy, but looking at a majority 5 star rating with these versus the 3 to 4 star on the Skullcandy's, I went with the previous reviews and bought the SENSO earbuds. Thus far I have had no issues with these headphones. They are very loud and connect to my Samsung Galaxy S4 very quickly (and easily). The sound quality is good and they seem to be somewhat durable. My lack of a star (from 5 stars) is due to the &#34;active&#34; portion of the sale. Whilst you can be active with these headphones, it is not ideal. I ran with them in/on and there was a lot of wind noise. I'm not upset about it, but for the asking price on these (originally $100+)...yeah... So all in all, I should have gone with some good over-ear headphones. Yes, they are bulky and somewhat obnoxious, but I would not have had to worry about wind noise while running. Also...all of the &#34;they never fall out of my ears - it's so wonderful&#34; reviews...must be nice. Unfortunately for me, they can fall out of my ears with a small amount of force. In other words, I won't be doing jumping jacks with them in. I did light jumping to test that bit of it and they technically stayed on my ear, but the buds wiggled out. If you're not hurting financially, you may want to consider these. May God bless you all."
0,Never worked right out the box
1,"Comfortable, lightweight and sound great. so far so good. we will see how they hold up. My experience is, with the lesser priced ear buds, they don't hold up well, but like them so far."
1,"The sound is great....I own the LG TONE Infinim wireless headset, no comparison! I highly recommend this product...."
1,"Bought these for my husband and he loves them.  He uses them when working out and said they are better than the previous set he had.  Great product, very happy with this purchase!"
1,Great headph..it stays charge for a long time. Volume is just right. This is my second one first one lost😢😢
1,The Senso has good sound and fits comfortable under a  riding cap and bike helmet. Still trying to figure out battery before a recharge is needed. Seems good for 3-4 hours.  I love being wireless and hope they hold up to my heavy use.
1,"I haven’t used the headphones yet, because they don’t fit on my ear. For a person with larger ears they’re probably great, but for me they are definitely difficult to use."
0,"Sound quality is okay, I've seen better with cheaper headphones. They are clearly not made for running, the hear clips are not rigid enough so they don't do much and the buds keep slipping out of my ears while running so I have to push them back in every other minute. Overall not really satisfied and have to buy another set. I would not recommend them."
0,This is my second pair.  The first worked maybe 6 times totally dry.  The second not at all.  Not happy. So sorry.
1,"These are my first set of wireless headphones, and I love them! The sound quality is excellent. Very comfortable and lightweight. I've only used them for a few days, but so far they're great!"
1,"After a year of buying this product. I do not regret it. I've been able to do everything from running, walking, and using it at work. This is the best Bluetooth I have ever had and a great battery life."
1,"I really enjoy these headphones.<br />I workout with them 5 times a week and sit in a sauna for a minimum of 15 minutes as well,,, they are still holding strong!<br />Im recommending this to my fellow athletes and Gym Breasts."
1,I read a lot of reviews before I purchased these blue tooth ear buds. My son had recently purchased some apple air buds. I will admit the sound quality is better on the air buds than the senso ear buds but not enough to pay the price difference. The air buds have a little crisper sound than the senso but sound quality is still excellent for the price point. The opelation of the senso buds is perectangular and more versatile than the air buds. I haven't owned them long enough to comment on battery life which other reviewers have praised. You can't go wrong with these ear buds at this price.
1,"Sound is exactly what i needed. I won't pretend to know anything about sound quality but just needed something to be &#34;out of the way&#34; and reliable while running or using the gym. This sure fits the bill. Aside from the easy connection to my device and remarkably long battery life I must admit I was pretty impressed with the packaging. A sturdy, slide out box which includes multiple charging options. A separate case for storage and different size earbuds which, in my case, was a huge factor.<br /><br />In all it seems to be the best value going.  Enjoy!"
1,For the few days I've had them they've performed great. Haven't checked power reserve yet but so far I've gotten over 5 hours off of the initial charge and that's better than my last wireless set.
1,The sound is great and the price cannot be beat. I bring these along on trips with my Bose wired headphones. They work perfectly with iPhone 8.
1,Very happy with these headphones. Great sound. They stay in place pretty well.
1,Outstanding! Excellent quality. Great sound. Very easy to pair to device. Super value. Love these headphones.
0,"Was really excited about these. Great sound quality, however after about 2 weeks of use I started to notice how faulty the wiring is. If you turn your head one way the sound goes in and out."
1,Sounds Good
1,"Blown away by the quality, especially given the price.  Very comfortable on the ear, easily paired with my iPhone, worked immediately after charging."
1,Awesome... plain and simple. Great price and they sound incredible!! Very happy. 😊
1,"First, let me say that I never make a purchase without first doing some research.  Amazon has so many different brands of headphones available, but I decided to try the SENSO based on written product reviews, product review videos on YouTube, and finally price.  I ordered these specifically for use at work where I work in &#34;cube land&#34; and it's difficult to drown out background noise.  The day these arrived at my office, I opened the package and had these powered on and connected with my iphone in a matter of seconds.  Super easy to set up.  Now, I have found since a few days of use, that I need to fuss with them a little more when switching devices (iphone, ipod and Samsung Galaxy S3), but nothing that would make me want to pull my hair out.<br /><br />Comfort:  These are so comfortable that I forget I am wearing them at times.  I like the soft, flexible loops that goes over my ears.  I wear glasses and don't have any issues or discomfort from the combo of these with my glasses.  I also like having the option of ear piece sizes.  I haven't tried running or working out with these yet, so can't say how these feel/fit when being very active.<br /><br />Sound:  I will admit that I am not the biggest sound snob.  I know that I do not like distorted bass or vocals in a song when the volume is turned up.  The sound from these headphones is clear with a good mix of bass and treble.  The biggest feature I want to talk on is the noise cancelling capability of these headphones.  I have found myself forgetting that I am in an office full of people as all background noise is gone.  I have actually had a few people standing in my cube talking to me without me even knowing it.  It's not until they tap me on the shoulder that I know they are trying to talk to me.<br /><br />So far, after a few days with these headphones, I have no real complaints.  If you are on the fence about what brand to buy, then buy these.  I don't think you will be disappointed!"
0,If I go for a bike ride and have the phone in my pocket the headphones and my phone lose connection every few seconds...quite annoying.
0,Stop working first day.
1,"Bought these for my boyfriend to use for his workouts. Sound quality is good and they didn't fall out when walking, running, or weight lifting. Hoping the battery life is as good as promised! Overall good product!"
1,"Had a little trouble pairing at first - kept dropping in and out.  But now they pair fine with my iPhone 7 each time I use them.  I did a 12 mile run in the rain last weekend with them, and they performed beautifully - better than my sneakers!  Sounded great, stayed in place, water had no effect.  I'm so happy that I got these.  And great price.  Thanks guys!"
1,"I don't give this product a five because the Bluetooth sinc. usually gets confused and if it is connected to two devices, I need to restart it to be able to listen on the other device that was not playing before, and it is annoying. Battery life is ok (las 8 or so hours) specially for this price."
1,They are really good for the price
1,"These Earbuds are amazing, cheap, powerful, versatile, long lasting, and most importantly they STAY ON YOUR HEAD when you exercise"
0,Horrible product. There is static way too often. I tend to return
1,"These bluetooth headphones are well worth the money I paid for them. They are very comfortable and the range is phenomenal with an equally impressive battery life, well over 6 hours. They have great sound with great range throughout the sound spectrum."
1,"My second pair, 1st set lasted over 2 years, great fit, easy to pair, great battery life. Very good value at $22."
1,"Husband loves these when he goes to the gym, but if it's busy he starts getting interference."
1,They are the best I have ever had. I returned my LG Pros back to Best Buy and order a second pair of thr Senso
1,Very pleased
1,"The only thing I don't like is that it picks up sound so far away. people can hear every sound in my background on the phone. Other than that, I'm 100% happy. Too bad I lost them this weekend and the price is higher so I won't be buying another pair."
1,"Great product, they sound great"
0,"the sound quality is ok, but this just does not fit in the ear and comes out during jogging."
1,"First of all, huge thank you to the company for delivering the item the same day I ordered it! Not sure either I should recognize the Amazon prime for this fast delivery or the Senso! As far about the product -- absolutely in love with the headphones! Extremely comfortable and I don't even feel I am wearing them. Great sound, very easy to set up and enjoy! Very comfortable for long-distance running. Thank you for the product again!"
1,"Probably the best headphones you can get for the price. I just got my second pair. My last pair I had for over 2 years and they only broke because of my my own error. They sound great, I use the foam earbud inserts with them."
1,"Love these headphones. Not only do they have great sound for the size , but stay in your ears when running or power walking. Well worth the money."
1,"Great headphones, they have this amazing feature where they ACTUALLY stay on your ear. A feature really overlooked in lots of headphones. Great quality music."
1,"These headphones are great.  I purchased these guys because when I workout, I sweat a lot, so the waterproof feature was a plus.  I also have small ears and thought that the ear hook would not stay, but these headphones are very snug even for my small ears.  The bluetooth connection was very easy.  Syncing was no problem.  And the fact that they come with three different sizes for the ear piece is also a great plus.  I would recommend these, especially for athletes or anyone who is in need of waterproof headphones."
1,Comfortable can use it for hours without issues
1,"I really like my SENSO Bluetooth Headphones, but an unexpected problem came up.  Contacting the manufacture was easy and fast.  They took care of my issue and stood by their product 100%! I really appreciate that kind of top notch service!<br />Thank you SENSO!"
0,They sound horrible
1,Running
1,"I ordered these for my runs throughout the week. Comfortable, no Bluetooth drops, stay in place. Love them. Highly recommended. Great value."
1,"These produce plenty of sound and are very clear when I am stationary.  I bought these for when I ride my bike.  I went on a 4hour ride this weekend and there was almost zero ear discomfort, the battery also lasted the entire ride.  My only complaint was wind noise, I was only riding at around 15mph and there was definite noise coming through.  I just had to turn out my music another notch and it made it much nicer.<br />I had zero issue with the music cutting in or out.  I was even able to walk about 40-50 feet away from my phone, line of site, before it started to cut out.<br />If you don't want to spend a ton of money on a wireless set of headphones I would highly recommend these."
1,"These headphones are fenomenal. Such a great cost, they are especially helpful at the gym because even when I sweat like crazy, they don't budge!!! I definitely recommend them. I feel the battery power is a little short because I use them so much but I honestly can't complain because of the price and their good quality. the customer service is also fantastic. I was having issues and contacted them and they replied immediately with insight. highly satisfied with this brand :))))"
1,Delivered fast. Great sound. Comfortable. Come with a lot of great extras.
1,For the price this is a great buy.  Syncs to both iPad and iPhone. Battery last as stated so be sure to charge. Comfy to wear.
1,great headphones have had them for a month I play basketball and cycle with them on and they are worth every penny . recommend
1,Sounds Great no issues
1,"Great headphones, sound quality and functionality are pretty good so you will get a lot of value for your money"
1,I love these ear phones. There comfortable stay on my ears without irritation. Have good sound quality. Easy to use. Comes with a nice case with both car and house charger. What more can you ask for.
1,"I planned to listen to recorded tour guide comments as I explored Ancient Rome and the Vatican City. Wireless headphones seemed like a good idea so I could keep my iPhone hidden in a pocket as I moved through the tourist sites. These headphones were the perfect answer to my wishes. I was pleasantly surprised that they worked so well. I used the headphones to control the narrative volume and to pause the narrative while I took photos or discussed the details of a site with others in my group. I also used them on the plane to/from Italy as well, where the noise cancelling feature was put to the acid test. All for a very low price. I am very satisfied! Julius Caesar never had it this good! Et tu, Brute?"
1,"These are good quality for the price.  I'm still working to figure out what ear piece will fit best as they tend to move a bit when I run.  The other thing I have noticed is that my air hitting the wire seems to cause some disruption in the signal, but that goes away if I wear them in front."
1,"no issues, fit well, sweat/ moisture not an issue. I have two, after years of use with the previous model, it's now my spare.<br />I'm a sweathog on the treadmill, I'm in my own world wearing these..<br />it would be nice if this has a charging case option. I'd buy that too."
1,"Great wireless earbuds, rating was given for all the reasons the other 5 star reviews indicated."
1,"For the price, this set is Amazing! Comes with the standard mini usb connector, but also an Iphone connector and usb cigarette charger and carrying case! On top of all of that, it's waterproof!"
1,I have enjoyed everything about the product but I'm not sure about the Bluetooth range.ive had some cutting out issues in I have my phone in my left pocket instead of my right.
0,"everything works great until I start jogging. Whether I run slow or fast, windy day or still, and regardless of which earbud adaptors I use, most of what I hears is the amplified sound of wind rushing by the earbuds. Nothing seems to get rid of it. So while there is only 1 thing wrong with them, its pretty much a fatal flaw. They are being sent back."
1,Connects easily. Simple to use
0,"Sounded great. One of rare in-ear headphones that didn’t make my ears itch. However, it stopped working after 1year."
1,Great headphones and work perfectly. They get the job done.
1,Love them so far. Very easy to connect and use.
1,Perfect sound.
1,"Pairing was easy, design is good, ear buds stayed in place during workout, sound quality is good, price for quality is excellent, they even have an extra apple cord and a 12v charger included, so Happy with that I bought another set  4 days after purchasing the first"
1,Love em. They fit great and work well for me. Very pleased. Headphones were well packaged and seller provided shipping updates on a continuing basis. Highly recommend this seller.
1,These buds have really good sound quality and noise reduction. They also fit really comfortable in my ears. I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 because if you really start to sweat they do get a little loose fitting and want to come out but I don't think there's any getting away from that....
1,"Have only had for a couple of day’s but so far I’m very pleased with the headphones, great case and easy setup.  Senso has done an amazing job following up after purchase to ensure the product was as intended and that I didn’t have any questions."
1,"I love the fact that the battery life is so long. I charged it 3 days ago and i'm still using them. They're not constantly running, but every time I'm outside doing yard work I need my hands and use these. They are great with noise cancellation on my end, but anytime i'm on the phone with them on everyone hears everything in my background. You have to have both pieces in your ears because one side will end up pulling on the other if you just have it hanging around your neck. For the price you pay these are great. Quality is great."
1,"They work very well, sound good and they're very comfortable. They also have some very convenient features. Easily beyond worth the cost of 37$."
1,"Not bad. Quality is about what you’d expect for the money, but they are weather resistant Bluetooth earbuds nonetheless."
0,Quit working after 4 months.
1,"I read a review of the headphones, and upon one opinion I bought a pair. Great overall, good and loud, battery lasts long nice carrying case. Hope they last a while. Comfortable and decent price. Thanks"
1,"Wow, I just got it and I was up and running in a few minutes. Its working great! What a value this Bluetooth is. I paid over $100 the last time I bought a similar device and didn't get near as much."
1,Nice and comfortable headphones
1,"Received the headphones, connected and worked perfectly."
1,These are amazing headphones. Music sounds amazing and the call quality couldn't be better. I highly recommend them!
1,Got these to replace a pair of wired ear buds because where I work requires allot of moving around and I needed something that won't keep falling out my ears and these looked prefect....And they also sound better than a pair of 50 dollar brand name headphones I purchased recently.
1,"Didn't know what to expect, but extremely happy I bought these. Will buy more in the future."
1,I purchased these for my husband after he lost his Beats at the gym. He absolutely LOVES them!  He said they have a better sound than his old ones and loves the more flexible part that goes over his ears. Highly recommend!
1,They are great a pair of heads for the price they feel great and work great for running and at the gym.... just did a triathlon with them and they stayed in place...... the sounds is very good..... thanks
0,"There is a problem with the Bluetooth connection to my Galaxy S4. Just wearing them around they work fine however when I start doing any kind of activity (running, lifting weights, etc) the connection gets real choppy and cuts in and out. Right when I stop the activity the connection is fine again. Tried resetting for Factory Settings and resetting phone with no success. It's too bad, the fit is nice and the sound is great too. Had to return them though."
0,"Worked great for a couple months, but now won't charge."
0,Sound quality is fine but it cuts out way too often
1,"Great price, great sound!"
1,"Nicely designed, works well, very comfortable, easy to use. The sound quality is very good. Packaging is also nicely done too. Perfect for my workouts @ the gym, as well as cell phone calls at home. I am very happy with my purchase of these SENSO bluetooth earbuds headphones."
1,"Better then I thought they would be. Comfortable, easy to connect. Can't even turn up more then halfway (good thing)."
1,"They stay in place better than normal earbuds, although they still can come out. But at least all you need to do is push them back in. They sound is good and they are loud enough."
1,So far so good? I just received them so its a bit premature to give a review...but so far they are working out fine
1,"Excellent buds and service, thanks."
1,good
0,Kind of feels weird on my ears. Keeps falling off when I run maybe it's just me
1,"By and large like the features. But a couple of reasons for 4 start<br />1. Wind noise when outdoors<br />2. Wanted to use it as a wireless headset for my computer as well, but not able to find drivers for Windows 7 Enterprise<br /><br />Battery life, looks, Clarity, quick pairing - Five stars. Just I hope the above two issues as well get resolved soon."
1,"I bought these ear buds to replace a MUCH more expensive set that didn't survive a trip through the washer and dryer in the pocket of my workout shorts.  I just started using them this week, and so far I like them very much.  I had a little trouble pairing them to my iPhone initially, but once paired, they work great.  I'm not yet used to the wrap around the ears, but they seem to stay in place well, and I'm sure I'll get used to it.  The sound on these seems comparable to the more expensive set and the charge seems to last as long.  Hopefully, I won't be testing them in the washer anytime soon.  Overall, I'm very pleased with the purchase."
1,"Fine for running and hearing music, not that great for phone calls"
1,"Just what i expected.  Fit, quailty, price"
0,I have gotten two pairs and both have broken. Very disappointed.
1,"So far these are working and sounding great.  They paired easily with my phone and came charged ready to go.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 is because they are a bit bigger than some of the others look.  I haven't ran with them yet,  but will update post when I do to see if they stay in place or if the size effects them."
0,Have had them 2 months and already threw them in the trash. Worked fine when sitting still but once you started moving around the sound would skip.
1,"I've been using these at work since I received them, and they have been working great for me! They connected to my Galaxy S8+ on the first attempt and  I've had no issues with disconnects or interference, which could be a problem at my job, considering I would in the tech industry. The only issue I have is that the left earpiece is a little bit rough where the plastic was molded, but I think this will probably wear to smooth from use. That is the only reason I rated it 4 stars instead of 5."
1,My daughter needed these for her new &#34;no headjack&#34; phone.  She absolutely loves them!  The battery life on them is better than her phone. :)  And she can't stop telling everyone how much she loves her headphones.
0,The earpieces that go in the ear break off to easily. This is my 2nd pair in 7 months where this has happened. The the intact earpiece with the power button stopped working a couple of months later.
1,Great for half marathon! Volume is super loud though beware . Really truly stays in your ear
0,Quit working after 8 months
1,Well priced. Well made. Well designed. Great sound. They make a very convenient way to listen to your phone without being tied to it with a cord.
1,Amazing sounds for the price. Stays in place while running!
1,"Great set of Bluetooth headphones, came with different sizes of rubber ear buds and an amazing foam one that keeps the buds in my ear comfortably even when I'm working out or doing chores around the house. Good battery life, could be better but lasts most of the day, and charges quickly. Reach of the Bluetooth is also pretty good, if you stay in the same room as the source device you shouldnt have any problems. The only thing I dont like about these is that during use there is a constant blue flashing light and it is pretty disruptive at night (small piece of electrical tape took care of that problem)"
1,These work great and with the low price how could you go wrong. I've had them for a week and no issues yet.
1,Product arrived on time and as described.
1,This is my second  headphone (the first I lost it) love the product.
1,"These have worked very well. The connect easily to my Bluetooth. They fit snugly on the ears, are easy to work out with, and don't fall off. Lightweight and comfortable."
1,"Perfect for when I'm jogging and working out, hang to my ears the way I wish my previous earphones would ."
1,product seems to works arbitrarily and intermittently whenever it so chooses to do so. Oh you want to turn your headphones off so your phone can actually understand using voice to text only for a brief moment and then switch back not on this little devices watch. It's off and wont come back on or charge till it pleases to do so or at least that's been my experience thus far but I know how it goes... quantity and speed over quality.
1,"I really wanted to love these earbuds.  Unfortunately, after a few weeks use I learned the following:<br />Pros:<br />1. Very comfortable<br />2. The over ear loops keep the buds in place during heavy exercise without any discomfort<br />3.  Lightweight and balanced: unlike the earbuds with the inline mike and controls, the weight of the cable is distributed equally, and I don't have to keep adjusting it as I work out.<br />4.  Very good sound quality.  Much richer tones, particularly bass -- compared to other similarly priced wireless earbuds.<br /><br />Cons (two big ones)<br />1.  Several people have told me they have trouble hearing my end of the conversation.  The mic on this unit appears to be positioned poorly<br />2.  Heavy wind interference when outdoors. Even when I am just standing or walking, the slighted breeze whistles across both earpieces.  While lightweight and comforable, the body of each bud is very blocky and not at all aerodynamic.  When I am running outdoors, I find it very annoying.  Nothing can be done to reduce the amount of noise.<br /><br />These would befine earbuds for someone who uses them indoors and does not use the mic very often.  BUt, given my needs, I would not purchase them again.  Next time around, I spring for a little bit more to get both very good sound and an overall better experience."
1,You have done a pretty good job!
1,I am giving you four stars but these are a Christmas gift so they have not been used yet. So I do not know how they sound or work yet.
1,Setup is quick and easy
1,I absolutely love these headphones! They’re comfortable and fit well in your ears. I don’t know how I functioned without them before!!
1,"I'm extremely happy with these, the sound quality is fantastic."
1,I like these headphones and for the money you can't beat them
1,WOW wow wow wow SUPERRR
1,"great headphones! sound is good, durable."
1,"We have bought these twice now. My husband loves them and uses them all the time. They last for a good while and for the price, you can't beat it!"
0,These suck. I had mine for a month and now the charging hole has broken pieces inside and now won’t charge.
1,Adjustable ear bands makes it easy to conform to anyone’s ear size.
1,"I wasn’t ready to spend $100 - $300 on fancy wireless headphones.  I just wanted to connect to my Apple Watch while I work out. These are a great deal, and sound good. I’m very pleased."
1,"Bluetooth takes a while to connect, longer than some similar brands, but overall a fantastic product that I have had no problems with."
0,"Great Sound!  Great Bluetooth coverage area!<br /><br />But, I cannot keep them in my ears while running on the treadmill. I've tried all three size of bids that came with them, no luck. I need help here, if anyone has suggestions. The sound and coverage are useless if I can where them while running."
0,"Linked up good ,Music was good, every time I made/received a phone call the person on the other end heard an eco. I had to disconnect,use my other headset or speakerphone on my Iphone6s. Im back to using my older bluetooth Noot earbuds. I guess Im sticking to the older ones that's lasted for over 2 years."
1,Love them
1,"I decided to write a review even though I rarely do.  I wanted to wait  until I had ran at least 40-50 miles in them.  I will start with the negatives first, simply because they are very few negatives.  I have one nitpick and that is that sometimes you push the actual bud deep into your ear when you use the multi-function button.  If the multi function button was the other bud on top you would never feel discomfort pushing it.  The other negative is a positive for many.  These block out outside noise extremely well.  Great at the gym but I lower the volume settings when running on the road.<br /><br /> Now positives.<br /> Seem very sturdy, and nicely packaged.  They may have a bargain price but feel much more premium then price would indicate.<br /> Sound is very good( coming from wired yourbuds so not a complete audiophile).<br /> They stay in very well.  I have ran rugged trails to roads and they have stayed secure.  I have strange ear shape so I have my left and right bud with different size bud tips.<br /><br />I did have slight skipping on one occasion, although I am unsure if that is the earbuds or if that was network issue streaming music using google music"
1,They are very good so far but the part that holds the ear is flimsy I wish it was more rigid so I could put It on my ear and not worry about it falling off but other wise they are a very good headphone
1,"Amazing product, using it since yesterday and already in love it, high quality with very resonable price , keep it up."
0,"It worked great for about two months. Then gradually the sound quality started to deteriorate.  I am using this device mostly for the TV audio.  It started to get static and break off when I move away even for 5 feet from my usual spot I sit and speeches become unintelligible.  I tried to adjust it with my Appletv thinking it wasn’t the device that had the problem.  I finally decided to contact Amazon Customer Services so I looked at the order number: well, I paid $36 or so and it went down to $19 something.  I discussed it twice with Customer Reps and they would not take it back nor adjust the price. After I contacted the customer services first time, the price on my “order again” went from $19 something to $29!!  I know that the return needs to be done in one month; however you don't expect the product to fall apart in 2 -3 months either.  I am very disappointed in the way Amazon is now conducting their customer services.  Don’t buy this priduct!"
0,Charger does not fit the ear buds and keep falling off my ears. The hook is to high or the buds need to come up some. It would be nice to find adjustable ones.
1,"I sweat pretty heavily, so I shy away from the more expensive models of headphones to use for running.  So far these headphones are doing very well.  The sound is the best so far for a lower priced model.  The big test will be the controls once they get wet.  I have learned not to mess too much with the controls when they are wet.  Just wait until everything dries thoroughly before charging, etc."
1,"I have only had these a couple days, but so far they sound great, and fit comfortably."
1,"Original review:  Died after 3 months of usage.<br /><br />CORRECTION:  Headphones did NOT die after 3 months.  Somehow the setting got accidently changed from stereo to mono causing the problem.  Once changed back to stereo setting, they still work great.  Sorry for the temporary 1 star review.  User error!"
1,"I bought these so I could more easily work out. They are really comfortable, I was surprised. I don't know if I can change the settings, but they are plenty loud even at the lowest volume setting. As long as I don't accidentally have it higher it's at a good volume. The sound quality is great too."""
1,"Great headphones, easy to sync and clear audio"
1,"I do not know how this company stays in business. Why? Because the product is worth more than what they sell it for. Nice packaging, sleek sexy carrying case, car charger, micro usb cable, and an additional long sturdy micro usb cable with a freaking iPhone adapter?! Now to the head phones. They feel great and come with tons of ear bud sizes including a foam one that shapes to your ear! Sound quality is phenomenal for the cost. Bass is deep, but a little distortion when playing loud.  DEFINITE MUST BUY! Very impressed."
0,"These earphones are very loud with is a great quality and fit my ears perfectly. Most earbuds fall right off of my ear because my ears are pretty small. However, I went to the pool to take a swim thinking that these earbuds were waterproof/swim-proof and they stopped working the very moment I submerged my head underwater."
0,"Sound good at first, however within 2 months they started cutting in and out."
0,There is a buzzing in one of the headphones on first use.
1,"Great product for reasonable price. Fit good around my ears and do not fall off when working out. Volume is good, ease of use is good as well."
1,I was reluctant to purchase them because is a brand I never hear before and you know the phrase &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;  and that's more scarier.  Let me tell you how wrong I was and now I wont follow that rule again.  Senso wireless headphones are 1- easy to set up<br />2- Very confortable in my ears<br />3- The quality is very good at the same level of the expensive ones I know my son have one of the expensive brands<br />4- the sound is amazing love it<br />5- I leave my phone in the living room and can go to my kitchen and still it doesn't fail however my distance in not to far from each other<br />6- I highly recommend them and will let my family and friends knows<br />Thank you so much now I can say we can have affordable wireless headphones high quality without have to pay much  amazing  :)
1,"These were purchased for me as a gift and work wonderfully for running. I am a serious marathoner and use the headphones for running easy, hard workouts, or long runs. The headphones stay seated in my ears and sound great even with all of the movement.  I am very sensitive to changes in my running gear, therefore, I was concerned about the cord irritating and bouncing on my neck and shoulders, but this has not been an issue. I don't even notice the cord when I run.<br /><br />The only reason I gave 4 stars for the material quality is the cord clip to adjust the tightness between the headphones detached and is lost.<br /><br />The battery life is awesome and lasts as long as the manufacturer states."
1,Great quality and excellent customer service.
1,"Absolutely amazing headphones. To spare you reading, I'll just jump right into the pros and cons.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) Great sound. The bass is noticeably present but it isn't overdone. If you're an audiophile, you will obviously be disappointed, but if you're a general user who DOES know the difference between good and bad quality audio, you'll be colored very impressed, as I was/still am.<br />2) They fit very snugly into your ear canal, without feeling intrusive. Because of this, it generates very good &#34;noise cancellation&#34; as these headphones don't seem to have &#34;noise cancellation&#34; as a feature, but the headphones DO a good job of cancelling outside noise when listening to music.<br />3) These won't fall out of your ears at the gym whatsoever, unless you're being punched in the face repeatedly.<br />4) Lightweight, but good quality build.<br />5) The amount of THINGS you get!: carrying case, car charger, micro-USB cable, extra buds<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) Not the most aesthetically pleasing to look at from the outside in, but for what they are meant for, who cares?<br />2) People will glasses (like me) will feel a slight discomfort the first few times wearing them. You'll have to adjust how you wear them so the loop sits comfortably behind your year.<br />3) The wire connecting the ear pieces is very thin, so just be careful during storage. Would NOT recommend shoving these in your pocket.<br />4) MicroUSB instead of USB-C :( but this is so minor I don't know why I'm mentioning it<br /><br />Overall, I'm really happy I got these; I've had them for all of a week, and I'm already recommending these to everyone I know, and I'm getting similar responses back."
1,"Love it, it literally tells you when its turning on and off. It also beeps when you can't turn the volume up higher. Great audio feedback. 5 stars because it's fun to use, but 4 because the sound quality is great great, just pretty good."
1,"I bought these headphones during Prime Day and was initially very pleased with the fit and sound.  But, I noticed that the bass in some songs was extremely distorted.  I originally thought that I shouldn't expect much from a $30 pair of headphones and could live with the inferior bass range.  But, I reached out to the company to see if anyone else had a similar problem.  They responded very quickly and initially had me reset the headphones, which didn't improve the bass.  I contacted them again and they immediately sent me another pair and the sound is great!  No problems with the bass at all!  I don't know if I'm more impressed with the headphones or their customer service!  Definitely worth purchasing!"
1,"This was a gift, but my sister seems to love them.  She wears them all the time.  She says it's really nice to not have a cord connecting her to her phone and getting caught on things.  Also, not having to carry her phone on her all of the time."
1,Was gonna get the Beats cordless ear buds but read about these. So happy I did! These are amazing. And not just cuz they’re inexpensive. Love these!
0,"When the  work, they are a great product. Sound quality good, stay in when I run, comfortable and easy  to use. Second pair in two years, though. This one didn't even make it 5 full months. Won't turn on after full charge. Won't purchase again."
1,I just tried these headphones for the first time and I'm surprised for good. The sound is very good and they are perfectly designed to fit well and without being a hassle while running. I would definitely recommend it.
1,They were working great till the sound started breaking in one bud. The warranty was still in place when the sound went out and the customer service and support team were awesome at solving the issue. I am grateful for their speediness and efficiency.
1,These took over for my motorcycle riding. They work terrific! Good product at a great rice.
0,"Not sure if I got a dud, but I will be returning these headphones.<br /><br />In comparison to my previously owned, now lost Plantronics Backbeat Go 2, these headphones -<br /><br />WON in areas of<br />1) Pairing/Control Functions - I like the fact that the controls are on the earbud. The separate console on my Backbeats often weighed down one side of the my earbuds<br />2) Price - my Backbeats were $20 more expensive when on sale at Costco<br />3) Comfort - would stay in my ear longer when jogging<br /><br />LOST in areas of<br />1) Connectivity - my biggest gripe. These headphones did not have the range that my backbeats had and would even lose connectivity while in a clear plastic sleeve attached to my arm. I'm probably dating myself when I say that it sounded like a skipped CD player<br />2) Fit - I would hear wind whistling through the earbuds while on a jog...thought that was a bit strange and the over the ear wraps were too large for my ear.<br />3) Sound quality - was pretty terrible compared to my backbeats. I'm not a big audiophile, but I could easily tell the difference in quality between the Senso and Plantronics. I would have kept the earphones otherwise, but with the lack of connectivity, the earphones had to go back.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this product on the connectiv"
1,Absolutely fantastic sound quality but the Bluetooth is pitifully weak.  Would be a five star product if the Bluetooth worked well
1,This is probably the best head set I have ever purchased. The price is ridiculously low for the comfort and quality of sound!
1,"I love all the accessories it comes with and the hey sound great. This product will definitely save you money compared to its competitors, and the sound is great!"
1,These headphones are awesome! They pair easily with the iPhone 7. They fit well and haven't had any issues with them falling out of my ears. They are also extrmely lightweight. I am going to buy another pair for my fiancé. If you are looking for a solid pair of wireless headphones try these out.
0,Here is how it was. I got my first pair. Lasted 5 months. It was ok not perfect but suddenly died.<br />Got first replacement lasted 2 weeks<br />second replacement lasted 1 week.<br />Clearly a piece of garbage<br />Clearly various quality versions available. You never know how lucky u are
1,"This is my first pair of wireless headphones and they work great.  I use them for listening to coached-music routines while training indoors on a stationary bike.  Nicely packed, chose the earbuds that fit me, paired easily to my old iPod touch, good sound, easy to use volume control on the headphones."
0,"The sounds are horrible, it comes off breaking. It looked great from outside and then the charger was also good but when it comes to the sound, it comes of breaking off. I am very upset. I am tired of products that keeps being sent to me  that are bad. I would not recommend to buy it definitely."
1,"This are good headphones. The only, but major, downside is that they stopped working after 2 years. And its not that I used them every day during this time. I use them mostly during the weekends. Meaning they lasted around 200 days which is the equivalent of 6 months if you use them daily. Sound quality was good."
0,Were working perfectly but then died of no apparent cause. I've seen similar reviews. Sad because they worked perfectly in their less than 4 months life.
1,"Long battery life, comfortable on my ears. The over the ear part tends to fall off ear tho"
1,"The listening quality for books and music seems good, but phone calls and the ability for the receiver of my calls is lacking.  Many complained about the lack of volume and the connecting to audio books was ragged and unreliable without 'fiddling' to get it to connect.  Something I never had with other headphones."
0,"Got these march 20th 2017. WAs very happy with them at first. Good sound quality for price, and stayed in my ears just fine on my runs. But last night they just decided to quit working. I thought they had just died, so I charged them all night. Won't turn on at all. Very disappointing."
1,Customer service was amazing.
1,The headphones are satisfactory. After 6 months of using them the sound in the left earpiece started to fade a bit but for the price I paid the performance was pretty good.
1,The headphones are great.  No complaints
1,"These are great, professional grade headphones at an unbeatable price!"
0,"Trash. Right bud is all static. Left ""works"" but sound sucks. Got these for the gym bag but they won't see the front door."
1,Excellent. Been using it a month. Good sound. Battery has a long life. Range is also excellent. Anywhere in my house with no drop out from the source.
1,"I like it loud without compromising on sound quality. I've tried JBL, Beats, and Plantronics, all to my disappointment. They just wouldn't get loud enough for me. These were not only plenty loud at 80% volume, but I had to go into my iPhone settings and adjust the EQ to my taste because there was too much bass!<br />The signal is slightly compressed, but not to the point of annoyance. I haven't heard any distortion yet (Probably thanks to that little bit of compression.) Frequency response is good. Harmonic distortion is a little better than normal for earbuds. (At high volumes, you can't really escape those detuned low notes, without going to big over ear phones with desicated low-end drivers.) Very impressed, especially at this price."
1,This is one the greatest headphones I have purchased for the price and the quality. I am runner and it makes my run fun. I listen to music for long hours and the sound is excellent. What I like is that it sticks to my ears and do not come out no matter my running speed. Rain or shine it is still works perfectly.<br />I have been using it since July 2017. The first one I bought has a manufactured defect and Senso customer service addressed the issue quickly and replaced it. I really recommended these headphones. No one should spend money on expensive headphones when these are just as good.
1,Works great.  Easy to setup.  Highly recommend.
1,"I'm only giving these 4 stars for right now because I've only used them once but the one time I did, the sound was amazing and they were comfortable on my ears. Good buy for the price!"
1,Awesome headphones love all the accessories just ordered 2 more for family members
1,"Great range, (better than Plantronics) for listening to music.  Mic picked up my voice nicely.  Battery life so far, has met my expectations.  Bluetooth sync's easily to my galaxy S6.  Finally, the ear buds sit well on the ear.  Overall good value."
1,Great Product
1,I had bought a pair of headphones and they stopped working within the warranty so I called the company and they are replacing them now! Love this sound quality and the ear piece size options. I still use the car magnet!
0,"Like the sound quality, but....purchased for the stated - noise cancelling feature.<br />These did not cancel any background noise from the plane engines.<br />If you press them in tight, they muffle the noise, but then you have to turn up the volume to hear music.<br />Loud volume is not what I wanted for the flights.<br />seller needs to change product title - these are Not Noise Cancelling headphones.  Misleading"
1,"love these things.  they stany on, even in really intense tumbling/gymnastic sessions.  i sweat a lot and they have kept up for over a year now.  the charge is pretty decent considering the size.  and not only is the audio output great, but the audio recording is great as well. it took me a long time to find a headset that would do all of that and i am really impressed that people on the other end of the phone can hear me clearly without background noise."
1,I was looking for wireless headphones that had good audio sound and wasn’t going to break the bank. These are quality headphones with crisp sound and loved the price. I know you get what you pay for and so far these have been great!
1,These are great head phones. Sound quality is Great. I use them to workout and the stay in place
1,"I own a pair of power beats 2 and decided to try the Senso due to all the positive reviews. They are pretty decent, but the sound quality is not near to the power beats. The lows and the bass sound is way better on the power beats. Senso are a good choice if your budget doesn't allow you to buy the power beats."
1,"The fit is a little loose, but sound is great and setup is easy."
1,Love my new Bluetooth headphones. Definitely worth it
1,"Love these. Very nice quality.  They work quite a good distance from my phone. Easy pause ability by pushing large button on right ear. Volume controls also available on top of right earbud.  No issues at all. Quite comfortable. I use them mostly to stream The Tom Leykis Show every afternoon, but music quality is good too."
1,"I've had 5 BT buds..<br />these pair great<br />range great<br />Best battery life ive ever seen by far by far ..I could say 12 hrs no prob..sounds like over hype ..<br />its not..<br />comfortable and hooks are formable and stays how you want,,,great<br />sounds great<br />cable is not annoying ..lays flat,,<br />cable is not on the hook part,,Great<br />nothing I don't like"
1,"These headphones are an amazing find! They sound and fit great... come with extra charging cables and 3 sized of earbuds, all of which fit into the perfect size case. They are 25% of the price of comparable sets and the quality is exceptional. I highly endorse this product and I paid full price for this product, this is not a paid endorsement."
1,"They beep ALL OF THE TIME. And it’s super loud in my ears.  Since I’ve gotten them this has been happening, I wrote in and never heard back.  Even when they are fully charged they will beep. I did read in the reviews that some people said this happened and I was naive enough to think I would get a pair that didn’t.  Don’t buy these, I’m sure there’s better blue tooth headphones out there.<br />If you don’t mind random beeping the entire time you use them, yes the sound quality is good."
1,Amazing quality for great price
0,"Sound keeps cutting out as if it has a bad connection despite being wireless and has minor yet routine static, popping and other white noise issues while using it. Its range is also confoundingly bad. I can leave the connected device laying on a table about 6 feet away and the connection will get no worse than stated above, however If I simply have the device its linked to in my front shirt pocket (so that it's no more than 16 inches from the headphones) and I so much as put my arms in over the shirt pocket as if working on something in front of me or so much as turn my head to the right, I lose sound. Let alone if I keep the connected device in a pants pocket, then it becomes unusable. I tried to link it to other devices and had the same issues with the headphones and I connected other Bluetooth headphones to my devices and had no issues with them, so through process of elimination I've concluded that the problem is indeed these headphones and not the other devices."
0,If I could give it zero stars I would. It's absolute junk. Don't waste time and money
1,"Light weight, blocks noise out well, and plenty of volume. Great so far!!"
1,"Great with music or using to connect the phone in the car, comfy fit too."
1,"Great product, in fact I was pretty amazed."
1,great product and easy to use
1,Really solid headphones for the money.  They have good battery life and hold a charge very well when not in use.  I find them to fit well and stay in my ears when I'm running.  My only complaint would be that the sound quality is somewhat muddy and dark.
1,"This is the second pair of earbuds I buy here. These were for my wife as she bought a cheap pair at Marshals and they gave out on her. These stay in your ear and have good sound quality. I use foam plugs I bought here on Amazon to use in the buds. They help with blocking out noise. You can’t go wrong with these earbuds . They stay in place,good battery life and the wire almost guarantees you won’t lose them."
0,"The designers tried to make the ear piece extra flexible for either comfort or conformity to the ear, yet it just ended being ridiculously soft and malleable so that the ear piece falls off with any head movement."
1,"Sound is amazing for the price. Only gripe, the rubber pieces that go over the ears, are a little flimsy and will occasionally allow the whole piece to fall out of your ear. Its only happened twice so far, and I was doing fairly intense cardio. Definitely a great guy."
0,I do not recommend. Voice is deteriorated in few weeks. Do not buy.
0,"I bought these hoping I could use them in the gym. I have small ears and even with the smallest ear caps, they do not stay in my ears securely. I'll be searching for another pair."
1,Product works great while I exercise.
1,"While I already have earbuds for my i-Phone which I use while walking to listen to my music, I really like these not only for the sound quality but because I no longer have  a wire trailing out of my clothes."
0,The first pair I bought was very good. I left them at a friends house while traveling so I bought a second pair; they were not the same.  No one can hear me when I use them. I was sorely disappointed with the inconsistency in quality. Thank God my friend sent my older pair in the mail.
1,Very easy to setup.Great sound good fit very satisfied.
1,Use them all the time for the gym.<br />They hace great battery life.
1,BEYYER THEN BEATS
1,I love these headphones! I’m a big time runner and these are seriously the ONLY earbuds that stay in my ears when I run! Others are ok when I walk but running is a diffeeent ballgame. Plus my ears are smaller I love these! The sound is awesome and comfort is the best!
1,"The good:  very reliable Bluetooth connection, truly waterproof headphones that seem totally impervious to sweat a few months in, battery life seems far stronger than advertised, great universal charging cable for lighting and micro USB<br /><br />The OK: sound quality is passable, lots of wind noise when running"
1,"Better than I expected!! I purchased these for working out. They don't fall out of my ears while running.  Sound is great, easy to use! It even came with extra adapters for my car!!  Bonus!!"
0,"You get what you pay for. The sound is adequate, coming from Bose earbuds they're a very noticeable step down but not terrible. The pairing works quickly and I never had any trouble with them disconnecting.<br /><br />My biggest gripe with them is the weight and fit. More specifically one bud is heavier than the other since it houses the controls and the battery. For me the result is that the heavier bud never stays in my ear while at the gym. Even the slightest tilt of my head and it falls out. I tried all the different tip sizes and still it falls out. Readjusting it constantly made it even worse than my wired headphones getting caught so I just switched back.<br /><br />They were only 30 bucks so I can't really be that mad and they do work fine if I'm sitting at my desk but I bought them for the gym and since they fail there they fail entirely for me."
1,"Had a hard time finding the perfect set of earbuds. Til now. LOVE these, Great sound, very comfortable and don't come out of my ears like the last few pairs I have tried. I WILL definitely buy more of these!"
1,Awesome value! Great headphones.
1,They work great. Very happy with them
1,Not bad.  Not stellar either.  Could use more volume.
1,Nice headphones and good price.
1,My husband and I love the head phones. The sound is awesome. We have recommended them to other family membees
0,Waste of money. I am a light user and mine broke within 3 weeks. There is a plastic coating on the outside and it came off after 1.5 week of use. Don't by it not worth the money.
1,the ear piece is larger then I expected it to be.
1,This is an awesome headphone for the price.<br />The sound quality will put many headphones at triple the price to shame.
1,"I bought the first set for my wife. I liked them so much, I'm ordering another one for myself."
1,work great  sound is excellent
0,"Briefly dropped a pair in my dog's water bowl, dried off and they stopped working.<br /><br />Ordered another pair and they changed the over ears to a more stiff uncomfortable material.<br /><br />Blu tooth &#34;Battery low&#34; yells at you even when the sound is low."
1,"Awesome headphones for the price, good clear sound and also comes with a lot of little extra great buy would def recommend to everyone"
1,Overall a great cheap set of headphones. Only problem i have is they aren't super comfortable in your ears.
1,Not bad for a cheap product. Material is cheap. Comfortable when running.
1,So far so good. I keep turning it off by mistake because of where the buttons are so I need to get use to that. I also have to adjust the ear buds so they stay put. I think a lot of these reviews should done after a mont or two of use.
1,I like that they offer different sizes. The range is great at the gym so I don't have to carry my phone around to listen to music.
1,"I haven't had a chance to take them on the road yet, but they work great on the treadmill."
1,These are so easy to use. The clarity is great and they last longer than I expected on a charge. Recommend highly. Very pleased. I am a 65 year old user. If I can use them anyone can.
1,"My headphones are amazing. I liked them so much I bought another pair for a friend. I am able to hear sounds from my music I never knew existed. The battery is advertised as lasting 6 hours at 3/4 volume, I've never needed to raise the volume over halfway. This product far exceeds my expectations"
1,"So far so good. They are exactly as described, arrived quickly, and followed by a friendly email from the manufacturer checking on things. These are very nice for in the gym or mowing the grass. I like the extras too, a car charger and converter cable for charging. Nice."
1,The ear holder is to loose it does not stay in my ear and the distance is less than 10 ft before i hear static
1,"Great comfortable fit with great sound quality and strong signal. Ideal for.all around fitness, running, biking and outdoors."
1,I've used other earbuds for running and found The Senso  headphones to be the best. Audio was very clear and battery lasted at least 7 hours. I would recommend it to anyone.
1,"I loved them, light weight, perfect for running and airplane mode"
1,"I like these better than my beats 3. I'm not an audiophile. These are easy to use, charge, turn on and off, etc."
1,Love these!!! Great price point and great value! Love the  ear size options as I have small eats/ear canal and often times ear buds hurt. There do not. Very simple to use. Use it all the time at the gym!
1,"I just got these two days ago and, so far, I love them!  I fully charged them before I first used them and they seem to be holding a charge really well. Sound quality is great and the range is good too. I was listening to music and left my phone in my room, it wasn't until I was on the other side of the house that I started to lose signal. The house has an open floor plan  but there were at least two walls between the headphones and my phone and I was probably right at that 30ft range.<br />The only suggestion I have is  to have a pair of headphones with different ear buds. I'm not really interested in noise canceling (although it can be nice) and I really like the style of earbuds like you get with a Samsung phone. These would be absolutely perfect if they had that style earbud with this device. But that's just a suggestion, otherwise,  great product!"
1,Great quality sound but volume is too loud even at the lowest setting on my computer and phone. Unfortunately on an Apple device there’s no way of adjusting volume at the lowest setting without sacrificing the quality of the sound. I’m afraid of damaging my hearing so I rarely use these.
1,They are awesome. Sound quality is great. Very comfortable. All the accessories rock: lightening and mini USB charger & Two port USB car plug in. LOVE THEM!
1,Excelente  sound long battery life
1,Bought these for my boyfriend for Christmas when another brand failed to work well.  He loves them!  Sound great and comfortable.
1,"These headphones work great. The sound is great and they have a good range.<br />The only thing I don't like us that they don't fit well in my ears. I tried the different sizes that came with it, but none of them are comfortable. Maybe I just have strange ears!"
1,They keep disconnecting at a certain battery charge level but most the time its seems<br />to work pretty good and the cost was pretty decent so it was worth  I'll keep them
0,"Long battery, inexpensive, sound quality is poor for my taste. Replaced with a set of Mpow."
1,these things are dope as hell.
1,I bought beats last year that were stolen these headphones are the same quality if not better at a fraction of the cost. I absolutely love these headphones very affordable and good quality.
0,I had these for barely over a month and they are already dead.  The battery wont take a charge.  They seem of similar build quality to much more inexpensive options....and I was wrong to think paying more meant higher quality with these
1,I would give it a five star if it had extra features like voice notification when the battery is low vs looking for the ligh. The other feature missing is the reverse or fast forward unless I don't know about it yet. The sound is great and the bass is good. I use this for my gym and walking/hiking activities. So far it fits well and barely notice its on my ears. For the price I would recommend.
0,"Unfortunately my ears are much too small, even for the smallest little rubber replacement pieces. They wanted to fit but the ear coil went WAY over the top of my ear and they just couldn’t stay on properly. Sound was okay, not incredible, but they would have gotten the job done if they had fit my ears."
0,"I used these head phones a lot to work out. They are good, and they stay in your ear very good but they are not durable at all. The first pair I ordered stopped working in less than a year, but I was able to get a new pair under warranty. The most recent pair now only works in the right ear. The left ear stopped working. For the price, they are not bad...but don't expect them to last more than a year before needing to be replaced."
1,"Good buy! Exceptionally easy to use. Put them on and link up. Simple, easy to find button press turns 'em on and links to bluetooth (once they've been set up). I especially like this feature. These are probably the easiest bluetooth phones to get going I've had. I generally don't like ear buds--they never seem to fit my ears--but the clips hold these in place. The clip is soft and not at all uncomfortable. In face they are quite comfortable when worn for a long tme. The sound is above average. Overall very satisfied with these and a happy customer"
1,Used them twice so fdar and they work great.
1,Great battery life<br />Good fit and comfortable<br />Little deep on the bass<br />A great affordable wireless headset.
1,Great for gym!!<br />Not a long range but good quality sound.
1,My son loves them for running!!
1,"It provides the right ratio cost-benefit. It performances as I expected, and the most important, I am based in Mexico, I purchased it online, and I got it here with no issues at all. Thank you for manufacturing a great product which meets high expectations."
1,Only issue is random skipping of songs on my playlist
1,These work great for my home exercising.  They sound great and they stay on really well.  It's so nice not having to mess with cords.  I use them connected with my tablet and they were very easy to set up.  I would recommend these.
1,"I'm on my second pair of these.  First ones lasted fairly well, second ones died today, one day after the 'warranty' ended... That's just wrong.  Looks like it is time to explore a different brand.  Update - I contacted Amazon who contacted SENSO support.  24 hours later there are a new pair being shipped to replace the faulty ones, that is all I can ask for!  These were my third pair of SENSO buds.  The first lasted two years being used for working out every day.  My wife has the second after about a year, and they are working just fine.  I'm very pleased with the support, no hassle, a response via email came about an hour after they were contacted.  Had me try a reset (which is good to know for future reference how to do), and when that didn't work they shipped me a new pair.  The sound is very good and they work well for my purposes.  Performance plus the support and I'm going with 5 stars.  and then 5 months later, same as the previous pair, dead."
1,Second pair of them since I wore the first ones out. They’re great!
1,It's ok but when cord gets wet from gym it sticks and pulls earbud out!
1,Nice product
1,These are my first set of Bluetooth headphones and I love them.  Super easy to set up and connect to my device.  Couldn't be happier.
1,They are light weight and great for running. Also the air vent holder for the car is great and works perfectly for my phone that previously didn't fit in any.
1,I've had them for about a week and they sound great. I went through 2 pairs of more expensive &#34;name brands&#34; and these sound much better and actually stay on your ears. I did a 5 mile run with them and had no problem whatsoever.
1,"I am very happy with these headphones. They are comfortable and pair easily. They are not noise canceling, but a good product."
0,"3 months in, doesn't turn on anymore. Don't waste your money"
0,Brand new out of the box and only the right side ear bud is working. The left is dead silent. I should have known better than to buy these.
0,"2 problems with these headphones. 1. The blutooth is very weak. If you are indoors at a gym, then they are fine. If you go outside, then something interferes with the signal, and the sound gets real choppy. 2. If you are outside and the wind blows, you get a lot of wind noise coming through the headphones. I have a different set of blutooth headphones, and those don't do that. In addition, my other set has no problem with interference outdoors. If you are only going to use these inside, they are OK.  If you are walking from your car to the gym, then the sound will break up."
1,This is my third set so I obviously love them
0,"The main issue I am having with these earbuds is the L and R printed on the side of the earbuds is extremely small.  Even with reading glasses and a magnifying glass, the letters are just too small.  The area available for the L and R is large, but they chose to only use 1% of that area.  Not sure why, but it makes the product difficult to use."
1,Sound is awesome
1,"Set up is easy. The cords, case, etc are great. Sound is HD. Comfortable to wear. Would definitely purchase again."
1,I got these 2 weeks ago and so far they’re awesome!
1,That are great.
1,Awesome!
1,"Amazing product. Nice sound, very light, good battery, speaks and says connention and power status"
1,"This is a great pair of headphones. I have had issues with fit with other brands, and these are perfect.  Sound quality is great.  Microphones is clear outdoors. Very happy with these headphones."
1,"Avid music and podcast listener. Extremely pleased with the performance and cost of these headphones. Like most headphone users I have purchased many that didn't deliver or stopped working after a brief period of usage. The SENSO Bluetooth Headphones have delivered with quick easy link up to my device and really nice balanced tone, bass and clarity for music, movie and podcast media. I will be purchasing these units for gifts this holiday season which is probably about the highest praise I can give any product. You won't regret buying them for yourself."
0,"Repackaging was GREAT, feel good and the sound is really clealy. Bass is really good and for the price you can't go wrong. Well worth the money!!!!"
1,"Have only used them once, but so far they are awesome. Great buy!"
0,Had sporadic cutting in and out.  Stopped working after a few weeks.
1,"Great sound, great fit, great price, great customer service follow up to guarantee my satisfaction. You will not be disappointed in these headphones!"
0,Didnt like it. I would prefer TaoTronics
1,They aren't very comfortable to wear & the sound quality isn't great.
1,"Got mine in November 2016, so I've had them for about 10 months.  Sound is fantastic and they are extremely comfortable and very easy to use.  The microphone sound is very clear, and I have sync'd with my computer, an Iphone 6, 6s, and a 7.  I'm giving it four stars for two reasons: (1) The battery life is not great.  I travel quite a bit, and the headphones start dying between 4 and 5 hours.  That's barely airport and flight time.  (2) Not Noise canceling.  Trust me, it does not cancel noise.  It says &#34;passive&#34; noise canceling, and if it is, its VERY passive.  Other than that, I don't think you can do much better for $33."
1,"Great set of headphones! The sound quality is good, the product quality is great, and it comes with all the extra little pieces.  Great buy, I highly recommend!<br /><br />If all Senso products are this good and priced as well, I will buy more."
1,Works fantastic...sounds amazing...Only small issue is with mic and its little weak to the listener on the other side.
1,love it!
1,Good sound!
1,"I bought these for my husband, and so far he loves them!"
1,This awesome little headset has some great sound inside.  Great value for the price with a very impressive set of features and specifications.
1,"Great sound, fit and easy pairing.  I use a pair of $200 beats ear buds and these don't have quite their range I enjoy them more because of the freedom."
1,I love them!!
0,"No bass in these earphones. And they broke in less than 3 months of use. The left speaker got a faulty connection. The warranty site provided doesn't provide much help, getting them replaced. Otherwise good earbuds for the price."
1,"Gave these as a gift, followed up to see how my son enjoys them and he likes them quite a bit. Only complaint is they don't have magnets on the back of the buds so when he takes them out of his ears he needs to make sure they don't fall while he's doing other things.."
1,I lost the last pair I had so I purchased another. These are the best they they were great and stay on when working out. The price is great I have no complaints and I recommend this product to everyone
1,They work great and very comfortably for long periods of time. Connects instantly to phone when turned and seems to have very good battery life. Works great for thr gym would recommend.
0,"Well I haven't had any problems, until now, they won't charge and they just quick working. I used them two days ago and then to turn on it doesn't work! So was wondering how to return them!"
1,Exactly what I was hoping for.  Great sounding blue tooth headphones at an affordable price.
0,"Maybe I have small ears, but these things were way too big. The left earpiece wouldn't stay in (admittedly, I have trouble getting things to stay in that ear, so maybe my ear canal's a weird shape) and the hooks that go over the ears sat way above my actual ears. So by the time it was low enough to touch my ear (where it should sit), the actual earbud was totally fallen out of my ear (this was on both ears).<br /><br />So I guess if you think your ears might be a little on the smaller side, you probably want to try a different product."
1,"Excellent product. Loud and fits well in ear, charge lasts over 4 hours. Delivered on time and as expected. Clarity of sound good and a bit of noise cancellation."
1,"My first wireless, bluetooth headphones and I didn't know what to expect. I haven't used it much (3x), but I've realized that the over-the-ear piece is kind of flimsy BUT it stays intact when I'm running ... I just wish it was a little bit more firm.<br /><br />The quality of the sound is nice, really nice. The only drawback is the loud feedback/noise I hear when it's windy outside. Yet I'm not sure if I need to adjust the size of the ear piece or just wiggle it around to minimize the noise (still experimenting on this).<br /><br />What also dropped this review from a 5-star to 4-star is I like to wear headbands that cover my ears when it's cold outside and because of the profusion of the earpiece, it makes it somewhat uncomfortable. It presses into my ears and after long periods of use, makes my ears sore. I'll have to see what happens when I put my snowboarding helmet on how the comfort level feels.<br /><br />I really LOVE the fact that there are no wires to get in my way!<br /><br />Reviewed MANY other wireless, bluetooth headphones and these are the reasons I chose the SENSO:<br />(1) wireless, bluetooth, tangle-free capability<br />(2) waterproof, sweat proof protection<br />(3) positive reviews"
0,Do not stay on my ears secured
1,"Great price for the product. The Bluetooth does get lost eveyonce in a while during a run if my phone is in my pocket, but it quickly regains connection. Sound quality is just okay. For the price though, totally worth it! And the charge lasts great!"
1,Affordable and work great. Not as cool as AirPods. Gets the job done.
1,Amazing support team and great customer service!!<br />I had an issue with my order and they replaced it for free.<br />Great earphones for an awesome price!!
1,So far they are good. I had a couple of times where they would cut off. My phone was in my pocket so it was not far away. Sound is good so far. Will update.
0,"I returned these because they did not fit my ears. The ear “hook” was just that, a hook! They were silicone & soft, but not flexible! They would not wrap securely around my ear, and as a result, they fell out. Don’t buy these if you plan to use them for running. I contacted the seller and was told maybe a pair slipped by quality assurance. So I bought 3 different models from this company, and yes….they all “slipped” off my ears. I returned them all."
1,"For anyone trying to decide which earphones to buy, you may wanna consider these . I was almost put off by the lower price, but after reading the reviews, I decided to buy. I bought 2 sets, one for me and for my trainer. Sound quality, cost, comfort won't disappoint."
1,BY FAR A SUPERIOR BLUE TOOTH LISTENING EXPERIENCE  QUALITY GREAT LIGHT WEIGHT SUPERIOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AS USUAL I LUV YOU AMAZON
1,"Light weight, great sound, they stay on, great product.!"
1,"Perhaps I'm being unfair and it should be five stars, but it cuts out sometimes almost like a short. The sound however, is terrific."
1,Better than expected. Comfortable to wear and sounds very clear.
1,"Why is there a continuous blinking light on at all times? I use these primarily in a darker setting and the blinking blue led is ridiculously obnoxious. I've put electrical tape over it. All the blinking is completely unnecessary. Otherwise, they do the job. I've had them for almost 2 years now and they're still going strong so that says something."
1,"great sound & very loud, too."
1,Works great! I loved it so much I ordered another one for my mom.
1,Works well and is as described
1,my wife thinks the world of them. great sound im very happy with my purchase
0,"The sound quality on these headphones was good considering the price, but the build quality is cheap and they broke after only 10-12 uses."
1,"I really really liked these for the first couple months. Lately they are having some issues though, only one side works well. But i did get the warranty."
1,"I bought these about 16 months ago. I’ve  used them for everything from exercise to garden/yard work to computer work. They stay firm and comfortable for me.<br /><br />They have been very durable for the price. A little bulky looking at first, but they have great battery life. I still get over 8 hours from a full charge.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it’s time to replace them since the wires have developed a loose connection from wear and tear. No complains, they have been well worn.<br /><br />The only negative marks I could give these are there seem to be a few bugs in the firmware. This can cause disconnects and difficulty connecting. Nothing a headphone/Bluetooth reset can’t fix. This may be fixed in current versions.<br /><br />Also these a VERY loud. Even the quietest volume is too loud for casual listening. I fixed this by stuffing a tiny cotton ball in them. Though... at times the excessive volume is a great feature... like when drowning out loud kids :).<br /><br />Overall ... I’m very satisfied with price, performance and durability."
1,"Comfortable and easy to use. They paired beautifully with my iPhone 6. Having the car charger and extra cable so I can charge both my phone and earphones is very convenient. Because they are waterproof, I don't worry about using them if it is snowing or raining."
1,"great sound , great price, great fit"
1,Really great headphones; I was pleasantly surprised given the price point.  As good as the more expensive brands on the market.  Packaged very nicely and works wonderfully with my iPhone and Apple Watch Series 2.
0,bluetooth worked okay..with two different devices..but the sound is god awful...anyone that says different needs their hearing checked..but for the price i took a gamble
1,"Have had mine for 1 1/2 years last week after a 3hrs bike ride I forgot that they were placed in my back jersey  pocket and they went into the washer....after two days of drying I put them on thinking that they were cooked but they played with no base. I let them dry for another day and the base came back they are functioning normal now. The only caveat I have is be careful when charging make sure you don't bend the cord back too far as it's pretty close to the charging port and you can create a short that can cut out the left speaker, this happened with a previous unit several years ago,"
1,awesome sound.  much better than i expected! Great job Invotek
1,I have no real complaints except if i purchase another set I would look for the ear buds that have the controls away from the ears to cut down on the bulky look. I do like the wireless part of this technology over the wired earbuds I was using.
1,Amazing headphones simply superb.<br /><br />Little bit of advice though don't double click the big red button or it ends up calling your ex girlfriend. Thanks invotek
1,"Great for the price. Nice, solid feel and clean finish. Easy to use and plenty of functionality. Pairs easy. Sound quality is what you would expect at this price range via Bluetooth, nothing audiophile but great for the price"
1,For my job it works great
1,"The sound is at par with earphones twice the price I had before. Bluetooth pairing fast, and battery holds all day. I have no complain though Im sure the customer support is responsive judging from the personalized after-sales follow-up on their product."
1,Good sound...great controls...but i really wish the ear pieces were flexible and adjustable.  I wanted these for running and the ear pieces dont really hold them in place.  Good value though.
1,"Average set of headphones.  I use it mainly for running and so far so good.  Sound is good, but a bit on the muffled side.  Connection is simple via bluetooth.  One star off for intermittent drop off of sound between device and headphones.  Decent quality for the price."
1,"Great, does the job except the cord is a little too long. My wife has the anker sport headphones and it fits perfectly. Only reason I went senso is because of its overall ratings and the fact that the audio buttons where on the actual headphone and not the cord. Might have to switch over to anker and deal with the buttons dangling on cord."
0,I could not pair it to my smartphone any longer after I used for around a month.
0,"These headphones worked great until they completely cut-out and stopped charging... I used these at the gym every day for about 2 months until they completely failed...I don't really know what happened, but very disappointing."
1,Paired well with iPhone 7 plus. Working well.
1,"Did my entire workout with these headphones. Great sound quality, crystal clear music and it blocked out the annoying pop music over the speakers. Felt very light and comfortable. Never once slipped out of my ears while running or lighting weights. Great product!"
1,Too soon for a meaningful review but VERY impressed so far. Will follow up 👍
1,"Don' let the 3 star rating turn you away, I just am not that fond of them. They just don't fit my head / ears and are kind of heavy, and tend to slide off when hanging around my neck, even under light movement.<br /><br />On the other hand, they are LOUD! They have pretty deep bass response, almost too much for me! They connect quickly and easily, and have an AMAZING battery life in comparison to most other devices I have used. Truly 6-8 hrs of continuous playback on high to max volume. That is rare."
1,Good price and quality !
1,I really love my new headphones.
1,They fit perfectly nice and light  great batter life
1,"Didnt have the highest expectations, just wanted headphones that wouldn't fall off while i was on the treadmill. Kinda crappy sound quality but way better and more convenient than some of the other options"
1,"The Senso Bluetooth Headphones came a day after I ordered them.  The directions provided were easy to follow and I was able to quickly sync the headphones to my Android phone.  They were easy to adjust, and I liked that three pairs of tips were provided so I could customize my listening experience.  A compact case is provided and it's protective enough that I can throw it in my purse or backpack without worrying about damage to my headphones.  Finally, they were inexpensive and the best wireless headphones I've owned."
0,They worked ok at first. Within the first 6 hours of use they started dropping Bluetooth connection randomly and only got worse. Also became very uncomfortable after about 30 minutes. The one good thing I can say is the battery life lasted as long as it was supposed to.
0,Was very sastisfied until last week when it stopped working.
1,It sounds awesome and is great quality for the price!
1,"When I first got them, it was great, sound was great, no sound interruptions great bass, etc. I got this end of Jan, and they’ve recently started having sound interruptions. Definitely not something you want when you’re in the groove exercising on the treadmill or something."
0,"Terrible, fall out of my ears all the time. The sound quality sucks as well and could be better. Guys if you buy a headphone invest in a good one. You won’t use this."
1,"They work well and sound good. The only annoyance is that the cord is a bit gritty and when working out, it can get caught on my neck when sweaty. Generally happy with the item."
1,"All I have to say is that after two and half years of serious use, training, abuse, etc - these things have NOT failed me.  They sound great, last a long time, take all kinds of abuse, charge quick and easy - they just do EVERYTHING right.  There is not a single doubt that I am buying these again - if they ever even die on me.  I love finding a great product at a great price.  I almost want to buy three or four more sets so I have these for the next ten or twenty years.  Seriously, for $20 - my goodness.  God bless this company."
1,These earbuds are great for the price. I own a pair of Bose earbuds and these are a great alternative to the higher priced Bose. I am pleasantly surprised how good these are!
1,Easy to use and awesome sound.  I have purchased other Senso products and they back their products with a great warranty and service.
1,"Great sound quality, comfortable to wear, and come with a nice case. I took off one star because they fall off my ears fairly easily and because it would be nice if the battery lasted longer."
1,"I bought these for use at the gym and trail runs. I absolutely love them! They stay put, have great sound quality, and we're really easy to set up."
1,"These were a gift for a family member who is active and uses them while working out. He likes the quality of sound and bass response. He mentioned that it took a while to get used to the shape/size/weight of the product at first, but since becoming accustomed to them he is quite satisfied. Battery life is good also."
1,Awesome product.
1,Great for the price!
1,"I LOVE THESE! They charge super fast, and have stood upto daily use for months. I'm a woodworker, so I always have headphones in to listen to podcasts / music / etc. It's also great to talk on the phone with these. After owning so many bad headphones, I'm so glad to have found these."
1,Unfortunately I have a hearing problem so this did not work.  It was not loud enough.  Sorry I can’t be of more help.
1,"love the headphones, they are great  and for a great price, will definitely recommend"
1,"My wife is a dedicated runner and has been using these for a while now. She is good at testing the headphones that I buy her and these have held up well with sweat exposure. The only difficult part is getting the charging port cover open, but that's probably what makes a good moisture seal."
0,"they work good,,,but what i wanted them for..for the pool,does not work...not very happy"
1,These buds are awesome!!!<br />They stay in during heavy workouts!!!<br />Just what I was looking for..
1,"Love, love, these earphones.  Sound quality is wonderful. They fit nicely in the ear and are comfortable.  At first I had trouble getting them paired with my iPad.  They worked wonderful with the iPhone but could not get them to work with iPad.  I wrote the company via email and in about 10 minutes I had the response and easy solution.<br />Now I'm all set to using them daily.  They came with a nice carry case and charge cord.  Quick to set up to use with a good eight hours of use before I need to recharge."
1,"Love these earbuds..I would like to say this product is of fine and durable quality for a very good price. The wireless Bluetooth connection works well and gives a very good sound quality.  It comes with a neat carrying case, usb short charging cable, a car charger, extra ear earbuds cover and a wire tie. I own a pair of beats headset so i was able to compare the quality of sound and I can say the sound from the SENSO is very good.  it looks very smart and I would most certainly recommend to others.."
1,Perfect for working out - volume is loud and I can get into my zone. Good purchase for the money.
1,These headphones performed extremely well I’m purchasing another pair because I stepped on mine and broke them. My only concern is the bass drowns out the mids and highs. But for $30 I’m not complaining.
1,"After one week of use. Fits really nicely on my head and very comfortable. Battery level indicator on phone is helpful. Battery life is accurat Bluetooth pairing is a snap with my iPhone. Great value for the money. Compare Senso to expensive Powerbeats: Senso sound is almost as good as Powerbeats. The distance you can put between devices is about half of Powerbeats (Powerbeats will receive signal two rooms away, Senso will receive one room away) The big difference is that the Senso is so affordable that if you lose them it won't break your bank to replace them."
1,Works grest for me. Good sound on music and voice isnt bad. Great for price.
1,"Senso's  response was immediate, simple and satisfactory."
1,"I like the sound, but find that it starts breaking up whenever I leave the room that contains my tablet or computer.  It also breaks up if I move around a lot.  The design of the earbuds make them difficult to fit the ear and they are uncomfortable after wearing them for more than 15-20 minutes.  The fit would probably be better if the part that goes around the ear was more firm."
1,Sound is good and easy to connected. Shipinged was fast! I loveit.
1,"The pair I ordered in December stopped charging. Not sure why, but I tried all of the resets advertised. So contacted customer service. With a few email exchanges (no big deal) they sent me a brand new pair. Awesome!  The new pair works just fine. Great customer service!"
1,fit great.. love them!!!
1,Got a chance to work out with these in yesterday and was very surprised by how comfortable they were! They stay connected to my phone the entire time I worked out and the sound quality was absolutely amazing! I would definitely buy these again.
1,Very happy with them.
1,"If you ride a bike or run fast or even walk on a windy day. You will hate these headphones. The wind noise hitting the large headphone body make them pretty unusable. They are also so bass heavy they will make your head hurt. I had to Eq the bass in order to even make them usable. Not much high end, they sound muddy. For the price they are ok. If you are using them to work out in a gym you will probably like them. But the wind noise is crazy on them. be warned."
1,"Love these buds!  I've been used to wearing the LG around the neck buds but decided I'd like to move on to lighter weight buds and a design that wouldn't fall off when i do situps in the gym.  Had my mind set on buying the Beats brand but decided to give these a try given the price difference along with the awesome reviews by nearly 3,000 people.<br /><br />Getting the Product.<br />I live in OH so the package arrived the next day as it came in from KY. Opened the box, put the headphones on, and immediately impressed.<br /><br />Comfort.<br />Feels completely weightless and VERY comfortable.  I normally can tell right away if earbuds will not be comfortable long-term and will immediately look for another product (discomfort doesn't get better with time...right?)....I CANNOT feel the buds rubbing against my ears.  I know they're there because music...beautiful music...is being pumped out but man the comfort is ridiculous.<br /><br />Sound Quality - The sound quality is amazing.  With my LGs I had to adjust and turn up as loudly as possible to get the desired effect and still wasn't satisfied.  I put these guys on and the sound is amazing....so i think I MUST have the volume on my phone up high....NOPE.....my iphone 7 is at about 3 bars for volume....I'M FLOOOOOOOORED! So i turn the headphones up to see the differences and it's just amazing.  Played different types of music Nina Simone, Lenny, Adele, Chaka etc JUST TO CHECK and it's amazing that every track sounds crisp and clean.<br /><br />Definitely would recommend these headphones.  Won't be buying another brand as long as I have these.  Considering purchasing another set for my wife just to have a back up in the house.  I won't post a pic as the pics in the add are spot on and true to what they say comes in the box."
1,After owning two sets of the PowerBeats wireless and being disappointed with their reliability given the price I am happy to report the SENSO option is a suitable replacement. The ear piece can be manipulated to fit your ear and the sound is just as good as the powerbeats in my opinion.
1,"Very poor bluetooth connection - just about anything in the line of sight will cause a connection cutout.  Sound quality is subpar.  Somewhat painful in ear ( no, I don’t have small ear canals). Don’t stay put during active movement.  Pushing pause tends to open some other random app and start playing something or dial your last call.  If you're looking for a cheap bluetooth earbud, these work, but you get what you pay for."
1,"I ordered these to wear at the gym and I was very happy with the product, the sound is great especially for the price, even better than $175 pair that I had. But on that note do to me sweating at the gym the first pair failed But I contacted the cellar/ manufacturer and they replace them pretty fast for me and II bear have been great."
1,These pair easily with my phone and stay on. Sound quality good.<br />These were a returned pair/used pair -  it was not fun to change out the earwax flecked earphone covers ( but I quickly put on a clean pair and kept as I was leaving for a trip the next day and desperately needed headphones.)
1,"Has not failed me yet. Good packaging, nice that they included several sized ear buds. Great value for cost"
0,"I bought these headphones for running and strength training and am very dissappointed.<br /><br />They are a huge distraction during both activities.<br /><br />For running:<br />They constantly come unseated from the ear canal, only hanging on by the loop that goes over the top of the ear. Also, the free cord that connects each ear piece is very annoying as it flops around on your shoulders. I tried using the tie pieces but they slide down after a few steps due to sweat and their purpose is defeated.<br /><br />For lifting:<br />The free cord is a major issue with head turning. It will drag on the back of your neck with head movement and constantly tug on each ear piece. This has me constantly readjusting how they sit in my ear canal.<br /><br />I'm skeptical that any of these reviewers have actually exercised in these headphones...."
1,"Pretty amazing!  I was able to go to the garage, 30 feet from computer, and maintain perfect reception. Easy to use, easy to charge.  Good sound."
1,Excellent quality or sound.  Easy to use and the charge lasts a long time.
1,works as expected. the product also includes a quality iphone/android cable and a car charger. good value.
1,"I wanted some bluetooth ear buds so I could get rid of the cord. I listen to audio books while working in the shop and the a dangling cord gets in the way.<br />These ear buds work great. The  connected to my phone with no problem.<br />I like the voice that tells you if they are on or off, no guessing if you hit the button right.<br />Added plus was they have a built in mic. I must have missed that in the ad.<br />With the mic, I can answer the phone<br />Great ear buds."
1,In the gym. A good product
0,"My old pair worked great, but then my dog chewed them up. The new pair cut out Everytime I turn my head. Very irritating and I didn't manage to get them in the mail before my return label expired. I am going to order a different brand this time."
1,"Just incredible.  These are comfortable and the sound is outstanding.  Maybe a little too much bass for some , but these sound much better than many high dollar pairs I have heard!"
1,I have been through at least six headphone over the last 15 years. This set works great and I hope it continues to do so. Bill E
0,"In ear headphones never seem to work for me although the memory foam earbud adapters for these worked great, until 1 month in and the foam fell apart. I guess you get what you pay for. I’d buy replacement foam covers if I could."
1,Love them. Like the on/off ability to change to next song and volume control. Plus other features I haven’t used yet. Sounds great to me. I use them to run with
1,Good value for the peice
1,"Purchased these primarily for workouts and dog walks. Great value for the money - I wanted something inexpensive so I don't need to worry about losing them or destroying them. However, they don't seem flimsy - they worked well even though I put them in the wash by accident.<br /><br />Pros:<br />  * Cost<br />  * Stay snug in ear during different types of exercise (running, weightlifting, yoga, walks)<br />  * Audio quality sufficient for audiobooks/podcasts, haven't tested on music as much<br />  * Charge seems to last for a while<br /><br />Cons:<br />  * Controls are sometimes counter-intuitive. Have had it accidentally &#34;Dial last number&#34; rather than power off a few times. I wish they were simpler - just on/off and pairing mode.<br />  * Placing phone in my pocket can lead to very choppy noise. I haven't compared this with other BT headsets though and don't know if this is a simple interference issue that nothing would solve, phone issue, or headset issue."
1,ok
1,Awesome quality and sound...  I bought a 2nd pair...  better sound quality than my former pair ... beats
1,Long battery  ✌🏽♥️
1,I am very satisfied with my wireless headphones. They were easy to use. They're light and the earpiece is flexible so it molds to my ear shape.
1,"These work great!  Very comfortable and easy to use while running. You can adjust volume, skip songs, on/off and pair to your device very simply.  I would recommend to others"
1,"Very nice packaging. Comes with everything you need to get started along with power cables for the ear buds and your iPhone/android phones too with a car power adapter. Give them a charge and listen. Btw don't judge the sound quality right away, while quite good to start with, they do get better after a few hrs of use. All in all, these 5 star reviews aren't a fluke, or SENSO employees, these seem to be a really nice Bluetooth earbud especially at this price point."
1,"I didn't expect studio quality sound, but I loved the price point and great reviews. The product has met my expectations perfectly. The item is well packaged with a few bonus extras that were welcome. The headphones are lightweight, easy to pair, remain secure, and provide more-than-adequate sound quality for my needs. People on the other end of the phone said the quality was just fine, but I also didn't have a lot of background noise. They stay in place well both during weight lifting and running. I also took some time laying down to stretch and never felt like they slipped around. They honestly were easy to forget you're wearing despite the music in your ears.<br /><br />Dropped a star because: The ear hook feels flimsy, but I'll admit they stayed secure.  The LED indicate is tough to see and a little sketchy IMO.  Last, and most important, I was having connection problems when the phone was in my left pocket and, apparently, the bluetooth antenna is in the right ear piece.  I never lost connection, just a few brief losses of audio."
1,I’m a sweater and the earpieces still pop out. I’ve tried every size. Still haven’t taken them to the pool but I lose connectivity with in 10 ft so I doubt going 25 meters away from my phone will allow it to work.
1,"Works great, just wish it had a little more volume.  Other than that, cant complain."
1,Absolutely love these earbuds! Sound quality is great
1,If you are looking for a low priced semi-decent sound quality BT earbuds then give them a try.  After years of running with wires I decided to give wireless a try.  Set up was easy and I had no problems with connectivity.  The problem soles im with the sound. They have WAY too much bass for me and not nearly enough trebile. Unfortunately there isn't a way to adjust this. For some it might be ok but for me I'm going to have to spend the extra $$ on a better pair. Hope this helps steer some of you in the right direction!
1,I was excited for these headphones some thing were a down fall- they do stay on your ears and block out enough noise. The power button is easily pressed and has made calls by mistake when in my purse. There is a lot of static and interference when I use them to commute to work. I decided to keep these for the gym and home instead. Overall I got what I paid for but they are good quality.
1,I like it alot! only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because my wife says the design causes some discomfort inside her ears.
1,They sound great and they fit in my ears good but I hate the over the ear clips.  They are too soft and pliable and they don't stay put.  Luckily the headphones stay in my ears pretty good without the clips.  I would definitely recommend these despite that.
1,I love these headphones. The earpeice is flexible and the sound is great
1,"Just got these wireless bluetooth headphones. Sound is very good. I use these while working around house, walking and riding my bike. They worked great. My only problem was while riding bike I take one ear bud out to hear traffic, the headphones seem to try and pull out of other ear. I would recommend these headphones, price is good also."
1,I haven’t had any issues with these headphones. They are great for running or walking and I don’t have an annoying cord connecting to my phone.
1,"These headphones are amazing. Pros: amazing sound and light weight; battery life was great (all day use and still at 90% - not sure how); easy to connect to my phone - no code needed; clear voice quality when using with phone (initial issue with background noise, tried again with another call and it was great). Cons: will not stay in my ear eventhough I tried all the ear buds (I think is  a personal issue for that I had issues with other ear buds) But that's my issue not the products.; problem staying connected eventhough my phone was in my hand or back pocket."
0,Too large
1,good headphones. arrived early. no problems.
1,"I love these headphones and the customer support!! The best customer support I have ever had with ANY company. Contacted them because my set kept disconnecting and powering off with no warning and tried a solution they offered. It didn't work and they sent me a replacement because of my warranty. All done in one day over email! Will look forward to other products from this company. The product works amazing too, nice and loud when phone isn't even at Max volume and the quality is super nice. Durability is insane as well had them for months!"
1,This product is worth every penny. I will continue to buy this.  I use this about 12 hours a day for the past 2 years and I have no complaints.
1,"Great wireless headphones with a lot of extras like a case and car charger, USB cord, and extra earbuds of different colors and sizes."
0,"The hook that goes over your ear is not adjustable, so when the buds are in your ear the hook either fits or it doesn't. For me, my ears were too small...I sort think most ears would be too small. I went on a run for the first time with them and they kept popping out of my ears and I kept having to shove them back in or put the hook back over my ear. I was fiddling with them so much that I wasn't paying attention to the sidewalk while I was running, stepped on a pinecone and severely rolled my ankle. I would have gone down hard but lucky for me there was a car parked nearby that I caught myself on. As it was it was some time before I got up to limp home and I hurt for the next several days...so yeah, I really hold no kind feelings toward these headphones."
1,I love these headphones! Easy to use and switches from music to a call with no issues. Clear sound and microphone. I just ordered a 2nd pair for my daughter.
0,"No matter how much I adjust and fiddle with these headphones, they won’t stay in. The bendable arms don’t hold their shape. One would have to sit perfectly still for these headphones to do their job."
1,"Good base, it’s loud but not hurting loud, and full Hd of sound, very comfortable and durable"
1,Fantastic sound quality! They're like surround sound in your ears👍 They fit perfectly to my ears and have various size pieces to ensure quality fit. They charged fast... really enjoying my gym visits and outside jogs with the whole wireless thing...no more fumbling with wires connected to my phone. They're worth every penny. Great customer service. Thank you!
1,"I bought my husband a different pair of headphones for Father's Day but they did not work properly.  I am thankful that we purchased these to replace them.  They work great, light weight, easy to wear and don't cause any ear pain.  Thank you for providing us with such a quality product that he has been enjoying daily."
0,Could not get it to stay connected to my Samsung S6 phone if more than 12 inches away from it. I have other blue tooth items that can stay connected more than 12 feet away. The sound quality was good. I just don't want to hold my phone next to my heart to stay connected.
1,Great product and excellent customer service if you need it!
1,I am so grateful to have found a pair of headsets that deliver quality sound but do not put pressure on my neck.I wear these at work and at the gym.I just bought a pair for our webmaster who was looking for headsets that could work in one ear only.I will next buy a pair for my business associate who loves mine as they accommodate her hearing aides beautifully.Thank you so very much for such a dependable easy to use headset.
1,"Works very well when paired with my iPhone. All controls are in the right ear bud - on/off, volume, song selection. Very easy to set up and use during cardio rehab sessions."
1,the device is functioning well but i am a bit disappointed by the quality of sound.
1,Great! The only problem is the cable.
0,"Quality OK,  but wind noise is the worst I have had with any Bluetooth headphones."
0,"I used these earbuds twice. When i first took them out of the package I used them for about 10 minutes to test them out, followed the directions and turned them off. The next day I tried to use them again, listened to one song and they said low battery, so i fully charged them again. I tried to use them a few days later and they wouldn't turn on."
1,"[[VIDEOID:bae93076bdbd5e80dae1e573c4837854]] I needed new running headphones after my first pair had an unfortunate run in with a thorn bush. I've used regular plug in earbuds forever, but definitely get frustrated with tangles and having them fall out when my ears get sweaty on a hot day.<br /><br />Enter these Senso Bluetooth headphones. They're a huge value for the price; the build quality is very high, the sound quality is good for running/general use (they're not going to blow away any serious audiophile, though), and they come with more accessories than a teenage girl.<br /><br />Connecting them to my phone was seamless, and I had no issues with the audio cutting out like some other bluetooth devices. The headphones are light but don't feel cheap; my only complaint is that the over-ear plastic piece is pretty flimsy. I have small ears, and wish it was a little sturdier so it didn't move around so much. Not worth detracting a star for (they still fit my head and ear fine), just surprising as the photos make them look pretty rigid.<br /><br />The headphones have independent volume control, and a power button. They do need to be charged, but come with two chargers AND a car adapter, which is pretty huge, give that some products come with no cables these days. They seem to hold charge for ~7-8 hours. I used them for a full work day and they still didn't die from low battery.<br /><br />Great value, made even better by build quality and abundance of accessories."
1,"Love these earbuds! Great sound, comfort and service!"
1,"One of the best Bluetooth headphone I ever used, and I tried many, only thing is, after using it for 5-7 hours it starts irritating my ear."
1,"Work, I only wanted them to remove cord tangle, does it. No base, just good for casual listening, don't expect apple or beats sound. Works, paired flawlessly, I am not a sound aficionado but I do like a little base."
1,I purchased senso headphones March of 2017. They were great! In November 2017 somehow during my workouts they started to get low in volume. I emailed customer service their response was fast. They tried to help me troubleshoot. When that didn't work they sent me out replacement headphones under my 1 year warranty . Their customer service is good. Senso customer service made me feel comfortable with my purchase and future purchases I will make.
1,omg i love these
1,Bought these after my Bose headphones quit working after a little over a year of use. I've been very pleased with these. I had a problem with my first pair after about 6 months of use. The customer support was super responsive and got me taken care off. I recommend these.
1,Very nice and comes with other accessories as well.
1,"Great product, great price, amazing customer support."
1,Great sound and very comfortable.
1,"Amazing product, best bang for your buck period for earbuds. I've bought 4 more pair's as gifts and everyone loves them."
1,Probably the best headphones you can get for the money. I have no complaints.  I bought a spare set just because.
1,Perfect set of wireless earbuds for gym.  Easy to use!
0,Do not buy they break really fast
1,"The sound quality is excellent and for the price, it's more than worth it especially with all the accessories of which are included."
1,I bought them to do Jogging and works great.
1,I think that they work and sound awesome. Would recommend them to anyone looking for wireless ear buds who doesn't want to pay big money.
1,"The headphones are great, whether you're running, lifting, or just walking around. The quality is great, it stays on your ears no matter how hard you run, and are just great all-around headphones."
1,These headphones are perfect. Great sound quality and stay on ears without problem. Perfect for my workouts.
1,Works great. Easy to set up. Arrived promptly.
1,Bought these headphones is 2017 (looking for a beats dupe) and they're still in tip top shape today. The music sound quality is phenomenal for a $30 pair of headphones. I use them to workout/run with all the time. I own a pair of the bulky beats solo 3 and prefer the senso because it's much more lightweight. Highly recommend this product for any broke student in need of a pair of long lasting headphones.
1,"Pro: Good sound and battery life.<br /><br />Con:  spend 90% of my workout put the headphones back on my ears.  The cord is grippy and the ear loops are not, so if you put the cord behind your neck, every time you turn your head it pulls the ear piece off you ear.<br />If you put the wire in the front of your neck you only spend 75% percent of your workout putting the ear pieces back on you ears and the wire is in the way."
1,"just what I needed of a pair of bluetooth headphones, sound is great, they are so light weight , so comfy. I'm so happy about them."
1,"Most satisfied I have ever been with a product ever! Let me start from the beginning.  Im a crossfitter and recently decided to put a little bit more running into my fitness lifestyle.  So I plan my 18 week running program to supplement crossfit and head out the door to purchase my running &#34;must haves.&#34;  I only like to run in running shorts that have the built in briefs, thats another story in itself, but lets just say I'm pretty happy (with the fit/ not so much price) so far with the 4 pair of UA running shorts I just purchased.  Next I head over to Target to look for a pair of bluetooth headphones.  Many pairs upwards of $80 to $200, I elected to go with the $57? wireless around the ear &#34;whatever&#34; brand.  Fast forward to a test run on a treadmill and I'm totally POed.  I want the music cranked when I'm working out and all I could hear was the treatmill, with a little whisper of music in the background.  I found myself continually trying to max out the volume which was already pegged out.  Not to mention that the ear piece was extremely uncomfortable.  Fast forward again to Amazon Prime's best seller and this purchase which came in in a quick 2 days.  Never had something more comfortable on and around my ear, sound will make you go deaf, the wire is short enough so its not bouncing around on your neck when running, and the accessories and carry thing well constructed.  So purchases these now, and hit me up for any questions.  Mr. B O B"
1,"Great product , works so well, and easy.. good service"
1,"The headphones are great. They are very comfortable to wear, they don’t fall, have decent sound for the price, and battery last as advertised."
1,"This is my first pair of Bluetooth earbuds, and they only cost $30.  Maybe I’m expecting too much but the bass has that airy, rattly sound to it."
1,Easy to connect ... make sure you headphones are charged before you pair for first time ... great sound ... I use my when I'm walking in the water.
1,"I love these. My first experience with wireless earbuds and I am thrilled. Easy to operate - even for me - comfy, sound great. A+++"
1,Very reasonably priced great sound for the money..came with car charger and accessories..very happy with my buy out did my last blue tooth headphones by leaps and bounds and they were 4x the price..
1,These earbuds are great!  Who needs to spend a ton of $ on Bose when these Senso's are just as good.  They are a wonderful product and I highly recommend them to anyone.
1,"UPDATE: SENSO offered to replace the headphones and ship me a new pair. Great customer service!<br /><br />They stopped working exactly 364 days after I purchased them. Great headphones while they worked, long battery life, strong Bluetooth connection, and sweat proof. Used them running, at the gym, and cycling."
0,Stopped working after less than a year.
1,"Easy to set up, nice packaging, great sound!  Love it!"
1,Sound bass quality is extremely bad.. had to lower the volume in order to reduce static bass noise.
1,"I've used my pair for other a year now, taking them with me to work every day and using the nearly constantly and consiently, so I can attest that they're quite solid and resilient to normal abuse. They're convenient to use, easy to pause music at a moment's notice and such, and I find that the adjustable ear piece works well for hooking it onto your shirt if you're not comfortable with it sitting on your neck Sadly mine have to be retired after a little over a year. Due to a power issue on the inside (I opened it up and couldn't figure it out so i'm buying a new pair for my gf and I) it is shutting off on its own, but it did last beyond its warranty and for such a low price! I'd recommend this to anyone who doesn't want those singular bluetooth earbuds, and I'll be ordering a new pair pair after I hit the Submit button."
1,They work great. Good bass. Great price.
1,"These are by far the best wireless head set I've tried. Once you get find the right ear pieces (I have a different size for each ear) they bring the bass and stay put.<br />  I've used them 3 days a week,  while kickboxing for 1 1/2  to 2 hours at a time.<br />  They paired  easily to my Galaxy phone. I have to say there  is no reason to drop $200 on Beats. More bass would be annoying.  Steve in Plum"
1,"Headphone do the damn job for 36 dollars and free shipping.. louder than samsung level and my old bose headphones. I saw 13,000 reviews and thought hey why not.. All I can say is you won't be disappointed at all.. Sound is great and they actually stay in my ear all night even while sleeping and rolling around.."
1,"I am loving these headphones!  I purchased them to use with a new iPod Nano, and so far they are working wonderfully.  I was able to easily pair the headphones to my Nano, and they fit well on my ears.  The sound quality is terrific, and it is easy to increase or lower the volume.  I have not tried using these headphones to answer a phone call on my iPhone, as I use another bluetooth device for that.  But they are just what I needed for my iPod Nano so I can exercise outdoors and listen to music around the house."
0,They broke on the first use. Left ear bud stopped functioning.
1,Great headphones! The sound is awesome compared to other wireless headphones I've used.  I bought a pair for my wife as well. I had an issue with 1 of the pair turning off automatically for some reason after 5 months of use and I got a replacement without any hassle. Reputable company that stands by their product.
1,Great to have it
1,So far these are great. Comfortable and easy tp use
1,na
0,Worked great for first 3 weeks then died and wouldn't connect.  Then started to work for a few days now dead and wont charge. Nothing.  No lights just dead.  What a piece of crap.  Of course days after return policy.<br /><br /> I bought the tecton haiser BH750 a year ago and it died also.  Hoping to find some brand that lasts at least 1 year??<br /><br />I think these must be affected by sweat and short out battery or something.
1,"Very light and comfortable. Bought 5 pair and passed them out to my family. So far, they are immensely impressed. Thank you!"
1,I have ordered these headphones multiple times in the past and have never had this issue before until my most recent pair that I purchased. The cover leading to the charge input does not shut all the way and keeps sliding off when working out..other than that I absolutely love these headphones and you can beat that price.
1,I have only used them one day at the gym. They worked very well without a glitch. Sound was above average. Not sure of the battery life since I've only used them 1 time.  They fit.in my ear very well. I replaced the tips that came on the headphones with the larger ones. They seal out the outside noise better.  I would recommend these to anyone looking for a good set of headphones
1,"I lose these often. Price is good for this unit which has good, not great sound. Thumbs up."
1,Awesome product!
1,Good for gym or listening music but really bad at canceling noise during calls. Returned.
1,Product lasted 3 months. Now product disconnects from Bluetooth every 20 seconds. All other devices using bluetooth stay connected. Deleted bluetooth connection on phone and reset. Same issues after reset. I have contacted factory to see if they honor 1 year warranty. Will update when I have a response.<br /><br />Updated this to 5 stars. Company responded immediately to my issues. I had another set of headphones in 48 hours. Fantastic support. New buds are working great.
1,"They fit well, nice quality.  Nice volume and bass.  I wish the bass was a little louder, but for the price these can't be beat."
1,comfortable and easy to use and they don't pop out when I am lifting weights or doing cardio<br />&#34;very lightweight and easy to use- seems to stay put without popping out of my ears&#34;
1,Ok
1,"Really a great surprise.  Sound quality, ergonomic fit and functions that overcomes any expectation. Bass and clear distinct between notes makes this Senso, with no doubt,  the benchmark in bluetooth headphones."
1,"I listen to audio books on my phone, in my car whenever or wherever. My nephew gave me and my husband these wireless buds. We both love them. No wires and quality is great. My husband just purchased another set as he very often forgets to charge his. Excellent quality I recommend mend to everyone."
1,My issues are with the ear clips (they would not stay hooked to my ears) and the sounds quality isn't great.
1,Very comfortable to wear. They actually stay in my ears no matter the activity. Love the access to music and how good it sounds. The price was just right. This is the first pair I have had. It paired with my phone instantly. I actually bought this set to use for phone conversations. I am slight disappointed in the quality of the live voice but the use for listening to music more than makes up for this issue. I would reccoment this set for anyone wanting to exercise or relax while listening to music.
1,I love these ear phones. I had a small issue with a rubber piece but the company replaced them quickly. Their customer service is awesome. Would recommend these ear phones to anyone looking for Bluetooth earphones.
0,THESE DON'T STAY IN YOUR EARS AT ALLLLLLLLL
1,Great sound with a decent price
1,Love my headphones for working out!
0,Bought these a while ago but ended up hating it. I'm a long distance runner and I love listening to music while I run. These headphones don't sit tight on my ear and fall off the second I started running. I guess my ears are too small or something but the the material that goes around the ear is actually like a rubber band just wobbles all over the place. The headline for the product is very misleading and isn't for sports that involve your body to move around a lot.
1,They are a comfortable fit. Sound is great. Bough then because of a few things first of all read the reviews which were good. The price was reasonable and they had blue tooth. I paired it with my iPhone7. No one ridiculous cord in my phone. Plus I use the ear buds for hours while I was sewing and didn’t have an problems. No sound problems provided u keep the device that they are paired with close by. Walk to far away and gets a little staticky.
1,These work really well. I hate earbuds normally  but with the over the ear hook they actually stay right where they are supposed to. They were simple to pair and I am really enjoying them
1,"Well designed, high quality product. Loud enough, battery lasts for an eight hour work shift. Very happy."
0,Sound quality isn’t great on these.
0,Not working will not connect to my devices
1,"I use these for long distance running, they're great. I can't attest to the sound quality because I only listen to audiobooks but they are plenty loud and the battery lasts 7 hours for me. I've run with them in the rain and sweating with them doesn't seem to be a problem. I just recently had a problem with them charging up but not turning on and a reset didn't fix it (maybe the rain or sweat did cause a problem) so I emailed the company and they sent a new one that arrived 2 days after my complaint. The original ones lasted for 8 months before the problem occurred. 4 stars for the earphones and 5 stars for their customer service.<br />thanks Amazon & Invotek"
1,Great sound and rear fit. The flexibility ox the around rear piece is cumbersome to maintain continuous fit.<br />LOve the memory foam pair of buds.
1,Delivery was faster than expected. Headset is super comfortable and sounds great. Couldn't be happier. Now everybody in the family wants their own. Great price and value.
1,This earpieces are the ish.. I can finally workout without hearing outside noises.
1,Very easy to sync to your phone.  The ear buds are the most comfortable I have experienced when compared to the 2 other brands I tried.  Good sound quality.  Has really improved my workouts as the gym I go to plays lame music so it's much better to listen to my own.  Would highly recommend as I have had them for a couple of months with no issues.
1,I really like these.  They have great sound especially when you answer an incoming phone call.  Definitely recommend
1,"I've only had a couple of opportunities to use my new Senso ear buds so for. My initial review was WOW! unbelievable sound for a bargain.From the packaging to the look and feel they seem like they would be a lot more. Don't be fooled by the price, these are pretty darn good sounding too."
0,"Nothing but mid range sound, absolutely horrid."
1,Love them! Super comfortable
1,"Given the very low price, I was nervous about buying these.  I cannot believe how comfortable they are and the AMAZING sound.  They do last about 8 hours, connect very easily via bluetooth and I could not be happier.<br />This past week I forgot to charge them up and had to use my old earbuds - which I thought had great sound.  After using my Senso headphones, I will never, never, never go back to my those hard-wired earbuds - they sounded &#34;tinny,&#34; aren't nearly as comfortable, and I constantly get the chord caught on things.<br />Senso, THANK YOU!!!  I am currently deployed in Afghanistan and your headphones make things much more bearable!!"
1,Awesome for the price!
1,I love the head phones. They work great for the gym.
1,SOund is great<br />Easily connected to ipod/iphone via Bluetooth<br />Fast charging<br />Only drawback was the part which wraps around the ear is flimsy<br />The buds stay in the ear through a workout
0,I like the concept but it didn’t work for me. My ears are small so they wouldn’t stay put. The sound also wasn’t too great even for the price.
1,"So far, they are great. No issues and I like that you get two charging cords and the longer one will double as a iPhone charger as well. Sound is better than I expected."
1,"A very good item at a affordable price!"""
1,"Great value for the price!  These are my second pair but the first one were great,  lasted 6 months of hard use in the gym, sauna, hot tub and everyday use.  Believe I got the first pair too wet and the batery wouldn't take a charge anymore.  Still worked just no battery life!"
1,"There are 2 reasons why I can't make it a 5 rating. I would have rated it a 3.5 but that isn't an option<br /><br />1. The michophone is horribly place and as a result, people have a different time hearing me and I have to resort to removing it from my ear and holding it up to my mouth which defeats the purpose of hands free or I just let it hang.<br /><br />2. I wish the battery life was longer. That said, the battery life is about 8 hours as advertised."
1,"I’ll start by saying the price is definitely a good starting point for these but quality is not lacking for what you pay.<br /><br />I purchased these for my girlfriend and we spend a lot of time in the gym needless to say these outlasted some Samsung’s I purchased that died after one day of use.<br /><br />Something I loved and so did she was the accessories the carrying case, and something that surprised us was when we connected it to her iPhone 8plus where the Bluetooth icon was it became a battery indicator.<br /><br />I recommend these for the quality, comfort, the price and the accessories soon I might be buying a second pair so I can replace my Samsung gear circle."
0,"These sound pretty decent for the price but only lasted about 2 months. I take meticulous care of my things. Now they won't turn on, no power, no nothing. I used them running every other day and used them on other days while riding on the train or walking. They should last longer than 2 months in any case."
1,"These are ABSOLUTELY GREAT! And for the price you can NOT believe the sound! Get ya some, no wonder their  the BEST seller!"
0,I've had these headphones for about 5 months. Sound quality is adequate. Not expecting superior sound. All I wanted is Bluetooth headphones to use while I worked out. First problem is there isn't much range between myself and my phone so I have to keep it near me or it loses connection. But why I'm giving it 1 star is now it doesn't even connect. My phone recognizes the headphones but the headphones won't connect. So basically they don't work anymore. Poor product that doesn't last.
1,Good for working out and cleaning house but starts cutting out if I walk more than 15 feet away from my phone.
1,"Really nice, durable and comfortable headphones. I use them for running or training at the gym a couple of times a week, and have also used them outside during a light rain, heavy wind, etc and they've yet to let me down! They also hold a charge for up to a week of use."
1,"Review after more than 1 year of use.<br />Sound quality is decent. Works while running/skipping, though seems to skip/disconnect for few milliseconds/seconds while doing any such activity.<br />Took good care of these headphones, lasted for about an year, now left earphone is not working, looks like some loose connection as it would work only when the cable between right and left ear is held in a particular position.<br />So if looking for a headphone to last more than an year probably these are not the ones else good for about a year."
1,Great sound!!!<br />What I really love is the battery<br />Last forever
1,"They work well but certainly don't hold a charge for 8 hours, more like 5."
0,"3 days of light use in the gym, the sound is dead on the right side. Good design but not much on the quality of the material used."
1,Fit well nice accessories
1,"Bought these as a cheap replacement for workout headphones. They sound great, fit in the ear well, range is pretty impressive. All in all a great pair of cheaper headphones for the gym!"
1,Great Product
0,"I've used these headphones for a few months now. You get about a week of play time if you hit the gym 5-7 days a week, &  listen for 60-90 minutes. The more time goes on the less these headphones work. If I get a dumbbell too close to my phone the music starts skipping, if I walk more than a few benches over the music stops playing, if I even put my phone in the waist band of my leggings the music skips."
1,"Great headphones. Lite weight, easy to set up and sounds pretty darn good for an old pair of ears."
1,Sufficiently loud in high-decible work environment
1,"Have had them less than a week<br />Easy to connect to Bluetooth, sound quality is good. If anything they are too loud (my family says I always complain about that) and I cannot turn them down one more notch. Craftsmanship is good, again only had for a few days."
1,Great works perfect
1,"Noise cancelling, great bass, and easy to set up and use, is there anything else required for Bluetooth headphone? A resounding NO!!! Awesome sound, comfortable to wear the whole day, and I can shut the world out if I want so I can focus on my work. I love SENSO's Bluetooth headphones. I will be getting an additional pair to leave at work while I groove on the original pair at home. LOVE 'EM!!!"
1,My son and I love them so much I ordered a pair for my husband
1,it works for me
1,Better than expected I'm impressed
0,"I've now used it for 3 months, and it doesn't charge consistently anymore. I have to wiggle the charging cable to get it right, maybe one out of ten times to see the red light. I thought it was the charging adapter so I tried both the long and short cables to charge but I got the same result, meaning it's the headphones. I use the earphone exclusively for the gym and I only used it 1-3 times a week since the purchase three months ago. But the return window has closed so I'm now stuck with it. I can't believe the poor workmanship."
1,"These wireless Bluetooth headphones are an incredible value and exceeded what I was expecting at this price point. The headphones are well made and designed and the instructions and packaging are helpful and exceeding what many companies provide. They paired easily and quickly with my Samsung S7. I bought them specifically for wearing while mowing my lawn and they passed with flying colors. The only negative comment I would make is the sound is a bit tinny when playing music, but I have not tried them yet with a podcast. Even with that, I would highly recommend this product. These headphones have eliminated the hassle of running a cord to my phone that is necessary with my prior headphones that constantly would get tangled up with the lawnmower, bushes, etc."
1,"TL:DR Review<br />Sound Quality: 4.9/5<br />Comfort: 4/5<br />Battery Life: 4.8/5<br />-annoying buzzing noise<br /><br />Full Review:<br />I almost gave these Bluetooth earbuds a five-star rating. They sound quality is great if you are listening to music on anything above 20% of the maximum volume. When listening to anything lower than 20% max volume (podcasts, breaks between songs, soft songs), the left earbud will emit a pesky electric buzzing noise. The buzzing noise will overpower the sound of any soft music or podcast that you may be listening to. I would not recommend these for non-music purposes because of the buzzing noise. Also, I'd like to point out that the right earbud does not emit any buzzing noise whatsoever. The ear hooks are not adjustable and are too big for my ears, I typically let them dangle on the outside of my ears because of this."
1,"The only thing I dislike about these are the arms that go over the ears,  they are not hard and sturdy but Soft and flexible A little too flexible as they tend to fall off."
1,Great headphones. Right out of the box easy to use. Sound is really good.
1,This product is every bit as good as the high dollar name brand products without the price. We use ours for music. They have great sound quality and they block out the outside noises really well. Great product! Great service as well. Seller was prompt at sending out my order. Received my product shortly after ordering it. Great service!
1,"So far, these are great! Sound quality is good, and the controls are easy to understand. Love that they came with a case and multi port charger- way to think ahead!<br /><br />They stay on my ears even when I'm upside down, so definitely worth the purchase."
0,These headphones worked for a month and stopped working out of the blue. I was sent new headphone free of charge from the seller and the new headphones also stopped working within 30 days.
1,I bought this for my son to use while working out and he loves them. Thank you for backing up your product with a 1 yr warranty.
1,Not sure why there are all the 5 star reviews.  There is literally NO Bass!  Other than that they are reliable and do the job and very easy to connect.<br />Not for audiophiles.
1,"These headphones are great. They have great sound, and do not slip off me during a workout."
0,The worst one. Is always beeping for no reason in the middle of whatever you’re listening! Always reconnecting for no reason. Is very frustrated try to listen using it.
1,I bought these for the gym and have used them a couple times since I just recently received them. They work great and are very loud. Perfect for a noisy gym.
1,"I've had the earphones for about a week, and I'm very impressed with them. I've been using them to run on the treadmill and to connect with my TV, which is about the only way I can handle running on a treadmill. The sound quality is great and connecting has not been an issue. I also plan on using them under my ski helmet when I take them to the slopes. Haven't tried it yet, but I think they'll fit nicely."
1,"Senso is the best!!! The Bass is excellent, the clarity is great. Watching a movie the sound is fantastic listening to music sounds extraordinary, it even has a factory reset on the bluetooth headphones. Cannot say enough about this product fully satisfied and a one year warranty with 24hr. customer number if you have any problems. Excellent."
1,Just got them an the sound is amazing!
1,"bought them as replacements - much nicer, came with additional chargers which was great - shipped very quickly - thanks!"
1,Easily paired with all my devices. Good sounds. easy to handle.hands free.
1,"Headphones are great.  Only had them a couple of days, but they work great and are easy to use."
1,Great for the price but wish the ear hooks were adjustable.
1,"I really like these headphones. Bluetooth works great and the earpieces are incredibly comfortable, including the silicone-type flap. The sound is alright, but what more can you expect from $34 headphones? It said they were originally over $140ish but I don't know if this was just a simple markup or if this was a consistent price. Anyway, I think they're well worth the price... at least for now.<br /><br />Will update in a few months if and when sound goes out in one earpiece :)"
0,"2nd set I bought. 1st pair lasted two years. This set didn’t even last two weeks.<br />Just completely poor quality. The speaker part would always separate from rest of housing so rubber ear piece is just dangling.<br />The stupid flexible ear supports are trash. They have no strength to maintain the shape of your ear so are easily pulled off and aren’t durible at all.<br /><br />I just bought a different, cheaper costing pair that had same or better reviews."
1,Love these.  Easily connected to my iPhone 6 Plus.  Easy to charge with a regular wall charger...like I use for my kindle or phone.
1,"I love these earbuds! The volume control is easy, the volume is amazing, the bass is awesome! Unfortunately, I only gave it four stars because I purchased them in February and as of October, the left ear went out ☹️... BUT I'm going to purchase a new pair because I really love the comfort of the ear hooks on my little bitty ears- not to mention the quality of the bass and volume. I highly recommend these. Hopefully, I don't have the same problem with the new pair. 🤞"
0,"The ear loop ,is too big for my ears..."
1,Excellent sound! Very comfortable to wear for several hours while I work and listen to my workshops. 100% recommended. And it has 1 year warranty. I do appreciate that very much. Thanks.
1,Amazing for the price!
1,Better than the Beats By Dre!
0,"Buying Headphones on Amazon might be one of the most difficult things due to some of the questionable reviews. I have bought several &#34;budget&#34; Bluetooth headphones on Amazon, and they continue to be a disappointment.<br /><br /> My problem with this Senso Bluetooth Headphones was its quality of sound. I listen to a lot of podcasts at the gym and my ears literally started hurting from the sound quality. There is a lot of bass and echo that makes it hard to hear. I had to take these off because I just couldn't stand the sound anymore.<br /><br />Another thing is that the mic barely works. So don't expect to use the mic because the person you are talking to will not hear you very well<br /><br />I think the only thing I can do now is to move up the $ ladder and buy a more quality headphones."
0,"Purchased in March of 2018, and product randomly became defective in April 2019.  Used headphones for roughly 40 minutes a day for 4-5 days a week until they stopped working. Did a factory reset, but headphones were not able to enter pairing mode.  Called Senso technical support and they confirmed that the headphones were defective, but that they could not offer a replacement since it had been just over a year.  Product not designed to last.  Sound quality and fit were “eh” to begin with.  Strongly recommend you buy a different product.  These are cr@p."
1,I love them!  I bought them for work since I sit in a cube farm. Now I can walk around the floor and still hear my music without carrying my phone. The ear buds are very comfy and callers can hear me clearly when we talk. I'm thinking of ordering another pair for home.
1,I am pleased with the sound quality of the headphones. I am learning how to not make &#34;pocket calls&#34; to friends in earlier time zones when I am at the gym at 6:00AM EST.
1,I had an issue with the earphones. I really like them but they stopped working after about 5 months. I contacted the seller. It was no problem to replace them. they were very nice and easy to work with.
0,They were as advertised except for the quality of bass in them. If I want poor quality of bass I might as well spend less money on Bluetooth/headphones that are cheap.
1,I use the daily at work and to work out and they stay on very well are comfortable and last awhile before needing a charge. I would definitely recommend these earbuds.
1,"sounds ok, but they died in 60 days of normal use....."
1,Great sound & price!!
1,"Love this thing.  For the price and the strong sweatproof performance, I give this 5 stars.  It lasts roughly 4-5 hours of usage though.  So I'm recharging after every 3rd time I use it so it doesn't die while I'm on my 1 hour commute on the 4th usage.<br /><br />I've had no reception issues even in the subway.  The jaybird I had previously would stop working once i was underground even with the phone was right next to it.  I can walk away 20 - 30 feet in the gym and still be connected to this thing.<br /><br />I do have to say that the i phone and this thing sometimes have trouble connecting on the first go with Spotify. But nothing a few restarts of the bluetooh and headphones can't fix."
1,"Guys for real, these are amazing. I'm hearing stuff in music I've never noticed before. Such clear, awesome sound. And they're super comfortable to boot!<br /><br />I even got a phone call with them in and had the microphone near me and my friend commented on how clear I sounded before I even told her I had the headphones in.<br /><br />Definitely invest in these bad boys, especially with all the extras that come with them."
0,The noise cancelation on these headphones is horrible
1,"They are durable, but the sound is muffled. Not comparable to LG but the price is low. The control buttons work great and they have a reliable distance from phone. In the gym I can venture far from my phone and they don't loose connection."
1,These headphones are amazing. You have to remember what your paying for them to before you compare it to boss or beats or any other high quality head phones. They honestly are better than my LG pair
1,"Not much to say, these work flawlessly and for me the sound is fantastic.."
1,Perfect!! I purchases the headphones for while I run!! Love them!! They stay charged for a long time. They stay on and in my ears very good.  I would definitely recommend these.
1,My only complaint is that I wish the battery lasted longer before a charge.  But that's minor compared to their performance and price!
1,"Loved these headphones,  they stay in my ears and don't flop around.  Really  good sound.<br /><br />Cons: They block outside noise so it might  be a bit dangerous  for cycling around."
1,"I like the headphones stay in my ears, comfortably, without fighting with them.  Good sound quality for audio books and music."
1,"Bought these to see what a $30 replacement for my $150 Bose would sound like, and I'm pleasantly surprised. They certainly have way more volume capacity than the Bose, and for $30 these are really hard to beat. Battery life is good, still 5+ hours after 3 months of moderate to heavy use.<br /><br />Minor downsides:<br /> - Plastic pieces that wrap around the ear are flimsy and can crease easily, so be careful if packing the headphones loosely<br /> - Audio quality is good, but not great. I like to use them for podcasts, but if using for music the headphones lack a bit of low end depth, though not to a point where I would say it sounds bad.<br /> - Not water proof, so avoid using in the rain"
0,"Not really as pictured. The loop that goes around ear is a little big/loose which made the inner part come out of my ear while I was lifting weights, so I just took them off. :/"
1,They are awesome.
1,They are not very comfortable. They do not stay in place when working out. They do not have as good of quality as I hoped but for the price they work fine.
1,These headphones Are Great!  I am extremely impressed with the sound quality and comfort at this price!!  Also was very happy with the free gifts....I started using the cell phone holder in my car immediately... much better than setting my phone in the cup holder😁
1,"battery never dies out, I use them at gym , makes wireless working out better than being tethered to my iphone I don't have earphones yanked out of my ears anymore nor do I drop my phone . can't beat price"
0,"I'm having a problem with the right side earpiece ,there's static in it."
1,Everything I wanted for the price! They work and are mostly unobtrusive -- now I can hold my baby and listen to music or watch a video without disruption or the fear of her getting caught on wires.
1,"Excellent sound quality, great clarity, comfortable fit, can't enough about these headphones. Great purchase!"
1,Amazing product and amazing customer service!
1,Great item for the great price.
1,I mainly use these for listening to podcasts.  What I like best about these headphones is they stay in the ear unlike some other brands that keep falling out while wearing them.  Sound quality is excellent.  Had an issue and customer service couldn’t have been more helpful.
1,Great sound
1,So these might be great headphones for listening to music as the reviews said which made me buy but I need them as a headset for my cell phone and they are dismal for that.  No one can hear me so this is money completely wasted.  Bummer as I'm not spending stupid money for the apple headset.
1,Great sound and well made.  Manufacturer took extra time to include accessories which are helpful.  I will not hesitate to recommend this product.
1,"Easy to use, comfortable, sounds great and even my granddaughter gave them a thumbs up!"
1,"Granted, I just purchased this and set them up today but they compare favorably to the Beats that just broke after a year and a half.  About 70% less than my original Beats.  Not quite as clear on the bottom as the Beats, but I'm using them for the gym, so who cares?  The telling thing will be if they have interference from all the machines at the gym.  I would expect not as they are the latest Bluetooth technology.  They are lighter than the Beats so I expect to have less falling out of my ear issues.  Fit the ears great.<br /><br />UPDATE: June 12, 2017.  Absolutely no interference in the gym from any equipment.  Stayed in place in my ears for an hour and a half workout on elliptical and bike."
1,Outstanding product!
0,"They cut out constantly while on my bike, which very rarely happened with my old Plantronics headphones.  They don't feel secure in my ear and constantly need readjusting, the sound quality is average.  Had a little bit of trouble pairing."
1,Great product...
0,Not the greatest. . .  I find it turning off for no reason on my runs and I have to synch it back which is a real distraction when you're running on the streets of NYC.  Would not recommend.  Feels kind of flimsy.
1,"I like the headphones. They seem to last and be somewhat durable, but my biggest issue is there is no noise cancellation on the headphones. So yes, I have hands-free talking and they work well while I'm running, sweating and working out, but when I talk on the phone (which I do a lot), I always have to transfer the sound back to my phone, because the headphones pick up every bit of sound around me and anyone I'm talking to always complains how they are unable to hear me. This is deeply frustrating since I am always on the go and me being able to talk hand-free is the main reason I purchased these headphones."
1,great value - only wish they offered one with a microphone too.  But great value!
0,stopped working after 6month no reason- it shows battery fully charged then when you unplug from charger they dont turn on.
1,The sensor is The best earbuds I have ever used!
1,"Out of the box the Bass was why over the top at the normal equalization I use with my Bose wired earbuds or my car system. After 20 minutes of adjusting on my Galaxy S8 I got them sounding pretty good but not as good as the Bose Buds. I had to use the manual adjustments since the the Bass on all the built in phone equalizer settings was overwhelming.  If you really, really like loud Bass or you device has a builtin equalizer they are ok. If you can't adjust you equalization manually they are probably not for you."
1,They are working great. I have had a pair of these before and like them so I bought new ones.
1,"Speakers play clear, charge last about 2 days..I only use when working out 2 hrs a day. The cord from left to right ear is way too long! Constantly getting caught on clothing or hair as I workout causing them to fall out of my ears. Will buy aomething different next time"
1,"I love these headphones, they connect to Bluetooth instantly and the sound is great. Extremely happy with them. Love them"
1,"Impressive what you get for the price. This is one of the best deals out there. Simple pairing with my iPhone. Very good sound, secure on my ears. Everything I wanted."
1,"Had these about a week. So far so good. They fit well, work fine (i.e. pair quickly and then play music well), and seem to generally work well for me (I use them in the gym). Will update if anything changes."
1,Great pair of wireless headphones that in my opinion are much better than the beats headphones that look like these.  The reason  I say this is that I bought a pair last year and spent the 150 dollars on them and had them break within two months of going to the gym everyday.  I looked after them as best I could and the only moisture that came in contact with them was sweat.  The same amount of fatigue was given to these headphones as well and they are still working very well.  The battery longevity is also better with these as well. I should also note that I am not a sound snob and cant tell you about the finer points on bass and etc.  I just use these everyday to listen to music for working out for at least an hour.
1,Very happy with performance. I used them for about 5 hours listening to an audiobook and they did not die before I plugged them back in to charge. Easy to get the hang of and no problems connecting to my phone. I liked these headphones so much that I recently bought my husband a pair also.
1,Good clear sound and very easy to control the music
1,Works great as expected!
1,"I love my Senso bluetooth!  I really appreciated the company contacting me to welcome me to their brand.  It made me feel confident that I made a good choice in my bluetooth needs.  If I have any problems, I feel they will be taken care of right away."
0,Skip while running and cause an echo when speaking on the phone.
1,"So far, so good! I have only used them twice, but so far they are very comfortable and they produce a great quality sound. I only hope to have many more great workouts with them in the future! I will definitely recommend them to people looking for a good workout wireless headphone."
0,Purchased headphones 18 months ago. Used them about a half dozen times throughout that period. Started to use them again and they initially charged without an issue. Once I tried to recharge them again they would not charge. They are out of warranty and I am out of luck. Would never buy again.
1,These headphones are great and very clear and easy to wear and I will recommend anybody to buy they.  I love them
1,Awesome! Exceeded my expectations. They sound just as good as beats version of these headphones. I'd give it 6/5 if I could.
1,Easy to pair with device.  Noise cancelling not as good as expected on airplane. Seems well made.
1,Product seems decent enough especially for the price but both pairs I ordered did not come with the wire tie so 4 stars
1,I thought these are good headphones. They have clear sound and hooked up to bluetooth really fast. They have good battery life and fit well.
0,I’ve tried them for 3 workouts and evey time I’ve had issues connecting to my phone so I am returning. I’m not going to fight with my headphones all workout
0,"Earphones are solid, waterproof as advertised, and have good batter life. Sound quality however, is not that great.  There is way too much bass, and you have to use the equalizer to reduce it to make music listenable. But once you reduce the bass, the quality when listening to music is not bad. Call quality can't be helped, since you can't equalize call audio. The biggest issue, however, is the microphone. Since the mic is inside the earpiece, it has trouble picking up your voice, and sometimes the other person can hear themselves talk."
1,"SUPER FAST shipping. I received these and absolutely love them! The sound quality is great, they charge quickly, and are super comfortable to wear. Highly recommend for workouts and running!"
1,"After extensive search, reading every review, these are not what I expected. Definitely not any different than the $10 dollar pair that you can get right here on Amazon. My iHip headphones are way better."
1,Awesome product
1,These are exactly what I was looking for. Lightweight and they stay comfortably in my ear while running. Great sound quality I'm really glad I took a chance on these. Love them!
0,Would not pair with my Nano
1,"For this price i expected some cheap headphones that i was just gonna use for running. Turns out the quality is amazing, sound quality is really good, strong bass, battery lasts longer than most wireless headphones ive owned"
1,Superb sound
1,Had an issue and SENSO was supet quick at fixing it with the warranty.
1,"I received these headphones as a birthday gift last fall, and wasn't too sure about them. I had never used wireless headphones before, but my parents were hoping that they would be a little bit &#34;safer&#34; for me to use when lifting (if you've ever had your headphones fall while you're lifting, you know what I'm talking about). As soon as I tried them I knew that they would be my babies.<br /><br />Some of my favorite features:<br />The noise cancellation is real with these!<br />The sound quality is amazing! I honestly thought that my family paid upwards of $100-200 for these beauties because they were so great.<br />They're lightweight.<br />They come with a pretty durable case.<br />The battery lasts forever (I usually only charge them once or twice a week depending on whether or not I use them for watching Netflix and home and whatnot. I go to the gym six days a week, so I think they last a pretty good amount of hours).<br />They're wonderful for running, wonderful for lifting... they're just wonderful.<br /><br />The only thing that I don't particularly love about them is that sometimes people don't notice I'm wearing them and try to talk to me-- but I can't blame that on the headphones. In fact, I actually kind of like that their discreet rather than big and bulky.<br /><br />I would recommend these to absolutely anyone and everyone!"
1,Doesn't have enough battery life. I like to listen all night. Didn't lock out ambient noise.
0,"I loved the look of the headphones and this style. The carrying case was slick and light weight, all the include attachments were helpful. Where I feel these headphones need to improve<br />-The microphone, no one can hear you unless you hold the left side to your mouth<br />-The battery doesn't last 5 hours<br />-When they connect to my iPhone 7 you can't hear anything for 2 minutes"
1,"Update. After using these as my primary headphones for about 2 weeks, I can honestly say they are pretty good. The sound for lyrical songs isn't the best, but you get past it after while. Everything came that was originally advertised. Will buy again in the future"
1,Very happy with my purchase. Great Deal!!!
1,"Got these today, charged them a bit and ran a 5k listening to a podcast. I usually run near cars and some trucks that make a lot of noise + overhead planes usually kept me from fully listening to my podcast. These headphones fixed that, and the strap is perfectly snug behind the neck. These are absolutely amazing, thinking of buying a second pair."
1,They are decent for the price compared to the ones i was getting from dollar tree.  Ive noticed the sound fades in and out and its not much noise cancellations.
1,"These have great sound quality.  I have bounced and moved around and as long as I am within 30 ft of my device I great reception with no skips.  The stuff that came in the box is great.  I would have liked a wall adapter too, but the car charger is awesome.  The only other extra that would be nice is a clip.  I have ordered a clip so its something you can fix yourself."
0,"Broke in 2 days. Won't sync and won't play music.<br />Quality is not worth the 40 dollars it's on sale for either.<br />Too bad, I was actually needing a sporty bluetooth head phone :/"
1,It was a gift to my wife and she loved it
1,"These are really comfy, but the battery life only lasts a few hours. I listen to music constantly at work, so I have a different brand whose battery life is better, but the headphones are uncomfortable. All in all these are might favorite’s, but I wish the battery life was better."
1,Edited the first one failed and got replacement device which is working as expected.
1,Works well.  Great sound!  Would buy again..
1,So far so good! Great sound quality and battery life.
1,Very Happy with them. great deal
1,Only used them once so far but they seem to work very well.  The bluetooth connection was quick and easy and the sound seems excellent.  Great product so far (particularly for the cost!).
0,hard to stay on and does not fit my ears
1,"I had a couple of wireless headphones in the past and they were not as solid as this one, it never failed me so far. Recommended buy!"
1,Best value for the money that I spent on them.  Very clear sound for music. Phone calls could be better but still works great.
1,"Bought mine for use at the gym. They stayed in place while running and lifting weights for over an hour at a time for the last 2 months with no loss of power. They even manage to deaden the sound of the lawn mower when cutting the grass.  Great sound, particularly at the low end. These are rightfully rated high by most folks. No problems connecting to my LG G4 via Bluetooth."
1,Sound is excellent.  They actually  fit in my ears. Easy to sync with my Samson smart phone. Love it for race walking.
0,Sound quality isn't bad. Packaging is nice. But these are horribly designed. The &#34;ear hooks&#34; extend way above my ears so they don't even wrap around them and hold the buds in place. It defeats the purpose of having them in the first place. They're not adjustable aside from the actual ear bud size.
1,"I must say that I really like the Senso headphones. They totally meet my expectations! Very easy to use for listening, plus the quality of the microphone is great. The customer service is just outstanding. I had some questions and emailed them, and they responded the same day with really thought through answers. Can't be happy more with the product. Highly recommend!"
1,"I bought these for my wife, who wanted to listen to music while she works out at a nearby pool. We were both pleased at how quickly and easily the headphones paired with her iPhone 6, and were very impressed at the quality of sound as well as the bluetooth reach it was capable of. She hasn't had the chance yet to try them at the pool, which is why I'm not able to give it more stars right now. But we both agreed it was a good buy! You've got a good product, Mr. Backstrom."
0,I returned these because they hurt my ear canals after a while. They were heavy and just didn't sit right on my ears.
1,Very comfortable to wear and the range is fantastic!  Love!!
1,Easy to use. Perfect fit. Love the power cord - unique. The Amazon Customer Video is great for the actual product. Works perfect. No issues. Delivered on time and without any damage. Highly recommend. Pairs easily with my iPhone and buttons easy to use.
1,Great Bluetooth distance.  Sounds great!!  Always work perfectly at the gym
1,"El articulo correspondía con la descripción, muy buen producto llego a tiempo.  Es eñ tercero que compro para regalo."
1,"I have had these earbuds for about a year and a half, and am sad to have to throw them in the garbage today. They worked great at first. When they quit the first time, customer service was quick to reply with troubleshooting steps that fixed my problem. I had to go through the reset more and more frequently since. Now, they won't even power on so after trying for weeks with different power sources, I'm just giving up. I paid about $35 and hoped they would last longer than this, but maybe I'm old school."
1,"I did return this item, but that’s only because my wife has the ear canal of a newborn baby(She’s 30). For normal size people these are pretty amazing they come with everything you could possibly need. Cables, 12v car connections, apple and android charger. Good buy if your normal size and looking for a wireless headset."
1,These are amazing
0,"I don't want to spend too much on headphones since they're pretty much ""Here today, gone tomorrow"" whether they are expensive or cheap. I had a similar set that lasted almost a year. These were great, until one day they just stopped turning on, even after having charged them up. Lesson learned: stop buying these kinds of items from Amazon. They last long enough that you cannot return them, but two months is ridiculous."
1,So far so good.  I'm still trying them out.  They are very comfortable around me neck and ears.  I actually wear them all day.  I'm a truck driver and charter bus driver.  I have to stay in constant contact with my dispatcher.  This make so much easier than those other bulky around the neck head phones and reaching for the phone.
0,"Didn't fit well in my ears and the company told me just that, it must be MY ears that are the problem. Did get a refund."
1,"I bought this earphone thinking that it would last long and would be confy. It has high rating in Amazon.  I just got it for few days now so I can't talk about durability. Convenience wise though, I thought it would stick to my small ears better than the regular type of earphones. Find out, it doesn't stay long.  I don't think this would help me on my running because I have to keep it in my ear every now and then."
1,This is a great product!! The sound is great and a great company to work with!
1,Wonderful headphone.
1,"These headphones are perfect for exercising. They have great audio quality and stay in place when you're active. The accessories are great too, especially the carrying case and the various ear bud adjustments. The original pair I bought stopped working (zero power, wouldn't turn on or charge) after six months. I contacted Senso support and because of the 1-year warranty, they were extremely friendly, responsive, and they shipped me replacement headphones the very same day."
1,"Paired easily. Like on/off/pause on outside of earpiece. Some headphones have buttons too close together, causing you to turn off or increase volume when that wasn’t what you intended. Sound quality is decent for a relatively inexpensive headphone. Headphones are comfortable too."
1,"The quality control here is not ideal - ordered my wife a pair for Christmas and they were awesome! Ordered myself a pair a few weeks later, they look the same as hers but the big problem is that my ear pieces don't bend so I can't shape them to fit. No big deal, I send them back for a new pair. Get the new one - same exact problem. Super bummed but it's a sign for me to move on to a different brand. On the bright side my wife really likes her pair!"
1,"I like these, they are cheap but I have had them for 2 years now and not a single issue. I actually bought 2 times not sure if whit this same account"
1,Great sound great price. Rival my sons beats
1,It's only been one week but So far so good.  I love it!!!
0,"Good sound and good volume. I think about four hours charge, which is OK, considering how light they are.<br /><br />Died about six weeks after I got them. Appeared to charge but didn't turn on.<br /><br />Invotech responded promptly with instructions for reset (which did not solve the problem) and an offer to replace. Received new pair within two days."
1,Very nice system. One star removed because I rubber ear hooks and thin neck strap look toovfragile for constant use. I will know better after more usage. Comfortable.
1,"I've had these headphones for a couple years now and the bluetooth radio has finally failed.  However, up until this point, these have been great headphones.  They sound really good, battery life is as-advertised however there is no noise cancellation that I can tell.<br /><br />If I could make one change, I would want to have a fabric-coated cable.  The current cable has a rubber-coated feel and when you get sweaty, it sticks to your neck, which is annoying.<br /><br />Other than that concern, I will likely order these again as you can't beat the price for what you get."
0,"Worked for a few months then stopped working. Would disconnect and turn off without warning. Wouldn't want to turn on, and would say its connected but the music would still come out from my phone. DO NOT BUY!"
1,I love it being cheap great sound and good quality on phone calls
1,We are on our fifth pair of these headphones.  Love them and customer service is great.  My first pair stopped working and they replaced them quickly.
1,Affordable and my son loves them
1,"I initially thought these headphones where amazing. However, the bluetooth distance seems it to fade if you use it for a little bit. It starts to break up and get crackly at even 5ft away.<br />Ex. I used the headphones for an hour, then went on a run with my phone on my arm and when my arm distanced from the headphones it would get splotchy. Now i just make sure I've charged it before I run!"
1,Very pleased going to order some for my sons
1,Great sound quality not too much comfortable to wear
0,"Big, bulky and heavy on the ears with the wire in front of the ear which is unsightly. Charge did not last through the next morning although I used it once. It also lost its blue tooth connection and I couldn't get it to find my phone that was right next to it. I thought it would be great as it was waterproof, but not for me. Going to get the one I used to have that goes around my neck and battery lasts for days/weeks."
1,I bought these Bluetooth headphones for my 15 year old and he loves them so far.  We got them in less than 2 days and they were about 1/3 the price of beats.  He goes to a very prestigious (snooty) high school and many kids have them.  He told me they perform as well as the beats.  They just are a little bit bigger than the beats.  Good buy and they work well.  Thank You!
0,As long as ur prepared to buy new ones regularly<br />They are fine.
1,"great soun, great fit."
0,bad don't buy it
1,Excellent Product!!! As described.
1,"Fantastic product! So God I bought a second... Really amazing sound and very simple to use, was trying to find something like this for ages.<br />It beats by far all the other more expensive competitors. Like I said before fantastic!"
1,I like this product as it fits comfortably in my ears and the sound is very good.
1,My everyday workshop headphones. I have purchased 4 sets of these so far.
0,Worst workout accessory ever. Songs just keep cutting off/skipping. Phone is on my armband. I just realized only way for this thing to work is when I hold my phone high above my head. How do I fix this problem? Does my phone have to be at a certain angle to listen to music? Makes no sense.
1,I went through 4 pairs of Bose headphones before discovering these babies. It’s been 2 years and I just purchased my second pair of senso headphones last week. The first pair broke from wear and tear. I go to the gym 5-6 days a week and sweat profusely. I love that I can’t hear anything when I wear them. These have never let me down and never fallen off.
1,"Bought 2 of these. FANTASTIC! The shipping was quick. The product is absolutely FANTASTIC! I've bought 3 sets for working out over the last 4 years. This set is the best. They sound great. They fit and wear well. Loud... OMG... they totally drowned out the overhead music garbage at the gym and that is only up halfway. The wife and I totally loves these headphones.<br /><br />Now to see how long they last. By the way they sound right now, I have extreme high hopes that they last. Even if I only get a year or two out of them they are totally worth the money. There is a reason why they have 71% 5 stars. #InstaChub"
0,"mic doesnt work, horribe. returned it."
1,Good battery life. Good water resistance. Great value
1,These earphones are great! Extremely loud and comfortable!
1,"I've been wearing these earbuds for 3 hours now and they are very comfortable. Sound quality is good and volume reaches louder than I care to use. 3 pairs of ear tips, two charging cables, dual port car charger and hard case: all for $30! That's a deal."
1,"Great when they work well, but I find that it sometimes dose a double beep and the connection cuts in and out losing 3-5 seconds of audio at a time repeatedly even when the device (computer or phone) is very close by."
0,"Battery life is around 6 hours. I'm a heavy user so this isn't very long. It always seems to be dead when I most need it. Furthermore, you can't charge and use at the same time which is somewhat of an inconvenience. Sound quality is good but not impressive. Holy hell is the functionality ANNOYING. Takes forever to turn on sometimes, I'm pushing a finger into my ear like an idiot waiting for the bluetooth lady to yell &#34;POWER ON&#34; into my ears. And sometimes when I'm trying to power down at night she'll go &#34;LAST NUMBER REDIAL&#34; while I scramble to find my phone to cancel a 2AM call to my ex girlfriend. Jesus. I don't want all that. I just want this thing to power on and power off."
1,Clear and load sound even whine riding bike with wind noise. mic works great
1,These worked really well. Was able to spend all day at the Rugby field without disruption of sound. Phone calls were clear. Very happy
1,Great product. Sounds good.
1,I've had my pair for several months and absolutely love them. Fantastic Bass! They hold a charge wonderfully and last several days between charges. I use them mostly at work when I need to tune out the rest of the open floor plan.<br /><br />I actually bought Bluetooth earbuds to run in and the connection was horrible. I'm buying a second pair of these this weekend for running.
1,"I have only had the earphones for a few days, and already been contacted by the company with AMAZING customer service making sure I was satisfied with the earphones. Excited to use the headphones and know if there’s any issues they will be resolved right away."
1,"Excellent pair of hp for the price. Very good sound, easy to control volume while jogging.  Only thing that could be improved was the ear hook.  A little on the flimsy side."
0,Had these for just about two months. We're excellent for the gym. Put them in my ears and they stayed put. Took them down to Virginia on vacation. Found one of the ear buds slightly ajar and tried to snap it back into place. The volume control disappeared in the process. Was hoping for something a bit less weak on the quality side.
1,"Great product, great sound and comes with a one year warranty.  The customer service is outstanding which is very important to me.  You receive a very nice carrying case, 2 extra sets of ear plugs, a short charging cord and a 3' charging cord that can fit apple products as well as the headphones.  Also a 2-port car charger.  I've use the earbuds over the weekend and they work great!"
1,"So far so good.  Setup took a few seconds, sound quality is great.  Very happy with this purchase.  I will update if anything changes."
0,I purchased very similar products for the same price and I'll definitely go back to them as soon as these completely stop working. The bluetooth connection is awful and I find myself constantly having to reconnect or just giving up and switching to standard headphones.
0,The device wouldn't charge after first use.
0,"Need to return iteam not working properly, people can't hear me very well when on the phone. Thanks please send me the return address."
1,Surprisingly these things work and sound great. Get about 8hrs battery life out of them. I’ve had them for over a year. I just wish they included more of the memory foam tips as I lost one.
1,I love these headphones. They are very comfortable and the sound is perfect.
0,It worked well for 3 weeks and then stopped working. When connected to get charged no light turns on and nothing happens.
1,Says it comes with the car mount but it doesn’t.
1,"The sounds are great, it is stable on the ear in running"
1,Perfect for working out. Great sound and easy connectivity for an even greater price!
0,Never fit my ear no matter how many times I change the size + doesn’t work well with sweating.. microphone is very bad... this product is waste of money and time.
1,Nice while they lasted
1,"I've now purchased 3 pairs of the Senso Active Buds one S-250 and two S-255. We use them with our smart phones and tablets, we use them at the gym while working out and on the go when we have to wait somewhere, like a plane ride. The sound quality for the price is excellent and the bass reproduction is strong. They come with a hard case, charging cable, 3 pairs of ear cups and 1 pair of ear foams for form fitting and sealing out surrounding noise.<br /><br />Customer service is superb. We had one pair that began to shut off when the connecting wire was bumped. I contacted customer support and received a response within 30 mins giving me suggestions on resolving the issue. I followed the steps, but unfortunately, they weren't successful. I contacted support again to let them know and within 30 mins they had responded again and stated they would replace the unit since we were within our warranty period. I'm a business owner and I can tell you from dealing with a lot of companies where I needed support for a product, this has been by far, one of the best and quickest responses I've received.<br /><br />When the time comes to upgrade or replace, Senso will be at the top of a very short list of options. You won't be disappointed in this product or it's customer service, should you need it.<br /><br />For those who have complained about the sound quality, they simply need to make adjustments in their devices. I come from an audio/video career background, so I can speak to the quality. There are options out there that may sound better, but you won't find them even at double the price of the Senso's."
0,When they coupled to my Iwatch they would breakup unless I put my Iwatch on my right wrist. I did a master reset of the headphones and after an iOS update to the watch they would not couple and they had to be returned to Amazon.
1,Awesome quailty
1,they are amazing.  the sound is perfect and the charge lasts a very long time.
1,I absolutely love these headphones!!  They are the first pair that I have owned that I can honestly say that are comfortable to wear and have absolutely beautiful sound.  The staff at SENSO also offer great customer service!!  They actually contacted me to see how I liked their product and to see if I there was anything that they could do to increase my satisfaction.  I would definitely buy something else from them and I am recommending these headphones to family and friends.  Great buy for the price!!!!!!
1,Just received these today and out of the box look and feel great. I’ve got small ears and seem to fit securely... Haven’t used them yet so test that out better and will update when I do. The only reason I’m docking a star is because the box/instructions say that there is supposed to be a “wire tie” included and it was not as you can see from the pictures. A little disappointed as that would have been a helpful tool.
0,worked for a couple of weeks and then would not connect with iPod or iPhone. I am returning
1,Just received.  So far so good.  Nice that a voice tells you on or off.  Interested to use on upcoming flight for noise cancelling compared to the wired set I have.  Let you know how that works.
1,"I received my SENSO Bluetooth Earbuds a few days ago. I paired them with my iPhone, iPad and television with no problem at all. The sound quality is excellent and I have had no problems with them falling out of my ears while using the treadmill or exercising. They are very comfortable. For the brief time I've owned them, I'd definitely recommend them to others and give them five stars."
1,"The sound gets distorted at level 7/10. Don't bother going any higher, otherwise all clarity will be lost. The bass although gives a good thump, the music occasionally cuts in and out like there's a mechanical issue. For those reasons, I give it a 3 star."
1,These headphones are great... with awesome sound and good range.<br />I'm ordering a pair for my office manager!!
1,Received them on time and in good packaging. Have only used them once since receipt and everything went fine. They are comfortable to wear as the ear pieces are quite soft. Remains to be seen how well they stand up to use. I am not a audiophile so the sound quality seems OK to me. I mostly use them while riding by bicycle. Used them once around the condo and there is a issue as they cut out when in a separate room when not carrying the phone.
0,Sound is hollow and they’re not super comfortable.  They do work but you get what you pay for.
1,"Work very well. Good stereo sound, and battery lasts a good while."
1,"I bought these headphones based off of the reviews and they have exceeded my expectations. The sound quality is very good, the fit is good and they are easy to use. I'm a multi sport athlete needs rugged while mantaining high quality sound becuase I have mild  hearing loss."
1,"Very satisfied with these bt headphones,  I wanted something that I could wear while doing yard work and it didn't disappoint. Have a pair of Beats that are seating idle now. Great price,  great product. Bought an extra one for a x-mas gift."
1,"Gets the job done! Pretty good quality & stays pretty fit in my ears that can be sensitive to holding up ear buds. I run a lot with these. The only thing that stinks however, there is no warning of low battery only 10 min or so before it shuts down, which tends to happen in the beginning or middle of my run. Good part is, it does last for about 1-1.5 weeks before charging again."
1,Great headphones. Great value. Purchased these a few months back and they are still going. Use them mainly at the gym.
1,I purchased my first pair Oct  2016. Love them. Just recently there was a problem with the volume changer. I reached out to Invotek customer service. Had a new pair in my hands within 5 days. I listen primarily to rock and roll. These are quality sounding headphones at a great price. Your expectations should be for a great sounding headphones at the price of  $36. For the record I have 3 over the ear beats. A pair of beat earphones and MEE On-Ear Headphones and not much of my hearing left!
0,"I have used this on the avg 4 days a week since it was delivered.  I have had to re-sync about 3 times and today after a full weekend charge and Monday gym use for &#60;2 hours, the headset was completely discharged.  Recharging now and will see what happens the rest of the week.  Stand by for a follow up.<br /><br />8 hours of charging... the blue light (charge complete) did not come on and holding down the &#34;on&#34; button does nothing... it is dead!!!"
1,"These were very uncomfortable to use, and fell out every time I ran with them. But when they did stay in they sounded really good"
1,Great product. Easy to use and connected very easily to my phone. Comfortable to wear.
1,"I do a lot of crazy body movements in my workouts- sprints, barbell thrusters, hand-stand push-ups, burpees, you name it. Once in a while the buds will fall out, but it's understandable since I'm all over the place. Very happy with them!"
0,They're ok. Too bass heavy and often have interrupting connection issues when my phone is in my pocket
1,"Just start using them and so far so good. Came fully charged, easy to connect and ready to use out of the box. No hassle setup made them very pleasant to use, and the sound quality is pretty good. Not the best but definitely good for what you pay for and they have surprisingly good bass."
1,Excellent quality & sound.  Good value -
1,"I use these when walking every morning.  They are very comfortable, easy to use, and the sound is very good!"
0,Not quite sure but barely after 6 weeks the headphones are no longer charging!
1,I really like the headphones and they are great for listening to music!! But the call quality is pretty bad. It's very choppy sounding. Even for my Rosetta Stone app I can't use the headphones because it's very choppy sounding. But to just listen to music I love them.
1,"In love, they are so soft!! And blocks all outer noise"
1,Battery life lasts a longggggg time. Perfect for a week at the gym!
1,Nice
0,"First the good. The packaging and items included with this set is exceptional. Everything showed up exactly as described, and I was surprised at the quality &#34;feel&#34; of the pair. However, this first set was not working correctly. I tried them every day for about a month during my workout routine and they were constantly dropping signal - cutting in and out. I emailed customer support and was promptly sent a brand new set.<br /><br />This second set arrived and worked flawlessly. The sound quality was superb, especially given the very reasonable price point for the product.  The microphone was clear (according the people on the other end of my calls).  I had no issues with sweat during workouts, and the buds stayed nicely in place. I was thrilled!!<br /><br />However, after using them nearly daily for about three months, I unfortunately experienced what many other reviewers have - the set just stopped working. No rhyme or reason, no slow fade-out in quality, just dead. I took very good care of the pair, never left them on the charger once fully charged, and did not abuse them.  However, they died anyway.  After two pairs, I unfortunately need to move on to another manufacturer."
1,Fits and stays in my ear.  The volume is much better than my previous bluetooth earbuds.
1,"The sound is very good, maybe a touch too much base, because they can get boomy. The volume preset is outstanding. If your sound volume is dangerously high when you connect, these headphones automatically turn it down. My two complaints that keep me from giving these headphones a full five stars are the volume control and battery. There is noticeable lag when trying to use the volume control on the headset. You have to hit the button and wait a moment before the volume actually changes. As far as battery life, there is an inevitable trade-off in blue tooth headphones. The smaller the size, the shorter the battery life and shorter the connection distance. For the most part I think the Senso headphones did a nice job of balancing the two, but I would like to have a bit longer battery life."
1,Good sound quality. Great price.
1,"So far so good! I've had waterproof headphones before that were cheaply made and the sound quality was terrible. I have not had any problems with these, and they sound amazing. Love my purchase so far!"
1,"Love these headphones!  Paired really easy with my i-phone.  I had a question about charging my headphones, called and the customer service was awesome!  Turns out I had overcharged them and messed them up, it was my mistake and they sent me a new set.  Super happy with this product and the company!"
1,The sound is great and holds the charge.
1,"So far so good. These arrived in less than 24 hours. Fits the ear well and come with different sizes of ear buds. I usually have a hard time keeping earbuds in my ears but so far they have stayed in. They are lightweight. Great bass and sound. Easy to use with directions and warranty included. Clear sound when making and receiving calls. Controls and microphone are on right headset (photos included). Battery life pops up on iPhone when paired! I’ve already recommended this product to others!<br /><br />UPDATE 6/6/18:  the sound quality for music and talking on the phone is great when the earbud part is secure in the ear. I have issues keeping earbuds (not just these) secure in the ear and this pair slips out when sweaty. The ear hook part doesn’t really hold the earbud in place, which is frustrating. I will likely give these to my husband to use."
1,"I bought 3 units for Christmas gifts, so I don't know first hand how they are.  BUT, my boss raves about them and has been using them for some time now.  I trust him and if he swears by them I know they are very very good.  He is quick to complain if something isn't right."
1,Love them. Great fit. Great sound. Amazing price!
1,"The best sound I've heard on a sports Bluetooth device, awesome."
1,You sound great absolutely no problems hearing them up and I'm happy about my purchase keep up the good work
1,"I just love these headphones. I have been trying to find a pair that sound great and will stay put in my ear. These fit the bill perfectly, highly recommended."
1,Great for running- finally an ear bud that stays in without making my ears sore
1,Love these headphones plus what everything that it comes with!
1,Like my new earplugs. Got it paired with my phone in less than 30seconds. Fits nicely. Packaging nicely done.
1,"Very Clear. The sound is impeccable. I have high-end wired Sennheiser headphones, and just as good when listening to music (although I'm audio no expert, so take with a grain of salt).<br />I've been told it sounds like I am on speakerphone when using my this with my phone.<br />Had a little issue with connection loss. Contacted warranty, and have a replacement within days.<br />A+ warranty!<br />When the time comes, I'd buy more for the family."
1,I wasn't sure how these would be as I have not used cordless before. Wish I would have tried them sooner. So much easier and freer. Syncs easy. Great sound. My only issue is that the right side always seems loose even when trying the different ear pieces.
1,This have a great sound when they stay in your ears. I have the smallest rubber things in and they are still to large. I didn't think my ears were that small.
1,"I have now purchased several of the Senso Headphones.  They sound is great but you need to make sure they are properly seated in your ear to hear the full dynamic range the headphones can produce.  Sound is clear and has plenty of volume.<br />I use them all the time, especially at the gym.  I bought a pair for my wife and she really likes them as well.<br />For the price, it is hard to imagine there is a better pair out there.  Just need to make sure the battery is charged which doesn't take too long.  Usually about 30 minutes to fully charge when the battery is completely drained.  With a full charge, they can last anywhere from 6 to 10 hours.<br /><br />Overall, I am quite happy with the Senso headphones and highly recommend them."
1,"They really take care of their customers, I was very impressed with the effectiveness of attention to detail they provide. .."
1,I lost a pair of these and ordered them again. I love them. I use them when listening to music while roommate watches TV
1,"They work well , they aren’t loud enough on my iPhone ."
1,Stay in my ears when running (ear buds always fall out) and great sound quality. Very easy to use.
1,Great headphones! Feel very durable and well made. Would highly recommend these. The cable that attaches the headphones together is a bit long. Overall great product!
0,"Useless. The bluetooth will not consistently reach from my ears to the devices (I tested multiple) merely in my cargo pocket. Same setup with other devices (like Beats Solo and Beats Studio) can reach through 50 ft and several walls. Again, utterly useless."
1,Great sound for the price!! The headphones were easy to setup and use.
0,When I opened the package everything looked great.  Then when I tested them  out the left speaker didn't even work.
1,I bought these headphones to use while at the gym and they have been amazing. They connect with a bluetooth device easily and have a long battery life not to mention that they come with charging cables including a car port.
0,"It's not that these are a bad product, just highly misrepresented as waterproof and useful for sports, which is the reason i bought these.  If I were using them indoors I would probably be happy with them, but I bought them to use while bicycling.  The wind noise with these is absolutely terrible.  Riding into a headwind creates a roar that drowns everything else out.  I tried taping over the mic hole but it made no difference.  Also, I soon as the buds got damp they did not want to stay in...<br /><br />When I got home from riding I wanted to rinse them off.  IPX7 means they should be submergible, so a quick prince under the faucet shouldn't harm them.  So I rinsed them, very quickly, and there is water still seeping out of them, and the USB port was full of water even though the cap was secure.  If I was only using these indoors, again, they would probably be fine, but definitely are not as advertised.<br /><br />Finally, I started looking for something else after I got back from my one ride, and it appears there is an identical version of these being sold under another brand for a little more than half what these cost.  Spend your money elsewhere...."
1,"for the price, these are awesome! no more having to have my phone in my pocket getting tangled in a chord while on the treadmill or cleaning the house, mowing the lawn. loud, clead, awesome!"
0,I’ve had these for about six weeks and they’ve already stopped working. Would have given it one star except that I really liked them. Used then with my Peloton. Too bad they are not better made.
0,"I bought these in March and they will no longer recharge. Evidently the return window closed in 1 month, and the product support window closed in 3 months. So... after 5 months, I have to throw these away and purchase a new pair. I will no longer purchase Senso, however, so please LMK if there's a brand you would recommend."
1,"Great devices, can't even tell their in my ears."
1,"Positives:<br />1. Sound quality seems very good for the price<br />2. They stay on your ears while running<br />3. A lot of functionality with the buttons<br /><br />Negatives:<br />1. The lightning usb/micro usb cable did not work out of the box (not a deal breaker, but annoying nonetheless)<br />2. The minimum volume is a little higher than I would like. I was going to use them at work, but they are too loud at the minimum to be able to fully focus on work"
1,Have had the headphones for a couple of months now and they are great!  The only downside is it takes a couple of minutes to get properly paired with my smartphone. Other than that I highly recommend them
1,"I used them once and they were easy to set up and use.  However, someone stole them within 12 hours. Poor me."
1,The headphones arrived the same day and they work wonderfully!
1,Sounds great. Easy to get working. Finally got rid of cord tangles!
1,"I've had these headphones for a few weeks now and use them with an iPhone 6. I use them for running, walking, and wearing around the house doing chores to listen to music or audio books. No issues with rubbing or falling out while running. Overall they're a good design and I'd buy them again, although I do have a few complaints. One the lowest setting on the volume is still louder than I'd prefer when I'm resting and there's no background noise. Two, the mid-range and high end range of sound is a little murky, I'm not too picky on sound quality, but if you're an audiophile this will bother you."
1,Great product for the price and suits my needs.
1,Easy to setup and have even connected them to our Samsung TV as a courtesy for our household that works multiple shifts and we have daytime sleepers. My son works out in gym daily with his and has nothing but the best to say about them. I appreciate that I can move around my office and listen to music without bothering my department or being tied to my phone or tablet. Would make great gifts. They are awesome and work great!!!
1,I like these headphones and they are quite comfortable to wear and work well. But they don't fit totally in my ears so they are not really noise cancelling. It means I have to turn up the volume with whatever I'm listening too. I have been using them in the gym while I'm working out.
1,So far so good sounds great better than I expected.
1,I loved these and they worked great while on the motorcycle or at the gym. But out of no where the left ear got a short in it and I have had them less then a year! So that is very disappointing that's why I am only giving them 3 stars wish they would have lasted for at least a year!
1,"I just got my order delivered.  I charged them up and really like the different options you have to charge these headphones.  They look like my beats but not near what they cost me.  After powering on I set the bluetooth and paired them and started playing music and I was very impressed by the sound these delivered.  Can't really listen to heavy bass on these but overall the variety of music sounded pretty good on these bad boys.  I have yet to see how long the charge lasts as it says 8 hours so we'll see about that in an update post.  As for the quality and how durable they are, that is another one for later.  I will post an update to see how these endure my workouts and day to day use.  For now these are pretty good and you can't beat the price compared to beats.  The sound is just as good yet cost under $40!  I'll post an update on how they are doing to let you know.  Rock on!"
0,"I would have like for them to work. Unfortunately, I couldn't get them to sync to my phone. Also, the headphones don't cancel noise. While biking, they create a wind-tunnel sound, making it impossible to hear any music, only the wind blowing."
1,"I purchased these headphones to replace a pair that had stopped working (would no longer synch up).  The previous set was probably over a year old, but honestly I really don't remember exactly when I got them.  In any case, I liked them enough that I got another set even though the first set eventually failed.  I enjoyed them enough, and the price was reasonable enough that I felt that I had gotten my money's worth.  I'm hopeful that this pair will last longer."
0,The sound was fine but got staticky and then totally cut out within 10 ft..  this will not work for me so I’m returning it
0,i bought these cordless headphones and they were easy to connect to my phone. I was happy with my purchase. BUT after they sat for a while they wouldn't sinc back to the same phone...or at least without a lot of fiddling around. Then after another couple weeks i went to use them and no mater how much charging them they got they are dead. They wont even turn on....do yourself a favor and dont buy these..
1,"Great product, great price!"
0,"As much as I wanted to like these, they have unfortunately stopped holding a charge barely after 4 months of use.  They've been sitting collecting dust for the last few months on my shelf as I've exceeded the 30 day return policy.  I'm going to see if they actually stand behind their one year warranty."
1,"Honestly, It is the best pair of wireless earphones I've ever owned, connecting to devices is quick and simple, the 30ft range really comes in handy too. I got my first pair over five months ago as a gift, and there is really no problems with it. The earphones are durable, the sound is crisp and also noise cancelling. Worth every penny,"
1,"I am super satisfied with these headphones. They fit, sound great, all in all, they just work, that's that!"
1,"Work well.  Battery lasts a long time.  Comfort is pretty good.  Connection is strong.  Phone operation is so-so.  Overall, a good buy for someone looking for solid and affordable bluetooth headphones."
0,"The best things I can say for these headphones... light, good sound, easy to pair to my phone, decent price.  What I hate...they pop/skip while playing.  I made sure they were fully charged.  I reset them to the factory default setting.  Paired them again. Tried to play my music on them again and they still pop/skip on occasions.  Very annoying.  It may take several minutes but it's going to happen.  They also lose their power rather quickly.  I can appreciate that I may have bought a defective pair but I bought two pairs at the same time and I just can't take a chance on the second pair.  You get one chance to have me as a consumer and that's it."
0,I got the ears phones to talk while walking and running.  The people on the other side have a difficult time hearing.  I can hear wind noise while I am walking. The battery depletes fast a couple of hour of continuous use.
1,"The title says it all.. Headphones were a great value, paired easily and are very wearable during exercise."
1,"Music is everything when I workout (-if it sounds sh*tty, my workout will be, too). My last one went through 4 years of sweat, fog, being dropped, left in my car, abused by the heat, sand, a teenager and the left bud stopped working- rightfully, so. It was finally time for a new set. It needed to withstand my workout habits- ie, Les Mills/Insanity, so- Wireless; fog/humidity/heat, so- Resilient etc. It needed to be durable, but had to sound good, too (i.e. &#34;if it sounds sh*tty, the workout will be, too&#34;). I circled Beats by Dre, like a shark. I loved how they sounded, but didn't want to drop $200+ bones on headphones I'd sweat in. I started looking at TrebLabs because they were waterproof. I took a chance on Senso, ONLY because it offered 1 day shipping w/Prime. Had it not- I would've gone w/TrebLabs. -I'm so glad I did!<br /><br />They say 'You get what you pay for&#34; -don't let that scare you because they're relatively inexpensive- considering what you're getting! I love them! They're very durable, they don't tangle, the music is crystal clear, sweatproof (survived 3 rounds of HIIT) and I've only had to recharge it once, in the past 5 days. I have not submerged them (yet), nor used them for talking (I bought them w/the intent of working out). It also came w/a hard-shell pouch. I'm very happy with these! I can't remember the last time I was so excited for a gadget!"
1,"So far so good. Got these for work, I work 10 hour shifts and the battery hasn't been a problem as long as I remember to plug them in at lunch"
1,I’ve had these for a few years now and they still work amazingly well. Such a great product!! And for a great price.
1,"Super simple to set up, they stay in place when working out, the sound is fantastic and my husband who hates technology loves his :)"
0,"My wife got these for me for Christmas because my old, $16 (like 25 year old) Sony ear hook buds finally fell apart. I've been writing a book and using Speechify for editing, using these earbuds. Initially, I liked that there were different sized silicone pieces to fit different size ear-holes. The sound quality seemed fine, and they were a bit bulky, a bit loose, but seemed not bad for $20. So now (1/10/21, or 17 days later) the charging port broke loose from the solder joints which affixed it to the little printed circuit board inside. Anyone who knows anything about wiring and electronics can tell you that a solder joint on a circuit board is inadequate to secure something that is going to have pressure put on it repeatedly due to plugging and unplugging. Obviously no one at Senso thought of this, or cared enough to put it into practice.<br /><br />This is all part of a larger problem which is what is known as 'planned obsolescence' or put simply 'making things cheap so they break quickly (usually just after warranty expires) and you have to buy another one'. It's happened to phones (buy a new iPhone every 2 years), audio equipment, cars, televisions, and computers (don't get me started on the crap Dell sells, and forget getting any support from them).<br /><br />AMAZON, if you're LISTENING, stop selling CRAP from SHADY SELLERS!  Stop allowing companies to bribe customers for 5-star reviews.  It makes reviews worthless and untrustworthy. Also, your buyers are obviously getting kickbacks, or if not they are terrible at judging quality. Either way, I cannot find good Bluetooth earbuds anywhere on the site.  Even the Beats audio ones you sell for $110 are lousy with quality issues.<br /><br />Disappointed, AMAZON. You own the internet but you can't sell quality electronics to save your lives."
0,"Not comfortable as all, Bluetooth skips signals when connected to iphone or tv. Please stay away from this cheap product."
1,These headphones just arrived and are performing beyond expectations. The question is will they continue to  perform as they sustain continued use.This is the question and they are too new to provide an answer.The success of the company depends on producing a durable product.We shall see. I will report back in 10 months.
1,It works very well!
1,It would be helpful if you could shorten the ear hoop...but was very easy to set up.
1,They hooked on my ear really good. The sound is great and clear. The battery last longer than the ones I previously owned.
1,I bought these because of the great reviews on Amazon and because of the great price. So far I'm very happy with them. They paired very easily to my iPhone 7 and sound very good. Definitely a good value.
1,Great product super fast delivery.
1,"I like these ear buds except for a couple of things.<br />1.) I have yet to see them last 8 hours before going dead.<br />2.) They take forever to charge for only lasting about 6 hours.<br /><br />They do fit comfortably though, and the sound is decent, but I wouldn't say the sound is Great.<br />I was really hoping they truly did last the full 8 hours. I use them to listen to music and the gospel while I'm cleaning or working out.<br /><br />Update: We bought two of these 4-2017. I gave one pair away and the other my husband uses daily. The other day I came to Amazon to look for another pair of sporty headphones which is how I realized my husband has used the same pair without issue for a little over TWO years. That's pretty great to me so I'll be buying myself another pair of these. We bought two of these 4-2017. I gave one pair away and the other my husband uses daily. The other day I came to Amazon to look for another pair of sporty headphones which is how I realized my husband has used the same pair without issue for a little over TWO years. That's pretty great to me so I upgraded by a star."
0,"I specifically bought these headphones because they are meant to be waterproof. I used them once, and they died before I finished my first lap. Unrelated, I didn’t think they were very comfortable. On the plus side, if you’re not intending to use in/around water, sound quality was decent for the price."
1,There great headphones and very easy to use to there full potential.
1,"Very comfortable, excellent sound quality, stays in my ears.  Love 'em!"
1,These have great sound.  They also stay on when I am working out or working around the house.  I appreciate that the charge port is compatible with a universal cord.  I love the hard shell carrying case.
1,"great battery life, fairly comfortable, great bluetooth range. worth every penny"
1,"The sound of these headphones is very good. I didn't have any issues. At times it is shocking how much sound I miss when not watching with earbuds, or use them for music. My only complaint is, and this is NO reflection on the seller, is I cannot find earbuds to fit my ears and stay secure. I even pre-purchased extra small silicone covers because the ones that come with any buds are always too large for my ears.<br /><br />Performance/ sound quality is very good for the very affordable price."
0,"After receiving my headphones & using then only once, my the wiring was exposed. I reached out to them to let them know the problem and was told to contact Amazon and have them send me a return kit and return them. I dont have time for this. I've had them for only 1 day and the wiring was showing. But besides that issue, the ear loops were a little large on me and I have the average ear and the quality was not that great... No bass. I would not recommend this product. Especially with the customer service I received. $30 down the drain. Sucks"
0,Had these for a while but then the sound stopped if the phone was behind me. Can’t seem to figure out why this is happening. Any help or advice is appreciated.
0,"Started off great hardly used them. I opened the case, unfold them, and the cord between the earbuds tore apart."
1,"first impression it is a very nice headphones, looks to be of great quality, good packaging and accessories plus excellent sound, time will tell if quality is good over time."
1,"Great headphones! Absolutely would recommend. Decently priced, and the sound quality is phenomenal. Personally I'm not used to this type of headphones - just the regular earbuds - and it took me a couple days to get used to them, but they fit just great. The headphones come with a few different sized earpieces, as well as a car charger and lightning cable for Apple products which is a definite plus. Love these!"
1,I love the headphones. The sound quality it really good. Bluetooth setup was easy. Wish the volume control was on the cord instead of the earpiece.
1,I think this are absolutely great for the price point. Warranty customer service is also on point.
0,These headphones worked well for the price. But after only a couple of weeks of light use they stopped connecting to any of my devices and I can no longer use them.
1,"Awesome sound quality, ease of use and comfort too!"
0,"4.5 stars?!? manipulation??<br />i normally work out with LG hbs700's, but those have a collar that is cumbersome, i thought i was upgrading.<br />nope.<br />everything is fine with these senso's except for the AUDIO QUALITY......which sucks........LG's sound much better.......the highs and vocals are much more crisp.<br />the quality is so bad im tossing it in the trash"
0,"I charged the buds and they went from red to blue but the next moring, I could not turn them on no matter what.  I plugged them back into the charger but this time no led light showed and I simply could not get them on to pair.  I am sending them back and reordered a new set.  did i do something wrong?"
1,"They work but I'm not a big fan of the in-ear headset because after a while it bugs me personally. I can only wear them for a short time before I get irritated by them. Other than that they sound fair but they do not really block outside noise to good.  The low end lacks depth but overall, they are not a bad buy."
1,"Got these for my husband for work and he says they really block out the ""work"" noise.  Took awhile for him to get used to how they hook on the ear, but he really likes them."
0,"When I bought it, it was great! Loud and crisp! I recently dropped one side in water and it’s completely dead on that side. Kinda disappointed when they said waterproof but it wasn’t. Threw it in the trash."
1,Very nice.  Connects to two devices simultaneously.
0,They are terrible. Worst Bluetooth headphones I ever had. Takes to long to connect with phone and it's keep losing connection. Multifunctional button doesn't even work with Android phone. Can't believe that people giving a 5 stars to this trash.
0,Just when your far away from your phone it shuts off
1,I have tried other earbuds but they would not stay in no matter what inserts I used. These are amazing with the fit and the soft feel of the ear loop. Would definitely buy again. Sound quality is also great
1,"Love the product, however, I have noticed that once I get to the year mark it stops working."
1,I liked everything that the senso bluetooth had to offer.and they are working just as good as they said it would. ...that's why I purchased them multiple times. ...I give them an 'A
1,"The headphones worked well and when they failed after six months, the company sent replacements with no problem."
0,I'm not able to charge the headphones.  I was only able to use it until the original charge ran out.
1,These Senso Bluetooth headphones are Awesome! Period!
1,"They came so fast ! In a carry case and other extra surprises , I will be buying more I am sure<br /> Great headphones for a decent price"
0,"Good sound and battery life, especially for the money. The volume up button quit working after about 6 months of relatively light use, so it is now stuck at a barely audible volume. Tried to contact the company, but they stopped responding after any simple fix didn't work. I would recommend avoiding this company due to their poor customer service."
1,Very Good
1,Best running head phones I have ever had
1,"I lost these, and man was I upset. The sound is good and loud. Good connectivity and great for working out in. Easy to charge. Sweat resistant."
1,Purchased a set of these in Feb. I use them daily and the left side started failing. I notified Senso explained to them the situation. I was asked for my order # 3 days later i received a new set.  Cudos to Senso and amazon for the cutomer service..
1,"These are durable, they don't fall out, and they sound great. I was really impressed by what came in the box, and the obvious quality of them, given the price point. It's rare that something comes with all the accessory cables, chargers, etc. This one came with a car charger and two cables."
0,No
1,Not bad for the price. I’m pretty pleased with what I got
1,Good headphones. They don't work as far away as they said but still a good distance maybe 10-15ft. The are very comfortable and never fall out of my ears. Maybe have to adjust it every once it awhile when I'm really moving around. Very good sound quality.
0,"What do you expect from cheap garbage from Amazon?  Well I go news for you, you get what you pay for.  Yes, this junk will stay on your ear.  Big deal, they have a bendable ear clip which I guarantee will break in 30 days.  So the good point is they stay on your ear, the bad news is that the sound is as horrible as you’d expect from such cheap junk."
1,"Excellent value! I use them for running and they work great. Paired easily. Includes extra ear tips in various sizes. Carry case is perfect size and function. I haven't made any phone calls yet, so I'm sure about hands free calling."
1,Awesome headphones better customer service
1,"I typically pair these headphones with my LG phone. When the two are too close together, the connection becomes spotty and the music starts to skip. The earclips aren't malleable and fall off occasionally.  Good value for the lightning deal in my opinion."
1,"These headphones were great when they were new but they're starting to fall apart after months of regular use.  My only but significant complain about these headphones are that the flexible earpiece is no longer holding its shape.  Now these ear buds are too loose so they won't stay on whenever I'm running.  I first noticed that I had to keep adjusting them when I was running but now I've given up and they just sit loosely and don't make a secure seat on my ear.  I really liked these when I first got them and I want to buy a replacement set but I'm nervous that those will fail as well.  Granted for what I paid for them I definitely got my money worth.<br /><br />The audio itself sounds good with a decent amount of bass.  It's not the absolute best audio quality compared to a nice set of studio headphones but music and voice calls definitely sound clear and nice.  Very good quality overall.<br /><br />The included accessories were a very nice touch.  The package came packed with extra goodies that manufacturers skimp out on these days.  This was a great value.<br /><br />The earbuds, when newer, fit perfectly on and in my ears but have definitely gotten too loose over time.  The sweat resistance is definitely a nice quality of these earbuds as well and they were perfect for outdoor activities.<br /><br />The range was surprisingly good on these as well.  In an open area I could get well over 30 feet of uninterrupted range.<br /><br />Overall these headphones are a great value for their price but I'm disappointed in their long term durability."
1,"I purchased these headphones because I exercise by doing water aerobics. They are awesome, the stay on my ears while I move through the water, the sound is great, easy instructions on setting them up. this purchase was the best one ever. thanks senso."
1,Great product Great sound excellent service and Customer service very helpful
0,"Ordered based on great reviews. Don't fall for it. There is no background noise reduction. Microphone is awful, callers can't hear or understand you. Sound is lackluster. And stupidly i didn't test them in a work setting until one week after return period closed. Spare yourself and look elsewhere"
1,"Easy to use and pair, great sound, no negatives"
1,"These headphones are amazing! I have a pair of Powerbeats 3 that I bought in April and all of a sudden they stopped working. I wasn't really in love with them anyways so I was searching for something different. I stumbled across these headphone at an unbelievable price. I thought they can at least be a backup once my beats get fixed.<br /><br />I can't get over the performance of these headphones. All other headphones I've bought takes forever to get the right fit. You have to experiment with different size ear tips then finally realize that's about the best it's going to get and then I get buyers remorse but don't want to put forth the effect to return them. But eventually you grow to like them. The volume is not that great especially in a noisy environment and the bass is really non existent. This has always been my experience with wireless bluetooth headphones.<br /><br />The Senso are totally the opposite. Right out of the box they are finominal! No fit issues, volume is incredible, and the bass was great right out of the box! I'm giving some thought about buying another pair for a backup if the price is still good. Highly<br />Recommended. Beats have nothing on these!"
0,"Maybe I got a lemon, but after only one day of use, the headphones are skipping and cutting in and out. Devices used are iPhone 5S and MacBook Air. The devices are literally a foot away from the headphones. I don't want to make the assumption that the numerous reviews are gimmicks, but I am not seeing the amazingly rated headphones these were meant to be. I hope the seller/company will make this right or I may just stick with a known brand next time."
0,They didnt fit at all. The sound was incredible though
0,"So here is the good:<br />1. quality packaging<br />2. easy to setup<br />3. in general quality materials and the charging cable supplied is high quality<br /><br />The bad:<br />And this is the big one.  I don't expect super high quality audio for 35 bucks, but the bass is very muddy and songs sound far worse on these vs other $20 ear buds I have.  I bought these knowing they would be a less expensive pair with bluetooth to use at the gym, but the audio quality is really very bad.  I would like to return these or trade them up for a better model.  Many positives with these SENSO, the packaging,the materials, but just not happy with the audio quality."
1,I had an issue with my earbuds and received a new pair with no issues. Great customer service and the replacement product has worked great.
1,Good bluetooth headphones. Easy to use and stay put in your ears.
1,Used them today for the first time in my Gasparilla Distance classic Race!<br />Today 15k & 5k and tomorrow 8k & Half Marathon!!<br />They worked great today!! Battery lasted thru both races!
1,Love them. Very comfortable. Great fit in my ears.
1,I use these earbuds when I mountain bike. They sound great and feel comfortable!
1,Awesome headphones
0,"No they did not work, I've called customer service and they informed  me to send them back in and get a refund. Very dissatisfied!!!!!"
1,I'm not sure they are a Christmas gift.
1,"Sound and battery is amazing!! The fit is good, the adjustable hook thing gets kinda loose so I have to adjust each time which is not a big deal. Main thing is battery is great and sound is also which are most important!! Quality build."
1,"Cyclist review:<br />PROS: These headphones are loud, they seem highly resistant to sweat, and Bluetooth works great. They come with interchangable ear pieces (for small/med/large ear canals). They hold a charge for me for the entire week (~8hr runtime, est.)<br /><br />One Major CON: They really catch the wind and are pretty much useless if you don’t have a skull cap or some sort of fabric covering them. I’m not sure I’ll be able to use them at all in the summer. If you aren’t biking with them, don’t worry about this, they’ll be great."
1,"Senso Bluetooth Headphones are great. They are lightweight making them comfortable to wear; but they are powerful in sound. They produce big, clear, crisp sound. I am more than satisfied. I heartily recommend them."
1,I use mine while working out everyday. They fit well. They don't move or come out or off the ear easily.<br />I really enjoy them.
1,"these are so easy to get going, it's fantastic!  i bought them for biking and they work perfectly.  good sound quality, easy to operate, awesome!!!"
1,Arrived right on time and easy to sync with my Samsung Galaxy 6.  The battery lasts about a week between charges which I like.
1,"To be honest,  I heard about these and how &#34;to good&#34; for the price they are so I was very eager but wary on the quality... I put them on and all concerns went out the window. These are easily worth $80 or more on the lowest of low ends. Ontop of the Bose qualoty sound they produce they feel sturdy like they will last. They come with a hard shell case along with two forms of charging cables including a car adapter. You CANNOT get anything better for the price and quality! Water resistant, strong, bass, noise cancelling, battery life, even ear fit is perfect. I will be buying another set very soon just to have as a backup."
1,"Loving these headphones so far. Easy to set up, only an hour to charge. Ran six miles and they stayed in my ears nicely. Great sound quality with an impressive bass sound. Wish I found them sooner."
1,Just great
1,"Don't expect much from these head phones. They are cheap for a reason. For the price, I would say they are ok. I eventually ended up getting a<br /> more expensive Bose headphones which are much better and great bass."
0,I could not pair the buds with my phone.<br />Now what do I do next?
1,These are great.
1,"These headsets, while comfortable, provide just mediocre sound. They have deep bass, but, they have horribly sacrificed the high end just to produce bass. Anyone who cares about the actual sound quality should take this into consideration. Even toying with the EQ on my phone was not enough. But otherwise, they seem well built. The audio quality just isn't there."
1,"I am very pleased with the SENSO  Bluetooth headphones. I use them primarily at the gym while I'm working out and they do stay in your ears very well and the sound is excellent for the price.  I also bought a pair for my 29-year-old son who lives in New York City and uses them to work out and on the subway on the way to work. He is very pleased with them and likes him a lot as well. I am also impressed with the company as they contacted me more than once to see if everything was OK. The only difficulty I had  was plugging in the 3 foot cord into my headphones. I did not realize that there were two connections and how to pull out the part that plugged into the Bluetooth, which now works fine. I highly recommend this company, the product and their follow up support and I will give them five stars."
1,Great sound and quick delivery
1,"Got them today. Easily the first impression is too much bass. Overall sound is muffled, but I wonder if the problem is with my Nexus 5X phone. A brief glance at most reviews seem to indicate no problem with bass, but a few do report too much bass. Unfortunately, they don't mention the phone they are using,  I've tried adjusting the equalizer settings, but don't get a lot of improvement.  I hope I can find an app that does a better job with the audio adjustments. Otherwise, I might have to return them."
0,"They work really well when I am in a closed room. However, when I get outside in the open connection drops and audio comes chopped. It is even worse when I am walking next to a road, it seems every car that passes by interferes with its connection. I bought this thinking I would use it when I ride my bicycle, but they might not work well.<br />So I got an email from customer support, I performed a reset on the device as instructed. The device worked fine during a couple of weeks, but then the problem appeared again. It happens even if I hold the phone next to the right earpiece. Is there a way to fix this properly?<br />UPDATE: I can say that they have a great consumer support service. I got a new pair of headphones shipped and they perform better than the first pair. However, I am still experiencing some chopped audio but not as bad as with the first pair of headphones.<br />Make sure you carry your phone in the right side of the body, I figured out the bluetooth receiver is on the right side earpiece. Doing so significantly reduced connection drops and chopped audio.<br />PROS: great battery life, and better than average sound quality. This statement might be subjective, but I feel the fit is comfortable. Great consumer support kudos for that.<br />CONS: chopped audio and dropped connection (might be an issue with reports of Pixel phone bluetooth issues, I have two friends with the same headphones and they claim they never experienced such issues). Wind noise is high when I ride my bicycle, sometimes I can't listen to the audio coming from the headphones.<br /><br />Update: so it's been 10 months since I got the earbuds. I can praise the sound quality, battery life, and customer support.<br />However, build quality is questionable, once they fell from my neck  (I'm 5'10) and they broke open. The second pair I got stopped working suddenly, the LED light will indicate they charge but they won't turn on. Both pairs stopped working from the left side, I had to wiggle and bend the wire on the right ear piece to make it work, but if I move my head the sound will cut off to the left earpiece. So I stopped using them, I'm sad because they had great battery life and the sound quality for the price was excellent. I hope they make the wire more durable or just make it a.cord to hold both earpieces together. I appreciate the great customer support."
0,On my second set. Fail. First won't pair with anything but an Apple product and Apple can inhale my azzzah gas. 2nd has a battery life of about an hour and a half. OK sound but constantly cut out.
1,Excellent sound and construction of these head phones. I bought them for my son as a gift after my fiancé ordered them for himself. He is a musician and extremely Precise with all sounds and levels of music we listen to.  He uses these daily on his long walks and is very happy with them. Thank you!
1,"Great! Ran with them to day, had a problem with my old ones falling out. Highly recommend these so far."
0,One of the earpieces stopped working after a month of use
1,Headphones reliably last for at least eight hours of continuous use and recharge relatively fast (typically two to four hours).
1,"I bought these headphones about 6 months ago and love them! The battery life is pretty good (at least 3-4 hours but probably more). If I could change something I'd prefer it gives you a little more warning before it is about to die - but this is a problem I run into with most headphones/speakers. What I was looking for was high quality, easy to run with, quick pairing, and the ability to change songs while running. These have all of those - and best of all don't hurt my ears after a long wear."
1,"Hi Kenneth,<br />Thank you for reach your to me about my satisfaction with your product. Everything is great used them for the first time today and they worked great !<br />Greg M."
1,Everything!
0,"I rarely uae headsets only during travel or maybe on rare occasions I pretend to work out.<br /><br />I'm not beating on these headsets daily...so imagine my surprise ro experience an issue already!  One ear just stopped working. Wasnt dropped,  didn't get wet at all, no tug of war with my 15 year old or anything.<br />Yes  45 days into ownership with LESS THAN 200 HOURS of use."
1,Where do I start these headphones definitely have my vote for five plus stars let me see they do everything and sound amazing just like describe trust me you will not better yet be dissatisfied yours truly a proud owner 😁
1,Great earphones at amazing price!!
0,"Audio quality is terrible, not very comfortable, no sound isolation, but they do come with a lot of accessories and features for the price."
1,I like these a lot. Great deal for the money. I'm no audiophile but they sound perfect to me. I'm a runner and for years now I've been wishing they made wireless ear buds. Thank you Senso.
0,These are the worst earbuds I've ever owned. the sound quality is horrible!! the sound actually cuts out as I move my head left to right if you value music do not buy these !
1,Great earbuds but too big for my girl ears even with the different attachments. I gave them to my dad and he loves them!
1,"Great, functional bt headset. Get almost 8 hrs per charge"
1,Bought these for my grandson for Christmas. He says he really likes them
1,"These are our “go to” wireless earphones for sports.  They work well, sound good, and are a good buy."
1,"Great price, they work as promised."
1,"I am really enjoying these headphones! I have tried 2 other brands and returned them due to short battery life or they kept falling out if my ears. These SENSO headphones are just Awesome! I have used them at work, on my elliptical, and with my Audible app. So far the sound quality and fit is great. I haven't tried using them on a call yet but it's not the main reason I purchased them. Paired quickly with no issues."
1,"Amazing quality and sound. Bluetooth pairs easily, and the buttons are intuitive. I listen to them daily and have had no problems. Fit is excellent for active users or just sitting on the couch. Much higher quality than expected. I will definitely buy these again, and will be giving these as a gift in the near future to the gym rat in my family."
1,"First set of bluetooth headphones. So far sound quality, battery life, and fit are good.  I also like the adjustable earbuds as the original buds kept slipping out my ear when I ran on the treadmill.<br /><br />The only issue I've encountered so far is interference.  I have the headphones paired with both my iPhone and my iPad but I have found that if connected to both at once the sound begins to &#34;stutter.&#34;  (It would be less of an inconvenience if the bluetooth function on my iPad would stay off once I turn it off, but I digress).<br /><br />Overall a quality product which I use both at home, work, and while running.  Not sure that you can get better quality for the price, but be aware of the interference issue."
1,I like everything about the earphones
1,Awesome sound and range with Bluetooth
1,Best head phones 🤘🏼
0,"Had mine for about 45 days when I went to take them out of the case to find the battery falling out and the side piece nowhere to be found. I bought a cheap piece of junk, hopefully you won't make the same mistake..."
0,I usually buy Senheiser and tried this based on price and reviews.  You get what you pay for.  This is a very cheap product that feels and sounds CHEAP
1,So far it's great. Good value. Sound is decent for Bluetooth connection and the price.  Anxious to try it out in the car and see if it's truly hands free.
0,Bought this item as a Christmas present for my husband. He’s used it a total of four times and now the headphones don’t hold a charge. Very disappointed
1,Great headphones. Bought them in January and for some reason in November the left side started cutting out. They were still under warranty so I contacted Senso expecting the run around or a long drawn out process to try to get replaced. Wrong! Sent in an email and had a response within an hour. They asked me to hard reset which didn’t solve the problem. They next confirmed my address and told me a new pair was ordered for me. That was Monday. It’s wednesday and I’m back rocking to my music on the headphones. Two day turn around on warranty replacement! Unheard of!  Fan for life!
1,"Start by saying I've only been using these for a week, however they have completely exceeded my expectations. I've been using Plantronics Backbeat Fits for several years and have been pleased but a pair recently broke which led me to this purchase. They are 5x louder than my Plantronics and fit much nicer. Bass is booming (I've had to turn down bass a touch for my liking). I have done a week full of very intense HIIT style workouts and they have not fallen out. Highly recommend!"
0,They broke within a couple of weeks of use. The button to turn the headphones on and off got stuck and doesn't function properly. The sound is decent.
0,"Product doesn't last<br />This is the the 2nd pair I got due to failure, and just failed again.  I don't use it very often, but now it doesn't turn on. Followed all instructions to reset it but stays the same.  Had a lot of expectations"
1,"Great sounds. had issue with recharging after a few months and seller replaced very quickly, no problem.<br /><br />Very happy with the headphones and even more pleased by their customer service."
1,Great product for the price. Very happy customer.
1,I love these headphones. I ran my first marathon with them in and they never once fell out of my ears. They also last FOREVER. I ran the marathon (4+ hours) and barely used any battery.
0,Needed something more practical to workout with since having an arm band and traditional headphones was more or less annoying. Read some reviews on these and was sold. It’s just too bad that they were just as annoying as my normal headphones. During one of my runs every 10 seconds it would cut out my music and say connected. I trashed them directly afterwards. Don’t waste your money like I did.
1,"I use my SENSO Wireless Bluetooth Headphones all the time when I am working out.  I use them for running and in the gym and I think they do a very nice job overall.  They are comfortable, have decent sound, good bass, stay in place for the most part, a good battery life, and are easy to operate.<br /><br />The reason I did not give the 5 stars is because on a fairly frequent basis they do stutter their connection for some unknown reason. The instructions say they can be a fairly good distance from the device they are being streamed from but I can be right next to the device and they will still do it.  It happens frequently enough (1 out of 5 times usually) to be annoying.  For the price I'm not going to have a hissy fit...  But I cannot give them 5 stars.  I still feel like they are well worth 4 stars and would still recommend them."
1,"These earbuds are great so far. I only got them yesterday, but I wore them almost all day. The sound is amazing. I didn't have to spend hundreds to get great sound. They were easy to set up with my phone and comfortable on my ears."
0,"I have a earlier version of these headphones and I like them! So when an advanced pair came available i'm thinking all right. With that being said ,maybe I got a bad pair BUT I can't even have my phone in my pocket and it loses the blue tooth signal. Also I can't get more than 5 yards away and the headphones start breaking up. This is with my phone and headphones fully charged. With the previous version I can walk from the front yard to the back without any problem. In addition these aren't truly &#34;noise cancelling&#34;. They do eliminate outside noise better than the original but  version but louder noises still can be heard."
1,Absolutely love these! Great accessories 👌🏼Most important the battery lasted all of my 9 hour day and then some.. still had 60% when I turned them off. Very happy and will be getting my son a pair!
0,"Quit working after a month, red light cont to blink after you take this out of charge, tried multiple times thinking may will need full charge but no luck. You have a one year warranty. Please tell me what should I do"
1,Very good Headphones and customer service is A-1
0,"The ear support is an awful fit. I can't imagine anyone whose head the ear support would actually prove beneficial. If the ear piece doesn't fit inside your ear, know that the ear support will NOT keep this unit in place. I also can't possibly see how you could use this while running."
1,"Great headphones, stays in your ears without needing to adjust and sounds great."
0,"So honestly, for the price these work well as just a generic bluetooth replacement. Though if you are an active person and you run or bike, these amplify wind noise A LOT. I have to crank up the sound to overcome the wind noise generated by the design of the headphone. I probably wouldn't get these again knowing I really can't use them while outdoors."
1,I gave these as a gift for my boyfriend. He is very pleased with them. He is able to use them at the gym and under his motorcycle helmet. These are a great!
1,They are very nice at noise canceling however even their lowest volume level is way too loud. I wish I could turn it down more. I have an iPhone. I’m not sure if it is a problem in other devices.
1,I was looking for a set of headphones that weren't super expensive or bulky and would stay on regardless of what activity I was doing. These are perfect! The sound is fantastic! They fit well and are super lite weight! They were everything I was looking for!
1,Love the small size and packaging
1,I saw an ad for Amazon with headphones that were not attached so I opted to try those.<br />sorry
1,I lost a more expensive pair and replaced them with these due to all the amazing reviews... I too highly recommend these ear-bits.
1,"love this ones!!!!! great sound!! great color , easy to use ,i have them for a while , durable, battery last really long time , depends how you use them and for how long you work them out to the extreme , so far they still work , they have an extra pair of ear plugs to mach your ear size ,  you can make calls and the sounds is really really good!!! make sure you never drive with the headphone not good safety , safety always first  ."
1,"These headphones are perfect... for the price. Before I bought these I had JBL Everest 100s, and the video playback was horrible. These are fine for videos, as there is no lag. The only issue I have with these is that they are very loud. At the third volume setting on my iPhone 7they are almost too loud, and you cannot go any lower, because the headphones will just beep instead of play music. I was able to make it a little bit quieter by going into settings, music, and then changing the EQ setting to loudness. It took it down hardly a notch. Then I turned on 'sound check' and it's a little more tolerable now. There is also a very slight buzzing sound in the background when music is playing, but it is hardly noticeable.<br /><br />That is the only issue I've had with these. There are a little bassy, but that's expected with $30 headphones. It was definitely worth it, especially because you can buy a pair of similar $100 headphones that have terrible reviews."
1,These have solid sound quality and noise level at an affordable price!
0,Bought these for my husband for Christmas 2016 and they went out in April. Very disappointed.
1,"Sounds great, easy to set up, holds a charge well, and stays in your ear"
1,I'm impressed with the quality of the headphones.  Especially for the price!
0,"I'm sure these are great, but I got a pair that are too loud on the lowest volume. Not too loud to stand, but too loud. If I went up a notch more people could hear if they were close enough."
1,The most important about headsets is sound. Quality is just below the average. The buit is good.
1,My husband and I both bought these headphones when the wireless pods my husband had fell off into a puddle of water.  These were recommended to us by our son and we are in love.  Great product!
1,"I bought these May 2017 and they were perfect until about January 2018. I am a walking mailman in North Carolina  and I wear these every day for a minimum of eight and sometimes 10 or 11 hours everyday and I sweat profusely. I was worried about most models that will get wet when it rains or I sweat and ruin them; that was not the case for these. I never had a problem with water from sweat or getting too wet when I was being rained on and the battery always lasts the whole day. I listen to music, podcast,YouTube Red, audiobooks or some form of listening entertainment most of the day that's about 9-10 hours of solid use everyday and standby intermittently ( I turn them off when I drive maybe 30 mins all day) these are excellent for the money and the only reason I am replacing them is because they got tangled up and I got rough trying to separate the knot which bent one of the wires the right piece which has all the functionality still works perfect but the left side comes in and out since the price is low and I know the damage is mostly my fault. I will be repurchasing another set as they have been perfect through rain, hail, sleet, snow and almost  a toddler who tied them in a tight knot"
0,Totally not what I was expecting. The sound quality is ok for the money you pay but wow these are the most uncomfortable earbuds I ever tried! After 20 minutes of wearing these I had ear ache . Sorry but I can’t recommend these to anyone
1,5 star headphones for a 5 star man
0,"I just returned these headphones.  While wearing them, the bluetooth would cut out if my phone was down at waist level.  The only time I got a clear connection was if I held my phone at chest level.  Disappointed."
1,"Pleased with the sound and design, but the ear buds are fragile and one side has broken off already 😩"
1,the sound is good but the connection is very bad.
0,"The beeped and lost connection about 20 times in 30 minutes with the phone only 4 ft away. Waste of time and money, I am returning them."
1,Accidentally washed them in my washing machine... still work no problem!!
1,Love these headphones. Unfortunately I lost them. I then ordered another pair and I am suffering through many Bluetooth related problems. To connect it only connects for calls not music (meaning I have to rediscover it to get full connection. The connection strength is bad constantly cuts in and out while walking. Lastly every now and then the volume just goes nuts (really high or low).
1,"Mostly reasonable headphones for a slightly exorbitant price. The noise cancelling feature only exists because of the way the speaker fits your ear. Nothing electronic or effective. Get what you pay for, not what the retail price and discount is. I might have to amend. Garbage. Floppy ear hooks and wicked bad sound. Do not buy."
1,"Works well, but I wouldn't recommend getting two pairs. It gets confusing when trying to sync them up with the speakers."
1,"They're ok, but they cut out a lot. If I turn my head too much - cuts out. If my wife runs with it - cuts out. Sound quality is decent, but that's about it."
1,"I don't usually write reviews. But I absolutely love the sound quality of these headphones.  I bought them for walking &  jogging in the pool.  I listen to smooth jazz & the sound is lush. I hear not only the main instuments but the background nuances too. The range is incredible even. The sound is full-bodied. I was surprised as the cost was so reasonable and they sound as good or better as the more expensive ones.<br />Cons: -Sometimes I have to keep adjusting to keep them comfortably on my ear.<br />-I keep hitting the off/on button when I try & adjust them. Due to where its located.<br />-I don't want to get out of the pool because music is sounding so darn good (that's more my problem)<br />Bottom line, well worth the price & you'll love the sound quality."
1,"I bought these for working out, so I don't need top of the line sound quality. These are ok... the bass is muddy sometimes, and they seem to be heavier on the higher frequencies, but they're not bad at all for $30 headphones. My biggest issue is that they keep falling out of my ears. The loop that keeps them in your ears is adjustable, but no matter what I try, they start coming loose after a few minutes of running. I've tried practically curling the loop part completely around my ear, and after a few minutes, they're loose again. Very annoying. My old headphones just had a rubber loop that wasn't adjustable, and they stayed in just fine, so even though it seems like the ability to adjust them should make them even better, I just can't get them to stay in."
1,Bought as a Birthday gift for my son in-law (he's a painter by trade). He absolutely loves them and is satisfied  with the headphones and the accessories included!
1,"I own a pair of the Beats Powerbeats 2's and this pair of SENSO headphones are almost identical! In relation to sound quality, personally I believe that the SENSO's are better! I would recommend anyone looking for a great pair of bluetooth headphones without spending a whole lot of money; to purchase these. Also, if you're thinking about using these at the gym, I highly recommend it!"
0,"The headphones worked well and sounded good but fell apart in less than 6 months, and that's being generous."
1,"I'm rating these after only a few days, but so far these are outstanding. The over-the-ear piece is very flexible and not rigid making it very comfortable for extended wearing. The inner ear piece fit comfortably and did a great job of blocking sound without giving me that pressure feeling in my ears. I used the largest buds to keep them from inserting too deep in the ear. My favorite thing, which I wasn't sure I'd like, is having all the controls on the earpiece. My previous set from a different manufacturer had the control dangling from the ear on the cord and the persistent bouncing and assymetrical design of having that on one side always caused problems pulling them out of ear when running. This pairs, that is not an issue. Minimal buttons with maximum control options and they aren't too bulky on the ear. They didn't budge through my hour long run or get uncomfortable or lose power. Sound is plenty loud enough and the sound quality is above average but not audiophile worthy. Excellent for working out. I swear a lot and had no issues. Last manufacturers didn't last more than 4 months. I will update this review if something happens. Also the included accessories were a welcome surprise. Great product(so far) and great price. Nice work."
1,"These have great sound, very happy with them for biking or for using at my desk at work."
1,Fantastic headphones for running!!!  Great sound!
0,"The band that wraps around ears was odd shaped, different on each one, one was too small and one was too large, would not stay in place on either ear."
0,"I'm using this as an alternative to my iPhone headphones, and the sound is 10 times better on the apple headphones, pretty disappointed 😔"
0,"I had bought a pair of these about 4 years ago and I loved them. I recently had to replace them, and the quality of these headphones has gone to trash. Cheap plastic, loose buttons, flimsy wire. Save your money and find another brand."
0,"The sound quality was good. The microphone wasn't great. But after about 1 month the hardware broke out of nowhere. I would say, these are actually pretty cheaply made. Ps. Battery life also sucks"
1,Greats
1,"working great!  connectivity was simple, battery life is good, audio quality is good.."
0,These earbuds stopped working after 3 weeks.  Liked them but build quality is suspect.
1,"I've only used the headphones a few times, but so for they are great!  They fit comfortably and have a very clear sound.  You cannot beat the price!"
1,Nicely built and good sound quality. Paring with my phone was a breeze. Would recommend.
1,Easy set up. Very nice sound. Just what I wanted.
1,Love these for my Treadmill. I watch YouTube and other stuff while I walk to a healthier self and use these to spare the household. They’re a bit bulky feeling around my ear but it’s not a big deal. They do cancel our noise which means you hear better. Love them for the price.
1,"Love, love love these earbuds, however when I turn my head the music cuts out , like there's not a good connection. Is this normal? And how do I adjust for this?<br />Otherwise my review would have been 5 stars!"
1,They work Great with my new Google Pixel 2<br />I walk thru wood about 5 mi per day to country western music<br />Thanks
1,As described.  Wonderful sound. Arrived BEFORE expected delivery date!!!
1,Exactly what was needed and cost of in the right price range.
0,with noise in it...
0,Unfortunately these headphones stopped charging after 6 months. I probably used them an average of once a week and now they're completely dead. Headed to the landfill.
1,"I have not used my new headphones outside yet. I have used them on my iPad to watch a movie. I am very well pleased. No problems whatsoever! Connecting, quality of sound, placement and controls are great. I have already connected to my iPhone when I charged them up. No problem at all. Too excited to use them outside and not have to worry pulling out buds because of blowing wind or wires connected to my phone. When I use them outside I'll be back to give another review! 5-2-17 I am pleased  to say these are excellent for outside jogging, running or walking!"
1,Great customer service. Great product
1,Comes with a lot of accessories. Sound quality is very good.  I'm using my old Galaxy S3 as an MP3 player and pairing it with these headphones was easy.  My only nitpick is that the cover of the USB port could be designed a little better for more secure closing.  It's just a rubber flap.
1,"Sound quality is amazing, and very comfortable on my husband ear while he work out,  mine will be delivered today, can't wait"
0,"Been a senso headphone users for years, old one finally broke down and the new one I just purchased had a worse sound quality and noise cancellation compared to last one, Disappointed with overall quality will continue testing."
1,"I have tried a number of other BT headsets and all have failed me by constantly falling out of ear. Finally, a set that does not fall out that deliver great sound!"
1,Sound was fine and it did provide about 6 hour battery life. Returned because microphone did not work and connection stops suddenly.
1,Just what I was looking for.  Great sound and easy set up.
1,The price you pay for what you get can't be beat. They come with different size ear pieces and the sound quality is great.
0,So I thought these were great and all- worked fine for about a year but now I have this issue with the headphones.<br />Basically there is a short in the actual headphone wire that connected the two earbuds- audio keeps getting cut out and not working in stereo like it did before.<br /><br />I usually am not one to rant but Senso customer service has been EXTREMELY RUDE telling me they can't help me since my warranty period has just expired and they offered me a pathetic 5% discount.<br />Come on do you really think I'm going to buy these headphones again after they lasted only a year?!!<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THEY BREAK VERY FAST!!
0,Great sound !<br />But sadly when I used for phone calls everyone I talked with said they could hear their voice echoing.
1,"Love these ear buds!  Great sound and very comfortable!  I like the ear loop as well, as it keeps them in my ear."
1,Awesome works great only problem is when I have a  beanie on pushes in my ear more . A little bulkier than I thought
1,"Beyond Happy these headphones work for my workouts! Sound is great, stays snug, and is easily rechargeable. This saved me from buying Bose's version @ $150! Great purchase"
1,"Overall quality is great.  Definitely outperforms beats, more balanced sound,  not quite as bass heavy."
0,One of my headphones stopped working after about three weeks to month. It just went out during one of my runs. Wish I would of tried to return sooner because deadline passed smh
0,"Poor quality, it sied in one day."
1,"Great ear buds, quick and comfortable with great sound. My second pair as recommended by my son. Great sound and easy to use."
0,These worked great for the time period that they were operational. I used them on one run and now they won't even turn on or pair. Just wasted my money
1,"I've been using these headphones for a week, listening to music via Amazon Prime and I'm extremely happy with the performance. Range is fantastic - I can walk all around the gym and never lose a signal. Setup was a snap and they're probably the most comfortable in-ear headphones I've ever worn."
1,"Sound quality is good for sports earphones that use Bluetooth. I felt that the sound tends to have a slight favor toward treble and is weak in regards to the bass, especially at the higher volumes, but, I have definitely have use far worse earphones.<br />The ear looks are very comfortable and have a great degree of flexibility toward fitting around various ear shapes, same goes for the three different sized ear heads.<br />Battery life is good and last me a couples days for my use case, 4-5 hr/day.<br />The noise cancellation feature, I haven't really noticed it, outside what I would expect from having headphones in.<br />Have not had to deal with high moisture situation yet, will update once such a situation occurs."
1,"Excellent sound, great features. Everything fine so far. The seller seems to care about customers."
1,There is a damn good reason these buds are 5 star. These replaced my broken beats. SmIles from ear to ear. Full range sound with plenty of isolation. Block the world out.<br /><br />6/18. Two other techs I'm working with have them now. I'm on my second pair after I lost the first. I have 2 pairs now.
1,Has great sound quality even when running.
1,Worked well with IPhone but kept cutting off when using my Apple Watch so I returned them.
1,AMAZING customer service! Great product!!
1,"Great, inexpensive bluetooth headphones.  Paired easily and very good audio.  Charge lasts a long time too!  I am thrilled I bought these instead of the more expensive bands.  Thanks SENSO!"
1,Very practical. Love the good quality accessories. Everything including the charging cable fits neatly into the small case.<br />Helpful in charging at the Gym after workout. Can recommend.
0,I purchased 2 sets of these headphones for my daughter and I to use with Aqua Exercise. They don’t pick up Pandora very well. Lots of static. Left bud keeps going out all together on BOTH headsets. Acts like there is a “short” because music goes in and out even with phone close to headset  This happens on BOTH. The piece that slips around ears keeps slipping off and bud doesn’t fit ears properly even with switching bud pieces. Would NOT recommend these. Very disappointed.
1,Shipped fast. And was easy to pair. The sound is awesome. No issues at all. My daughter ordered hers first. She liked them so well she ordered me a set. I have been looking for a good set of wireless earphones. And these are just right!
1,"Comfortable headphones, connects easily with my iPhone 7"
0,"The left ear randomly loses audio and it gets worse everyday. I am supposed to have a year warranty, but I have not been able to get a replacement."
0,Not the same model as I previously ordered. Cheap knock off. I'm pissed.
0,"I bought it at May 10 2017, the sound discontinued on the left earbob in 5 month. Plus the microphone is not good, people cannot hear what I am talking."
1,The headphones sound good but they were for my daughter and she doesn't like the headphones; she likes beats instead so I have two pairs that I will end up useing. Lucky for me I didn't pay full price for each.
1,"These are great headphones at a great price.  I was looking for headphones to workout with that paired w my Apple Watch.  After reading all the good reviews I landed on these.  They can’t be beat for the quality at the price. They come with a case, multiple ear bud sizes and other extras. After using them one time I went home and ordered a set for my wife. If you want good Bluetooth headphones and not spend an arm and a leg, do yourself a favor and try these."
1,"So far, I have no major complaints with these headphones. Having gone through several pairs of really expensive high-end headphones, and an untold number of low-end wally-world specials, these sit right smack in the middle in terms of quality and price. There is some reception issues when attempting to work-out with them on - namely if your phone is in a back pocket - but overall they work without any issue.<br /><br />My only complaint on these headphones would be the weight after an extended period of time. When using them for a 3+ hour bike ride, by the end, you can definitely feel them pulling down."
0,Signal breaks up when more than 1.5 feet away.
1,Bought these due to the great reviews that we seen. I want to say just from prompt shipment to opening these I am ordering more!
1,This is a Christmas present has not been used yet
1,"Easy to use and very convenient. My niece, sister, and I All have a pair."
0,Earbuds are constantly dropping signal. I'm thinking it is specific to this pair because I've had these same kind in the past and that's never happened..
1,"Great sound, nice fit and noise canceling"
1,"I needed a way to listen to calls, music, and videos while still being around other people and noises.  The SENSO ActivBuds Bluetooth Headphones work great.  I am able to sync them easily to my ipad and iphone and I can move about easily.  The range is a lot farther than I would have thought...I can walk to other rooms at home or in the office and stay connected.  I can watch TV and still listen to football games or music...at the same time!  I think I will purchase sets for my sons as Christmas gifts!"
1,"Arrived today, packed well, connected with my phone, very good sound. I didn't really expect much cause they don't cost much but they exceeded all expectations by far. I think I'll buy a 2nd pair for my wife because these things are sweet."
1,Good bass loud long long battery  life
1,"Total win here! Comfortable ear buds that stay put even when running and weight training; the gel-type ear hooks are amazingly comfortable - I was worried they would be to flimsy - and help hold the ear buds in place. The set-up and pairing was a breeze. The controls, albeit somewhat small, are easy to use. And the sound is absolutely fantastic!! Make sure you dial back your volume - these things pump it out! The noise cancellation is actually pretty decent and remove most noises from the gym. I highly recommend these ear buds for anything/anyone active!!"
1,Good voice quality but you can't used in bed time
1,For the price these things are great.
1,I purchased these for the price point and am NOT disappointed. I like listening to audio books while doing other things and these are great. I’ve also had phone conversations and the person at the other end had no problem hearing me.
1,"Edit 3/9: After Senso support reached out, I tried using a different cable and it started charging - so it was the cable, not the headphones, that was at fault. The charging cable was also heating up, so definitely needs to be replaced.<br />They seem ok for the price, but did not expect them to stop working so soon! In less than 3 months of intermittent usage they have now stopped charging. When I plug them in to charge, the red/blue light does not come up and even after keeping them plugged in for couple hours it's always saying ""battery low""! Completely useless. And of course Amazon will not take it back as it's been over a month, but come on.. less than 3 months is too short of a life for headphones - I'd expect at least a year."
1,sounds good<br />comfortable<br />pairs easy
0,These are built to last just long enough for the warranty to expire.  My battery died in little over one year.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and get something with more longevity.
1,They are great! Base is a bit heavy. Use an equalizer.
1,silicon ear hook is not flexible but instead its bendable ( not holding good )
1,decent battery life. lasts me around 5h single charge. I dont think its waterproof but i have taken it to the shower a couple of times and they still work. Sounds is not the best but for the price is really good.<br /><br />Comes with a case and extra buds.
0,Stopped working after 3 weeks. The 2nd pair after 2 weeks.
1,"These are a great value for  Bluetooth Headphones. They are light, easy to use. Complete integration with my Android based Samsung phone. I did have a minor issue with sound fidelity at first, but I remembered my phone has funky (and high quality) audio settings. So if you buy these and the sound quality is poor initially dig into your phones audio settings and try the multiple ear buds that come with this product until you find the best match for you. I was on the verge of returning these until I fixed the audio output setting on my phone and switched to the foam ear buds. NOW, You can't get these off my head except to charge.Could not be happier with the comfort level and sound quality for the money."
1,"I use these every day, pretty comfortable."
1,Good Bluetooth
1,"The headphones sound great, they fit comfortably, they're easy to pair, the controls and microphone work like a charm, and they're definitely water proof. I got caught in a downpour at work that literally killed my phone, yet these headphones took it like a champ. But, with that said, they have a tendency to completely freeze my phone up when using the built in music controls. It happens at least once a day; the only way to fix it is to either remove the battery or hold the phone's power button down for 10+ seconds to reboot. And I'm not just talking about one phone, it's even doing it on my replacement phone, which is a whole different brand. So there's that. Otherwise they're great."
0,Good product for the price and fit the need I had. Unfortunately they stopped charging after 30 days.
1,Arrived beautifully packaged in a tiny carrying case complete with accessories.  Quality is really good.<br />Great value.  Sound is as good as other Bluetooth ear buds that cost hundreds of dollars.
1,"I've bought several of these over the last year. It seems that each one lasts at least a few months before issues arise, but that's nothing new for earphones, at least in my experience. The sound quality is great, and it fits comfortably in my ear. The package comes with different-sized earbuds, so anyone concerned by that should rest assured; it is possible to change them out for comfort. The battery life is about 10-12  hours on average which is nice. The range is around 8 feet if the right earbud(where the signal is received) is pointing to whatever the Bluetooth is connected to such as your pc, phone, etc. If not, the signal will cut out fairly quickly which can get annoying. Another thing that may not annoy you, but it certainly did me, is the part that loops around your ears. It gets old fast, and the earbuds stay in your ears regardless of the loops being there or not so I always decide to cut them off. As far as I'm aware it does not damage them in any way, and I certainly have never seen a reduction in listening quality because of it."
1,"I have bought about 8 pairs of different t one this brand make all good, but I have baught them for others 3 for myself I work in an industrial  setting and these last about 8 months there, cant get better for the price."
1,"I received them and they are working okay so far.  it's only been a short while and so i'm hopign they don't short out on one side or anything but the fit and everything is great, sound is good as well.  As with other reviews, it's not noise cancelling.  Great for slow walking but they suck when I ride my bike because all I hear is wind in my ears."
1,"Love these headphones! I always have problems with the wireless headphones not making it through my workout - 4 hours on Sun. Finally don't have to worry about changing headphones during a workout. Sound is good, functions super easy 😊"
1,Great value for my first Bluetooth earphones. O
1,This headphones are great. Was expecting less for the price. They have great sound and are comfortable to wear. I enjoy these headphones.
1,I enjoy that the headphones last a little more than 8 hours and how there easy to use :)
1,I am so impressed with my new Senso ear buds!!!!<br />They make Physical Therapy enjoyable.
1,"Great quality, very loud so it cancels out the background noise! Worth every penny! My beats broke after only a few months so I’m already pleased with the price and quality!"
1,sounds good for the price. comfort is good for the price and have been using on trips and at the gym
1,"Great for music, sound is amazing. but not for calls. When I turn my head sometimes while listening to music it stop playing. There great for their price."
0,"Didn't use them much, maybe once a week for an hour or two and after a couple months they won't turn on. For 30 dollars I expected the build quality to be better than that. I have other Bluetooth headphones that are still going strong after 4 years. Don't recommend these."
0,"The sound is as good as normal earbuds, and they don't hold much of a charge, but overall they worked okay for about a month of intermittent use, with only occasional stuttering when first connecting, at the edge of Bluetooth range, or when the batteries were low.<br /><br />Now, though, they stutter about every fifteen seconds. Batteries fully charged, phone two feet away with no obstructions, but they're absolutely useless, unless you're nostalgic for the &#34;badly scratched CD&#34; music listening experience.<br /><br />Wish I could return them."
1,"I love these headphones.  Great for listening to music or podcasts while you are working out, or cleaning the house!!"
1,"This review is for the ActivBuds S-250. I like these earbuds very much. They have a long playing time and have a pleasing sound quality. I use them with Comply foam tips which greatly improve the comfort and sound. Comply tips come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and sound isolation and are a positive addition to any buds. One improvement I would  like to see would be cloth braided connecting cable between the two buds. The rubber cable sticks to the back of my neck sometimes and it will dislodge the buds from one or both ears. I usually wear them with the cable in front of my neck and flip it to the back if I am going to take them out. I like these earbuds because the controls are easy to use and are ergonomically designed. The charge plug is easy to put in and the buds hold a charge for a long time. The playing time is quite good and is at least equal to the time claimed by the vendor. All in all a comfortable set of buds with sweet sound. (I also have a set of the S-255 buds and am not happy with the flimsy ear hooks. Fortunately, the Comply foam tips keep them in my ears as the hooks are quite useless.) I have several pair of these buds because I have a number of Bluetooth sources and the buds, like most Bluetooth devices will only pair to two at a time. Bluetooth 5, which will be released any day now, is claimed to allow several devices to pair."
1,"The Bluetooth is very quick at connecting with my iPhone, ipads, and the sound is very good and clear both at listening music and talk on the phone.  It's no difference than listening with the apple wired earpods.  I can't compare with the apple Bluetooth earphones because I don't have one and no plan to spend big buck for one.  I'd rather save the money for the real Bluetooth headphones like Bose or Bowers & Wilkins, etc. if I am really into music.<br />Also, this earphones does fit in the ears good and stable."
0,These are just ok. I have a pair of powerbeats3 and the fidelity on the SENSO are sub-par in comparison.  The bass and high treble are muffled.  Bottom line is theybare a cheap option and you only get what you pay for.  Easy to use and set up.  Quality is fair. Recommend for young adults or college grads on a budget and are not looking for high fidelity or quality.
1,"I like the sound quality, the bass can only be improved by proper ear canal fitting.<br />The over the ear hooks are comfortable and functional. I am not a fan of rubber ear tips,<br />sweat from exercising can pop them out of place,  I prefer the foam. It comes with a set.<br />Blue tooth seems to work OK, Can't comment on battery life yet. The workmanship is good be careful there is<br />a weak point between the speaker and the body of the electronics. Handle with care."
1,"These headphones work perfect for the price. I've owned expensive wireless headphones in the past, and all of them broke within 3 months of constant use. I use them strictly for working out and they stay comfortably in my ears throughout the entire duration. I am able to sweat in them without worrying about them giving out."
1,These are gre great headsets- they paired easily and have high quality sound. The are lightweight and stay in place during even vigorous activity. Great value for a modest price!!
1,These are wonderful for the price! Highly recommend!
1,"Only 4 stars... Although I am satisfied with these Headphones, I am NOT happy with the battery life!<br />on a full charge the battery life seems to average 6 hours. I work some long days and it's a little irritating when I get the battery low warning.<br />On the other hand... they're great for working out, Walking or running. especially if you are a heavy sweater!<br />One other thing... my old Headphones would read my text messages, these do not have that feature."
1,I purchased them for my wife who has issues with headphones and she is 100% happy with them.
1,These earphones are a good buy.
1,"I'm no audiophile, but I think these earbuds sound great!  Great price for the sound quality and all that comes with your order - good stuff!  One thing though (maybe it's me), and that is I can't seem to pair it with my Win10 pc; earbuds are not recognized at all in bluetooth settings for my laptop.  No problem with iPhone."
0,"Sound quality is crystal clear when headphones are near the phone. However as soon as i put my phone in my pocket it becomes staticy and will randomly disconnect, which defeats the main purpose of Bluetooth headsets."
1,"I was very impressed and actually blown away by the sound. These are awesome, far better than Beats!"
1,"HOLY SSHHHH<br /><br />My Bose headphones broke after only a year and 10 days. (10 days out of the warranty...go figure right.) I'm on a budget right now so I decided to get these. They are way louder than the Bose and really are noise canceling, they like suction in my little ear holes hahaha<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend these, the bass is awesome. I'm a hip hop head so it's perfect for me. Spring for the warranty, it's only a little extra and gives you some peace of mind."
1,"These headphones are survivors, got in a laundry machine for 30 min by mistake, after a couple of hours they started to work again almost as new."
1,I just got my Senso  Bluetooth headphones and I love them they stay in your ear great and they sound fantastic and are very comfortable and light .  Already recommended them to three other friends .
1,"I really like these earbuds. Connection with my phone and tablet has been seamless, unlike some other Bluetooth devices I’ve used. They sound good, and have plenty of volume available, and they are relatively comfortable and don’t fall out of my ears.<br />  I had hoped that I could get a little more bass volume, as I play bass and usually listen to music with the objective of learning the bass line. To be fair, I have not heard many in ear type phones less than $100 that are able to produce strong and undistorted bass.<br />Overall I am very happy with this product."
1,I enjoy running and needed a pair of headphones that would stay in/on while running around. I really like this set! I can change the ear bud to fit looser or tighter in my ear. It is flexible around the ear so I can make sure if the bud pops out the whole piece stays on my ear. The buttons are easy to use and the quality of the sound is great. No issues since I purchased a month ago.
1,"Great sound, ordered a second pair right away. Amazing Customer Service at Invotek. Quick response to request. Highly recommend."
1,"First, I paid full price for these, and I always expect more than I usually get.  With a 4.5 star average after thousands of reviews I expected these to be pretty fantastic.  For once a product EXCEEDED my expectations!<br />  Very good price for the quality of these great sounding sport buds.  At the gym I had been using wired buds and it was just kind of a hassle, but they sounded great (1 Mores Triple Drivers).  Figured with the Bluetooth buds sound would greatly suffer.  These Senso buds are pretty darn good.  Great bass, more than the triple drivers, and overall surprisingly enjoyable sound.  For working out I prefer these.  Comfort level is great, controls easy to operate, and they look good!<br />  Very satisfied with this purchase and highly recommend👍"
1,"I really love these headphones! They are the 1st pair of wireless headphones I've ever owned and I must say, these are great!! The sound quality is excellent & the bass is present without taking away from the vocals, which says a lot for me because I really prefer a lot of bass when I listen to music! They are a nice comfortable fit and I haven't had any issues with them falling out! I would also like to add that the customer service from this company is AMAZING!  I've received a few emails from the company, one prior to receiving the headphones and one or two after I received the headphones.  They were very much on top of things, nice & efficient. Answering questions without them being asked, they attached a guide for the product, & also covered all info needed about the 1 year warranty that comes with this product, they gave me steps to take if I had any issues with the product, and they were overall very impressive about making me feel appreciated as a customer!! 5 stars all around for this purchase!"
0,The headphones feel great and sit nicely in the ear however the sound will cut out way too much!  If my phone is on my left arm while I run it is unbearable.  It will only work if it is on my right arm and even at that it will still cut out at times.  Never did that when I used my old Motorola sd11-hd headphones.  Not sure why the receiver is that weak but it is.  Would not recommend for anyone that wants to use these for an active lifestyle.
1,Works great! Came in excellent condition and all the pieces.
1,They arrived days early. They are easy to pair. Comfortable and very easy to wear.
0,The connection is intermittent and stopped working after a few months. The battery holds for 4-5hrs on a good day. The sound quality is fair.
1,"very good sound quality, lightweight, easy to sync<br />they do get a bit uncomfortable on long runs, which is why I cant give them a 5star raiting, but I would purchase again."
1,"I'm giving this as a christmas gift. So, I will have that person give a rating!"
1,"Customer service is a 5, product is a 4. Would give 4.5 stars if I could. Had a pair that fit REALLY well (the over ear hooks had wire inside), but the bluetooth went out after a month. Senso sent another pair right  away, and the Bluetooth is MUCH better, although the hooks are more plasticy than the first pair. Having said that, the fit is really solid. It sometimes takes a few extra seconds for the headphones to REALLY connect (despite what the computer voice tells you) and once in a while I have to turn them off then on again to get them to connect to my iPhone. But overall these are a great bargin."
1,I got these earphone for gym. They have amazing ng sound quality and are indeed noise cancelling. They are light weight and trendy. Excellent value for money.
1,These headphones last an entire work shift within a noisy factory. With memory foam (or any ear filling) tips make these an investment worth having for outdoors or indoor activities.
0,"First time using them, the sound kept cutting in and out. The phone was strapped on my arm, no more than a foot away."
1,It was about time I went wireless.  These headphones fit the bill perfectly.  Easy to set up and pair with my device.  Easy to use.
1,"These ear buds came quickly. They came with a nice little carrying case, extra ear tips, wire ties, car charger adapter, short charging cable (micro USB) that fits the ear buds but then an extra USB 3 Foot charging cable but this cable does not fit the ear buds so I questioned why it was included. I can use it for other things so no big deal. The ear buds themselves are comfortable in my ears and they didn't not fall out once even while I ran on elliptical and then did weight training as well. The sound quality is decent and I only have to turn the volume up half way and I don't hear any of the people around me. So far I'm very happy with these buds and would purchase them again."
1,"These headphones have amazing sound quality, very clear, and ok bass. The battery will ussually last me about 2.5- 3 hours on a full charge."
1,I used these for workouts and I loved them!
1,Fits in my ears very good and has great sound. Also easy to advance songs and answer phone calls. Used at work today and I was very happy
1,I believe they work as good as the beats...
1,My first experience with wireless headphones. Bought headphones with an exercise armband: hate the armband but really like the headphones. Easy to use and the sound is pretty good.
1,"I have had these headphones a couple days but they are GREAT. They charged quickly, paired easily with my phone, and fit well in my tiny ears (with the included small earbuds). I took them for a run and really loved the sound and the ease of use. I had them on the lowest volume and could hear outside noise too for safety. I hope they last a while because these are exactly what I have been looking for at a reasonable price."
1,Somewhat tinny sound
1,"Not the greatest sound, but okay only. Not a lot of lows or highs. The biggest problem is the people have a hard time hearing me. I can't use this for phone call."
1,"Bought these as a replacement for some Phaiser Bluetooth headphones that I found to hurt my ears due to their hard plastic. So far, I'm VERY pleased. The sound quality is excellent (as far as Bluetooth headphones go) and the soft, bendable rubber earpieces are very comfortable. I have small ears so I gave up on in-ear buds. Had at least three pairs, and all would come out during runs...or just walks for that matter. These survived the run test in terms of staying in. However, I wore them yesterday while bike riding with wind gusts of about 7-9 mph and I could definitely hear the wind. However, I'm not finicky about noise-cancelation. From a safety perspective, I actually WANT to be able to hear a leaf crinkle to know if someone is approaching close behind me. With that being said, I could still hear my music and if needed, I could push the earbud down deeper into my ear and/or raise the volume. The battery lasts as advertised and the neck strap is a good length to fit comfortably behind my head or hanging down in front.<br /><br />I wish I could give 4.5 stars, but my only wish is that the earpiece hooks (if that's what they're called)--the part that wraps around ear--was adjustable. While they do stay on while running, they actually do come off a bit more easily than I'd like when doing ordinary activities due to my long, thick hair or having a scarf brush up against them (during winter), etc."
1,"Happy with my purchase. They are easy to use, the traveling case is compact and the sound is great."
1,Selected these as replacement for BEATS. At the start I was apprehensive as they seemed to cut out at short distances but seemed to work it self out within a few days.  Worked perfect for 3 months.  Then they died. So why 5 stars? Service! They emailed me quickly tried to help with factory reset to make sure it wasn't firmware related etc. That didn't work and they shipped a new pair.  They stand behind the product. I do wish the ear wrap was more firm but other than that solid all around.
1,"I love these headphones!! The sound quality is great, and the headphones are incredibly comfortable to wear."
1,The sound quality is very good
0,"Don't stay in, not comfortable, not at all noise cancelling. Wish we could return."
1,"Pluses: Amazing sound!  Stay put while I run - they don't bounce out. Great customer service - the car charger I received was broken so they sent me another one for free.  Cons: I wish they were a little lower profile - didn't stick out from my head as much.  The extra power cord is cool, but I don't really have a use for it."
1,I love it but unfortunately I lost it...
0,The person on the other lines couldn't hear me very well.
1,"The look good and feel good in my ears. The sound quality is pretty good as well. They came fully charged right out of the box. They paired easily to my iPhone, I love the foam ear tips that came with it. Plus it came with a car vent phone holder and a adhesive credit card holder.<br />Update: I’ve noticed that I didn’t receive the car charger and cord. I’ve emailed the company and within seconds I had a real person email me back about the problem and they are sending it out ASAP. Amazing customer service, 5+ starts !"
1,"I chose these based on the price and rating. I have used them often, they are easy to adjust the volume, clarity is great."
1,"Great, stay in place on a run and heavy sweating does not phase them. Only observed drawback is the volume buttons are too close. As a runner in Florida (I know sweat) I highly recommend."
1,The earbuds work fine. Sound quality is decent for the price. Advertised as noise canceling but haven't used them in a noisy environment yet. They do well as earbuds for working out. I bought these as a temporary solution. For the price Iwould say go for it.
1,These earphones are wonderful. I bought them for the gym and they stay in my ears and sound great! I really like that I can see what the battery charge is on my phone when I connect them. It comes with a great case to hold them so they don't get damaged in my purse or gym bag. I would highly recommend these to those who need an inexpensive option.
1,Great head phones for the price
1,These headphones are a great buy. The sounds is crisp and clear. And I can leave my phone in my locker while I am working out at the gym.
1,"Sound was great and the packaging and accesories were really cool, but the ear hooks were too big for my small ears. Literally hung way over my ears loosely. Uncomfortable fit and didn't trust they would stay on. Returned them."
1,This is my second pair of Senso Headphones. The purchase was made because my daughter liberated the original ones from me. Really like these earbuds (maybe a  little more than the first par). The earhooks have been modified and they can now be molded around your ear for a much more secure fit when out on those runs. I never once had to readjust them because they were falling out. Hard to pass up for $23.
1,"I own a pair of Bose QuietComfort 20i noise-cancelling earbuds but I was looking for a pair of wireless bluetooth earbuds for working out, doing lawnwork, etc.,  so I took a chance on these based on the reviews. These are simply outstanding for the price (sound quality, eat of use, comfort, etc). Much much better than anticipated. I will be ordering another pair for my wife."
1,"They have worked fantastic over the past couple of months, no random shutdowns or disconnects, battery life is really good for the price.<br />Worth recommending for the price!"
1,easy to use and sound great.
1,Received these headphones on my birthday. Not really a headphones type person but the standard ones that came with my phone sucked or ones I have bought have store eventually fail. I mainly use them when working outdoor around the house doing chores mowing etc. I was constantly pulling one earbud out of my ear by moving around while mowing and on riding mower. Now I dont have to pull one out of my ear to talk to someone can just pause them and they are of course wireless so I dont have to pull phone out of pocket constantly. Great noise cancellation. Not looking to use the waterproof feature anytime soon lol. Comes with so many accesories. I was floored. Great gift or awesome purchase.
1,"I wear these in the gym and they are one of the best purchases I have ever made. I am college student and can walk all over campus with these and take my backpack on and off, take jackets off, do simple tasks such as bend over without having to worry about my headphone cord tangling. Especially helpful in the gym as the drown out all sound, are beyond louder than apple pods, and actually stay in my ear. Fit better in my left ear than my right for some reason. The goodie bag included was a pleasant surprise as I received the coolest 2-in-1 charger cable (both lightning [apple] and microusb [android and the headphones].<br />Bluetooth headphones are a must purchase and well worth the investment.<br />These just so happen to be the best I have tried and the best price I have seen for the quality.<br />5 stars"
1,Headphones work great. High quality at a low costs.
1,"After buying several bluetooth headphones I am so glad to have finally found a set that truly have great bass and sound incredible. Especially for the price. Not to mention the bonus accessories (USB charger, dual USB cable, carry case and spare bud ear plugs)"
1,Everytime I have bought these headphones a family member asks to borrow them and end up loving them so I let them keep em & I buy a new pair for myself. These headphones are GREAT!!!!! My entire household has a pair now.
0,"I really wanted to like these headphones but they have a major design flaw. After charging them up in accordance with the instructions, I used them for my daily walks. While in the midst of a walk, I got the &#34;battery low&#34; warning for the first time. FIVE MINUTES later, the headphones turned themselves off and could not be turned on again. I spent the rest of my walk in silence.<br /><br />I couldn't believe that headphones advertised for working out would have such a short window between the first battery warning and completely shutting down, so when I got home I charged them up and tried again (keeping a spare set of wired headphones with me, just in case). When I got the first &#34;battery low&#34; warning, I started a timer. Sure enough, almost exactly five minutes later, the headphones shut off.<br /><br />The designers clearly were not thinking when they made these. That would be annoying in any Bluetooth headphones, but especially if you're marketing them to people who will not be near a power source while using them. On top of that, the booklet that came with them is full of warnings about the dangers of charging them too much, so it wouldn't be practical to plug them in after every use just to avoid the stupid things shutting off in the middle of a workout."
1,These are s gift for my son but I have the same headphones for over a year and they’re great!
1,"I bought these for running and cycling. They worked great and endured 5 months of heavy use (i.e. sweat) without showing any signs of damage. I felt pretty confident in their durability, and since they're rated IPX7 waterproof, meaning they should withstand submersion in up to 1 meter of water for up to 30 minutes, I didn't think there would be any issue with me using them while I swam laps. I was wrong. I swam one lap with these in my ears, and they malfunctioned almost immediately. I couldn't get them to turn on after that, which was disappointing.<br /><br />Fortunately, the seller stands by the 1 year warranty. I contacted customer support and they were very kind and helpful and agreed to send me a replacement. They also told me that even though the headphones are IPX7 rated, they don't recommend using them while swimming or submerging them in water. Doesn't really make sense to me how these are certified as waterproof but can't be put in water, but I'm glad I learned that lesson before my warranty ran out."
1,Live these. Listened more than an hour every day for a week before had to recharge.
0,Meh. They take forever to charge and then the battery doesn't last an hour before it starts beeping loudly in my ear and needs another hour of charging. Impossible for long jogs or listening to podcasts around the home.
1,"The SENSO Bluetooth Headphones are a good value. There is no doubt about that. But there are definitely some pro's and con's that made me rethink this purchase. When I was looking for headphones, my number one concern was if it would stay firmly in my ear without having to readjust. Second, was the quality of sound. Third, was the Bluetooth connection With the SENSO Bluetooth headphones, this is what I found to be the case...<br />The PROs: Quality sound, good button functionality, and surprisingly comfortable.<br />The CONS: (the major one) when you start to sweat the silicone ear hook does not keep tight to your ear resulting in slippage and bouncing, Bluetooth disconnects from my iPhone after about a minute (so if you pause your music for any reason expect that you will have to reach for your phone to sync the two devices up again).<br /><br />I am still not sure I am going to keep them. I have to take off the headphones to wipe the silicone ear hooks off about 4-6 times over an hour workout."
1,These are great! They fit perfectly and don't come out while I'm running. I've never dropped a connection with my Apple Watch while exercising and the volume is great.
1,"Way cheaper than Beats Wireless Headphones - but with the same quality of sound! It even connects faster to my iphone bluetooth verses other wireless headphones.  I wish it was a tighter fit around the ears, but overall, this is a good value for the quality of sound and ease of use. Totally recommend."
1,"great sounds good base though i wish they could have a lower volume setting, tend to be a little loud for me even at the lowest setting before they cut off.  but these things are fantastic for commuting, trains, buses, ect.  though the mic does not account for background noise, this makes for loud background on phone calls."
1,"I purchased these headphones close to a year ago.  They worked fine but just a few weeks ago one of the headsets lost sound.  I was going to give up on the item and throw them away when I remembered about the 1 year warranty.  I figured it was a long shot and there would be resistance to honoring it but was pleasantly surprised by the Senso response to the claim.  I went to their site and filled out the information on the item.  I shortly got an email on how to do a hard reset to see if it would bring the sound back to the ear piece.  It did not, so I responded back to them the following day, as encouraged if it did not work.  They advised a new pair would be shipped out.  My claim started on Wed and I had a new pair by Saturday.  Best service I seen to date on a warranty issue from any company.  I would not hesitate to purchasing another pair."
1,The bass is a bit much but still useful if you run
1,Work as expected.
1,great headphones comes with lots extras for the money
1,"These are fine headphones, that pair easily, fit comfortably, and sound a lot better than their price point implies. As a headset, I come through loud and clear on the other end of the line. Can't ask for more than that."
0,"Its not that the buds don’t look good, they do. It’s not that they don’t sound good, they do. It’s the fact it takes forever for these things to connect and work ever time I turn them on! I’m done! Going back to beats!"
1,works for general listening.
0,"These earbuds would not turn off at all, and they would interfere with everything else that would bluetooth to my phone, especially my car. Sound was sub par, not worth it."
0,"These are garbage. There is a reason the price is set a discount. I don't do reviews, but this was that disappointing."
1,Great product. The seller delivered according to the agreed term.
1,"I had these headphones for almost a year and thought they were pretty good. Unfortunately, a couple months ago the right side earbud separated from the control piece where the buttons are located and now it just hangs there by the electrical wires. This somehow happened through normal use. I didn't drop them or mistreat them in any way. Hoping that SENSO will see this update and offer to send me a new pair."
1,They were easy to set up with bluetooth and the sound is fantastic and they are comfortable to wear. Very happy with this purchase.
1,"Just totally awesome, and exactly what I was looking for in a set of wireless headphones.  Any OMG are they loud, good base response. I have to turn the volume on my phone to halfway for comfortable listening."
1,Stays in place during workouts and while running.
1,"I've had these for about a week and they do the job great. Good value for the money. There have been a couple random instances where the sound will cut out or digitalize, but it corrected itself after a few seconds. They come with a unique charging cord that has a changeable head do you can charge the headphones and then your iPhone. Unfortunately the lightning charger part doesn't work on mine. Kind of a bummer, but not a huge deal. I do find that they hurt my ears after about 30 minutes, because of the pressure even though I'm using the smallest buds. Overall I think they work great and I'm happy with them."
1,These headphones are amazing.  They have better sound quality than the beats by Dre. do and are very comfortable.  I have used them mostly on the treadmill and do not fall out.  They do get a bit loose when I am hitting the heavy bag or the cardio bag but are great for the speed bag.  Overall all 5 stars.
0,"With the phone in my back pocket and playing an audiobook the headphones have intermittent bluetooth connections (i.e. words continually missing from the transmission.) I should have returned them immediately, but I tried to work the problem through SENSO. My mistake."
1,Sound is great. Piece that goes around the ear needs to be smaller
0,"I purchased one set of these in April , 2017, and it no longer accepted a charge within -3- weeks. I did get a refund, and purchased another one, in May, 2017, assuming that the first was a fluke. In 3-4 weeks, the newer headphones literally fell apart. I contacted Invotek and after a dozen emails (they would not supply me with a customer service #) they advised me that they were sending me yet a third set of these headphones. I wrote them numerous times that I did not expect the third pair to work any better than the first two. Different customer service people wrote me back, stating that the new one was on the way. I will return it as soon as I get it. Thank goodness Amazon Prime interceded and gave me a refund. Stay away from this item, You get what you pay for."
1,"Good connectivity to my iPhone and I use it to listen to songs, audiobooks and podcasts while in the gym. The earpieces fit very well and can keep out most of the noise around me. The flexible earbands work very well."
1,"So far so good, wind blowing when I am running is a little annoying but hope to adjust them so that it is not as bad."
1,"Audio volume doesn’t go very low, so you’re going to have medium volume at the lowest setting.  Also, people tell me, when I’m using it as a microphone/headset with phone calls that they can’t hear me very well.  Think I’ll have to buy another Plantronics."
1,Like them more than my Beats2
1,"Because I'm contractor in carpentry it allows me to listen with cords getting way while working. Also it great for keeping my phone safe while working, can leave 25ft plus away ."
1,"Fantastic and at a great price. I'm an audiophile, to the ludacris and extreme point. Very rich and warm sound even from mp3 format or music streaming platforms. Can't wait to try them with vinyl. Not the absolute best out there but at this price they are top notch. And, the battery life is phenomenal."
1,"The sound is great and the battery life is great, but the only thing that is the most annoying thing about these earbuds is when it reaches 30%, every 5 minutes it has a loud voice that says battery low. Not sure if this can be turned off but it is a stupid feature. It also means the earbuds are about to turn off when it reaches 30%. Seems that it miscalculates the battery time."
1,"Ordered these in April 2017 and had been very happy with them.  Sound quality was good, comfortable to wear and held a charge for a long time.  Liked them so much that when a lightning deal popped up for the newer version I grabbed it so I'd have a pair for workouts and one for travel.  This week after boarding a flight put on the pair that I bought in April 2017 and they wouldn't connect to my phone.  I assumed that I must have forgotten to power them down last time I used them, but rather than the red LED that indicates a low charge I saw that it was blinking alternately blue and red.  I tried removing the device and pairing them again but they wouldn't connect.  Like I said, they were great but I'm disappointed they only lasted a bit over one year."
0,I've had at least 6 pairs of noise cancelling ear buds over the past 7 years --- these have virtually NO noise cancelling.  If you pound them into your ear they may block some noise but they DO NOT cancel.
1,Perfect headphones for working out!
1,Great set of buds for a workout. Sound quality is great for the price point.
0,"Sound quality wasn't very good after listening to the Beats Solo 3 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones. I returned these Headphones immediately. If you don't care about crisp clear sound (bass, treble, mids), then I would recommend this phone. The ability to answer phone calls (the phone call is clear) and pair with an iPhone is simple and quite easy."
1,These headphones are pretty good the battery life is pretty strong and the sound quality is good for its price. I had these since January 3rd of 2018. The only problem as of May 23rd 2018 the Bluetooth stopped working it doesn't connect consistently and also it's randomly turning off on its own and it doesn't even tell you that it's off. It's just after a while you start talking to somebody and out of nowhere it's disconnected because it turned off. But for its price it's not bad.
0,Didn't even last 4 months until they stopped working.
1,"Headphones work great, even came with both a home and car charger. All for a great price<br /><br />An update on these. I use these about 4 times a week at the gym and they were working great until one day when I couldn't get them to turn on or charge. I contacted customer service and they were very helpful. They sent me a list of things to try, including how to reset the headphones. Unfortunately none of those things worked and my headphones still wouldn't turn on. Senso apologized and had a new pair in the mail the next day. I was pleased with their customer service."
1,Sound good but don’t stay on well
1,I wish I could give 10 stars. I just love them but I wish there was a wireless set
1,"These are really very good for the money.  I wear them in the gym and on the trail. They stay in, sweat and motion doesn't bother them. The instructions say not to charge them over night, but I do almost constantly and they still work. They're easy to turn on and off and they pair instantly with my Apple Watch 4. Its also easy answer phone calls."
1,Great for the price
0,I was at first pleased however there is this SUPER annoying static noise on the left ear piece. It won't let me concentrate on what I am listening to. I returned them and got a new pair but the static noise is still there! Its mostly annoying when the volume isnt that high. I'm debating returning. Also the pairing is pretty annoying.
1,"Packaging:<br /><br />The earbuds came in a very nice box which displays the earbuds in the front and its features on the back<br /><br />Unboxing:<br /><br />Upon opening the packaging, you are greeted with:<br /><br />1.) 1 Pair of Senso Earbuds<br /><br />2.) 1 Carry Case<br /><br />3.) 1 Dual Port Charger<br /><br />4.) 1 Short Charging Cable<br /><br />5.) 1 3 Foot Charging With Interchangeable ends (Micro USB & Lightning Port)<br /><br />6.) 3 Replacement Earbud Tips<br /><br />7.) 1 Wire Tie<br /><br />The Product:<br /><br />So, it seems like a lot of these wireless earbuds are manufactured the same and given a different brand name, however out of the three brands I've gotten, this specific brand was my favorite. Unlike the Blayz, these do not have an annoying buzzing noise in between songs, they also come with 2 charging cables and a bigger carrying case than the others, which is really nice since the small charging cable usually keeps me from closing the the other cases.<br /><br />The sound for all of these headphones is pretty bass heavy, and so until you get used to it (takes like 3-5 minutes to do so) the sound sounds a bit muffled. The noise  cancelling on these earbuds are alright, they'll muffle out someone trying to talk to you in a normal voice, but if there's a lot of background noise you'll definitely hear it. I did receive these for free for my review, however my thoughts and opinions on the quality of these earbuds are genuine. They're very comfortable to wear while exercising, I personally wear them everywhere, and they're my go to earbuds when I go biking."
1,"How this little headphone can pack such a powerful sound!!  This one also has the noice-canceling capability!!  Portable, small, powerful sound!!"
0,After reading reviews they are pretty much spot on. They bad boys just stop working after a couple months.
1,I paid about $23 for the red button ones I've used for about a week now I give them 3 stars which means they are okay these are the first wireless earphones I use so I can't compare them to any other I like they are light have decent sound and stay connected most of the time. What I would don't like is the battery life they only last about two hours fully charged and that they have a blue light that blinks every five seconds when they are connected haven't used for running yet but I'm sure that it would not be a problem since there a hook that wraps around you ear.
1,Sound is great... my only issue with this item is that it keep on falling when I’m running
1,"This was a very tough choice for me being that so many of the ear bud designs look familiar. I had originally bought the Otium buds and was very pleased although reading through the reviews I discovered that many of them were dying out just shortly after a month. After a few days of contemplation I decided to return them in fear of losing out in a short period of time. I then came across Senso and a couple of other brands, ultimately deciding to try out the Sensos. After only a couple days I am pleased to have a pair. They seem well built (for the price range) and I have no worries about them breaking down anytime soon. I would recommend them to anybody who wants a quality headset at an affordable price. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK AT SENSO!"
1,Very comfortable and clear music! Love how it was packaged and all the things that come with it!
1,Great product and easy to use at a great price point
1,The headphones arrived in good time. It was for my 16year old son and he absolutely loves it. He says it sits well in his ears ( unlike the initial ones I ordered from another site that kept falling off). The sound quality is excellent. I am vey pleased with thia purchase. Thank you.
1,"If you are going to wear these inside only, then they will be ok. But if you ever want to wear these outside, prepare to not be able to hear. The wind noise on the headphones is ridiculous. If it is windy outside and I wear these, I can not even hear what I am trying to listen to.<br />In regards to connection, they sometimes will say connected, but not actually be connected. This is quite annoying.<br />Battery life is good. The fit is good too, once you find the right piece to fit your ear."
0,"Sound Quality: Fair. Worse than Apple's earbuds that came with phone.<br />Comfort: Good, can run with these without falling out of ears. They are light.<br />Battery Life: Good<br />Quality: Poor. Failed just after the 1 yr warranty period. Fully charged, but will no longer connect to anything, makes odd beeping sound.<br />Value: Fair. for $30 I'm ok with not-perfect sound, but should last more than 1-yr."
1,"Great sound and bass, does not fall out of my ears."
1,I recommend
1,I never thought I would be that person using Bluetooth headphones at the gym but these are absolute gems. you can skip tracks right on the volume buttons and take calls. the mic sucks but if you're looking for a decent option to pair up for workouts this is a good bet. they last for a solid 4-5 days when I use them just for my runs.
1,"Overall good product, but its super annoying that it keeps repeatedly  saying “low battery” after 30% and interrupting the music... Also the loud beep when increasing the volume is a little extra too"
1,"The price is right, and I liked the headphones so much, I actually ordered a pair for my dad for Father's day, and he loves them too! I'm planning on purchasing a pair for each of my family members this year."
1,"Super easy to connect to iPhone, sound great and fit in a variety of ear sizes!"
0,"Absolute garbage. Mediocre sound quality will be the least of your worries, this POS fell apart within 2 weeks.<br />The side with the power button just fell off! Poof. Gone. Garbage."
1,Works greT ear buds fit good
0,This Bluetooth is not a good as described. The sound is horrible that people could not hear me if left phone in livingroom and went to kitchen or any other room without phone. You have to have phone close to you all time for better qualify sound. The port for charging was broken and not able to charge after one use. Returned to seller.
1,I enjoy the headphones sound is good and easy to sync.  For the money it is a good choice.
1,"So far so good. Only have had the earbuds for less than a week but so far they work great. No issues with pairing. Earphones paired without a hitch. I am having a problem keeping the earbuds in my ears, but this has always been a problem for me as I have very narrow ear canals. I'm using the smallest pods but they still won't stay in my ears. Obviously when the earbuds are not firmly seated in the ear canal there will always be a considerable loss of bass response. In order for me to offer a fair review as to sound quality I would have to give them a listen with a known audio source while holding the buds firmly in my ear canal. In all honesty however I did not purchase these buds for critical listening, but hopefully no one would purchase earbuds for critical listening anyway, I have several pair of modified Fostex T-20 headsets that I use when I want to hear music with a full sound. I basically purchased these earbuds for wearability with reasonably good sound. These buds delivered on both of those counts."
1,A+
1,"Easy to pair, and they sound great"
1,"If I had written a review at any point between their arrival and 7/15 I would have given them 4 stars (great battery, great sound, doesnt come out fo the ear, poor mic - based on feedback during calls and if you turn your head sideways and the phone is in the pocket, you lose connection). However on 7/15 they just quit and died for no reason at all, they showed a full charge on the phone, everything was working normally and out of nowhere they switched off (no warning or anything) figured maybe the battery died. Put it on charge, never got the charging light. Left it for a couple of hours and tried to turn it back on, it did not.<br /><br />Edit: After working with Customer Service, which was really quick and easy, they sent out a new headset. So far things are great again, so I have changed my rating from a 1 star to 4.<br /><br />Edit: After having these headphones for nearly a year, they quit working i.e. they no longer charge. The pair I currently have 10% remaining and I dont expected to here sound again after they die since I cant charge them :(. Took 1 star off cause this shouldnt have happened?"
1,Had a good charge right out of the box. Used it during one of my heavier workouts with no issues
0,They do not work
1,"Absolutely love these headphones long lasting and perfect for the gym, They came with multiple earbuds and they are very comfortable."
1,The sound is OK with that price. Easy to control volume.
1,The are perfect with good quality sound
0,"the sound quality is very good. the fitting is ok. battery life is also good. however, they keep pausing my music every ten seconds, and decided to stop working altogether."
1,"Fantastic headphones. Beautifully packaged, great sound, well-made and designed. A great buy. Highly recommended."
0,"Well, I DID love these but after using them maybe only 5 times, the charging cable isn't working and they won't even turn on. :-(  I've tried a different cable and no luck. Now the return window has expired with Amazon so I just might be out $50. Such a bummer!"
0,"I am prime user and it is already delivered late by 2 days, and now it is not working, FRUSTRATED..."
0,Dont work dont order they wont send u a fraud item
0,I got these for running. They do not stay in my ear and the black part that goes behind the ear never stays contoured to my ear and therefore it is serving no other purpose other than making it more difficult for the ear bud to stay in my ear. I'm constantly pushing it back in when running.<br /><br />I shouldn't of messed around with another cheap pair of headphones and just shelled out for a Bose pair. Those are the only headphones I've ever owned that stayed in when running but unfortunately they caught on something in my gym bag and the part that kept them in my way got ripped off.
0,I bought these several months ago and was going to return but now I lost them. I really didn’t like these at all. Sound was tinny which I could have handled. But they don’t stay in my ears. I think if you’re just walking maybe they would as long as nothing pulls on them. Jogging on treadmill - the heavy side that has the volume thing will pull the other side out of your ear. And when you start to sweat same thing. Then I tried to use them mowing the lawn. Nope. Falling out. Waste of money for me but maybe it’s my ear shape. :-)
1,"These are high quality headphones. I researched several and based on reviews and asking someone at my gym wearing them I made the purchase. Very easy setup, different sizes buds for your ears, and great sound. I'm very pleased!"
1,"These are GREAT!!  I love these, especially for the price. The sound quality is GREAT, the controls responsive, people hear me very well on my phone and work computer as well as them being so convenient.  I also like the carrying case, the quick charge and long battery life.  Additionally, the curved earpiece fits nicely in ear and stays seated even with vigorous activity.  Can't go wrong with this purchase."
1,"Very comfortable (can easily wear for hours), stays in place when running, battery lasts well, easy to Bluetooth connect to all of my devices, and the case for these headphones is also very convenient for storing and traveling. I absolutely would buy again!"
1,"What a awesome pair of headphones! My wife bought Beats by Dre. They stopped working after a year and it cost us another $100 to get them fixed. I was not going to make the same mistake, so after reading all the review on the Senso headphones I decided to buy these. I can't tell the difference between the the two product. There is one difference, $270 after repair. They are comfortable and sound great. Don't waste your money on the big name, these are awesome!"
0,sound was mediocre and earbud hurt my ears.
1,I have an earlier version of this same product and the volume is much greater and for someone who is hard of hearing it make a poor quality of a ear buds.
0,Stopped working after 6 times
0,I only gave them one star so I could post a review.  I am not happy with these headphones at all.  The sound is very tinny and they cut out the entire time I wore them.  I would not recommend purchasing these headphones.
1,I've only used these headphones for a couple days but am really happy with them.  They were really easy to set up via bluetooth with my iPhone 7+.  The battery life has been great.  Used them on and off yesterday at work and didn't get a low battery chirp.  I actually had them on standby quite a bit because I got busy and forgot to turn them off.  It seemed to not use much battery at all on standby.  Nice quick charge.  Great sound.  Also a big fan of the power button doubling as a pause/play button.  I would highly recommend these!
1,I love these! The best wireless headphones I have ever purchased.
0,not great problem syncing and the sound is not very good do not recommend
1,Comfortable and good quality. I didn't think the over the ear piece would be so soft and flexible. Very nice
1,"Good sound and value. Comes with car charger, which was great"
0,Terrible sound
1,So far it works great.
1,"Great headphones.  We decided to try these out when they were on sale for Prime day. Wireless, noise cancelling, sweat proof and easy to use. So far, (it's been a week), they have exceeded our expectations. The volume button is a bit awkward to use and takes some time to get used to kits location and function. Everything else makes These headphones worth the money."
1,I bought these as a bday gift for my boyfriend. He loves them and uses them daily. Great quality for the price.
0,"Product did not stay in ears during anything but sitting still. I tried all the ear bud sizes and nothing helped. The sound was good quality, but the design was terrible. I would not recommend these to anyone."
1,The BEST Bluetooth Headphones on Amazon ...got them for Christmas and love the bonus items that came with them. Holds a charge very long time and stays in ear with amazing sound.
1,Works great!
1,"I purchased this earphone one year ago, and now I am having a problem,  the left side the sound on an off while using it, not very happy with the quality only last for a year!"
1,"These are extremely comfortable compared to others I have tried.  The sound quality is excellent. Could use a little more bass, but I solved the problem with The Bass Boost App. on my android phone.<br />Suggestion: Put an order form in the box so 2 years from now when the ear pads need replacing we can do that easily."
1,I bought these for my son and he says these are great! really happy!
1,"I bought these for my husband for Christmas and he absolutely loves them! The sound is great, the bass is great and he loves that he can move freely on the basketball court and in the gym with them while he’s training!"
1,"These are some very awesome earbuds. I've worn them to the gym and when running multiple times and have never had any problems whatsoever. They have a perfect fit and are completely secure with the loops which you don't even notice after wearing for a few minutes. Bluetooth works flawlessly and the battery life is great. You also get a bunch of accessories like a car charger, carrying case, two charging cables (one for apple products I think) with different earbud fits. These would make a great gift for anyone you know that is an active runner or gym goer."
1,So far so good!!! Excellent quality and value for the price!!
0,After 4 months of use the battery no longer holds a charge. I used it about 3 times a week when I would go running. Avoid buying this.
0,Left speaker on this item stopped working after 6 months of use. When I tilt my head slightly to the side it cuts out. I have asked for a replacement because it has 1 year warranty. Once I get the product I will update this review. The charge does not stay for 8 hours. At best 3 to 4 hours of continuous play. So its falsely misrepresented in the description
1,Great product
1,it is an excellent product. high quality and an excellete  sound.<br />congratulation!!!!
1,"I ordered 2 pair in the past and my kids inherited them. Being they work great for them, I ordered 2 pair for my wife and me."
1,"They were very hard to turn off and on, but overall okay"
1,paired with my iPhone and AppleTV quickly and easily.  The sound great!
1,"The sound quality is excellent , i used so many Bluetooth headphone but these headphone sound quality is much better than other in these price."
1,Light and comfortable<br />Have only had for couple days but like them a lot<br />Also received inquiry from owner of company checking to be sure all is ok<br />Usually a good omen that it is a great company
1,"The first unit was defective and transmitted excessive wind noise.  However, customer service was exceptional and promptly shipped out a replacement after a reset did not resolve the issue.  Though I can't speak for reliability, this seems like a very good set of headphones for an exceptional price."
0,"So to begin, I come from Jaybird X2's that i unfortunately lost while running (battery died so i put them in my not deep pocket...expensive mistake). So, I had just recently bought these for my GF, which instead I used. At first, I was very impressed by the sound quality, fitment and comfort-ability within the ear and to remain in place, and overall performance. Now after actually using them regularly for maybe a few weeks I've noticed the battery life is very weak and they need to basically be charged daily. Also, now while during runs (not related to low battery) the headset is randomly disconnecting from Bluetooth and my iPhone while on treadmill. Overall, decent pair of earbuds for $30, but the quality I don't believe is there since now that I am actually using them they fail. My suggestion is if you actually run regularly multiple times a week to go and spend some coin on a trusted brand that has proven quality."
1,Reason for only 3 stars...gift for husband and he's only been using 1-1/2 days. Let's give it a bit more time before asking for feedback.
1,Awesome headphones!!
1,"They worked well out of the box ,was easy to connect to my I phone ,well packaged ,nice charging cords I will see how they hold up to the moisture /sweating while exercising ,other brands I have tried in the past doesn't handle the moisture/sweating while exercising."
1,This product is better than I expected its a good buy.
1,Very good headphones for the price. My headphones arrived with the rubber ear tips ripped which is the only reason I would not give it a full 5 star rating.
1,I love them!! I replaced some beats active wear with these and OMG! the sound quality is so much better than the beats. The bass is excellent. Super loud and sweat resistant! The battery lasts long too!
0,"I've had some issues with this headset, and I'm not sure why it has the good reviews it does. Maybe mine is just defective.<br />Audio quality: Average. The sound out of these aren't bad, but they are similar to the $15 headphones I buy off Amazon.<br /><br />Connectivity: Poor. I have a Moto XPure and I have been having issues connecting these and getting the audio to play from them recently. They'll say they're powered on and connected out of the headphones but audio will still play out of the phone speakers. Also, if the phone is in the back pocket there will be a lot of disturbance and loss of audio.<br /><br />Feel: The headset and case actually feel really good (except the part that goes over the ear). Materials are solid, and I am happy with the build quality (at least aesthetically). The hoop that goes over the ear is annoying and doesn't fit my ears at all. I am 5'9&#34; with &#34;normal&#34; sized ears (?) and they're way way too big. Makes going to the gym annoying.<br /><br />Overall, not worth it IMO, I have owned better bluetooth headphones in my day (Mpow Jaws V4.1 [[ASIN:B015IEW1AY Mpow Jaws V4.1 Bluetooth Headphones Wireless Neckband Headset Stereo Noise Cancelling Earbuds w/ Mic]]) for about the same price $30ish so there are other options out there. If I just got a &#34;dud&#34; then I'm sorry to waste your time with this review, but I thought it would be good to put this out there."
1,"I love, love, love them. I've owned many Bluetooth ear buds. Everything from cheap Wal-Mart brands to beats by Dre and, these by far, are my favorite. They fit well, have great sound and an awesome battery life. I'm a runner so all of the above are important to me."
1,"Great sound , super light and really cheap!"
1,"I was looking for a pair of headphones that met very specific criteria:<br />1) Wireless<br />2) Comfortable<br />3) Sweat-proof<br />4) Good sound quality<br />5) No &quot;excessive&quot; noise cancellation.  (If I'm working out or running outside, for safety reason I DO want to be able to hear things around me when necessary - cars on the road, etc)<br /><br />These headphones fit the bill PERFECTLY.  Their fit and comfort level are fantastic.  Some earbuds have that collapsible &quot;foam&quot; that you squeeze, insert into your ears, and then allow to expand inside your ear canals.  Those work okay, and they do block out some ambient noise, but after a while they can leave your ear canals feeling a little sore.  These earphones do NOT do that!  They include three different sizes of earpieces so you can try them all and see what fits your ear best.  In my case, it was the largest pair.  What a difference that makes!  Honestly, they are so lightweight that I didn't think I was wearing them correctly at first, until I turned on some music.  Very impressive.  Oh, and don't mistake &quot;lightweight&quot; for &quot;cheaply made&quot; because these do not feel cheap at all.<br /><br />Regarding the &quot;noise cancellation&quot;: These headphones are listed as having CVC 6.0 noise cancellation which filters out ambient sound.  This helps in two ways: First, it means you hear more of your music and less of the noise around you.  Second, if you are using these to make a phone call, the person you are speaking with will hear more of your voice and less noise from your environment.  In all honesty, if serious active noise cancellation is one of your top criteria, there are headphones out there that do a better job of that.  But again, total noise cancellation is probably not why you are considering this pair.<br /><br />Some great bonuses:<br />1) The headphones come with a nice protective case.  This is essential because if you were to toss the headphones into your gym bag or something, they would inevitably become damaged or tangled up with other things in the bag.<br />2) Also included is a small charging cord, about 12 inches long, that fits easily into the case with the headphones.  It can be used to charge them from any USB port.<br />3) ALSO included is a car charger with _2_ USB ports, so you can charge these headphones and your phone (or whatever else!) at the same time.  Score!<br /><br />I figured I would eventually find a good pair of headphones that met the above criteria; I did NOT think I would find them at this price.  The sound quality is fantastic as well, especially at this price.  After all I'm using them for working out, not studio recordings.  I couldn't be happier.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you are looking for headphones with noise cancellation or reference-quality sound, these may not be for you.  But if you want a very comfortable pair of sweat-proof headphones with VERY GOOD sound quality at a killer price, do not pass these up."
1,Best earbuds I have had thus far. Exactly as they were described and came in a great travel kit. Very happy with the sound as well as the fit. i have small ears and usually earbuds bother me or do not stay put. These fit perfectly and are light weight and comfortable.
1,"Gave them to wife for her workouts at the gym,  loves them!!!"
1,"Great sound quality, good battery life and overall a fine head phone"
0,"The sound quality was really good for the price, but the fit with any of the ear bud's just isn't quite right for me."
1,"These are a phenomenal set of headphones! The sound quality is very good for rhe price. As soon as I got the chance to try them out, I asked my husband to give them a listen. Within 2 minutes he responded, “where’s my pair?” And he has high standards. The carrying case and charging cables are wonderful additions. Extra sets of earbuds are fantastic too so. I emailed the company for directions on changing them because I didn’t want to risk damage. The customer rep got back to me in under an hour. Impressive. This is the first lengthy review I have taken time to write. This company has clearly earned the huge number of positive ratings. I am impressed indeed. And yes, I did order a second pair for hubby. They delivered in 2 days. Well done Senso!"
1,"These headphones sound great for ear buds. they have great bass and highs. If you want an eclectic sound system for your ears while you work out, you  may look elsewhere. The dollar spent value for return is very very good. To get that high end sound, you'll need to spend a few hundred dollars for the same performance it was designed to do while you are working out. Highly recommended."
0,These are horrible. They pair just fine with my moms iPhone but the issue is they do not stay on the ear. When she starts sweating during her run they start to slip off and even when she hasn’t started her workout no matter how much we have tried to squeeze them or push them back they do not stay on the car. The buds that go in the ear (or whatever you call it) are also not that comfortable for long use and the sound quality isn’t that great. I’d skip these and look for something better. It’s dissapointing because I got her these for Christmas and she can’t enjoy them.
0,My ears hurt after used couple hours.
1,They fit really well and stay in and the sound quality seems really good! Great product for the price!
1,Got these last week and first day with them I hated them. Sound was poor but I put loved the way they stayed on my ears. I was getting ready to return them and decided to try putting on one of the other size buds that comes included and voila! I loved these now and the sound is much better . Great for the gym and running. Mic works well with phone . Great value!
1,Like them
1,"the quality of the sound is incredible, love it"
0,The Bluetooth started to break up as soon as I took my phone out of my pocket. They didn’t fit well no matter which tips I used and the ear hooks were way too big. I returned them after the first use.
1,Great product☆!
1,"I've had these for a month now and they are definitely worth the money.  Fit is good and the hooks keep them on my ears where other buds fall out.  The sound is very good, also.  I'd buy another set without a second thought"
1,They are great when the bluetooth connection doesn't want to fizzle out.
0,"The title says it all. Way too much stuttering. The only way you can achieve an uninterrupted connection is by placing my iPhone right next to my head. I've trouble shooted in various ways (ie. resetting, recharging, making certain that I'm streaming on ""low"" quality since it isn't ultimately a data issue), but to no avail. I guess you do get what you pay for."
1,"Only used for a week so far, but battery life and sound quality have been great"
1,"I like the fact that they are wireless.  They are convenient, easy to use, and fit on my head well.  I like the blue tooth feature.  They are well made, and a good value for the price."
1,Bought these for my 2 teenage sons and so far they love them.  Fast Shipping and great price on Amazon Prime Day
0,This is the third one that I have purchased and the other two worked great but just wore out from use.  However the one I just received never would take a charge no matter what I did.  The over the ear clips also are much looser than the other two.
1,Gift
1,"Senso support was excellent. After about 6 months of using the earbuds, I had trouble with the battery draining and the red light remaining on even when the device was turned off. They responded immediately and politely to my email. They asked me to do a reset. It didn't work. They immediately confirmed my purchase and sent me a new set of earbuds."
1,"I have bad hearing in one ear so all the reviews that said the sound quality was excellent didn't really phase me. I do like good bass and the fact that it is waterproof, so I bought them. As soon as I listened to music on these, I was blown away by the quality of the sound. I was really impressed by the fullness and richness of the music. I found them very comfortable once I switched out the earbuds to the foam orange ones. Time will tell on how they perform with sweat and activity, but I feel sure I will still love them. I like the positioning of the control buttons. The only thing I worry about is wearing them in bed and inadvertently powering them off. Oh well, we'll see. Highly recommend!!"
1,sound quality is ok for this price
1,they rock!
1,Received headphones and have used once during workout.  The sound and controls work well.  Only thing that could be improved is to stiffen the over the ear part some.  I have been searching for a descent inexpensive bluetooth headphone set and I thing that I have found them.  I would recommend these to others looking for an inexpensive set of headphones.
1,"Awesome MP3 headphones.  Connected right to my phone quickly, I use them for running and working out, plus they have a very good mic for phone calls.  Sometimes I use just to talk to peeps hands free.  Quality of sound is excellent as well.  Additionally they ship with a small case to keep them in which I really like too.  Excellent product SENSO."
1,I can recommend it to anyone.  It is great.
0,"The on/off button on these got stuck after 1.5 months. The microphone was not the best (I got complaints from people on the other end of the line) and it takes a while to get used to how to put them on over your ears. I looked at a ton of waterproof headphone reviews before choosing these, and it's two weeks passed the amazon return window, so I'm pretty disappointed."
1,"I just received these headphones and they seem like they are great headphones for the price.  I will update my review once I use them for running, which is why I bought them."
1,"Arrived on time and the headphones are awesome, sound is great and they hold a charge for a long time.  Would recommend these to my friends."
1,"Great headphones, great price! I use them while running and have no issues with them coming out or constantly needing adjusted. Glad I bought them."
1,Fits well and feels comfortable!
1,The ear piece fits well and can be adjusted to ear size. Very comfortable when walking  and listening to music or audiobooks.
0,They are broken. The connect button broke.  I would not purchase them again.
1,"Sound quality is great! Bluetooth is a must these days. I wanted a pair of bluetooth headphones to work out with and run with that didn't fall off or out of my ears. My ears can't hold earbuds by themselves. Anytime I lean back on a flat bench, they'd fall out. These stay in and the sound quality is excellent. Especially for the price!"
0,They suck.  Constantly skipping and losing signal.  Junk.
1,"Bought these on Amazon for like $33.00 and they far exceeded my expectations. I was looking for something to workout in and had Bluetooth compatibility to sync with my samsung gar 2 and these came up on my search. I'm typically a bose guy but for what I was needing I felt I could give these a shot. Well first the packaging was outstanding and all the accessories were outstanding. The headset themselves are made of a soft ruber and fit nicely in my ears. They don't fall out and seal nicely. The bass is outstanding and I would be hard pressed to find a better sounding set. Now I haven't had them very long so I can't say anything about the durability or the battery life on a charge. But what I can tell you if you want a decent set of earbuds that won't break the bank and sound absolutely amazing buy these. Again, you will not be disappointed in these little guys."
1,"I bought these, well this, for work. They work but they don't fit me. The parts that go over the ear are so lose they fall off my ears. No way I could do exercising with these. The range was pretty good, I could go between 30 and 40 feet before losing signal. Sound wasn't awful but I really haven't used them enough to give a good review of the sounds they produce. The case and cord it came with are pretty good imo."
1,These work perfect. Also there are different sized ear tips which is a plus.
1,Awesome head phones. Works good and I am able to roam free at work and not get tangled.
1,"Very good battery life, comes with necessary wires as well as replacement for the ear pieces, pairs up to your phone easily, very easy to use because of concise instructions. Some cons that I have include that they hurt my left ear, this could be just me but after wearing them long the left side became very uncomfortable, also the sound quality isnt the greatest ever, it lacks bass for the most part so some songs may sound different than they would when they're played through regular speakers. Overall they are a decent product, id recommend buying if you want some cheap wireless earbuds with long battery life."
0,"The left earbud is losing volume after fewer than 20 uses. No longer stereo.  They were great when new, very good sound, but it didn't last."
1,They stay put and sound good - thanks!
1,Amazing headphones...especially for the price!!  I'm more than satisfied with this purchase and will recommend these to others.
1,Recently bought the SENSO headphones and I love them.  Have used them a few times for running and blocks out the traffic noise.<br /><br />Update... my headphones stopped working 3 months after purchasing.  Had to email thw company and they responded within 2 hours on a Sunday.  Tried to reset my headphones but did not work.  Company sent out new headphones the next day to me.  Wonderful customer service!
1,Sound is good and earphones stay in place. I bought them to take on my runs. They come with lots of extras for the price! Customer service is very quick to answer if you have a question and they email to make sure you’re happy with the purchase.
1,very easy to pair with phone. sound is clear . bass could be a tad more. very comfortable. great customer service. liked these so much bought a pair for my girlfriend.
1,"After a few days of use, I am very happy with this product.  They fit well, sound good, and are comfortable using for hours at a time.  I highly recommend this product!"
0,"All that was deliverd was the headphones inside the carrying case. No magnetic car vent mount, no phone wallet, no charger, no extra earbuds, no manufacturer's box with instructions on how to use the headphones."
1,"Very good sound and easy to use, good service"
0,"The sound is great, I got these for my water workouts, and love that I am able to listen to my music, while I'm swimming laps or running in the pool. They are great on the treadmill, eliptical, and bike as well. They don't move. Only downfall is that I wish they came in purple! Great sound. :) Edited 11/13/2018 - I reached out to the manufacturer as somehow one of my silicone ear pieces fell off, and I need a replacement. They told me they would send me out a free one, and then a rep after refused stating it has been too long since I made my purchase. Edited - 1/15/2020 - Headphones don't turn on, not able to reset, looked for answers nothing to help!"
0,The left ear continuously buzzed no matter what I did. I called for support and after getting help I was recommended to return the product. So I returned it and was rewarded a full refund. I do want to note the quality of the sound in the right was pretty nice.
0,"It came today, DOA! It won't charge or connect to any power source. Very disappointed!"
1,Fantastic! I bought three pairs of them for my family. Great quality.
1,"Great sound, great price, great value!"
1,"I feel bad giving this only 3 stars. But it's literally that...okay. Most of the time it works well. The sound is great. I love that they give you 4 different sizes of earbuds; the memory foam ones are perfect for helping these hold on while I run the treadmill. There isn't a wire-hitting-your-neck noise while you run as long as the volume is up high enough. And the volume does get loud! The bass quality is surprisingly good.<br />So now lets review what makes it okay:<br />I was bummed the ear holders weren't adjustable. I am a petite woman with tiny ears. It takes a bit of finagling and the memory foam earbuds to help keep them in place as I run.<br />The battery has slowly gotten worse as time has went on. Not only that, the little case that comes with them to keep them in sometimes turns them on without you knowing, and the battery is near dead the next time you use them again.<br />Lord help you if you're more than 20 feet away from your phone. Even weirder, if there's a *person* between you and your phone, it'll start cutting out. Hopefully the person is just walking by and not stopping to stretch.<br />There's no &#34;low battery&#34; warning. It just stops working."
1,Delivered on time and I the sound is amazing!!
1,"Very much impressed with the quality, just loving it !!!"
1,"I'm very impressed by the sound quality of these headphones, especially for the price. The bass response was very surprising. Not sure how long they will play on a charge. I've worn them for a couple hours at a time and then just recharge them so I'm sure they won't run down on me the next time I use them."
1,"Bottom line, they are entry level headphones but they get the job done.  I bought them to connect to my new Apple Watch b/c I hate running with my phone but didn't want to spend $150 on headphones.  The sound quality is everything you could ever need on a run.  The noise cancellation is above average.  I also sweat like a pig but still had no issues with them staying in my ear.<br /><br />About 8 months into owning them and using them several times per week for runs one of the earbuds cut out and wouldn't turn back on.  I suspect the sweat finally got to them, but I don't know.  Much to my surprise Senso's customer service was actually spectacular.  I sent them an email through their website, they responded in minutes, and b/c my earphones were within the 12-month warranty they sent me a new pair free of charge.<br /><br />Bottom line- if you're worried about durability with a cheap product you should be.  But they have the warranty, so you can't lose with these headphones."
1,This was a present for my son who's a long distance runner and he loves them. He stated that they fit perfect and don't fallout and the audio sounds great.
1,I think the fit and sound is great. I actually owned a pair of beats last year and think these are better. They are lighter and were easier to connect to iPhone.
1,"Only 1 thing. The wire tie is too cumbersome to attach, probably because the neck wire is short."
1,"Great Headphones! Just received them. Easy to charge, usually 2 hours tops. Very simple to use for music or phone. Syncing with iPhone a breeze. Multi-size ear buds makes finding the correct fit easy. Sound quality is a must and these sound real good. I had to tweak the equalizer in my phone to get the right sound, no special app needed. I've used them in the gym weightlifting, cross-trainer/elliptical machine. They don't move much so don't have to keep adjusting for fit. Jogging shouldn't be a problem either.<br /> I would definitely recommend or purchase again!"
1,perfect!
1,I love these buds. Normally buds hert my ear's but these don't. The sound is great with some good base. Setup was very easy. I would buy again.
1,"For the price these can not be beat. They sound great and fit good. Well worth the money. This set was for the gym, I might buy a second pair for the shop."
1,So far so good. Bret sound
1,"I was looking for something of good quality but also cheap, around 50-75$ range. I came across these from filtering top rated and I trusted my fellow amazon shoppers and I must say I was not disappointed. Great sound and super comfortable. Wear these to run and lift and I must say if you are reading this to see if they are worth it Im gonna say it right now, Get them!"
1,"Nice set and comfortable.  I am wearing them under my motorcycle helmet so didn't know if it would work out or not.  They are not as comfortable as ear buds but I wanted something Bluetooth and better sound quality.  I got both and like I said, they're pretty darn comfortable for what they are!"
0,Very Disappointed. I used the product 4 times and not it will not recharge. The unit now keeps saying battery low over and over again. It is an excellent product while it was working.
0,"Well I went with these because of the amount of reviews everyone gave it.  I have to say after reading the specs these headsets are either the earlier model or a defect.  1)  Sound quality is inconsistent.  There were times where the sound was great then there were times the sound was distant, like below CD quality (same song, same playing device).  2)  I bought these headsets for the main reason to have an all in one device to listen to music and be able to talk on the phone.  There were numerous of phone calls taken on this device and everyone told me they hear an echo of their own voice.  This happened on every call taken.  On my end I can hear the caller just fine but the echoing on the other end caused me to stop using these for calls.  Bummer because the specs on the device states these were made to take phone calls with zero interference or noise from the surrounding area.  3)  You can not tell when powering up the device is low or high on battery, but when the battery is low, my god, the device will not stop letting you know the battery is low.  That part is very annoying.  Good things about the device.  Function buttons are in good spots.  They are light weight.  When the sound is performing at it's best, they have a very nice sound to it.  Good highs and good bass.  Again, if you are looking for an all-in-one device where you can listen to music and take phone calls, this device will not be the one!"
0,"I’ve had these for 5 months and they broke out of nowhere! They won’t connect to anything. Also, the little charger port doesn’t stay closed, so there’s constantly a little flap open."
0,Worked good for a week then the battery started to not last and now it won’t even connect to my phone.
0,"very poor connectivity outside (likely due to bluetooth interference from other apartments).  tried with fully charged earbuds. returning these, and i bought the bose soundsport wireless instead.  0 connectivity issues with the bose earbuds."
1,I love these and I'm impressed with the 1 year warranty
1,This product is totally great for my workout. At first the sound quality was bad because it wasn't charged fully. So I gave it another shot and it work perfectly. Also tested the sweat proof on it and its great without any irritation or headphones falling off. Highly recommend for this kind of price.
1,"Have worked great. Linked to my Galaxy s7 and 2015 Toyota Prius. I'm happy with the charge life. Not sure if I should be able to use them outside the bathroom, but that's the only time there is major interferrence."
0,"Headphones stopped working after 3 weeks. They won't turn off, or connect. Do not buy!!!!!!!"
0,Buy it and only work month and a half
0,"The music was subpar, seemed to sound like I was listening under water. I used them while riding my bike and all I could hear was the sound of wind buffeting on the headphones and ears."
1,I have run on the treadmill and outside with the headphones. I've also lifted weights at the gym and they have been perfect. I really wanted the apple buds but for the price of these I will look no further. THey do the job. I do have to adjust them at times they can turn a little and shift out of my ear. I haven't figured out how to change the ear size piece which would probably help me.
1,I'm very happy with these headphones so far.  They're easy to use and the sound quality is good.
1,Keep up the good work. The base is not too high but overall loved it
1,Excellent price and sounds great!
1,Awesome sound quality. Perfect for what I needed.
1,"Nice fit for my ears, easy to set up."
1,Great packaging. Great extras. Easy to use and great sound. I'm very happy with this purchase.
1,"The battery lasted well past the 3.5 hour flight time. The sound quality was all I expected for the price. They are a little larger than I expected, but they were comfortable enough when I changed to the correct size ear pads which were included."
1,Thank you!
1,One of the best wireless headphones I've had. It fits perfectly. The sound quality is clear with bass. Battery life is great too. Great customer service from the company.  I received a total of 3 emails to make sure that I was satisfied with their product. They even sent a owners manual and offered help if I had any questions or concerns. Customer service is a big deal for me so I definitely appreciate the great service.
1,"This is the second pair of these headphones I've purchased. I've been using a set at the gym for 6+ months and liked them so much, I bought a set for work. The sound quality is really good (and this comes from someone who has a $300 set of Bose noise canceling headphones I travel with) and I can charge them and easily get 5-6 workouts out of that single charge. I definitely recommend them."
1,Amazing headphones for the price. Exactly what I was looking for. I'm probably going to buy a second pair. My only feedback is that the headphones come with a car adaptor? I think a wall adaptor would be more useful to charge the headphones.
1,I really like these. They work perfectly for my needs. I will be buying some for my son as well.
1,They are what I expected and will continue buying them if I need more of them.
1,I gave these as a gift and my son is very pleased with it and the quality of your product
1,So far I am very happy with them.Only have had them for a couple of days.
1,"These headphones are great and they turly are noise canceling. They are perfect for folks that workout wether it’s cardio or leg day these stay in place! The great part is, the part that wraps around your ear to hold them in place is adjustable!!!! Overall great product and my boyfriend also just purchased a pair!😉🤪 Definitely worth the hard earned coins!!"
1,"They stay on/in my ears, sound is good."
1,"Easy to use, comfortable and work great."
1,Hello my name is Rita I would love to test your product I am a reviewer
1,"This is my 7th pair of bluetooth headsets,  give or take.  These are definitely of better quality and have been working great thus far. Im very excited to see how they hold up over time!"
1,Excellent. Love them. They stay in place and sound is great.
1,"Not bad, not great. Fit my needs for listening to podcasts, though. Easy set up, good charge. I personally don’t find them comfortable, but that’s just my opinion and I have small ears, probably fine if it weren’t for that."
1,"Great earphones, quality of sound with top brands, i think i’ll get a second pair soon!<br />Update 5-11-18 I got my second pair and i felt compelled to write these few lines about the overwhelmed great customer service I received from all the technicians at Tekatron, it is amazing the speed in which these professionals mobilize themselves, they got a customer for life great job in the most beautiful way, thank you."
0,This headphones work for about 2 weeks and then it's cutting in and out. Can't hear anybody talks anymore and can't listen to the music either. Very disappointing
1,As a recording engimeer i wanted a great pair of earbuds while i work out. These are it. Awesome bass and they sound very clear. After using them once i could never go back!
1,Loved them thill they started cutting out. Had it happen to two pairs
1,Comfortable and good sound. I an satisfied with the S-250 Active Buds. Great service from Invotek and Amazon
1,Quality headphones from the wearing comfort to the sound. I bought one set for me and one for a friend and we are both very pleased with the purchase.
1,"I was dubious about ordering these however they are great earbuds. Great sound, great and comfortable fit, and connect up to my phone better then any other blue tooth ear buds I've owned. This is about my 3rd or 4th set. I especially like the flexible ear wraps and can wear these for hours without discomfort. A big issue with my many other pairs. The case, charger, auto charger, and USB cords are great too."
1,"Comparable to the Beats by Dr Dre. Amazing sound and quality. Customer service is outstanding. The one year warranty is awesome because I sweat more than most I think (ha!), and it seems to always mess with any headphones I buy. I had an issue and they replaced them pronto no questions asked."
1,These shipped very quickly and work fantastic!!! Great buy!
1,"They last 10 to 11 months. The right bud quit working and/or fall apart both times.<br />1st time I thought I might’ve been unlucky or accidentally roughed the right bud. I liked the sound quality so bought it again.<br />2nd time, same failure mode around same point in the life time.<br />I’m changing brands."
1,worked as advertised. stay on really well. comfortable and easy to pair.
1,"They work well and are comfortable but the volume control could be better. There seems to be a big jump between no volume and low volume, I can't get it as low as I would like, it's a bit louder than I want, one push on the volume rocker and no sound at all. Otherwise, nice product."
1,"The product works great until it stopped working less than a year later. I am not sure what happened and suspect the inside mechanical structures broke. Overall, it works well and stays on your ears when you run and gym!"
0,"I got these as a gift for christmas and they worked alright for a month. I use them at the gym and sweat quite a bit but they say sweat proof so that shouldn't matter. Whether it was the sweat or not they have stopped working completely a little over a month in and won't charge at all. Also to activate the warranty you have to have the amazon ordering info, which I don't have because they were a christmas gift so now I'm just out a pair of headphones. They're great in theory but I will be sticking with wired headphones from now on. Hard pass on these."
1,Good product
0,The connectivity of these is terrible. I bought these with high hopes but they are a waste of money. I returned the first pair hoping that I just got a bad set but the second pair I got had the same problem. I went through all of their troubleshooting ideas but nothing worked. These are basically wireless headphones that cut out as soon as you start moving.
1,"Going on 7 months I use them 2-4 times a week at the gym, better than more expensive brands IMO"
0,The headphones will not charge and have stopped working after 2 months.
1,I had these before and they were great. they got crushed accidentally. I bought again to find that the part that goes over your ear is now rubber with a metal wire in it. I constantly have to reshape it and 30 days into me using them this rubber and wire combo is failing. The last set had a very nice flexible plastic piece that retained its shape well.  The sound is great but the over the ear part IMO is terrible.
1,"These are pretty good headphones but only if you are 3 feet away from your source or phone. Seriously you can’t set your phone down at a park and workout 10 feet away, it fully cuts out.  They do stay in your ears which is nice, and the battery life is acceptable I’m just super disappointed with the range."
1,"I have small ears. When I run, my music becomes distorted because the buds do not stay in my ears."
1,"Holy Guacomole!! Let me find out I paid $30 for some Beats. I set the bar really low because of the price. Not only were these easy to pair, but the sound quality is fantastic; and not from a lower price perspective. They truly sound like the several pairs of wireless Beats I owned. The range is also great. I was able to listen to my music with my phone in my living room and me in my bedroom about 10 - 12 ft away. So far the battery life is true to description as I have yet to recharge them and I've been using them at least an hour a day for the past week.<br /><br />I plan on getting several more pairs just in case the shelf life on these things are short. Either way, it was well worth the money spent."
1,perfect gift for Dad
1,"It's too early to rate this product, but so far, I like it. Give it 3 to 6 months and I'll give you a realistic assessment."
1,Good Product
1,Love the product. Thank you.
1,Work great!
1,I love these they work well and stay in your ears well even when sweaty. The buds are made of material similar to earplugs that you roll up and they expand after you put them in your ear
1,Sound as good and operate more easily than another brand (that I bought first) that cost twice the price.
1,The customer service is great if you run into any problems later. The product comes with a 1 year warranty
1,This is the third pair headphones I have ordered. A pair for me and two as a gift. For the price the quality is very good. They fit and stay on my ears. I highly recommend them if you are looking for wireless headphones.
1,"&#34;This is the second time I purchased these headphones. I paid $19.00 and would certainly buy them again ( I have) they are a Very good value. As good, or better, a sound as the earphones that come with an I Phone, but with the convenience of Bluetooth. The battery seems to last several hours between charges, which are fairly fast &#60;1/2 hr., but i haven't really been officially timing them.&#34;"
0,I recieved the product one ear piece not working so I returned it.
1,Battery life is amazing
1,Love these headphones! I have a hard time with headphones staying in my ears while running but these have been great and stay in my ears without a problem!
1,very great product...only thing to improve on is sound quality.
1,"work great! stay in ears, very clear, have used 3x for about 40 minutes each time and haven't had to charge again. Nice!"
0,"This is the third time I have purchased this headphone. I loved them, however the first and second pairs stopped working out of nowhere after about only a year of use. I only use them at the gym and they say that they are waterproof (i.e. sweat resistant), so I don't understand why they have repeatedly stopped working. This is the third time I have ordered them and the connection is very poor with my phone (the music goes in and out constantly). None of the other ones did this. I am unfortunately going to have to send the pair back."
0,Quiero devolverlo
1,Liked them
0,"Hello amazon friends, I bought this 2weeks ago. Working well until this morning. I am glad I am eligible to return it. I don't buy it again. I don't recommend."
1,Great product at a reasonable price!
1,"Works great, connects fast, no problems other than keeping them in my ears, but I have pretty small ears so that's always an issue with earbuds for me."
1,So nice not to have a friggin cord tangelin on stuff<br />Hats off
1,"I have been very satisfied with the earbuds. The only issue I have had is peeling back the plastic strip covering the charging port. I needed a knife to pry it open. I understand it has to be water tight. Nevertheless, I am very satisfied. When walking on windy days there is a lot of ambient noise from the wind. Perhaps this in unavoidable."
1,"Great for running, stayed in place and great sound quality."
1,"I purchased these as I lost my Beats wireless headphones.  I was concerned initially due to the price difference, but was pleasantly surprised when I wore them during my recent half marathon.  Great product, great sound, I did not have to fuss and fight with them to stay in my ears at all, which is a BIG PLUS.  I would definitely recommend these to others in my fitness group."
1,The sound on the head phone's are great but I had a short on mine
1,"Sound quality is pretty good. I think i saw a few people mention about it having really good bass but I didn't notice that, although I just tested them out with a few songs before i re-packaged it (got this as an Xmas present for my wife). Build quality seems nice too. I wouldn't say its top notch but it doesn't have a super cheap feel either. Only thing that i wasn't a big fan of was the packaging. It all comes in one box...the headphones are in its own container inside the box, but everything else (charging cords/adapters and car adapter) was just kind of 'thrown in', which you can hear rattle around when you move it around. This isn't a huge deal since the headphones themselves are in their own container, just thought I'd put it out there!"
1,I read all the reviews to find some cheap headphones for my brother who is a marathon runner. He has used these for short runs so far but said he is very pleased with them!
0,"First the mic stopped working.  Then it stopped holding a charge.  Now completely dead.  Of course my return window JUST closed, so I am stuck with inoperable JUNK.  You get what you pay for, I guess.  But I would have expected more than two months out of this.  JUNK."
1,&#34; This item was a gift to my husband. It looks great and has a nice case. He's loving it. Uses it often when we go for walks.
0,"Sleek and look like they’re built well, but I’ve had them out of the box for 10 min or so now and they won’t stop giving static instead of base and have a lot of sound distortion. Hoping a good charge will help, but doesn’t seem very plausible. Will be returning if I can’t get them in order"
1,Nice case for buds and charger
0,"Hi , I bought the earbuds last month. Yesterday it seemed to disconnect and reconnects within a few seconds, I don't know what is the problem?"
0,I don’t know where all the 5-Star reviews for these headphones are coming from because these are garbage. The Bluetooth receiver is too weak to pick up a signal from my phone in my back pocket! Even after a full charge and resetting the Bluetooth connection they still cut out if the phone gets more than 12” away from the right ear bud (where the receiver is). These are garbage and I returned them immediately.
1,"First sport Bluetooth headset and I'm diggin it! Sound is righteous and so is the fit, and for the price, score!"
1,"They work great, fit great, sound great and look really cool. They came exactly as mentioned and have a cool case as well. No issues at all. I would easily recommend to anyone, as I use them for the gym and walking to class."
1,"I purchased these as a replacement to Jaybird JF3 Freedom BT headphones that recently died. I used these for a few hours yesterday and around the house they would be an awesome alternative to wired headphones... however, once things get active they suffer from a few cons that I feel are design flaws...<br /><br />Pros:<br />Cost - These are fairly inexpensive and an easy way to get a quality set of BT headphones for under 50 bucks.<br />Audio - These destroyed my JF3's in the audio quality department. Decent bass, crisp highs. These are a delight to listen to.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Over ear arms - These are floppy (soft rubber) and, in my opinion, worthless. Sure they will keep your buds from falling off your ear but do nothing to assist in their placement.<br />Fitting - I'm going to try a few combinations of the soft in-ear tips to see if this makes a difference but as soon as I started to run they fell out of my ears. Unlike the JF3 that had the rigid arms and also a small rubber piece that would clip into your ear...these have nothing supporting the weight of the headphone as it bounces in your ear. Once I started to sweat, they were worthless."
0,"Hate these headphones!  Meant for the gym but always, always shut off and can’t reconnect while working out????!!!’"
1,"loved the audio quality. charging took longer than expected and never did see the ""blue"" light which denoted fully charged."
1,great sound. easy sync. comfortable. good mic. good control of apps with on off switch.
1,Sounds wonderful! very clear and very easy to operate! Works well with my Ipod now I can exercise and move around with ease. Great customer service too!
1,"I really like the ease of use of these earbuds. Pairs nicely with my phone.  Makes phone calls a breeze, workouts with favorite music easy. Sound quality is good considering the price.  I would recommend."
1,Pretty good sound quality for the price and they have stayed charged for a good amount of time.
1,Great sound. The ear hook was too big for my girl ears. I just cut it off and put some inner ear hooks on them.  I used a little binder clip to attach the excess wire to the back of my shirt so it won't get in the way.
1,"Great sound quality, battery life seems good. After 2 weeks I'm really happy with these headphones. Dare I say these might be the best headphones Ive ever purchased. At this price point I think you would be hard pressed to find Bluetooth headphones that produce sound this well and be this versatile. So far they have been camping, hiking, mountain biking, used while Im in a boxing work out and around the house. the phone mic seems to work although occasionally I'll get a complaint about sounding like I am far away however it could be based on the bridge cord being in front (good quality) vs the cord going behind my neck and mc placement in those positions. Cool little case to keep everything together and a mutli adapter for mini USB and Apple products.  If you have big ear holes use the red foam bud inserts, They drown out ambient noise and provide a good sound seal."
1,"The sound quality is fantastic.<br />The headphones do NOT stay on during jogging or heavy exercising activities, at least not on my ears. I bought these specifically so I could listen to music at the gym, and found I can only really wear them when walking calmly or sitting still."
0,Updating my review...2 weeks and the ear bud connected to the ear holder snapped off and broke wont work in 1 ear....sad :(  not like old versions
1,"Personally I was not a fan of these, I prefer the bluetooth head phones that stay weighted around your neck but my boyfriend loves these! He takes them jogging, going to the gym, and during school/ work when he's working on a project. Definitely based on preference. They always fell off my neck and annoying if I needed to continually take them out so people could talk to me. Good quality and battery life otherwise. Would recommend to the right people"
1,A very good set of ear pieces that sound great. Great value!!
1,Just got the senso ear buds. Highly impressed.  Better than my jbl Bluetooth buds... and half the price
1,"Great product! I'm a hard runner and was shopping around for new wireless headphones. These stay in my ears, sound great, and were much more affordable than some of the other brands. Also came with a case and multiple charging accessories. I would recommend these to anyone looking for a new pair of wireless headphones."
0,"The buds are comfy, and don't pop out of my ears (like the Apple buds that came with my iPhone) HOWEVER, I'm returning these, because the connectivity is terrible. I bought these for the gym, and walking the dogs, and the wireless goes in and out, sometimes for minutes at a time.<br />Get whatcha pay for, I guess."
1,These are very nice i am happy with them
1,"Great sound, very comfortable!"
0,These were so terrific at first but I had increasing difficulty getting them to pair and stay on.  Finally gave up.  Just too fussy and delicate or something.  Really disappointed.
1,By far the best headphones I've owned!!
1,Love senso. Good sound. Blocks extraneous noise.  Affordable to anyone at the sale price.
1,"I bought these earphones because my ears are really small and the normal shape earphones do not fit. At first I bought just to try them out, but I've had them for almost 3 years now and they are really, really good. The sound is clear, they are light and easily adjustable. I wear it at the gym, to run outdoors, for my meetings... I fully recommend it."
1,Better than I thought they would be
1,Gave my eardrums and Orgasm!
1,The sound is amazing!
1,Awsome wireless earbuds! Amazing sound quality! love it!
1,Headphones are great!  has a long lasting charge and good sound.
1,Bluetooth randomly but not consistently drops out but overall great quality for price
1,I love these ear buds. Very comfortable and the sound is great. I bought one for my daughter too.
1,Sounds ok but can't hardly talk to anyone
0,I can cup my hand over my ear and interrupt the Bluetooth connection. I can't return these fast enough.
1,Just received these earbuds and have used a couple of times at gym...sound is good and the set up to use was simple. I like the case they have to store the earbuds in. Time will tell if they will last. I had a Phaiser brand that wore out 2x after about a year of use. Battery wouldn't charge. Like these as they are smaller and simple to use.
1,I purchased 2 sets as Christmas gifts for my daughter for her long walks and my grandson for the gym!  They love them!
1,"I bought these for the gym... I get 5 or 6 hour-plus work outs out of them before I need a recharge which isn't bad.  Good quality sound and function.  The only thing that annoys me is that when the battery is low, you get a woman's voice uttering &#34;battery low&#34; every minute until your battery dies, which is around 10 minutes later.  It interrupts your music and is very annoying.  One warning is enough... that and the battery life is why I give 4 stars instead of 5."
1,"Is the head plactic is to hard, sometimes my ears heart"
1,They don't fit well in the ear and actually hurt after a while.
1,Love the fit holds a good charge
0,It's not waterproof. It was fine for the first two times I went swimming and then it stopped working.
0,"good sound, good battery life, great for hearing those hard to interpret callers. Worked great for 8 months then died."
1,Very happy. Good value for the money.  I'm a runner and these head phones stay in my ears.
1,Headphones work without any problems. The sound is good. The connection via bluetooth works smoothly. The price of headphones is not excessive
0,"I bought these headphones because of the great reviews.  I was excited to get them and they seemed to be everything I wanted in a pair of Bluetooth headphones.  The sound is pretty great, they stay in my ears well during exercise, and they are comfortable.<br /><br />The biggest issue they have is the connection is unreal spotty.  I put my phone inside my basketball shorts during my workout at the gym and the music breaks up constantly.  I had to pull my phone out of my pocket and hold it close to my chest in order for the connection to be solid.  It's possible that I received a bad pair of headphones, but I am truly surprised that they can't keep a solid connection from 3 feet away.  I do wear a Garmin watch during my workouts and if these headphones can't handle a workout watch while being connected, then I am very disappointed.  (Everything was charged, I don't have issues with my iphone 7 and any other Bluetooth device)"
1,"It was a good deal! Good battery life. High quality sound. Also, it comes in a full package with two other accessories and more! It is really a complete package. I loved it!"
1,"So, never used bluetooth earbuds before.  The sound, especially the bass, is amazing.  They are very comfortable as they are held in place by the ear clip (?) so they you don't need to push the actual earbud into your ear canal.  I am very pleased and would highly recommend them."
1,These are great! Perfect for running. Volume is loud and clear.
1,"Just got these today. I ordered these after reading the reviews and returning a less expensive set that skipped terribly while running. I am very pleased with my purchase, they are simple to use with good sound quality and they did great while I ran today.  I like the rubber piece that goes over the ear. I would highly recommend these."
0,I recently bought a pair of these ear phones and have had nothing but problems connecting with my devices. It will not recognize a device unless I manually input the connection. It was previously connecting to my laptop but now it will not even recognize the laptop. I like the quality of the sound but the overall performance of the headset is very poor. I spent $15 on another set of Bluetooth earbuds that has never experienced these issues.
1,Love these the reduce so much background noise and the call are crystal clear...will be ordering some more because I've lost mines......(sad face)....
0,"Produced received as expected, worked well for two months but will now not power on.  I have tried multiple reset combinations with no success.  When i connect them to a power source, the light turns red and then turns blue after a second or two.  The light stays solid blue.  I disconnect the power source and attempt to power on but nothing happens.  Need to return"
1,"I bought these for my hubby, and he really likes them. He uses them to work out and improve himself."
1,"I give this a 4.5. The bass is solid. Probably the best bass I have heard on bluetooth earbuds. The treble is fairly decent but I could tell the mid is lacking which is where I dock half a star. For the price, these buds are tremendous and I recommend them."
1,Nice
1,Got it as an early Father's day gift and he loved it!
1,"I love these earphones! Supper light, and comfortable. I run with these, and they do not move or slip. The sound quality is great and very clear. It is very easy to use, and you can even pick up phone calls without pulling your phone out."
0,"I've had these headphones for just a month and they are already terrible. They constantly cut out, especially when at a busy gym, and completely distract you from any focus you had. Extremely unhappy with this product."
1,This is our second set of these headphones - My husband got a pair and my son will be getting a pair for Christmas (so my husband will get his back) Very reliable - We usually go through headphones.  These have stood the test.
1,Great for the price
1,Excellent quality! The same as much higher priced items. We bought two and will probably buy another.
1,"good product for the price. One complaint would be the wind noise when riding my bike. Tried the different sizes of earpieces, but all of them did not solve the wind noise."
1,"I really love these. I am not tech savvy and these are very easy to use. They stay put, sound is perfect for my needs. I put in about 35 miles on the treadmill and spinning bike weekly. They are great outdoors too. The battery power is amazing"
1,"I rarely write reviews and I really should since I rely on them. These earbuds are great. The sound quality is really clear. The fit is good. I have small ears and have a hard time with earbuds but these work well. Granted the over the ear hook doesn't offer *that* much assistance. Meaning if I had to rely solely on that, it would not fit. However the buds stay in well. I use them to work out and I do a lot of HIIT, Plyo, running, and weight lifting.  These have been very good. I've used them for 3 training sessions (roughly 1 1/2 hours each) and the battery is still on &#34;very high.&#34;  They pair well with my galaxy s9.  I own 4 pair of earbuds trying to find the right ones. These are it."
1,Have to turn the volume way up to hear the highs. Cutting out after 2 days of use. After speaking with tech support and resetting headphones the sound issue has stopped. But the volume has to be turned up way too loud to get fool range of highs and lows.
0,"[UPDATE] 4-6-2018.  The quality on these are terrible.  I have now had (2) pairs in 24 months and both have failed over time.  They lose their ability to hold a charge and cut out (beep) when connected.  BOO!<br /><br />These headphones are excellent!  I've used them in the rain, I sweat quite a bit and was running and they were excellent.  Very comfortable, audio quality was way better than the default iPhone ear buds.  They were very easy to use and seem to hold a charge very well.  Considering the price they are an AMAZING VALUE!  They include a very nice case, two chargers including one that can double as a lightning charger as well.  Nice device"
1,Great product at a very affordable price
1,Sounds good but charge lasts maybe 45 minutes
1,"Love these. The sound quality is as good or better than others ive had that costs me waaaaay more. The bluetooth connection, while of course not as perfect as a wired set, is just as good as my old JVC's & Yurbuds. Great set, especially for the low price."
1,"Mine broke after about six months, so I emailed Senso directly and at 10:30pm on a Friday night, they spent no more than 15 minutes responding to every email I sent and their customer service was the best I’ve ever seen. They’re sending me new ones because I have a one year warranty, but I was expecting this to take at least a week to get a response. It was incredible and I would recommend these earbuds and this service to everyone."
1,"Received these two days ago, so i don't have a lot to report other than they are a) comfortable, b) very secure and good for working out, c) sound great, and d) holding their charge well.<br /><br />The box includes a dual car charger and a lightning cable.  Very nice.  The phones charge with a mini-USB, included.  The controls take a few minutes to figure out, but they work as designed and are logical.<br /><br />In short, these are exactly what I was looking for and I'm happy with them."
1,"These are excellent wireless ear buds. They are so comfortable and the sound quality is amazing. The over the ear silicon holders are not even noticeable while exercising and they don't fall off! I was thinking of the &#34;Apple ear buds&#34; ,(but they kept falling off !!) ,but these are so much better with the band over your ear.Very good product,now we will see how long they last.  Thanks SENSO."
1,"The headphones are very good quality for the price and their customer service is excellent. Since my headphones were still under warranty they'd already begun processing a new shipment the moment I told them I had a problem, even before I tried the possible solutions they sent me via email. Unfortunately the audio does get choppy sometimes, particularly when the battery gets low, but it doesn't seem to last that long usually. I'll update if my new ones don't do the same."
0,The sound quality is not very good and the controls are awkward. Ok as a back up to the name brand ones.
1,So far so good. Easy set up a comfortable fit. Was able to change out bud sizes for more comfortable fit. Sound quality is stellar. I have yet to take him for a run but just a quick head bang in the kitchen they didn't go flying. Would definitely recommend these .
1,trying these for the first time. Other Bluetooth headphones only manage to last 6 to 12 months so I am optimistic these will do a little better.
0,"Tried a hard reset....does not work.  Great sound, OK moisture wicking.  Great while they lasted, but not long enough."
1,"Arrived timely and has nice accessories, carrying case, car charger, etc.. It synced with my Kindle Fire very easily, but I haven't had time to wear it while exercising yet.<br /><br />I have been using earphones for about two weeks now. The sound and ease of use are good. They are a little bulky and the cord is too short. Other than that they seem pretty good."
1,Sound quality is good.  Comfortable and portable.  Good value for money..
1,I like the sound when playing music.<br />However when I'm on a phone call using the Bluetooth the caller says they can't hear me. But I hear them usually.
1,My son loves them and they work great. Only time will tell if thy standup to a 12 y/o active boy but for now they are great.
0,Product had been previously opened.  I am very uncomfortable using something like this after it had already been put into someone else's ear.
0,"While the sound quality is pretty good, the range on these head phones is VERY limited, (like 6 feet from source).<br />Also, it is very touchy about where the connected wire is: if I hung the wire in front of my chin; good reception. If I hung the wire behind my head, I seemed to lose reception..."
1,"I love these headphones, this is the second pair I bought. I lost the first pair and I would buy them again in a heart beat. Great sound and great price. Amazing product!!!! A+++"
1,Love these headphones! Great battery life and does cancel most noise while working out. The volume is excellent and the quality of the music is great.
1,"I love these! Walking my dogs with these in my ears is perfect. Comfortable and easy to put in, with a little practice. I’m impressed."
1,"so far so good, i used only 2 days, the sound it is great a LOT BETTER THAN THE ONE<br /> that i had before.<br />So easy to use also."
0,I do not like that
1,I received these one day after ordering with prime with 2 day shipping. My powerbeats 3 just broke so I took a chance on these. The build quality of these are nice and sound quality is good too. My powerbeats 3 had slightly better sounding bass in my opinion but these are still good. These are amazing for the price. I will update my review later to see how well these hold up when used for running since I sweat a lot.
1,"The SENSO bluetooth headphones have made exercising a lot more comfortable. I used to get annoyed by having wired headphones bounce around and snag on things when I was running, but the bluetooth earbuds work great and I rarely have to fiddle with them in the middle of a workout. Unfortunately my first pair suddenly stopped working after about 4 months so I contacted SENSO's customer service reps and they were very helpful. They responded to my email in under 2 hours and gave me a few things to try to get the earbuds working again. It turns out they were a defective pair and SENSO let me know they'd send me a new pair right away as the earbuds come with a one-year warranty. I'm excited to get my new pair of earbuds and hope the replacements work well."
1,These are great! They don't fall out of my ears while I'm jogging so that's what I was looking for. They were easy to pair. I'm glad I purchased these!
1,"Sound quality is better than I expected. Compared to Beats, these fall short, but only by a little bit. The carrying case and charging cables are great too. I love the combo Apple and Android charger. Wish it included the new type-c charger, so this could be my go-to cable, but that is minor. Maybe one day. LOL."
1,perfect
1,"Excellent buy. I highly recommend these for anyone want to buy a Bluetooth headphone. Great sound, voice responses on power up and power down and even calls out the number on incoming calls. Great value for the money. I am going to order some for my sons!"
1,"I love my new headphones. I can move around, walk or run ease. Not as bulky as my previous headphones. Dont feel like I have a weight around my neck.  No problems connecting the Bluetooth.  I am pleased"
1,"Best Customer Service EVER ....<br />I have two of these headphones that I bought in April 2017 - and I LOVE them.<br />Recently one of them had a minor problem in one of the buds and I reached out to Tekatron.<br />Even though it was a weekend they replied withing a few hours; suggested a few things that might fix it and when those suggestions did not solve the problem, on their own said they would ship a replacement pair - I did not even have to ask them to do it.<br />I would buy this product without any hesitation because it is a great product (very good sound and very hardy) and because it is supported by a great company.<br />I wish them great success."
1,"The headphones sound great. I did end up having some issues with them but the product support was awesome! They responded right away with instructions to try and reset the headphones, and when that didn't work, they promptly sent me new ones."
1,Nice headphone for my gym workout. Battery lasts for a long time and the sound quality is really good.
1,"Love my new Senso earbuds.  The sound is crisp, stay on during my workouts & have surprising great sound.<br />The order arrived quickly & without any problems.<br />I’m very satisfied with my product."
1,I got these for my fiancé and he LOVES them. He said they're just as good as beats but a fraction of the cost. Bluetooth works perfectly. Very happy with this purchase !
0,"very disappointed at these headphones. I gave it a chance, but I could not stand the fact that the Bluetooth connection keeps cutting in and out at the gym. I tried to do a process of trial and error to see what exactly is causing the interruptions.. it has to be the fact that there are too many other Bluetooth connections around. even at some points where I took my phone out and had it directly in front of my face it would cut in and out when there are others nearby and congested. returned for another pair hoping it was just a defect. nope. I would not recommend these headphones if  you're planning to work out with them in a crowded gym. the sound and bass is great and it's just a shame that the Bluetooth connectivity is horrendous."
0,"I got these earbuds, they sounded great for the first day after a full charge then they just stopped working. I’ve always loved this brand and bought earbuds from this but after this experience im throwing these earbuds away and never buying another pair !!"
1,I like these headphones. Good quality and easy to use and connect to Bluetooth. The right ear bud tends to not suction to my ear but that could be just the way my ear is not sure
0,"did not fit on ear properly , I returned the headphones"
0,"Well, unfortunately, these didn't work out as great. The earbuds keep dropping from my sync with my phone. Did a reset & still nothing. The worst part is that even still under warranty, the company did not respond to my concerns. Kept being told over & over to do a reset and got ZERO help."
1,So far these ear buds are awesome!
1,"Bluetooth connectivity generally works very well, fits well enough, seems well-made, long battery life, intuitive and accessible controls, says in my ears even when mountain biking.  The big problem is the sound quality.  Like so many of these types of products, the bass is boosted artificially high, and not in a good way.  A bit of extra bass is fine IF it's tight, but this is muddy bass.  If you are listening to pop or basic rock I can see how these would sound fine.  If you listen to any kind of hard rock, metal, jazz, or other technical music, you end up with a ball of mud. Double-bass drum hits, muted riffs, or anything remotely fast that has some bass content will just flub out.  For me, wearing these while I bike or otherwise workout where there is extraneous noise anyway, I can deal with it just enough to tolerate it.  In isolation they sound like a big fat mess with a lot of music.  If you are an audiophile and like technical music, I'd recommend looking elsewhere."
1,Very good so far
1,"Good item, good price"
1,"Fantastic product! Super easy to set up and use, and the sound quality is awesome"
1,"GREAT for the gym. Excellent ear buds. They sound great, and fit well. Very comfortable and very easy to set up. Shipped with various sizes of ear cushions, including an extra spongy earplug like type that blocks even a little more noise than the silicon ones, which are adequate. The noise reduction is decent, although from what I can tell it is not an electronics system like my full size headphones. I don't hear any difference in the background noise bleed when I turn them on and off. But their design does block out a significant amount of background noise. I purchased these pretty much for the gym, as I kept knocking the wire out of my traditional headphones and pulling my phone into the floor when I ran. My full-size wireless noise cancelling headphone sound great, but I sweat too much and they become uncomfortable as well as being large and heavy. I'm going to keep the full size ones for ones for when greater noise suppression is needed, such as on an airplane. I am curious to find out if these have electronic technology or if the physical design itself is the only noise suppression they use. As I said, it blocks out more than enough noise at the gym."
1,"I use them daily for working out at the gym, showering, grocery shopping, etc.  They fit my ears perfectly.  I sleep with them in for aid in falling asleep.  I honestly can't think of one thing I dislike about them or would change."
1,"Been looking at wireless earbuds for awhile, been using these for a week now and I love then, they worked great out of the box.  They hold a charge all day at work which I'm greatfull for!  Great product! Thanks! Well worth the price."
0,"Doesn't stay in ears, wire is annoying on the neck. Ill-fitting. Get real wireless. These are cheap."
1,Sound great but don't really fit my ears well.... Hook is way too big
1,"Easy to pair, great sound, comfortable on the ears!"
1,Great product always use at the gym and isolates sound so far so good
1,These are great. I first thought they wouldn't stay around my neck. But the rubber connecting each eat piece is flat and grabs on to my tops. The sound reception is phenomenal.  So happy I just in and bought these
1,"Really like these headphones.  Bought a pair for myself, let my wife try them then had to get her a pair also.  Great sound and battery lasts a long time."
0,Right ear didn't work ..
1,Great sound! No trouble syncing. Fits well in my ears.
1,"Comfortable, the sound is great."
1,Love the headphones! Pure Bluetooth sound and so easy to set up. Thank you.
1,Great feel on the ears! Blocks out the 2 stroke gas trimmer sound superbly! Vey comfortable! Easy sync with my new iPhone 7!
1,"Nice sound, can't go wrong with these.  The only thing is the strap around the ear is too flimsy."
1,"I love the Senso headphones, the packaging they came in and all the support behind them. You have a great product. Keep up the great job..!!<br />Frank"
1,good construction and better sound than my other earphone ----------- can be less expensive
0,Purchased as a gym only headphone set.  Sound quality is pretty good.  Range is only about have other high quality bluetooth headphones i have owned.  Low score as the headphones stopped working within 3 months.  Won't turn on or charge.<br /><br />Update.  Purchased a second set.  Same issues.  Died after 3 weeks of ownership.  Yes they are cheap... but for a reason
1,"Fits snugly around the ear and they don't have the feeling that they'll pop out with a sneeze like with buds.<br /><br />They don't cancel noise, but that's good if you're running on the beach or anywhere else you need to pay a modicum of attention to your surroundings.<br /><br />They'll last half the day non-stop, which is good enough.  They could probably last longer, but I've never pushed it to the limit."
1,great product
1,"When you get your headphones, replace the red sponges  (shown on the right), with one of the three pairs of ear cushions (shown on the left). Attach the small, round, black wire tie to create an adjustment loop in the middle of the cable. Also note the location of the charging port on the right ear piece. The extra cable connects to either your iPhone or a micro USB."
1,excellent
0,"Pair I received was defective, but they bigger problem was they are bulky, uncomfortable, and wouldn't stay in my ears."
0,"I spent 36 dollars on this headphone. I used it occasionally each week. In 6 months, it is dead now. It is NOT worth it."
1,Excellent for the price. Use them for running and they work great. Came with multiple sizes for the ear adapter so it was easy to find one that worked well with me.
0,"I'm 100% disabled and can't sleep on my back at all so I bought these thinking I would be able to sleep on my pillow on my side but these are very uncomfortable and hurt my ears when I do. If your willing, would you be able send me something like a pair of singles for each ear. I really need something cause I have &#34;TINITIS&#34; so bad I have to listen to either my books from audible.com or, listen to TV show that I don't have to watch cause I know what's going on. I've been looking and trying for a few years now & I can't find anything comfortable enough to sleep on my pillow. I'm willing to try the kind that doesn't have any wires, just the kind that will fit in each ear or just one ear. My Tinnitus is so bad that I can't hear so good because my ears ring so loud.<br />Do you think you could see it in your heart to possibly send me a single or a double earpiece so I can sleep a little better and also one that seems to last around 5-6 hours or so, if it's possible, my address is 3813 Dorchester Ln., Eugene, OR 97404. If you can do this for me cause of my disability, I'll definitely change my review to a very positive  &#34;5 STARS&#34;,, Thank you in advance for your help (I hope)- csmeadeiii@gmail.com"
0,Awful and uncomfortable form factor. I returned it immediately.
1,Good sound. Seem to be good quality. I like the personal touch of the follow up email.
1,These are awesome earphones. They fit just right in your ear and no complaints when talking to clients.
1,This does what it's supposed to do but doesn't fit my ears very well.  They fall off a lot so I put my glasses on top of the ear loop to try and hold them in place.
1,"So far, they work great for music. The feedback I've got about how they sound when used with my phone, for calls, I've been told I sound quiet. Other than that, this is the second pair I've bought. My girlfriend got the first pair, lol"
0,"4 Brief Impressions of the Senso Bluetooth Earbuds<br /><br />1) Sound Quality: Much better in my opinion that Taotronics that I also tried. Bass and mid-range are excellent for earbuds, although the high-end, treble clarity cannot compare to good quality wired headphones or even my cheap $10, wired JVC HA-EB75 earbuds. Very efficient sound (loud at low play volume levels).<br /><br />2) Bluetooth Connectivity & Range: Excellent! Easy to connect and great range (at least 30 feet without walls).<br /><br />3) Comfort & Fit:  Great if you are just sitting or walking slowly. I can wear them for long hours without discomfort. However, apparently my ears may be on the small side and they don't hold well when I'm running or exercising.  The ear wraps are soft & pliable, which is great for comfort but not so great when you are in high motion.<br /><br />4) Build Quality: Not good at all.  Initially I thought the controls were solid.  Compared to the Taotronics, they turned on quite easily (one large button on the side of the right piece to turn on/off,  two small buttons on top for volume and forward/reverse).  Unfortunately after a few short weeks of constant use, the controls completely failed, rendering the device unusable.  The top tiny controls actually collapsed into the earpiece and the side on/off controls froze. Too bad because overall, I liked these earbuds.<br /><br />Although all the other qualities of these earbuds are above average, based upon the extremely poor build quality of it's controls, I have to give it only one star and I'll be returning it."
1,"I bought these at the end of February 2019 and they worked great until now, 11 months later. I’ve noticed the Bluetooth range has become much shorter and it will start to cut out at about 15 ft away. The battery used to last a weeks worth of workouts or so and now it’s one workout. Twice this week I’ve gotten to the gym and they’ve been dead when usually I could charge them on Sunday and make it through at least four 1-1.5 hour workouts before it started saying battery low.  Now they just don’t turn on."
1,"Comfortable and stylish, at a great price. Good sound. Elegant extra--iphone charging cord--is worth the price alone. For some, the car charger could also be a great extra."
1,Will be ordering another set for my spouse. Holds well while running and the sound with bass was awesome. The little case was a plus.
1,Nice item. Fits well even during intense workouts. Sound and controls are easy to use. I have not tested the range but in normal use I never had connection problems. Very good customer service
1,"Great sound, Great value."
1,great quality and arrived on time.  would recommend to everyone
0,The headphones worked just fine until one day 5 months later they quit working.  After attempting a factory reset they still did not work.  The batteries would charge but the headphones would not turn on.  I am waiting to see how they enforce the one year warranty.
1,"Can’t beat this value! They look and feel identical to the $200 Beats brand of the similar variety. These don’t quite have the richness of sound that the higher end models do, but for the price and purpose, these are fantastic!"
1,"Sounds really good, clarity is A++"
0,"First off, I chose these BT Headphones because 8500+ buyers gave this product a raving review.  These are my second pair and Im having the same issues with the second one as I did with the first pair (lost).  The issues i have with this product are:<br />1. the 4.1 BT technology should work well within 98ft, however if place your connected phone in your left breast pocket as i have a habit of doing, i get repeated static interruptions while listening.  i have to place phone either in right breast pocket or right pant pocket in order to get rid of the interfernce.<br />2.the noise cancelling feature is not existent!  receiving calls anywhere - especially in MidTown, NYC is a problematic when everyone hears everything besides me<br />3. Today, walking from home, the right speaker just stopped working.  I paused, unpaused. I shut it off and restarted it and still it does not work.  I will be returning these.<br />one of the worst experiences with Senso, Ill not be buying thier products again."
1,"Love them. Works great, super comfy. Clarity is amazing."
1,"These are great! Especially for the price. I went on several runs over a couple weeks and I didn't have to recharge them once! I run with my phone is a pouch as well and the connectivity is great. I also love that you can pause, skip forward and back songs from the headpiece. They are sturdy in the ears and you do not get the bouncing noise that sometimes comes with active headsets. The bluetooth is also amazing. They pair automatically and quickly with my iPhone 6S as soon as I turn them on! Definitely would recommend for the price."
1,Works great!  easy to pair.  Very comfortable.
1,"I give this 5-stars, I was not expecting the quality I got for the price I paid. Cannot beat this, battery lasts a good amount of time and I think its better sound quality than buying a pair of the generic apple headphones."
1,they were easy to pair and have great sound....Their Customer Support is EXCELLENT!!!
0,It stopped the connection  after a few months.
1,I liked them so much I want to buy other ...
1,"Fit and sound great,I also like the id of the<br />Incoming call number."
1,"I've been using buds that have no ear hooks or wires, and Ive found this works better now that I wear a mask when I'm out for my walk.  I sometimes have problems with the others falling out.<br /><br />I've used these for 3 years, had to buy another because I misplaced one set, or it may have been stolen...these are a great buy!!"
1,great for me at the gym. great sound. deep bass. stays in my ears and does not come out like cheaper models
1,"These work well with my iPhone 8 Plus, but I primarily bought them for running and listening to music off my Apple Watch series 3 and in that function they are luckluster at best. I have to wear my watch on my right hand. I have gone through the troubleshooting steps to resolve the breaking up I experience when running with my watch on my left hand. I am still searching for another headphone to run and listen to music off my Apple Watch on my left hand."
1,Love them! Came with a carrying case for them. Exactly what I wanted.
0,I used them a handful of times over the last 3 months. Yesterday I decided to use them after having not done so for a few weeks and they didn't turn on. Tried to charge them and they don't take a charge. They worked well when I had them though.
1,"Work great, used for 3 months."
1,I've had many sports earphones but this is the best by far. They fit comfortably in my ears and the audio is very clear.
1,Great headphones for the price. Sound works well and they don't fall of the head.
0,Super uncomfortable.
1,"These headphones are perfect for me.  I use them for audio books and for playlists in the pool as I do water aerobics. I was pleased to see the IPX-7 rating even though they won't likely be submerged, splashing from others is a concern. I bought them on sale at Amazon and couldn't be happier!"
1,Love these and the price!
1,"These headphones are just exactly as advertised.  Good sound, easy to use.  Just what i needed for my workouts.  Love them."
0,"The cord is AGGRAVATING! When wear it in the front it gets in the way when you are looking or bending down and when worn behind the neck frequently when you turn your head to either side it pulls the ear bud out of your ear on the opposite side you are looking, especially when sweating. Too bad, the Bluetooth features are great but the constant battle to keep the buds in your ear negates that."
1,"They are as good as advertised.  I had fairly modest expectations. I bought them to use with Samsung Smart TV. I need more volume than my wife does. I am absolutely delighted. She controls volume with the TV remote. I can control volume separately with the volume buttons on the SENSO.  We can mute the TV and I can still hear through the earbuds.  Relative to the range, I am writing this from our computer in a separate room of my home down a hallway with a wall in between. I can hear perfectly.  They are easy to sync with my Samsung Smart TV with built in Bluetooth.<br /><br />I am totally happy and delighted with these. They completely meet my need and expectation."
0,"Use them on treadmill at gym.  Gym is noisy, so wanted in-ear style.  They were OK, even with the over-ear hooks having all of the weight at the buds meant they didn't stay in great, but I would have given them 3-4 stars.  Sound was fine.<br /><br />But after about 2 months of use they don't turn on anymore.  I don't expect gym headphones to last a long time, but I expect them to last longer than this...<br /><br />EDIT:  They were good about following up, sent me a new pair with no hassle on my part.  So raising from one star to three.  Because they don't stay on my ears well, I had already moved to a new brand by the time I got these though, so not currently using them.  Gym headphones don't typically last long though, so probably will be back to these at some point...<br /><br />Further edit:  Back to one star.  I started using the new pair about 2 months ago.  They started failing last week.  Several times I've had them just cut out half an hour into a run.  They shut off, won't turn on.  Not low on power.  I suspect it is sweat getting into the charger flap, which seals very poorly.  All three times they started working again after a few hours (without charging).  They dried out?  Anyway, into the headphone trash pile they go."
1,"Product seems to be good quality. A little bulky to wear. A slimmer unit perhaps more tapered would be an improvement. Bass could be stronger as well. Overall, it seems to be a good purchase. Pairing was very nice."
1,I love it.
1,Headphones was a gift for my best friend and she love them.
0,"For the gym/exercising they are fine. But if you’re like me, and use wireless headphones for multitasking (being hands-free) then they are terrible to talk on the phone. They pick-up so much background noise and are staticky."
0,"It was working just great, great for runs and the gym. Today, after 5 months, it died completely. Cannot even do a factory reset on it. Granted, I only paid $24 for it because of a flash sale. But still disappointed."
0,Received them yesterday hooked them up and about an hour in they started beeping continously. I thought maybe the phone was out of range so I placed the phone in the pocket and it still beeped and the music started to fade in and out. I should have just spent the money and got the beats headphones. Very disappointed!!!!
1,Excellent
1,Purchased highly regarded Senso Buds as a gift. Haven't given yet so don't know how much she'll love them yet.
1,love these headphones - lost the 1st pair and immediately ordered a replacement pair!
1,"-flat cord is nice- no tangles<br />-pairing smooth on a pixel phone<br />-audio sounds pretty decent<br /><br />Cons-<br />-inserts will take some time to get used to, it feels like it's going to pop out. Wish they were the cone shaped inserts that go into your canal<br />-charging port cover is flimsy, I don't see how this will survive a little water if it can't seal the charging port properly. Will reach out to support"
1,"Great sound, fit is ok one ear fits good other not so good and often falls out of my one ear."
0,Very poor quality product. When I'm on a call ppl always complain about feedback. They won't stay in my ear even after trying out all the ear tips. I really had high hopes. Looks like I'm going to have to spend more money...😬
1,"These headphones are super comfy, and stay in my ears really well.  They connect easily via Bluetooth and notify you when the connection is established."
1,"Great sound and comfortable in the ear. I can't stand that the product repeats &#34;battery low&#34; every 30 seconds for the last 10-20 minutes of battery life. Why not repeat it just once with about 5 minutes of battery life left????? For the price, I think the headphones are stylish and quality is good so far (used for 3 months). I like the product but it is worth looking elsewhere for headphones that are less annoying."
1,Great sound.  Good bass.  Very effective noise cancellation. I returned a pair similar  from another maker but I'm keeping these.  Great buy.
0,"Ill-fitting headphones, making fit adjustments and the on/off switch difficult. Sounds is fair, battery life also average."
1,thanks son loves!! exactly what he wants
1,I ordered these and received them very quickly and I used them to walk today and they wok awesome.!! I never had wireless headphones but I strongly recommend these.
1,good~
1,"Hey guys. I've had these earbuds for 2+ years and they're still kickin.<br />They work but *the usb cord wears out after awhile!* so you may want to replace it or use a different cord.<br />I've been frustrated numerous times because it won't turn on or it won't charge....<br />Until I realize it's not the earbuds, it's the cord. Now, I use my JBL Bluetooth Speaker charging cord to charge, and they're charging as I type this!<br />Totally a great product for a cheap price, but just heads up about the cord.<br />Peace & love, and happy exercising! #GoVegan"
1,Great battery life and hands-down the best/fastest customer service I've experienced...products sometimes have problems:  the Senso team handled issues near real-time via email.
1,"I love to run (about 20-25 miles a week) and these are the best headphones I've ever owned in terms of sound, ease of use, battery life, staying in my ears while running, etc. The pair that I bought most recently had a slight defect and customer service at senso was also super responsive and sent me another pair quickly. In short, great product."
1,Amazing and beautiful
1,"I use these in the gym, in the pool and at the office- they work great. I'll but them again. They connect with ease, stay in your ear, cancel noise and come with a nice little case."
1,"I hate in ear headphones, so I went in knowing I wouldn't love these. I did not expect them to sound like such garbage. Can't listen to audiobooks or podcasts in the gym - they just aren't loud enough. No amount of tweaking the equalizer will make music sound decent, either. When these break - which may be never, the build quality is pretty good - I will be relieved to not use them ever again."
1,"I have been very pleased with the SENSO Bluetooth Headphones.  The sound quality is excellent.  They are easy to use, fit well, and hold their charge for hours.  This is my second pair.  First ones worked great for two years, a real bargain."
1,Great sound!
1,These headphones are amazing!!! I was a little unsure how good they were going to be because of the price but OMG was I amazed. They are great in quality of material and sound. They truly make my work outs so much easier and fun because I don't have to worry about my phone being wired to my headphones. The life lasts up to 6 hours after being fully charged. I only have to charge them once a week :) would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a great set of headphones without having to spend the ridiculous amount for the beats!
1,"These units were petty bulky and the bass was really boomie for my liking.  Some may like the boomie bass but way too much for me.  They sit fine on the ear and don't hurt.  However, they were bigger than what I thought and certainly too much bass."
1,I bought these for my brother and he loves them. He says they are great at blocking out noise.
1,My son works out a lot at school and loves these. The sound quality is great he says!
1,"I have tried several pairs of wireless headphones now (4 different brands) and these are by far the best sounding ones.  they rival some of the wired $30 dollar ones I've had.  Sadly, they have alot of wind noise due to aerodynamics on windy days.  The bluetooth connection to a samsung s7 isn't the greatest but it was worse on other more expensive pairs so yeah?  over 10 feet and I lose connection with s7.  Don't even bother watching videos with a bluetooth headset (all bluetooth headsets) the lip flap(sync) is a major problem.<br />  I gave these 4 stars.  They have great audio quality, especially for the price.  They fit pretty well and haven't hurt my ears as much as most other pairs of bluetooth. They stay on when working out (even doing situps).<br />  I have alot of problems with bluetooth and the s7, but these headphones are about as good as they can be while dealing with the bluetooth platform issues."
1,The Senso bluetooth headphones are great. They fit well and they pair easily with my phone and my iPod. They were shipped quickly and they were easy to charge and set up. The sound is good for the purpose and they over the ear pieces hold them securely during physical activity.
1,"So far so good. Arrived on time and I’ve only had for a week but no problems. The only downfall is , it comes with one year warranty but I cannot register the product to get the warranty<br />."
0,"These kinda worked during my first run.  It was windy, so I had a hard time hearing the music through the wind.  On my second run, connection to my ipod kept going in and out, which made the sound feel like the music was constantly being paused.  I have since tossed these in the garbage.  Do not waste your money on this trash."
1,Extremely happy with headphones. I do not yet know if they will hold up to the punishment I dish out (I go through a lot of headphones) but the bang for your buck ratio is the highest of any headphones I've ever bought. I'm going to purchase a couple extras before they realize they can charge another 50 bucks. I'll update after a year of use.
1,Rd the replacement pair started shortimg out.<br />Maybe about 6 months to 8 the Mic quit working<br />and sound started cutting out. With glasses on the rubber ear piece that fit around the ear didn't want to stay in place wished it was more solid to<br />Adjust. But sound Quality is great.
1,"Great value.  A breeze to use, comfortable, and sound great.  Well worth more than being sold for."
0,"If I were writing this review 5 years ago it would be 5 stars. My original pair recently broke so I figured I'd get the same ones again. The quality was amazing up until the end, they only broke because I tore the wore by accident.<br /><br />Something at the factory changed big time, there's a noticeable drop in sound quality plus the part that wraps around your ear doesn't bend anymore making it basically pointless. Such a shame, I thought I could keep faith in this company but they seem to be cutting corners and running their brand name into the dirt to make some easy money before going bankrupt. Stay away!"
1,"I love my new Senso headphones. Now just to be clear I've only had them for about a week. These are similar to the Dr. Dre Powerbeats that I paid $200 for. By which I had five pairs within six months that I continually had to take back to the Apple Store.this was last year before Apple took them over. They would break because when I run I sweat a lot. So far these headphones are much louder, They are just as comfortable oh and did I mention they are only 1/5 of the price. The reviews on them were great,so I took a chance. I'll keep you informed. So far I have used them on two 4 mile runs . I'm still on the same charge and they are still working great. Thanks Senso!"
1,"I just received these on the same day as this review.  I cannot speak to the longevity of these, as I just received them.  I am writing this review about the incredible sound that permeates from these earbuds.  I swapped out the tips that came on the earbuds with the red foam tips.  The sound quality is life changing.  Do yourself a favor.  Purchase these and give them a try.  The sound quality and the comfort is second to none."
1,I liked these so much I bought a pair for my husband.
1,Sounds great and sweat proof. Perfect for a workout or my Hot Tub.
1,These Senso Headphones were delivered on time and have a wonderful clear sound.  I am very pleased that I selected them over the many other choices.
1,"Needed a new pair of headphones recently and decided to upgrade to wireless. It's been quite nice so far. Sound quality is great for the price, they're comfortable and worked for a while out of the box without a need to charge them right away. They're easy to set up and use. If I could change one thing about them, it would be moving the main button to another location on the unit. Pushing the button sometimes causes the earbud to press inward uncomfortably if one is trying to do something like pause the music or turn the headphones off before removing the right side speaker."
1,The sound is great.  I'm able to run without them falling off my ears.
1,"Not 100% sold on the product. I've only used them once so far, while I was mowing the lawn. I noticed that every time I would bend over to empty the bag. The music would cut on and become all static. My phone was in my pocket of my shorts so not sure why this would happen."
1,For the price these are a home run !!!! Great product and service
1,"While it took a minute to adjust to the earbuds (I was a Beats guy for year), the overall experience rocked.  Inexpensive, light, powerful and easy to pair.  However, I've only had them since September, 2018 and the left ear bud has stopped working.  Pity."
1,No issues getting or using the product.<br />Fits well in the ears and stay on during normal workouts and runs
1,"Decent headphones, not much noise reduction however."
1,I was looking for wireless sports headphones.  I researched many sources and decided to try SENSO's  wireless sports headphones (earplugs).  I have used them every day since i purchased them and i ABSOLUTELY LOVE THEM!!!  They are super comfortable and don't fall out while i am running. It is a great product and a great price. Also i really appreciate that i received an email directly from one of the owners to make sure the product was to my satisfaction.  That personal touch meant a lot.  I highly recommend this product
1,No bass when  listening to music but good phone convesation quality
0,Returned after first short run.  Wind noise was unbearable
1,I received these today I would have to say they are ok. My biggest issue with these is the way they fit. I feel like they are going to fall off me head when I am wearing them. I realize what I paid for these but if I need them to stay around my ears that should be there regardless.<br /><br />The packing and presentation were both good along with the bonus car charger. I like the carrying case and the pocket for extra ear buds. I didn't try them while I was on a call so I cannot rate those features. If you listen to hip hop or music with a lot of bass you will probably be happy with these. The highs are really dull and it makes the overall sound real monotone. That makes the music or podcasts a little hard to listen to.<br /><br />I can say I will probably be returning these. I just cannot go backwards from what I bought these to replace.
0,"They broke after a month of use. I only used them at the gym and they broke in the middle of a long run which is possible the worst thing for head phones to do. It was nice that they told you when they were on and off, but even when they were off the battery drained. My honest opinion for any wireless headphone user is to go out and buy an expensive name brand pair because they will actually work. this is my second pair of wireless headphones that I bought and they both broke. at least my first pair broke after I finished running a marathon and not in the middle of it. Do not buy these if you are looking for a pair of reliable and durable headphones they were discounted for a reason,"
1,"fantastic sound quality, on par with my old corded beats by dre ear buds, range is acceptable, but these are not noise cancelling that is a complete lie."
1,"Not the best quality, but okay for the price."
1,"**Update as of August 2018**<br />These are still going strong, good battery life and zero issues, other simular looking ones I've bought for cheaper have worse sound (static, delays) and just flat out die. These are still amazing.<br /><br />**Original Review**<br /><br />For the price, these headphones are amazing. I love them, and have used them for 5 months as of this review with zero issues. Are they the pinnacle of sound, no, but they get the job done.<br /><br />The packaging of the headphones is amazing at this price point. They look good, and I've been averaging 7-9 hours use between charges. They stay fixed during runs, I can't express more. They're not an expensive investment, give them a try, I've spent a lot more on worse sounding wired headphones."
1,These are perfect. Sound quality is outstanding and my wife loves them.  This is the 2nd pair I've purchased.
1,"Pretty comfortable, great accessories, sound is legit. Only issue I have is I constantly have to repair it if I turn it off."
1,these are just fine for the price. i thought they sounded kinda weird at first but i got used to it. they also have a pretty long battery life.
1,"Okay so this is my first day with them. So far it's great !!! I have never have beats before. However, after using these headphones I doubt I would ever want them. Everything work perfectly with my iPhone 7 plus. Directions are easy. The owner sent personal email to make sure product works and it also comes with 1 year warranty. I'm loving these headphones . I would def recommend to friends and family .Thanks  for a great product"
1,Very fine product. Excellent audio. Very user friendly. High quality construction. Great value.<br />Had a very nice interaction with company owner/representative. I appreciated that.
1,"Love it!!  I was getting my cord caught on everything, not so much anymore!  The connect is great too!"
1,"Bought these headphones a while ago, waited to see how they hold up before submitting a review.<br /><br />The sound quality is pretty great for the price, maybe a little tinny for mids but otherwise no complaints (although I'm no audiophile so don't quote me on that). They have yet to fall out of my ears even once, the Bluetooth works with minimal setup (but if you have multiple devices you will have to manually connect from settings every time you switch as far as I'm aware), the accessories are thoughtfully picked to enhance the headphones - I would have liked to see a wall adapter but you probably have a thousand already so it's not a big deal.<br /><br />The main reason I waited before posting this review was to test the durability and see if any issues would arise from casual use. I'm happy to say that I've had the earbuds paired to an LG g3, iPhone 6s and iPad mini with no issues, the sound quality has remained consistent, and I can find no evidence of wear and tear from carrying them around in the case provided.<br /><br />In conclusion, these headphones are in my opinion a great option for someone on a tight budget who wants a cheaper option that will last a while. When playing music I can't hear someone calling my name from across the table, which is good enough noise isolation for me."
1,"Before posting a review I wanted to put the headphones to a good use.<br />After a week of using them at the gym, I can comfortably say that these headphones are amazing. Good battery life, quick bluetooth connectivity and range. Also fast changing and comfortable to wear around ear. ( great for runing). highly recommend these!!"
1,"I work outside and was looking for a headphone that would allow me to be handsfree when recieving phone calls, this is not the headphone you want to purchase if you are looking to use it primarily as a handsfree Bluetooth headphone for phone calls. The microphone picks up too much background noise and the other caller will not be able to head you if there is any noises around you, this includes wind noise on trip in your vehicle. I took the risk when purchasing because there weren’t many reviews on people who used it for phone calls but after having them for a month I could firmly say they are not beneficial to have for using to talk on the phone via Bluetooth. As for listening to music, they work pretty well, nothing spectacular but they work well. I will say however, the company provides some pretty great extras which is keeping me from returning the item because it’s too good of a value for decent music listening headphones. I would recommend these headphone if you are looking to Only use them for listening to music.."
1,Received the headphones and used them for first time.  Easy to link via Bluetooth to my IPhone.  I use them to workout and didn’t want to deal with dangling wire from wired headphones.  These worked very well and the sound is solid for such reasonably priced headphones.  So far so good!
1,Son una maravilla!!! Los mejores que he tenido y hasta mejores que los de marca que son súper caros... Ninguna batería aguanta como la de estos audífonos!! No los cambio por nada!!
1,"My husband and I just received the buds, and we both love them. Noise cancelling works very well, sound quality is excellent, and we couldn't be more pleased. My husband is hard of hearing these days, and using ear buds for calls is necessary. He can hear his phone now and callers don't have to talk as loud, as the volume level on the buds is very convenient. And the wireless feature is awesome! What is there NOT to love about these? Thank you Senso!"
1,"These could be powerbeats3 knock offs but for 1/4 the price they fit the bill perfectly.  They come with the middle size earbuds attached and include an extra smaller, larger, and a squishy foam pair.  Comfort is very good, but they still are &#34;in ear&#34; earbuds so can take some getting used to.  There are two wire ties included that are essential to minimize the &#34;microphonics&#34; issue that plagues all bluetooth headphones connected by a cable.  The default sound on my ZTE Axon 7 phone was kind of muffled and boomy, but this appears to be another common issue with many earbuds.  However, using the built in android Dolby Atmos app (short press the Dolby icon in the quick settings pull down menu) I picked the Custom 1 profile and dragged the mid and high up and low down a bit and the sound is perfect now.  Bluetooth range for me is 20 feet at best before skips start happening.  The car charger, case, and charging cables are nice extras.  Time will tell how these hold up quality wise, but even buying two of these are still half the price of the more expensive headphones, and I have a hard time seeing the value in paying 2-4 x more.  I'd rather spend my savings on two MOOV Now bands for my HIIT boxing workouts."
1,"I have had these for years now, and they are just as good as when I first got them!! I use these daily at the gym, and have had zero issues with them. They are able to get sweaty and get thrown in a gym bag, and are still great!"
1,"The product is very ok, for what you can get in $20 budget. The ear pieces keep falling off from the ear, I tried all the three ear buds.<br />One major complaint I have is regarding putting on the ear buds on the ear piece. The openings of the ear buds are too tight/ small to mount on the ear piece, even after a lot of struggle I could not put on the memory foam ear buds on the ear piece and eventually ended up tearing them apart."
1,"Easy to wear...wonderful sound, comfortable!"
1,It seems like the connectivity isn't that good.  I have a new ipod and i constantly get breaks while listening to music.
1,Didn't dig the sound. Hurt my ears. Comfortable though.
1,"Wonderful item, comfortable to wear and easy to use."
1,"Nice weight, excelent sound, regular base, easy to use."
0,Head phones were great at first. I purchased on August 7th I think. I would like a full refund. They will not charge and it's only been 2 months.<br />Disappointed to say the least.
1,"For the price, I'm quite impressed from the packaging to the build quality. These headphones are more than a bargain. The sound quality is good but not great. However, I'm very pleased with my purchase."
1,Senso are perfect for running. They don't move like other headphones. I live in south Texas it's hot and humid. I sweat a lot and have no issues with the headphones. Great job to SENSO design engineers!!
1,"Thanks guys for a great product, so far I am very pleased with the performance and fit! Thank You!!!!"
1,"Works great, now I can listen to music and get phone calls I use to miss."
1,This is one of my favorite products purchased through Amazon. I use these headphones every single day. They have great battery life and they have lasted numerous gym and hiking sessions. I still use them all the time! Highly recommend for the price
0,Burned while charging.  Be careful.  Amazon was great in refunding me!
1,Love these earbuds.  Just wondering how waterproof they are.  I was hoping to use them in the pool
1,Great product quality for a great price. Outstanding customer service. Would definitely purchase this product and from this company again.
1,Great headset.  I use them all the time.  Perfect for running.  Haven't had any issues with it.
1,Works fine loses connection sometimes.
1,"I've had this product for about 3 months and they no longer turn on and my iphone no longer detects it either. With a year warranty, I don't know if it's worth it because it died less than 6 months."
1,I Love them. I like the sound and convenience. Only complaint is they don't last 8 hrs. on a charge and they slide off the neck when not in my ears.
1,So far so good. I can't speak to how well they will stand up over time but I'm encouraged based on what I see so far.<br /><br />The headphones are very comfortable and provide for a good fit around and inside the ear (has different-sized detachable earbuds). Also comes with accessories that make you feel good about where that extra money went.
1,Great product and customer service.  Customer for life.  I highly recommend these ear phones.
1,"So impressed with the quality of these headphones is a 4 1/2 Star. Sound is very clear, easy to set with the Bluetooth. When I first charged it went fairly quickly. Just keep in mind not to over charge to keep the battery life span. Walked around the house and was still able to hear clearly. Comes with extra accessories, nice small portable case. Charger is smaller than expected but that makes it easier to place inside your case along with your headphones. Headphones are pretty comfy to place in your ear and came with several extra rubber buds to fit your size. I would definitely recommend this product.<br />When a call came through it told you the complete phone number that was calling. But when I answered it didn’t connect on the headphones but I’m thinking perhaps I missed something on the instructions."
1,Worked well and has a great sound.
1,I do heavy construction and these headphones own. i bought my girlfriend a pair of beats and the sound difference is minuscule with the beats sounding a bit better with a few hours longer of battery life. For $35 i feel like buying a pair for all my friends. Get em.
1,I have worn them a couple times now & I could not be more excited or happy with this product!  They don't move around when I run & they are super easy to operate without breaking my stride.  The mic is also really good for when you are talking on the phone to someone.  I would definitely rate this a 10 star if it were possible!
1,"Definitely worth buying. The packaging is classy, comes with a carrying case."
1,"I love these headphones, they have great sound for the money, a definite WOW!!!"
1,Good quality
1,"The wire is great. I wear it around my neck all day long without realizing it's there. Great audio quality, never falls out of my ear . Battery will last me the full day.<br />The one issue: the rubber part covering charging port is difficult to remove when you go to charge it."
1,I love how they’re wireless but the only problem I have with it is that the piece that is connected to the ear piece kinda hurts my ears but overall they are really great.
1,I bought it for my wife and she's very satisfied with your new device.
0,"These worked great for about 1 month.  Now they will not connect to anything.  I have only used then in my air conditioned office.  They are comfortable to wear, but won't connect to any of my devices."
0,They only last 2-3 months. Senso has sent out 3 pairs so far.
0,"llegaron bien , pero después de dos días dejaron de funcionar, los estaba usando anoche y dejaron de funcionar"
0,As noted in other reviews the silicon ear loops are quite flimsy.  That became more aggravating when the ear buds kept slipping out (I did experiment with all sizes - and yes - I did make sure left was in the left year and right in the right ear!)  This was a continuous problem later in the run when more perspiration was generated.  Also the sound kept cutting out when they did manage to stay in place.  Not fun!
1,Excellent headphones!!!
1,Bought these about a week ago. Only used for about 3 or so workouts about an hour each they havent needed a recharge even though they have been in my bag (turned off) all week so batttery life is better than my old headphones. Sound quality is mediocre as id expext in this price range. The one thing i would like to inform is that the ear hooks are very flimsy and soft. I was hoping for a firmer tight feel. That being said they havent fallen out yet despite vigourous workout. Best feature is affordability and they offer a pretty good performance per dollar.
1,"So far, these are absolutely amazing. Very comfortable with 3-4 extra buds for different size ears. It even includes a set of foam buds. The sound is incredibly good for the price. Decent bass, no static. I cannot yet report on battery life. I will update after I have used them more. Add on top of all of this that it came with a hard shell carry case, a sleeve to stick to the back of your phone case for a credit card or even business cards, AND a magnetic car vent mount for my phone is just ridiculous for the price."
1,Good product. Noise cancelling is only average. Great sound quality. Cannot honestly report good for workout as I don’t workout vigorously (I am 75 years young) but I do use them for a vigorous strong paced walk. Would recommend highly versus the much higher priced models.
1,They're grrrrrreat!
1,"I had the power beat wireless for 1.5 years.  In 8 months of not heavy use, an earpiece broke off so they sent me a replacement with a 3 month warranty.  Just over 3 months of use everyday, the volume piece started coming apart and 4 months later the battery wouldn't take a charge (neither covered in warranty). So I decided to try other wireless headphones that weren't as expensive.  I tried several from best buy that were $50 to $70 dollar range and their battery charge was much less than advertised (I couldn't finish an hour workout!)  So I returned them and tried these.  So far so good!  3 workouts in and still on same charge.  They are about the size of the beats and the buttons work well and seem logical.  Sound to me is similar to my beats.  I'll update if I have any future issues."
1,Really nice earbuds. I originally never buy earbuds because I don't like the way they fit my ears . BUT these are perfect. The way they are shaped prevent them from digging to deep into your ear canal. So glad I bought them. HIGHLY RECOMMEND
1,"The battery life is really long, and it charges very fast. Mic is good when talking on the phone. It fits and stays on my ears when I exercise or run. I sweat A LOT and unlike my last Bluetooth headset,  these have lasted well so far. The sound is also good when playing music. I've owned these headsets for about a month."
1,"Nice headphone especially for the price ! Battery lasts forever. If you forget these on the plane, your wallet and your pride suffer far less. Nice , carrying case"
0,"Horrible bass.  Every drum beat is cringeworthy.  Absolutely washed out.  I sent it back and ordered another.  If the next comes with the same issue, I'll have serious doubts about the reviews on this item."
1,pretty good.
1,"These are great headphones for the $- they are inexpensive and I primarily bought them so I could listen to Audible books while working out so I thought “How good does that sound really have to be to listen to someone talking”- turns out they are fabulous for listening to music as well- Just as good as my $90 ones that fall out of my ears every 1/4 mile when I’m running or if I move to tie my shoe or pick up a weight.  I also have sort of small ears and I love that the ear hooks are totally moldable to wrap securely around my ears I put the strap in the back and I don’t notice it all- for the price, you really can’t go wrong."
0,The hooks for your ears weren't stiff enough so they feel out of my ears when working out. Wouldn't recommend.
1,These headphones have everything you would want waterproof and 8hrs of usage. Sound quality not good in my opinion. I had another brand of similar price that I like the sound quality better.
0,These were working fine but after a month of use they will not charge.
1,"Only had the headphones for a week, but pairing them with my IPhone and IPad was very simple.  The ear pieces are comfortable and they stay on well.  First time I've been able to mow the lawn and listen to music.  Nice...."
1,"works ok, sound is just as you would expect from the price, not great, but good enough for the gym or a run. Battery lasts long, however, after the low battery warning it dies in less than 5 minutes."
1,"Great headset, with extended battery life. Built to last as well."
1,My husband loves these headphones and he is very particular on a good bluetooth head set.
1,They work great I use mine when I work out at the gym
1,Great headphones!
1,"Sound great, fit great and they stay on/in my ears.  Really appreciate the soft &#34;ear holders.&#34;  Would recommend them for anyone."
1,Cant beat it for the price.
1,"I was skeptical of these because of the price, but don't let that hold you back. These are better than most of the expensive, ill fitting earbuds that I've tried.  The microphone for the phone is great, they stay in my ears even when I sweat hard in the Louisiana heat and the sound is amazing.  I highly recommend these headphone/earbuds."
1,The girl loves these for when she's working out. They stay in place and have great sound
0,"Edit to my original post, my son still loves them but the battery life is already going south. Too late to return them and he likes them enough he may still oder another pair. Headphones sound good battery life bad."
1,"Bought these February 2017.  They were fine, no complaints, until now, July 2018.  They lasted 16 months and are out of warranty.  The left side quit working, or cuts in and out intermittently.  May-be you just cannot expect anything to last much longer than the warranty but I am disappointed.  Having said that, I will probably buy another pair.  They are among the least expensive and while they worked they were fine."
1,I bought them for my husband. He has been looked for headphones when he does excise. He says they are working very good.
1,"just received them, charged unit took very little time . pairing was super easy and the sound was very good.<br /><br />let's see how long the charge  lasts"
1,"I was hesitant on buying these pairs, as I had never heard of the brand but every other review said they were good. My other concern was buying good wireless headphones that would not fall out of my ear and nicely wrap around my small ear. And these headphones delivered!! Immediately trying them out, the volume and noise cancelling ability was better than expected. This is a great buy!! Plus, for those concerned of the earpiece, it is adjustable to bend to you please, a surprising feature."
1,I have been using these for almost a year now. They are great great great! Better than the $200 beats if you ask me
1,They work. Great sound and Mic seems to work as well. No issue while running!
1,"It's a pretty good pair. The sound is great, it's comfortable, and the charge seems to last a pretty long time.<br />The box comes with all sorts of goodies too, like a carrying case, car charger, and two cables.<br /><br />My only complaint is that Skype calls lower the quality of the sound to like a phone call, but Discord doesn't.<br />Also, I can't figure out how to lower the volume of POWER ON and POWER OFF and BATTERY LOW. It's kind of a shock to hear that in your ear!<br /><br />But I still really enjoy the headphones~"
1,"Very satisfied. Sound quality is great so far, no problem with figuring out the buttons (as long as you read the instructions.) I will say the flap cover for the micro-USB charging port on the headphones is rather flimsy and may eventually break off, but personally that doesn't bother me.<br /><br />The fit is great though, I have no problem with the buds staying in my ears, and the hooks add extra support--I've had issues with buds before.<br /><br />Of course, I've only owned them for about a week as of now, so time will tell if they hold up to my satisfaction."
1,it works for me... hopefully it don't bonk out on me like the last one I ordered after a month of running...
1,Bluetooth works well with the distances I need (about 15 feet) and the batteries last as advertised. They fit very comfortably and come with two alternate sized earpieces so they will fit everyone. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend these.
1,Sound quality is great. Battery life is on point. They are very comfortable and have interchangeable ear pieces so they fit your ear size.
1,Good sound and is easy to connect to phone.
1,"If you're like me you are looking for a good set of Bluetooth, wireless earbuds. I previously went through 3 pairs of Motorola S11's. Each one would last about 2-3 months and then one earbud would lose sound. I really liked the Motorola because the earbuds were connected by a headband. So I wasn't so sure about these, at first.<br /><br />After about 4 months of using these I can honestly say I am very impressed and glad I bought them!<br /><br />Sound: Excellent! It the bass and tremble on these are appropriate and you can really hear the music clearly, but at the same time have the heavy bass.<br /><br />Range: I often use these working out or lawn work. I have my iPhone 7 in my pocket or to my side. I have yet to have any issue with connectivity or range.<br /><br />Battery: Awesome. I did not charge these for the first time until about a month after I bought them, which was about 8-10 hours of use. One issue, when connected to my iPhone 7, the batter never displays lower than 70% battery life. I found out the hard way this isn't accurate as the headphones dies while running a 5K. So far, this is the only issue I have had with these.<br /><br />Fit: These things fit wonderfully in my ears. They have a wrap your ears. I have yet to have any issue with the falling out or feeling uncomfortable.<br /><br />Durability: I have sweated and sweated while using these and have not had one issue.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend these. As a bonus, they are the same headphones Luke Cage wears on his Netflix show, so there's that."
0,"Not the best sound quality. too much treble not enough bass.  Ear loops have a wire inside the rubber that is annoying.  They lose their shape often and need  frequent adjustments.  Pulling them out of my pocket and they really get deformed.  Functionally, the units controls are well done and pairing was easy."
1,Great Headphones
1,"It is amazing for the prize. Sound quality is clear, almost noise cancelling. Even reads out the number from which u are getting the call.<br />Great product."
1,"It's great so far. However, when my phone is inside my back pocket, the bluetooth signal starts to crumble."
1,Good clean sound works grate in doors. Easy to pause music and answer incoming call which are announced with in coming phone number.  Not as good outside do to wind noise even in light breeze.
1,It’s good overall but I wish u can adjust the ear clip u put over the ears..
1,"They’re loud, bass is good. Only thing I would change is add a slider on the cord for adjustable straps so it’s not hanging/dragging on your neck. But for the price they’re good!"
1,"Very easy to setup, comes with a great case for storage along with all the connectors and accessories you'll need, and awesome sound...very cool!"
1,"I really enjoy these headphones. The sound is great for what I need. I mostly use them at the gym, but not being tethered by a cord to my audio device is such a life changing creation. haha I didn't realize how much I would enjoy them, but I am extremely happy for this purchase"
1,Everything I have dreamed of headphones being!
1,"It's easy to understand why these were marked &quot;Best Buy&quot;. A Very Good sound for the $, very light, comfortable, easy to pair and wear. They are not going to compete with $200. headphones so don't expect them to. One of the 3 sets of ear buds should fit your ears nicely and my bet is you will be more than happy with the sound at this price. Delivery was quick and all the extras make this a +, + buy."
1,Good quality and comfortable
0,Ordering twice and the 2 times the bluetoo not working. Very bad decision buy this
0,Charging doesn't work. Returning the product now..<br />Waste of time
1,So far so good. Just got them paired up to my phone and they work well and sound good.
1,You cannot beat the quality and comfort of these at this price point. Nice rich sound and great bass. Highly recommend
1,"I'm very happy with these headphones.  They came nicely packaged, with a carrying case, 3 different sizes of earbuds, charging cords (even a car charger!), and really nice instructions, laminated and easy to read and understand. I specifically chose them because I haven't been able to find any that are comfortable and stay in my ears.  These do!  And the fact that the controls aren't hanging on the connecting wire makes a big difference.  They stay in place.  The sound quality is fine, also."
1,So easy to connect to my Iphone and great noise cancellation. Just ordered two more pairs!!!
1,"So far the SENSO Head phones I purchased are working out great. I'm actually using them more than I thought I would.<br /><br />My intention was to use them for music while I was at the gym, which I do 4 days a week, but I also use them as my ear piece for my cell phone while I'm driving. People tell me they can clearly hear me and I can hear them so it works for me. The clarity in the audio and and the volume is not as issue. You can have them hi or very low. The buttons are easily accessible and not hard to figure out.<br /><br />The different sized ear buds are also great because we all have different sized ears of course. My only recommendation would be to include even a smaller ear bud. I'm using the smallest one and I could go for a smaller one ONLY because I personally don't like my ear completely plugged. I wear ear pieces for work everyday so it's a personal preference for me.<br /><br />I have no complaints about the headphones"
1,Received product ordered the first time and very happy with the sound quality of these headsets
1,"nice gadget, works great"
0,They beep and cut off for 5-6 seconds then come back on when listening to iPhone apple music
1,"Great  Bluetooth headphones for the price.  I have had these for a couple of months now and they continue to perform well.  My adult daughter and husband are constantly borrowing it.... I need to surprise them with their own pair...lol!  They are easy to use, stay in place and sound good.  If they last a year, it will be a nice surprise and I will become a loyal customer of the brand, only time will tell."
1,"These are by far the highest quality headphones I've ever purchased, they have amazing bass, it rattles my ears if I turn it up high enough, but remains audible, it gives me more range than advertised, over all they're amazing headphones, and I plan to buy more senso products"
0,Can no longer adjust volume. It's now stuck to the minimum.
1,"I love the Senso Bluetooth Headphones. As a daily cycle commuter and sports enthusiast, I like that they stay in my ears and provide good sound. When one earbud stopped working after 8 months of heavy use, SENSO provided great customer support in helping to resolve the problem."
1,Great for working out!
1,They are a little difficult to put in my ears but stay put very well. The sound is good.
1,Loving it.
1,These work well and deliver good sound.
0,"Disappointed that these claimed to be specialized for athletic use, yet biking and/or running will cause extreme wind noise in your ear. I also have regular 'ear-bud-only' wireless headphones that are perfect for biking, and don't have this issue. These are great for the gym but if you plan on moving outdoors, you are going to get louder wind that your music."
1,"Amazing range. I've had two other pair of Bluetooth earbuds, and both seemed okay, but the minute I so much as put my iPhone in my pocket the connection broke up. With these I can stroll into the next room without so much as a hiccup. And they can get plenty loud if you want them to. Like, really REALLY loud. A little heavy on the bass, so listening to podcasts can be a bit muddy, but if you like your music with plenty of thump, these are your new best friends.  Comes with a zippered hardcase, a couple of charger cables (one of which is a brilliant USB/mini-USB/Apple Lighting combo), a car adapter, and a nice selection of different sized ear-cushions, so if they're not quite comfortable for you right out the box, don't worry, they will be."
1,Great headphones! The sounds is nice and laud! Perfect for me!
1,"Great sound, comfortable, and secure during activities."
0,"They aren't made for everyone, they fall off your ear. The wire pulls away the ear piece. Let's say I'm still looking for a pair of headphones."
0,I was truly hoping that these ear buds would be &#34;The Ones&#34; so I could use them when I swam ... But they are so flimsy around my eras they won't stay on ....So regrettably I had to return them
1,"So far so good. I like the sound overall but I haven’t used them enough to see how long the battery holds it’s charge, etc."
1,Amazing price for the quality of these headphones.  I haven't had any issues with them.
1,"This is a pretty good and solid wireless headphone. I use it when I work out, because my wired headphones were always in the way. I don't really have any complaints about it, though it's good to know that these do not come charged. Charge them before you get to the gym."
1,Great gift for my son.... Loves that the charge is lasting days. Quality is holding up with his teenage activities....
1,"These ear buds are good quality. They come with 3 different bud sizes, a short charger, a long charger, and a round carrying case. The sound quality is pretty good and they fit well in my ears.  I've only used it at the most 1 1/2 hour at a time and then recharged so I can't speak to the duration of play time with one charge."
1,"Love these earbuds. Sound is good, long lasting, compact. Only issue is that the left one hurts my ear after a while."
1,So far so good. This are the first Bluetooth earbuds I have ever tried so I have nothing to compare them to. However I am very happy with the sound quality and comfort level. They are light but well made. So far I have gone running a few times and for a long bike ride and they stay in my ears perfectly and with no desxonection issues. I will update any developments in the future.
0,It won't turn on now
1,Arrived on time and as described. Daughter loves them!
1,"They are packaged extremely well and I really like how easy to use they are. I seem to have trouble keeping the left one in my ear, but perhaps I need to switch the size of earbud attachments. My only concern is that the User Guide says that I should have gotten a &#34;wire tie&#34; and I don't think that I did, unless I'm misunderstanding what it is. It looks like something that I would be able to wrap the earbuds around when placing in the case but I need them for traveling and running and don't feel like sending them back for that reason. Otherwise, so far, I really like them! (Have only used for music so far, no speaking on the phone)."
0,It worked well for a few months then the cover to the volume control fell off.<br />Now I'm unable to change the volume from the headphones.
1,Awesome these are very nice and worth the money but more.The sound is so nice
1,These are good ear buds but the chord gets stuck on you neck a lot...but well worth the money for sure
1,Good product. It's very easy to pair to my phone and start working right away. The music sound is pretty good and also very clear to the phone call. The Mic is a little weak but it's fine to me when I used it at home. I am satisfied and would recommend it.
1,I bought these headphones for exercising. They stopped working after a year.
0,stopped working after a month. dont waste your money
1,"Sound is great, battery life is amazingly long. I use these at work and love them. The only thing I wish is that the range was further than roughly 30 ft. Accessories are real great to have."
1,Awesome sound quality and no complaints from the wife when I talk on the phone with her through the senso headphones. Thanks!!!! So good I bought a second pair for my daughter and she loves them!!
1,I had a lot of trouble with the bud falling out and had to buy different pads.  Other than that it works great.
1,"Had them for a few days, took them running. Very satisfied. Quality of sound is much better than I expected. Definitely worth the money."
1,Excellent product ! Just whar I expected !
0,Great sound and quality but will no longer hold a charge
1,"These were exactly what I ordered and wanted.  They are light weight, but have a great fit and work great for my walking.  I was very pleased with the sound quality.  Ordered others after I received mine to give as gifts"
1,"I've only had the head phones for a week.  In the past week, I've used twice.  So far it has been good...hoping it will continue to perform well."
1,Very comfortable and great sound quality. Amazing product especially for the price
1,"so far so good!  I've used them for about two months.  They're comfy, stay in my ears, good sound.  Have been using them at gym."
1,"I just received my new wireless earbuds.  The packaging and directions are great.  I got paired up with my Iphone and my Podcast, music, and then phone call were all great.  The recipient of the phone call said the voice quality was great.  Thanks... This customer loves his ActivBuds."
0,"I'm going to give them a two because they worked for a few months. I dropped them when I was trying to put them on my ears. They worked for a few days afterward but the sound was distorted and spotty. Eventually, they quit working all together. Find a better pair."
0,"I've tried all of the earbud sizes  provided with these headphones, but they still refuse to stay in place when I am using the cross-trainer."
0,"Returning after trying for all of ten minutes. If you can't have your phone in your pocket, then it is useless.  It has maybe three feet range and cuts out past that.  I would have given no stars if was possible."
1,"Didn't realize how many things came with the ear buds; hard side case, multiple ear buds, several charging cables, and cord adjustment. It came with a charge so I  could pair it to my phone and listen to music right away. So many features on the unit itself. Love them."
1,These headphones are really great for the price. It was easy to connect and the sound is excellent. They are also really comfortable to wear.  I highly recommend them and plan to get another pair for my daughter.
1,easy to pair and works great... need to use them during my workout but so far I love the ease of use and the sound quality... great price too!
1,These are great.  Good battery life and inexpensive for what you get.  Quality sound and comfortable.  Solid packaging and nice amount of accessories included.
1,Love them
1,"Just arrived and just set them up. Setup is easy and voice responses are a great feature. Sound is very good and they are very comfortable. Going to take them to the gym soon for a spin.<br /><br />Sorry, my earlier review was premature. They died after 5 months. However, I called Invokek and they were very helpful in sending me a replacement set, so I am keeping a fairly high rating."
1,"Works great, just wish the indicator light was just a little bit easier to see"
1,They sounded great. I had some issues with the product but they were promptly replaced without question.
1,I ordered the headphones for my husband. He loves them!
1,I love the fact that I am no longer attached to my phone when I walk in the swimming pool with headphones on.
0,Ugh- returned and alternate brand purchased that actually worked
1,Very good quality
1,Fit perfect! But there's no bass to the music. It almost sounds like there's some static to it
1,"I purchased these SENSO wireless headphones from Amazon less than a week ago and can't believe the sound quality, as well as the fit and workmanship. Very impressed and satisfied customer that has recommended these headphones to my family and friends. I'm also very impressed with the Senso customer support team. I hope others purchase these headphones, and enjoy them as much as I do."
1,Its good but when you run on a treadmil it will fall off your ears or wobble.
0,"True HD Fidelity Sound?<br /><br />No way.  These remind me of the time I received a counterfeit pair of Motorola SD-9HD.  The sound quality is substandard.<br /><br />I'm guessing anyone who rated these above a two hasn't listened to music through true high fidelity headphones/earbuds.  I'll admit that I may be biased given that my home and car audio systems are top of the line.<br /><br />Either way, I've listened to MANY better sounding earbuds than these.  The attempt to extract more bass from a tiny speaker makes the sound muddy and diminishes the highs.  I realize they aren't expensive and perhaps my sights were set too high."
1,"""I had an earlier pair which I misplaced, so I bought a new one. The old pair had pauses at the beginning of playback. The new set has no pauses. Comfortable, work well. Come with a convenient case."""
0,"Purchased these headphones a month ago and was pretty happy with them.  I purchased them to use with my peloton, they connected easily and the sound was pretty good.  They weren't very comfortable but I was getting used to them.  Last week I plugged them in to charge and when I came back to use them there was no power indicator light and they would not turn back on.  Seems as if they just died while charging.  I called Senso support and they just told me to return them.  Pretty disappointing, probably won't be buying another pair."
1,They sound great and stay on when I run!
1,My ears are small and this was a bit uncomfortable at first but it’s ok now
1,"Perfect! Exactly what I was looking for. Had them for about 2 weeks and so far no problems whatsoever. Really good sound, especially for the price. I was nervous they would be tinny since they are inexpensive, but they sound pretty dang good. They’re obviously GREAT for the gym!!! The extras it came with are also wonderful!! Thank you!<br /><br />Update: 6 months later and still in love! The battery life is incredible."
0,"Came damaged and never fit my ear properly and it was an uncomfortable fit and the sound was not all to great, and the charging that came along with it was cheap and only worked for a week, don’t recommend."
1,So far these headphones are good.
1,sound is terrific . I had some trouble with pairing  I had to call the customer support line. The person on the line was very helpful. All around great product and experience. highly recommend
1,I use them while I mow my yard. They cancel the sound of the mower. As much as you can cancel the sound of a big Zero Turn mower. Now you can destroy your hearing with a little good music.
1,These headphones are well made and have great sound quality. I'm enjoying no longer getting entangled in wires!
1,"I haven't had theses long enough to speak to durability, but so far very pleased with quick battery charge, ease of BT synch, functionality, quality of audio, and comfort.  Very stable for working out.  Hopefully there will be a way to get replacement buds when the time comes that I need them."
1,I can not believe these are as good as they are for the price. Can't be beat.
1,Bluetooth headset sounds amazing. Everyone can hear me with clarity and the music quality is out of this world!
1,Great Bluetooth Headphones. Will buy again for my family.
1,"Very satisfied with this purchase.  Sound quality very good for this price range.  Very surprised with the range between my phone and the headset before the signal<br />Cuts out (almost forgot my phone a few times). Would like it if when the headphones were powered on, a voice alert of remaining battery power was added to the power on/off alert"
1,Really great sound. I am surprised that these are so good for being such an inexpensive product
1,The senso earbuds have a great quality sound and easy to use on the treadmill. I don’t have to worry about my cords getting caught on the machine anymore!
1,Bought these for my husband and he absolutely loves them!  Great price.
1,Very good product! Functions as described! Overall functionality of this product performs well. I am greatly appreciative for this product to arrive on-time and without delay. Packaging & overall product presentation is clean and concise. Product arrived new and without any defects. Highly recommend seller!
1,"I ordered this as a gift for a friend who goes to the gym almost daily. At the time he received it, he was still using a standard wired pair of earbuds, and I noticed how tangled they would get during his workouts. Ever since he received this product, he hasn’t used anything else. It stays out of sight and out of mind while he’s lifting, and is a great value for the price."
1,Great headphones!
1,"The fit is not too comfortable pressing on my tragus and on my last walk, there was some interference or loss of connection to my ipod where the music was cutting out and clipping. I wanted to give a better review because they are lightweight, battery life is as advertised and would hold on well for more intense workouts."
1,I was very happy with my purchase. They are very lightweight and have excellent audio quality. The case is a big plus in helping keep my earbuds in good condition. They are a bit bulky but everything else overall is great.
1,These headphones are amazing!
1,They work fine but only last for about 6 hours.
1,Great! Good quality materials and the audio sound is very good. Very light and comfortable on the ears as well. Great value!
1,Inexpensive with great sound. For the price is pretty nice. The product fits in my ear perfectly.
1,Arrived on time . So far so good. Really nice sound quality and a sharp bass. Earpieces are very comfortable. High quality especially for the price Would recommend to anyone in the market for a nice quality set without the sticker shock of other products out there.
1,The headphones sound ok but I noticed they were tinny with no bass.  I had to play around with the equalizer on my Android music app to get a better sound.  I'm using a Pixel XL with PowerAmp.<br /><br />The case is nice and solid but it's bulky.  No way is the average person going to carry that in their pocket.  It a circular case with a 3 1/2&#34; diameter and is 1 1/2&#34; thick.<br /><br />I really like when you turn these off it makes a voice announcement in the buds.  My prior headset it was always hard to tell if I shut them down or not because there was no verbal indicator.<br /><br />I was disappointed that they don't use a USB-C port for charging.  When are these manufactures going to realize USB-C is the new standard.  There is a red LED on the headset to indicate when it's charging.
1,Great for work out. Doesn’t hurt the ear.
1,No rewind or fast forward option. Other than that good headphones.
1,"Had a problem with my original Senso headphones.  I contacted them and they were great to work with.  After trying a few things to fix my first pair of Senso's that didn't work, they were quick to replace the pair with a new set and they work great.  I know of three other people that have these and they work flawlessly.  Now that I got a replacement pair, I'm in that group as well.  They were great and sound great.  Thank you customer support."
1,"4 star for quality, battery life, price. I can't give it 5 stars as a runner and cyclist because there's no good way to run only one ear. I like to keep one ear open for situational awareness. Also the wire clasp is needed to keep the cord from catching when you turn your head. Set it tight before you start and it works pretty good. Good variety of ear inserts. Fits securely and comfortably. Passive noise canceling is good, but not good enough to use as selling feature. EQ is favorable to low and low mid frequencies. Lacks a little of the crisp high frequencies but no one really appreciates that these days 😑 My opinion, I've spent $60 on plenty worse headsets. It slams for the price. Buy it"
1,For the price they work pretty good except for the battery life.......doesn't last as long as advertised
0,I had these 3 months and they quit working.  Very disappointing....
1,I was truly amazed with the sound quality.  Great product
0,"I received these yesterday, and after charging them went for a run. I was using them paired to a Sandisk Clip Sport Plus. As with other headphones I've tried, if I have the Sandisk player attached to my waistband I have constant cut-outs and skips. If I put the Sandisk player in an armband, it seems to eliminate most of the skips and cut-outs. The biggest problem I have with these is the large round piece just outside the soft rubber tip. It just does not fit into my ear well at all, and causes almost instant pain. I had red spots in both ears after just a few minutes of wearing them. This discomfort will keep me from being able to use these headphones. Sound-wise, they were fine, although they seemed pretty bassy at the cost of having almost no high end. I had to put my Sandisk player's equalizer on &#34;Full Treble&#34; in order to make it sound decent, and then of course I had no bass!<br />Added Feb 27, 2018 - I have continued to try to use these while running, and it just hasn't worked out. In addition to the discomfort, when running into wind, the wind noise completely drowns out the music. Running into the wind is a constant in Oklahoma, I could literally put my hands in front of the headphones to block the wind, and the wind sound would disappear. Definitely these are not a good option if you run in windy conditions!"
1,muy poco volumen
0,"It's the second time those earphones stopped working, in less than two months"
1,Great headphones at a great price!
1,Worked well but would not stay in my ears
1,I've had them for about three weeks now. They sound great. The right ear started making weird noises today but it's not constant. Came with a lot of stuffed. Very pleased
1,"Edit:approximately a year since I bought it. Still flawless. Best bluetooth headphones I've ever used. Highly recommend<br /><br />My review:after about 1 month of buying it:<br />&#34;Until now , it is really good. Connects real fast , and the sound is clear. I like it.&#34;"
1,These are great! Comes in a great licase and works well!
1,"Easy to charge,to use.<br />Works great,no issues whatsoever."
1,Great for working out and they withstood the heat of my local gym’s sauna.
1,Nice price
1,"Great sounding and fairly comfortable, though I had to spend some time fiddling with the different bud tips to find the right fit. Battery lasted for 3 days of my daily commute (about an hour each way). I do get a lot of wind noise when it is breezy. Overall a solid choice at a good price."
0,"They are made of high quality materials. However any amount of interference between the device and the Bluetooth source usually cuts off the music, audio stutters and information is lost. Even just the act of bending down at the waist was enough to consistently disconnect my pairing and the sound would go to shit.  More disappointing is that any objects between you and the device will cut audio. A work desk. Sitting forward. Kneeling down.  The range is terrible, can't hold signal from my head to my pants pocket... garbage..<br />  but when it is connected how ever briefly it sounds pretty good.  Written from phone. Typos"
1,Very comfortable and good sound quality
1,Getting the correct fit of the earbuds and keeping them in place during workout is sometimes a challenge.
1,"UPDATE:  Switching from 3 stars to 5.  See comment from SENSO customer support.<br /><br />I really like these earbuds.  I've always had trouble getting buds that fit and these fit the bill perfectly.  The sound is great (I'm not an audiophile).  It performs pretty much exactly as the product description says, although 8 hours of play time might be a stretch.  I haven't timed it, but I don't think I get 8 hours of playback.<br /><br />So, why only 3 starts you ask?  Well, 8 months later, I'm hearing some very mild &#34;skipping&#34; during playback.  The bluetooth connection seems to be a little off, so every 10 to 20 seconds I get a pause and restart as the connection to my iPhone 7.  The pause is extremely quick.  If I was just listening to music, I might not even notice it.  But, I use these earbuds when I'm working (software development) for background noise to help me concentrate on my work.  But, with these bluetooth hiccups, I end up focusing more on the quick pauses than my work.  I know the problem is with the earbuds because if I switch to my bluetooth speaker and play my music out loud, there are no such pauses.<br /><br />Now, don't let this review scare you off.  It's very possible that this issue is limited to my pair.  These are still the best earbuds I've ever owned.  They're not super expensive, so 8 months of problem free use is fair.  I just can't give 4 or more stars to a product that didn't maintain its initial quality for at least a year."
1,"I'm a very active 73 year old man who loves to workout, ride motorcycles, ski ect. I lost my LG infinim bluetooth head phones. I wanted something that I could use to workout, ski and ride my dirt motorcycle. I read the reviews and bought the Senso active buds. I really like the sound quality and volume that I can get with these Sensos.<br /><br />I have no connection to the company. I just wanted to let people my impressions."
1,These headphones are great !!! Excellent product for the price. They fit nicely in the ear. The sound is very good. The range is excellent.<br />They come with a car charger. Very happy with them.
1,"It works good. Easy to pair, sound quality is decent. battery life is kinda crap. Also, it doesn't properly show the percentage of the device. It goes from 100%, then to 90%, then to 50%, and then 30% and then it dies. Battery life and now showing proper percentage and my biggest issue with this sometimes, overall nice inexpensive headphones with some flaws."
1,Awesome! They stay in the ear! I put a 31 mile test of 6 different runs with them. I sweat a lot and not a problem happened once with them. Week 1 went great!
1,"I have had my Senso Wireless for about a month and I use them every day.  I am thoroughly impressed with their performance.  They hold a charge for several days, are easy to operate, and all the accessories/case were a great bonus.  I had a small issue with connecting mine today and contacted customer service. I figured that since it was a Saturday, my email would get answered in a few days.  Within an hour, I had an answer and was given easy to follow instructions to reset my buds.  Excellent product and even better customer service.  I am very happy with my purchase and will not hesitate to order more as gifts."
1,"These play music (as opposed to phone call), and also hold their charge, well.<br />After some use the review is very positive."
1,Good quality headphones. Way too much bass for me. Vocals are completely covered by the bass.
1,"great quality, durable, and looks awesome."
1,Great sounding. Wish the ear buds were a little bigger.
1,"Hi these were recommended to me. I was about spend way too much money on the top brands. Set up time easy, great packaging, superb quality and sound, very pleased and will buying my children a pair. Thank you..."
1,Work great!
0,The microphone doesn’t work and the sound quality is meh. Connectivity is sketchy at best.
1,I am glad with this quality good.
1,not bad for price
1,love these!
1,"Amazing features and accessories at this price point. Very well designed, protected and packed. Prompt and knowledgeable support via email. There are 3x in-ear sizes for best fit. Very soft and comfortable materials. Can control volume on the right earbud. After a bit of fidgeting with bluetooth settings, the dual pairing (e.g. on a phone and a laptop) works seamlessly. An awesome feature."
1,"Got these over a year ago and they are still working like when i first got them. The only issue is sometimes they dont connect to my phone right away and i have to turn them off and on again for it connect. I work out maybe 3-4 times a week and for up to an hour and a half and only have to charge these maybe once in a week, sometimes in two weeks. they are definitely worth the money would never spend the amount of money it cost for beats. the other thing is that in the title it says 'noise cancelling' but i can still hear background noise while at the gym<br /><br />Update: Sept 2nd 2019<br />These bishes still work! Havent notice any change in the battery or sound quality since the first day i got them!! Def will buy again if these suckers ever die<br /><br />January 28 2021- still working! what the heck!"
1,"When I run i have problems keeping the headphones in the ears, the sound is ok"
1,"I didn't expect much for the low price, just needed a wireless earbud  that would wrap around the ear so it wouldn't fall off.. They were louder than I expected with pretty good sound to boot. I mainly use it when doing yardwork, and this is exactly what I wanted. Also, I have read reviews about the wire slack flopping around, well this one came with a wire tie! looks like these guys really listen to what customers want, Great job!<br />Thanks Senso!"
1,Absolutely love them !!!
1,"Third try with Bluetooth head phones and these are the best ever, great sound, cancels out everything, I love them!"
1,My first pair of wireless headphones. I love the fact that it comes with different size ear plugs. Highly recommend this product.
1,Stopped working after six weeks but they sounded great during that time. Great customer service by Invotek and they are sending out new pair. I'll update review once I can confirm the new pair lasts.
0,They stopped working after 41 days.<br />It's too late to return them.<br />I should have trusted the other bad reviews.
1,"UPDATE: After speaking with the Support Team, they are sending me another one. I'll update later if the headphones don't work; however, A+ for support.<br /><br />I'm very sorry for this rating. Truly I am. I loved these headphones when I first received them. They worked perfectly (unlike any Bluetooth headphones I used before); however, about three weeks ago, they started to randomly turn off or lose connection. I thought it might be my phone, but it happened with my laptop as well. In the middle of the video/music, it turns off. Or sometimes when I tap the multifunction button to pause music, it will shut the headphones off altogether. (I'm not holding in the button. I'm only tapping it.) Sometimes even tapping the volume buttons turns off the headphones. I have factory reset the headphones four times now to no avail.<br /><br />What's wrong with these headphones?"
1,Awesome!!!<br />Great product! Simple and extremely comfortable headphones while doing cardio or lifting weights at the gym!<br />Highly recommend!<br />Talked about the product at work and 3 of my co workers ordered some soon after!
1,"Love these new headphones. Took about 2 hrs to charge out of the box last night.  That matched what the instructions stated.  I bought them  because I did not want to  use my expensive BOSE headphones on the beach on vacation.  Paired first phone but had problem with second phone until I realized the headphones were still connected to first phone.  Once I turned off first connection, they easily pared to second phone.  Lots of &#34;goodies&#34; come with product: . +12v car charger, extra ear pieces, duel charger cable for lightening and micro usb connector, standard micro usb to usb charger cable.  They fit great compared to Apple ear buds which constantly fall out of my ears.  These Senso headphones fit over the ear, are very light wt.  and are very comfortable.  Sound was fine.  On/Off and Volume buttons very functional.  Not sure how long the play time will be but so far they are great"
0,I have had these headphones for about three months. The sound is great for the price and I was really happy until yesterday. I was mid conversation using my headphones and the microphone went out. I have tried multiple times but the microphone just stopped working. I can still use them as headphones but have to take them out and grab the phone anytime I have a phone call which is annoying. I hope this is not a common thing but at least the earbuds still work I guess.
0,"Not good for serious runners. Constant readjusting required once you start sweating. For walking and weights they are fine. Sound is fine, bass kinda lame so I would change the EQ on iPhone settings."
1,"Product performs as expected given the price. Does connect multiple devices, however there are minor issues with making this seamless unlike some higher quality tech products. Sizing of the loop around ear doesn't fit snugly but what can you expect with one-size-fits-all $20 headphones. Holds a charge well for now but will able to see any obsolescence over time."
1,Nice headphones that sound good and you cannot beat the price! I do get a bit of wind noise when outside. They stay in my ears way better than the Apple ear buds. Shipping was fast.
1,Finally. Bluetooth headphones that are comfortable AND stay in place when I run.
1,"Bought 2 the s250's in Feb of 2018. Here we are in August of 2019 and both pair still perform flawlessly! My husband listens to audio books all day at work, 5 days a week. About 4 months ago, his battery began only holding 6 hours of charge instead of 8... but hell, they were over a year old at that point. My pair are used for a couple hours at a time for Pandora mostly, while I tend to my yard. I drip sweat like crazy while mowing, weed eating, washing the cars, pulling weeds, etc. They never slip and never fail me. Can't hear anything but the music, either. I prefer the foam ear covers because I have really small ear canals, and even the smallest set of silicone ones would make my ear ache after an hour. My husband prefers the medium silicone ones. I also us the buds as my hamds-free for the car a couple times a week. Sound is crisp, clear, and loud. I recommend only putting in 1 while in the car so you can still listen for emergency vehicles. All in all, these ear buds are still in excellent condition after a year and a half. However, I will be upgrading because they didn't have blue yet when we bought ours. If you need a great, durable set(I have 4 kids) for a great price, definitely get these.<br /><br />My only con is that the metal plate for your phone to magnetized to the dashboard has some real weak and crappy adhesive. Get you some gorilla glue!"
1,"perfect in the beginning but after a while, maybe if the battery is low they tend to cut in and out even if my phone is in my hand. I still use them daily and like them a lot but sometime it does that."
1,very powerful and well built.
1,"I was so skeptical of this headphone. Upon using this senso headphone, I am totally impressed<br />about the quality especially for it's price. I would buy this product again."
1,First set I received they would not charge set them back and got another. So far they are great comfortable to wear sound is good and easy to use.
0,They’re cheap and they sound cheap. Sometimes lose connection to my phone. Next time I’ll spend more money to get better quality and just be more careful with my headphones.
1,comfortable with good sound quality
1,"Great Headphones! Just like the Beats by Dre, just cheaper! smartest headphone purchase of my life"
1,Good sound and comfortable as well.  Instructions are easy to follow and it comes with an awesome case and an extra iPhone cord which is actually better than my original cord !
1,Great sounding ear buds! Bought another pair for my son and he loves them!
1,They are awesome!! I will never buy anything else.
1,The Bluetooth range isnt the greatest but once connected the sound quality is great. They stay in my ears and they are comfortable to wear for a long periods of time.  It's a good option for the price.
1,very convenient and great for noise blockage and working out
1,Great value! Best product on market for sport headphones under $40
0,They only last 5 month.
1,The fit is perfec and they stay in place well. They are pounder and the sound in very crisp comated to other blue tooth head phones I have used.
1,Versatile. Works with all products easily....
1,"A little bulky,  but you get what you pay for"
1,Amazing for the price!<br />Half the price of my Wireless skullcandies and just as good I am stoked only 20 bucks sounds great comes with lots of extras worth the buy!
1,This headset is AWESOME!!!! could not believe my ears; crystal clear sound and the bass....JUST WOW!!!!
1,Great headphones great price! They are very comfortable and I really like the design of the headphones and the way they fit snuggly into my ear. I have owned headphones that cost 5X the price of these and would hands down pick the Senso’s over them without hesitation!
1,"Very handy, easy to use, great battery life.  Very happy, especially considering the price."
1,Great headphones for the price compared to the $200 ones
1,"Sounds great, last quite a long time, stay in your ear well but could have a more universal ear rap as a posed to OSFA, maybe a flexible rubberized wire. Only real down fall is when you get a call the caller has a hard time hearing you speak and if your outside and the wind blows, It amplifies the noise right on your ear. But overall awesome for the gym"
1,I love Bluetooth headphone. They charged very fast.
0,I have used both ear inserts and they both have the same result. While running I can hear air coming into my ears. These do not seal the ear tight to prevent the air noise.
1,Got these on April 12th and loved them until the left ear stopped working 2 days ago hence my orig 3 stars... however I contacted the seller and got an immediate response as to how I shd troubleshoot it... since that didn't wk they IMMEDIATELY replaced the item.... I highly recommend the item and seller!
1,the only thing I want to know is how to connect to Alexa Dot and how do you call out. States it can do so.
1,These headphone has amazing sound quality to be so light.  They are perfect for jogging or when you just what to listen the music you love.
1,"I really wanted these to be the answer to all my previous earphones that failed in one way or another—but nope, I guess nothing’s perfect.<br /><br />I sweat profusely when I run and I bought these not only bc I wanted sweatproof earphones, but earphones that stayed in my ears while running. They stayed put for the most part (the space between the hook that goes over the ear and the actual earbud is too large so the hook really serves no purpose).<br /><br />As far as the waterproof part goes, its not. I mean unless sweatproof and waterproof are completely different things in this context. The first time I used these (2 days ago), they stopped working after about 50 minutes of running and I wasn’t even done running. The earphones were fully charged right before I ran too. They didn’t respond to any of my button pushing. So my assumption was that it stopped working bc of all the sweat that dripped all over them. Once they were dry, they worked again.<br /><br />So either I got bad earphones or they just don’t perform for those who sweat hella. I think I’m just gonna go back to the basic earbuds. Those work with sweat."
1,Speedy delivery! Great product
1,"I've only used these a few times but I already like some of the features better than my Powerbeats (5 times the price) which fell apart shortly after my one year warranty expired.  If these last as long, I'll be thrilled with the value."
1,"I had previously purchased an older model and I feel that the older models ear loops are more comfortable: flatter, softer, and more flexible. Granted the older version's loop is thicker, just has a better feel. Other than that, such a quality buy. I've had two co-workers that purchased these and love them.<br />I can also attest to their water proof-ness. I was paddleboarding and had my Sensos in my pocket and they did get dunked a few times. Put them on and they worked fine.<br /><br />Update: While comfortable, and waterproof, these aren't rolling chair wheel proof, as just now the swivel wheels on my chair just demolished on earbud."
1,They were so easy to set up and they work really well!  They were here in two days!  Thank you
0,"Do not buy! Does not work!<br />The headphones will not stay connected to any Bluetooth device—phone, tablet, computer—for longer than 10 seconds, and then it keeps trying to reconnect and then disconnect every 5 - 10 seconds.<br />I reached out to the company by responding to both of their automated post-delivery customer service emails, explaining that the product did not work and they just ignored my emails. So, apparently, they do not actually offer any customer service.<br />Do not buy this product if you ever hope to have a pair of headphones that works, or if you want to actually talk to someone about replacing a dysfunctional product."
1,This pair only survived 4 months before one side of the earphones shorted out. Now it's just all static. Up until then they sounded good.
1,"I totally love these. They stay in my ears, the sound quality is good (I am not an audiophile, but I've been pleased), and they come with a lot of accessories. Drawbacks: the &#34;low battery&#34; voice repeats forever until you plug them in (though the charge is generally good enough to get me through a day); they are hard to find if you put them down somewhere (user error!); sometimes the connection is a little wonky if my phone is too far away or there is some large metal object around. If I keep my phone in my pocket or purse, no problem. I listen to a lot of podcasts while cooking/cleaning/exercising, and the wirelessness (and fit) is just fantastic. Another plus/minus: they really block out outside sounds (for me) while playing something -- so I make sure to tell my family I won't be able to hear them."
1,"Fantastic sound, sturdy design, and they went above and beyond with accessories (including a set of earplug-material earbud tips which are absolutely fantastic)"
1,"Great stereo seperation!  I have been using earbuds that didn't have any support keeping them in place, so I especially like having the earbud held in place.  So far, the headphones have performed great!"
1,Have
1,These are the 3rd style of 'budget' earphones I've tried.  These I'm keeping!!  They are very comfortable. The sound is really great with strong bass and clear midrange and highs.  They feel and sound like a much more expensive pair of earphones.
1,Sounds great for music during my run but phone calls are muffled
1,"Because the feedback was so good I order two pair, one for myself and one for my husband.  We both love them.  Our main use is for listening to music while at the gym.  The sound is great and the battery life so far has been very good too.  I have already had others ask about the product and how I like them.  I highly recommend them!!!"
1,"Unbelievable!  Easy pairing, great sound and perfect fit. I've always had trouble with earbuds but these sit right into the ear and I haven't had to move them once!  Normally, I am fiddling with earbuds constantly to achieve a good fit and sound.  These rival Bose at 1/5 the price!"
1,"Great ear buds! Sound great,  and very durable!"
1,Great sound &amp; I love the bonus items that were sent along with the headphones.
1,"I purchased this for my daughter who is a freshman at the university here in Texas. I asked her how is the product, hHer comment was 'they're really good. i ran with them yesterday'.  That says it all."
1,"This is the (last thank God) out of 4 attempts at buying good sounding, comfortable, durable, bluetooth buds! These have Great sound, they are comfy and stay in!! Yay Senso, yall knocked it out of the park!!<br /><br />Now 4 weeks later---- the only downsides are: the range.  seems to only be about 10', the 2nd thing is where the &#34;controls are &#34;plug-ins&#34; are.<br />For those reasons, i gave 4 stars instead of my previous 5"
1,"good sound and reception, no distortion with the wind and comfortable."
0,"Great price but these just don't last. this worked great for 5 months but now, they're useless. It shows that it's fully charged but when you try to connect NOTHING happens. It's as if the batteries have died because it makes no sound and no lights come on. However, when you plug it into the charger it says it's fully charged :-("
0,These headphones stopped connecting to my phone after 1 months of use
1,"FOR THE PRICE...these have been amazing! Fit is great....stay in during running or working out activities, pairs easily with multiple devices and auto-switches with ease. My only knock is that for some weird reason i have not solved They go out on me when I use them outside mowing the lawn....yes, that's right only when I am doing this activity do i see issues."
0,"I'm really surprised how many positive reviews these headphones have gotten.  Maybe I got a lemon?  I find the audio quality to be WAY too bass-heavy and muddy, and the noise-cancelling feature completely lacking.  I primarily listen to headphones when I work (in a loud environment), and my old $40 LG headphones worked much better to drown out surrounding noise, not to mention sit comfortably in my ears without falling out with the slightest jostle. These Senso's seemed ok for music, but listening to any audio books, or podcasts (especially if the audio volume fluctuates), or any spoken word sounded like Charlie Brown's parents.  Another annoying feature is that you can't use the headphones while they charge.  This may not be important to most people, but I will occasionally have one headphone in at night so I can listen to music or podcasts without disturbing my partner.  It would be useful to be able to use them while charging, so that the next day I can start with a full battery.  Anyway, like I said maybe I got a lemon, but I will for sure be returning these."
0,"I LOVED these earbuds when they first arrived.  Great sound for my nightly runs, comfortable when I switched out the earpiece, nothing but good things to say.<br /><br />ONE MONTH in, the left earbud doesn't work.  And it isn't merely silent.  The sound will suddenly flash into my ear like a jolt to my system, with no warning or pattern.  Alternately, at other random intervals, I will get bursts of static.  LOVELY.<br /><br />While they are cheap, I expected them to last longer than 1 month."
1,Quality sound and materials. Bonus for the ear customization!
1,I have only had these for a couple of days.  So far so good.  Comfortable fit.  Blue light that blinks every few seconds is a little annoying.  I would buy this product again
1,"Great price! Box comes with car charger, and the charging cable for iPhone. Such a great deal and they sound great and charge lasts through over a week of daily workouts."
1,"Just got the headphones for ipone 7. I purchased based on the price and advertised 8 hour battery.  For the price I am very happy, comfortable to wear at the Jersey Shore ran for about 4 or 5 hours of play.  all functions worked great, sound is also very good.  After each use washed the salt air off charged them<br />ready to use again. Very happy with the purchase."
1,"So far so good. Inexpensive, they sound great and they stay in my ears pretty well while I'm jogging or cycling."
1,Awesome headphones! Great quality and battery life!
1,Excellent product.  Perfect for gym use.  Impervious to sweat and moisture.  Very good sound but you can still hear what is going on around you which is my preference in the gym.
1,"The Senso Bluetooth Headphones are great headphones. They sound great, are nice and loud, have good bass, and fit relatively well.<br />Pros: 8 Hours battery life. Wireless. Loud. Nice bass. Not flimsy. Quality plastic. Includes 2 chargers- 2 micro usb, car charger, 1 lightning apple charger, carrying case, multiple earbuds, and a warranty.<br />Cons: Not well balanced. Needs an anchor in the middle to keep from flying all over. The over the ear hooks fit on one side and are loose on the other* (really depends on how big your ears are). Takes around 15+ seconds to connect to phone (could be my phone but previous headphones never took that long to connect and were always instant).<br /><br />SHOULD YOU BUY IT??!?!?!? Yes. You can not find a better deal than this for what it comes with and how well it product is. If they break, make sure you registered them online because then you are covered by a 1 year warranty. Hope this review helps. Would rate 4.5 stars out of 5 but thats not an option.<br /><br />Update: dropped these in a mop bucket filled with soapy water. They were completely submerged. After pulling them out i turned them off to let them dry. These things are 100% water proof. They work perfectly. I was worried that I'd have to use my warranty but i didnt. 5/5 stars no doubt"
1,"Great product, easy registration"
1,"sound quality is good, comfortable to wear. lost 1 star because when i had it around my neck the other night (was not in my ears), it came off my neck twice in one night. Getting out of the car it just came off my neck. Might have got caught on my seatbelt, but twice in one night to almost lose them was a bit much."
1,Good quality buds for the price
1,Sound quality is great and they are super easy to hang on the ear!!  The carry case is a good feature as well.  I love the car charger too!! That helps a ton if you are in a hurry and forgot the charge them.  Keep up the good work guys!
1,"The sound quality is decent. Much better than the Phaiser BHS-730 I got as well. However, the person on the other line has a hard time hearing me sometimes and I have to constantly adjust the earphones and wire. A bit of a shame because they look nice."
1,"good sound quality, and comfortable to wear.  The hooks that go around your ear and flexible, so that makes them a lot easier to wear."
1,I’m so happy to finally find a pair of headphones that don’t fall out of my ears when I’m working out and start to get sweaty (sorry tmi). It did take a while and a lot of trial and error to figure out how to properly “install” them in my ears for the first few times but once you get the hang out it they are awesome! My one complaint is that after wearing them for a few hours (which doesn’t happen too often) my ears have started to get a little sore holding them in. I was worried they would be too bulky but it hasn’t seemed to be an issue! Love the easy commands and phone control through the earbuds.
1,"So I finally got these and OMG the sound quality is amazing!  Lightweight, easy setup, and clear sound.  Strong bass.  I haven't used it for talking on the phone yet, but I didn't but them for that either.  I'm SUPER excited about these."
0,I was excited to get these headphones but upon wearing them they are entirely too large for my ears and I don't have small ears. The loop part that goes around your ear doesn't even touch my ear and the smallest bud doesn't fit in my ear canal. I'm very disappointed as they seemed so promising. I searched on Amazon for a 'contact seller' link but couldn't find one. I'm writing this in hopes that the seller will reach out to me and allow me to return them for a refund.
0,"I am really disappointed with how fragile these headphones really are. I have used these TWICE, and the volume is already distorted. Be careful not to pickup by the chord, as they are loosely seated into each earbud. The chords loosening will make the (already mediocre) volume worse. I am VERY particular about how I handle my equipment, and by no means used this piece past normal &#34;wear and tear&#34;.. I would save yourself the time and money and just invest in an established brand of headphones. Goodluck!"
1,"I had them just over a year. Use them primarily for the gym. I always put them back in their case after use, but recently a wire has started poking through the wire sleeve. Going to pick a different brand as a replacement.<br /><br />Pros<br />-connects easily via bluetooth<br />-sound quality is good enough (primarily listen to edm and rap)<br />-no issues with battery life<br /><br />Con<br />-for some reason the ear ring is extremely large and won’t fit<br />-broke after a year<br />-the sound can be too loud and unable to turn it down any lower"
1,Awesome! These headphones work great. Just received them and I was surprised by the quality and performance.<br />I love them. I told my friends about them.
0,"These were great....while they worked. I bought a pair and about 6 months later they just stopped working. I tried all the tricks they gave me but nothing. I figured it was a defective pair and the warranty covered getting a new pair. So the company sent me a new pair, super easy and quick. The second pair stopped working a lift over a year after I got them. Same problem- just stopped. I emailed the company, this time I was over a year so the warranty didn’t cover it. They were quick to respond, but only offered a 5% discount as consolation. I am choosing not to use the coupon code. I guess I shouldn’t expect products to last very long, then the company wouldn’t make any money."
0,Really bad  sound quality
1,I bought these for my husband and they are awesome!! They cancel out all noise and fit well inside your ear without falling out. I loved them as well so I had to buy me a pair for running. I fight my Beats the entire time I run and these are surprisingly light weight and I never have to worry about these falling out during my run.
1,"These are very comfortable to wear and sound just fine.  Hey - they are ear buds - so I was surprised at how good they sound.  I am not an audiophile, but I know what sounds good, and these do.  I use them to listen to music on my iPhone while I am mowing - they seem to block outside noise pretty well.  They are very comfortable and lightweight.  I would buy another set should something go wrong with these after the warranty period."
1,I like that they're noise canceling. Sometimes I forget to turn them back on and find that I'm using them as ear plugs! However for some reason when my phone is in my pocket and I bend over the music some how cuts out and returns once I stand up?! Other than that they're great and well worth it!
1,Loving it! Sound quality is excellent. Easy to use.
0,worked for about 45 days then quit.  Very poor product durability.  I wish i could get a refund.  Not worth it at all.
1,"These wireless earbuds are comfortable, and they paired easily with my Kindle. I like to listen to audio books when turning in for the night, and was tired of my uncomfortable wired headset getting tangled in the bedsheets. I can't vouch for the microphone quality, since I have no intention of using this headset to take calls. This headset works great for my intended use and the price is great."
0,I can assume I got defective item but audio quality of this headphones is pretty low - a lot of bass but almost no mids and treble.
1,Great product.
0,"Loved these....when they worked. Had them for less than a month before they never turned back on. Little bulky, but for the price I was okay with it. If they lasted longer they would've been better but disappointed in how fast they broke."
1,Not bad. Not good. Bass is muddy but they do get loud. I liked the fit but it was just not the quality i was looking for but for 20$ i wouldn't pay more then that for them.
1,"Ordered my first pair of bluetooth earbuds on the recommendation of my son.  I am totally happy with the purchase.  These have great sound, multifunction buttons to control volume, phone calls, tracks, etc., and they are very comfortable.<br />I use them in the gym mainly and highly recommend them."
1,"I sweat quite profusely and they still work great for me. Comfortable and very loud, which I like my music blaring. Great product for he price"
1,The sound is amazing
1,I received these promptly. The instructions were easy and they work great! I appreciated the seller contacting me after the sale to make sure I was happy.
1,"Got my buds a few days back - been on two runs with them so here is the data so far.<br /><br />I had 2 Jabra sports ( the old model from way back ) for the last 4 years ( the first pair died after 2 years not being able to take a charge, the second got lost ...somewhere...)  which I just loved and thought I would never get anything else; except they stopped making them. Found these after looking at the latest Jabra product and seeing all the good reviews the Senso product had. I was looking for buds that had the ear hook feature as I prefer it for long runs,.<br /><br />Onto the product.<br /><br />Came in good packaging - sturdy box, good instructions etc ( although maybe you could up the font? - a little small for older eyes). In the box were the buds, some different sized ear gels, a short USB cable, a nice travel case for the buds, a car charger - and an Apple charging cable! The last one threw me as I tried to plug into the charging port on the buds and it wouldn't fit ( lucky didn't push to hard! ) , found the short USB in the pack with the gels eventually - doh!<br /><br />The ear hooks felt a little, floppy(?) at first - I was used to the hard plastic Jabra's; once on they felt fine but have a little concern on their long term durability - will update in a few months.<br /><br />Pairing was very easy with my Samsung S7 - no challenges compared to some of the other reviews - worked first time. First time I played them I must have had my volume on my phone on full, and the buds volume on full, and I think I nearly blew my eardrums out - my head was literally ringing for an hour. So, no problem with the volume.<br />Volume controls easy to use - also skip track works ( hold volume down for 2 secs to switch backwards on forwards )  - no one has called me while on my run ( good! ) so don't know how they sound for a call.<br /><br />Price vs. Quality - these appeared to be the cheapest bluetooth buds on Amazon, so I assumed there would be product compromises - HOWEVER, so far I have found any. 2 days in am VERY pleased with them and would recommend them strongly. I will update review once I have a sense of how long they go without charging and durability over time."
0,They stopped connecting after three uses!
0,"VERY poor sound quality so bad that I think the ones I received may be damaged? Abnormally large, they look ridiculous. Also they do not stay in your ears."
1,"Honestly, for the price and what's currently on the market- other products being way over priced; this product is worth the money. Plus, it comes with other universal products. I wish more companies just understood common sense. People work hard for their money and they want to purchase a good quality product at a good price, and having a good warranty is a plus. This product, and the components it comes with, is well worth the purchase."
1,"This is good for normal use, not for sports, they fall out easily and the rubber hooks are flimsy and don't add too much stability. Great sound, just terrible fit."
1,Love this product. Will buy more from this manufacturer.
1,"Great earbuds, very comfortable"
1,"For the price, these wireless headphones can't be beat.  They are a bit bulky but fit well with the interchangeable earbuds.  The sound was surprisingly crisp and clear with good bass.  They did tend to distort when turned way up as I like my workout music loud.  The range was a bit disappointing as I had paired the headphones with a stationary iPad.  If you have your phone close by, it should not be a problem.  Overall, I think these are pretty good wireless headphones for the price."
1,"Initually I didn't like these for running. It makes a perfect seal and I could hear myself hitting the pavement and breathing. But full insertion to make a ""cork"" seal should be performed only when you're sitting or resting. It's fine to let the hooks do the work and merely let the buds rest against your ears! I ran last night with them not making a perfect seal and the sound was fine, still had highs and lows."
1,"Original Review - Most reviews say ""these beat the beats""; I wouldn't go that far. They are comparable in many ways, but I do not think one is better than the other. Each has pros and each has cons. Personally beats are over-rated and expensive, but they have many good features. These do not have the level of bass as beats, and the ear hooks do not have metal in them allowing you to ""Mold"" them to your ears. These sound good, but do not sound any better than beats, they sound about the same. The price is worth it, but these do not work with ""high impact cardio"" (aka running or jogging or crossfit) these do not stay in as good as beats, but for the price, they are decent. The ""low battery"" warning is ANNOYING, every minute or two for 5 or 10 minutes....YES I KNOW THE BATTERY IS LOW, let me enjoy my last 5 minutes of music please!!!!<br />Decent for the price, works for lifting and light cardio (walking), but not great for high impact cardio, falls out of ears easily.<br /><br />Update 2019-01-16<br />Bought a ""new model"" of these recently. The sound is still as good as before (great sound for the price), but the design changed. In my previous review, I commented that they could match Beats by making mold-able (malleable)  ear hooks. Well they implemented that aspect in this model, and definitely get an A for effort. The only problem is that they don't use a good enough grade (thickness) of metal, its too thin, flexible, and mold-able. I take them off at the gym mid set, and I have to re-mold the hook. It gets a little annoying, imagine the difference between the metal of a standard staple, vs the metal of a heavy duty paperclip. The staple will bend easier, but not stay in that position if even the slightest pressure is applied.<br />Great idea, good progress from the last model, but they definitely need to make improvements. They do stay on during workouts and running at the gym, but the wrong twist or pressure and it will need to be remolded to fit your ear comfortably or the same sound as 5 seconds before it.<br />I still recommend these, and the last pair became my preferred gym set (over my $200 beats). Good product, but def needs some tweaks."
1,"Before purchasing Senso I had LG behind the neck earbuds and after three years the neck piece just broke from normal use.  I was looking for quality of sound, ease in using and hoping for one with a long battery life.  With the Senso it seems I have found all three and the price was great."
1,"I love these headphones. The price for them although more then some cheaper hearphones are well worth the price. I used about 5 different brands of headphones all bluetooth ranging price from $20-$40. Compared to the otherbrands these headphones sound great, a perfect if you run or workout a lot like I do, or are just wanting headphones that offer great range and distance to allow house work without having your phone in your pocket. The company overall has been great. They respond fast to emails and to help you out with any issues you may have like they did for me and will help you to the best of their ability which in working with sellers on Amazon or any company or place is great when you get customer service like they gave me.<br /><br />Overall I would get these headphones they're great and I even bought two pairs just to have one that is fully charges for work and working put."
1,"Great sound, background noise is a minimum.  They pair very quickly.  Great for the gym"
1,"I've had these since Christmas and have been very impressed by the sound quality. THEN I accidentally put them in with the laundry. After a long cycle through the washing machine, they STILL work!!! Not quite as well, but they work well enough to use. 10/10, would definitely recommend to a friend."
1,Paired quickly. Sound quality is pretty good and they stay on my head while running.
1,"It took a while to get used to these headphones but I really do like them now. When I first started wearing them, they didn't seem to fit tight enough into my ear. They seemed to flop around and always came out despite the ear hook. I played around with them and finally found a way to get them in and have them stay. (Kind of &#34;screwed them in&#34; helped) Now I put them on and wear them while working on the pool and haven't drop them in ONCE!!!  I can put them on and  they pretty much cut out all sound around me.  I put a pair of ear protectors over them for mowing and they work great. The battery lasts at least  4-5 hours of continual use out of a charge and they recharge up pretty quickly. They may last longer but I don't let them totally discharge. You do get a verbal warning when the battery strength is too low-scared the hell out of me when it first happened.  I'm satisfied with this purchase and would buy these again"
1,"They are very handy, work all over my 1200 sq ft house. Battery seems to last a long time. Comfortable on my ears. Sound is about as good as ear buds I get at the 99 cent store. Not nearly as good as  iPhone 's which will not stay in my ears. Keep working on the sound dynamics and sales will soar!"
1,I have nothing but good things to say about these. I am a contractor that uses them all day Monday thru Friday. They have held up flawlessly. They got put through the washer and dryer the other day and have worked fine. I have tried bluebuds and Beats and they aren't even close in quality and usability.
1,Thanks! They work great on land as promised. Next I will try them when I do water exercise by myself. I can listen to the music and not bother others.
1,I love these earphones. My puppy ate my last pair and I had to order another pair. They're great and an awesome price.
1,Great noise cancellation
0,"I had the same pair, but we're branded differently.<br /><br />The wind noise when using them for cycling was unbearable, and I returned them.<br /><br />Even without audio playing they were unsafe to have in your ears while cycling.<br /><br />I'm only writing this review after seeing them reviewed/advertised by Bicycling magazine... and I felt their encouragement for people to buy these headphones was downright irresponsible."
1,"LIght weight and sweat proof. Yet, they do take a little time to connect."
0,Very uncomfortable after 30 mins of use. Other then that they sound better then my air pods.
1,"I've had the Powerbeats Wireless 2 for about a year and my battery quit charging. Apple wouldn't repair them for a reasonable price so I bought these headphones. They are basically the same as the Beats. The quality of the bass is not as good, but if you're using these for the gym like I am, you'll be slamming enough weight that it won't be noticeable.<br /><br />Usually I would be very skeptical about a product with nearly identical specs as beats but for a fifth of the price. However, the 1 year warranty acts as an insurance policy."
1,Excellent for the price.
1,"Very nice headphones and great after sales service, very professional."
1,"I love these headphones,  so much so that I have told all of my work colleagues as well as my wife and now they all have a pair."
1,I workout in a loud machinery space. It’s loud and hot. Noise and sweat are no issue for these headphones. This is my second pair (first lasted over two years) and I can’t beat their durability for the price.
1,"Excellent product, light as a feather, top-notch sound."
1,"I absolutely love these headphones! They are easy to use and without a doubt, the very best that I have ever owned. The sound is also fantastic!!!"
0,Charger does not match the earbuds. Earbuds were unusable as a result.
0,"OK first the positives:<br />-connect easily and reliably reconnect<br />-decent range (not spectacular, but not bad)<br />-decent sound quality<br />-controls are easy to access<br /><br />Now the negatives:<br />-from the get-go I have been annoyed by wind noise... these headphones stick so far out of your ear that if you run or cycle you will get noticeable and annoying noise. In fact even when I walk briskly or if I'm out on a windy day this is a problem. Very annoying!<br /><br />-after using them for less than 5 months they gave out on my during my bicycle commute. I was sweating heavily so this wasn't the first pair of BT headphones that have suffered from my sweating... but this was the first pair I bought that made the bold claim to be ""sweat proof""<br /><br />Bottom line- DO NOT be fooled by this claim. If you are buying these BT headphones only for use in the office or at home you will probably be fine. But if you want to exercise outside be ready for wind noise and... if you sweat don't expect them to last more than a few months."
1,Awesome for workouts
1,"They arrived early & worked perfectly. When I wrote in to say the headphones had suddenly stopped working, within less than 24 hours my warranty was confirmed & a new set is now en route. Great product; excellent service!"
1,i liked the price and the product
1,"Great Bluetooth headphones, hands down! But can can you please consider this suggestion that many others may agree with? Please make it so that I can connect another device and automatically bump the previously connected device! I have gotten so frustrated looking of the last device that I connected to disconnect so that I can connect to another device. For example, I have a MacBook, an iPhone and an iPad. If I was connected to my MacBook last night while working and taking calls, and then I wanted to connect the headphones to my iPhone while in range with my MacBook, I have to disconnect from the MacBook because the headphones automatically connect to the last connected device. Big headache!!!!!!"
1,Great headphones. They feel light when you run and stay in your ears. They have great sound and a good battery life. I'm happy I bought these instead of dropping $200 + on more expensive wireless headphones.
1,"This is my first pair of wireless (Bluetooth) headphones and man I will never go back. I've only had these a few days but I love them so much, this is definitely one of my favorite purchases I've made in a long time. The sound quality is awesome, they are super comfortable, easy to control the music, volume and pause/play from the earpiece and really convenient while running, boxing and lifting weights. All my many previous pairs of headphones would inevitably mess up in some way over time from the internal wires coming loose and result in one earbud going out, or needing to bend the cable in a certain way for it to work- I'm hoping since these aren't attached to my phone they won't have the occasional pulling that sometimes happens which over time loosens the internal connections. I got these for daily use while exercising and will update if any problems arise in the future after more wear, however these seem high quality so I have high hopes."
1,I love them but there seems to be a lot of jitter..........the fit is FANTASTIC!
1,Very nice for the price. Good fit and comfortable. Quick charge and nice battery life
1,For the price they are fantastic
1,Perfect!! Thank you..
1,"I was pleasantly surprised with this purchase. I was looking for an inexpensive pair of wireless headphones for use at gym and during yard work. These fit the bill. The depth of sound lacks a little compared to higher end brands but overall the sound quality is satisfactory. Nice fit and design. Purchase came with case , car charge adapter two cables long and short.  I will mention at the gym with phone in pocket I have on occasion heard static when I remove phone from pocket it goes away.  I will have to see how this goes. Loving forward as I have only used them a few times. Over all satisfied."
0,"I am giving this product 2 starts just because the sound quality is not bad; however over the ear pice is so flimsy. It is not made from some flexible plastic but from a flimsy rubber that barely holds the earbuds behind the ears. Also the incoming call announcements is very slow just tells u a number one a time very slow, instead of the called id. Bu the time i heard the number I missed the call."
1,"I'm still getting used to how the ear pieces work, and the need to charge them after every gym session, but otherwise they are comfortable, have great sound, and are easy to use."
1,Bought these for my teen daughter- she was able to set them up herself and has been enjoying them each day since receiving them. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that there is a one year warranty on these headphones too! Can't beat the price either... all around happy that we found these headphones!
1,If you wear glasses then the blinking blue light is reflected in your glasses which makes it very irritating.
1,Haven't found a thing I don't like. Love Love Love!!!!
1,"I'm very impressed by this product. They sound great, include some unexpected extra bits that are actually useful, pair easily with my iPhone 6, and the carry case is very nice too. All that *and* they come with a warranty!<br /><br />For such an affordable price, you can't go wrong."
1,I was surprised by how great the sound quality was. These are simply awesome!
1,"I LOVE these headphones !  I use them to watch TV late at night when the rest of the household is sleeping.  They pair quickly to our<br />Connect brand universal wireless audio transmitter. The battery life is AT LEAST 8 hours and they charge quickly !  The customer support for this product is excellent.  I haven't experienced any lag time what so ever with these and the quality of the sound is GREAT for such an inexpensive product. I agree with the other reviewers who've noted..... no need to JAM these into your ears. Just insert them, without screwing them into into your ears and they are so comfortable, you'll forget all about them.  They are perfect for us night owls who are sick of trying to watch TV on a low volume in order not to keep everyone else awake at night !"
1,I like how comfortable they are. and the sound is great too.
0,"The right side stopped working after only 1 month of use. The headphone were lighter than another pair I had which made them less prone to falling out/off the ear, but once I started moderate sweating I would have to keep pushing them in. The &#34;hooks&#34; are very flimsy (not stiff) and did not do a good job of keeping the bud in place. No way they would have survived summer runs."
1,Good
1,Love them!
1,"Great sound, amazing battery life, great for calls, I use this at work around high noise levels and it blocks out quite alot of noise."
1,"I lost my first pair but loved it so much I had to get another. My second pair did not work, but I was able to replace it using their warranty."
1,The packaging is really professional and he quality of these headphones are incredible!
1,"Time to cut cords and get these headphones...!!!<br />Great quality, great sounding, and nice extras.<br />Sound - nice highs, mids, and rich bass.<br />Quality - nice design, light on ears (I wear glasses)<br />Note: They did begin to bother after over 2 hours of usage, working out and phone calls.  I would say that's normal.<br />Shipping - I literally got them the next day of ordering.<br /><br />Overall, great buy for me...."
1,"I have been using these for the past two weeks and so far I feel they're great. Sometimes I lose one of them because my piercings keep pushing them out of my ear, but I don't feel like it's the headphones' fault."
0,I desperately needed some bluetooth headphones for some overseas flights to Europe. I was very happy to get these with same-day Amazon delivery the day before my trip. Unfortunately the right earbud does not produce any sound. Now I'm stuck trying to find something at the last minute and am stuck with this defect until I come back in two weeks and can return.
1,"Awesome, best headphones I have ever used."
1,Awesome sound...great product with fast delivery
1,"Still going strong after a year of almost daily use. Stood next to a beach bongo player and only heard my music. Battery life has faded only a bit, so very good for basic headphones."
1,"Perfect!  Exactly as advertised.  Light weight, great sound, easy to operate, great for long walks or runs. These are exactly the headphones I've been looking for!"
1,Sound great. Hold up great to the gym sweat sessions.
1,They have great customer service and the product is good for the price
1,"Works Amazing, don't have to worry about my cord getting tangled into my work. Amazing crisp sound."
1,Amazing! Great for use in a noisy gym!
1,I like every thing about these ear pods but the instruction sheet.  There is no reason to use such a tiny font.
1,Using them right now!  So far so good.  Easy to use and very affordable.  Comfortable in the ears and them stay in my ears well.  Just get them!!!
1,Absolutely love love them!!!!
1,Overall I am pleased with this product the base is great and all the accessories it makes it even better. As far as conversations go it could be better it does not noise cancel the background very well but not a huge problem if you use it just to work out. very comfortable to workout in I use it to run and crossfit and they don't full off.I definitely recommend this!
1,This is a great product
1,"Good quality as far as I can tell... However, they simply don't stay in my ears when running."
1,Better than expected great product for the price
1,Love them.  Needed technical support after six months and the customer service was nothing short of excellent.
1,Great for working out. It stays in place.
1,"Bought these for my 15 year-old son and he loves them!  He is very active and uses them for all sorts of activities, including batting practice and running. I convinced him to try these rather than purchase a big name pair for 3 times the money and he is extremely happy with the SENSO headphones and I am very pleased with the price."
1,Better than expected.I would buy it again.
0,STOOPED WORKING AFTER FEW WEEKS.
1,"These were a gift, so my input is second-hand.  However, she was very excited about receiving them!"
1,Recommend it
0,"It seems like everyone likes these headphones - they are waterproof, have good bass, etc. That wasn't my experience, mine only lasted 3 weeks unfortunately. But I go through headphones every three months, so take what I say with a grain of salt."
1,"Just as good, if not better, then Dr. Dre's cordless Beats which you pay 4 - 5 x more for.  My kids have the Beats so I've used them on several occasions.  The Senso headphones are just as good!! Highly recommend.  My only issue is that I'd like the volume to go a little lower than it's current lowest setting.  If you listen to anything in a quiet room the lowest volume level seems loud."
1,"I really like them. Easy to pair with android, ipod and kindle fire. Great sound for music and podcast listening and so far no echo with phone conversations. Comfortable in my ears and charge lasts many hours. Inexpensive. No negatives."
1,"easy to setup, comfortable to wear and volume adjustment convenient"
0,Bass way too loud on these things can't even hear anything else. I have no way to turn down the over powering bass on these things. I don't know If I got a bad batch but I was very disappointed with them.
1,"I decided on these for a few reasons. The different sized ear adapters, the carrying case, and the price compared to other blue tooth headphones. I've owned and tried several pair of headphones but never a blue tooth set like this.<br /><br />Pros-<br />The sound has been great for the 3 weeks or so that I've had them. Really crisp and clear sound and you even get the bass.<br />Battery lasts quite a long time<br />Easy to turn on and off and connect to my phone<br />Comfortable to wear<br /><br />Cons-<br />The piece that goes around the ear is way too flexible so they aren't all that secure when I'm trying to workout. They don't fall out a lot, just when I'm not careful. However, I will disclose that I have small ears and have yet to find a good set that will stay on. So, it MAY just be my ears. But I really don't like how flexible they are. It almost seems like a pointless feature in my opinion.<br /><br />Over all though, I'm happy with them. The smallest adapter it comes with has the best fit I've found so far. With the previous sets I've had (cheapies from Target, nothing too fancy online) the smallest are still too big so I can never seem to get them into my ear enough to stay and often will hurt after not that long of wearing. These are pretty comfortable and the fact that it actually fits in my ear canal helps them stay put."
0,"They worked fine for a little over 3 months, then just died. No sound comes out of them anymore. The return and support windows have closed, so they are just junk now. Definitely not worth buying."
0,"I've used these a few times a week since early January. I bought them because it's nice to be able to do strength training workouts while listening to music and not having to deal with wires. They worked great, sound quality was excellent. I had to charge them after every 2-3 workouts, but that's more or less what I expected. Now, they won't turn on, won't charge, won't reset. They're completely dead. These are obviously inexpensive but I did expect to get more than 6-7 weeks with them. Really disappointing."
1,The headphone is very nice! I like it!
1,"The headphones work just fine,  but the Bluetooth cuts out when my apple watch goes underwater.  That said, not sure I'll be able to use these why swimming."
1,I have bought a few Bluetooth headphones the first costing 160$ That lasted five months and these are by far the best. I didn't expect much at this price but I am very happy with my purchase. After 7 months they are still going strong.
1,Great set of wireless earbuds at a great price.  Very complete accessories and instructions.  Arrived sooner than expected.
1,The sound is too strong while the price is nice
1,Work great!
1,"Love them for fitness workouts. Sound great, good noise cancellation, no more tangled wires!"
1,Good sound quality; stays in ears
1,Great headphones!!!
1,I am using the headphones while I am walking on my treadclimber. I watch my ipad to help keep me motivated while I am working out. I like the fact that  there is no loose wire to get caught up. The sound quality is  good too.  I would recommend them to others for the quality and price.
1,"I just received these two days ago so I haven't used them too much.  But, I did pair them up right away and had no problem.  Also, in the short time I've used them I really like them.  Here's why:<br />1.  They fit well.  Sometimes earbuds don't fit well or feel right.  When I put these in and wrap the things around my ear they feel secure.  They come with small, medium and large ear fittings to fit your ear.<br />2.  I like the controls on the earbuds.  They have a button to turn them on and off - which also is used to pair up the earbuds and to answer the phone if it rings.  Also has two buttons to adjust volume if you need to.<br />3.  They sound really good.  I've had earbuds before that just sound awful - but these have good highs and lows and sound great with my music.<br /><br />I've only had them two days so not a lot of use yet but from what I've seen so far I'm impressed."
0,Loved them at first but three months in they crapped out. A for comfort but reliability is an F. Volume button fell off within 2 months and completely stopped working within three and of course it was just outside of the warranty window.
1,Better than what I expected. Love it
0,"Sounds quality is great, comfortable, nice, solid case. Microphone is crap though. Tried using for phone calls but the other person only heard my garbled voice. Does NOT pair with a PS4, not compatible, which is why it was purchased :("
1,not user friendly with the buttons
0,"WORTHLESS! After two months of minimal use stopped turning on. In addition, doesn't hold a charge for any length of time. Has a blue light to indicate charged. Red for needs charge but no color to tell you if the damn thing is actually on."
0,I charged it. The red light came on then after about 20 minutes the blue light came on. I place to unit in pairing mode but no lights came on. I tried to turn it on no lights came on. We charged it again with the same results. I returned it to Amazon and bought one from a different headset.
1,"I, too had problems with ill-fitting earbuds, none of which stayed in my ears regardless of the various sizes provided, I purchased the Senso Bluetooth ones since they had hooks for ears and very comfortable earbuds. Syncing was a breeze, and I am very happy with fit and sound. Perfect solution!"
1,"I have only had these for about a week, but I work out very hard and sweat a lot with many fast movements. They stay on my head, haven't had any sweat issues ane the sound is great. I'm very pleased as long as they hold up."
0,"Looks great, feels good, fits well, but the audio/Bluetooth connection skips regularly. I have charged them fully, tried other devices but the connection skips on everything, every time. It is unfortunate."
1,"It's not heavy or super big like a lot of other expensive headphones. Perfect for ignoring the world and zoning out, when you have it loud enough. Practical for plyometric workouts, and other type of workout you can think of. It has simple commands. It's very subtle, which is what I like."
1,This is a good product.<br />I recommend the salesman.
1,"I purchased these as a less expensive version of the Beats BT headphones that I use and love. I really like these so far. There use softer rubber for the ear wraparound which at first I didn't like, but now prefer. The sound is really good and the functionality is the same, at least as far as I use them."
1,"My first pair of bluetooth headphones and I couldn't be happier.  Super easy to set up and operate.  Connects to both my wife's iphone and my android without fail.  These look, feel, and perform like they are way more expensive than they are.  Going to get a second pair just for me."
1,These are great for me. I use them in gym constantly. I use when mowing the lawn. I use when washing cars. I use at work when phone signal is too weak and I can leave the phone 50yds away and make business call. Ears seal pretty well except when I'm jumping around or up side down at gym they may unseal causing the bass response to weaken. I would buy these again. I bought a 2nd pair for my honey.
0,"Worked fine for few days and then the real issues arised. Sometimes it keeps disconnecting for no reason and when i open other apps, for example : If i use headphones for whatsapp voice call and open skype for chatting, bluetooth disconnects . Seems like a bug it needs some major tweaks and also there is always a sluttering noise while using."
1,awesome little headphones
0,"Way too big to fit on my ears. I couldn't get them to fit right, so I didn't even try out the sound. Not adjustable in any way and one of the earpieces was deformed anyway so I sent them back. On the bright side, the return process was easy."
1,"Works well, easy to link with our TV-Bluetooth transmitter."
1,"Problem with first pair, immediately replaced.<br />Very nice quality and excellent sound, extra cable a great value."
0,The ear loops did not stay on the my ears. They kept falling off and the heavy ear buds was no picnic. Was able to return.
1,I purchased these as a gift so I can't review how the earphones work but I was impressed that they came with a very nice looking clamshell and a car charger besides the regular wall charger.
1,Sound is great
1,"This is my second pair of this style (I'm a heavy user).  I was having some trouble getting the earbuds to charge, but I contacted Customer Service and got a quick response that walked me through the reset process.  They also followed up promptly.  I highly recommend this product."
1,"seems to loose connection to my phone when cutting the grass... phone in pocket headphones on head... fidelity is ok when listening in quiet room, not very good at  ambient sound isolation.. for the price a good buty"
1,"These are awesome! Bought them to use while walking my dogs, found that headphones with any sort of cord were a pain. Not only are these comfortable, but they also came with an adapter for Android and iPhones, 3 different sizes of ear buds, a charger AND a car adapter. All in a cute and study little round carrying case. Really more than I was expecting. Super easy to pair with my phone and other devices. One of the earphones also has buttons for volume, ffwarding songs,  picking up phone calls, all while never having to even think about pulling out your phone. Love them, thinking ood buying some as gifts. Oh,  and they are comfortable and don't fall out so the sound is great. Thumbs up!"
1,Excellent earbuds..I have tried many other types but the Senso earbuds exceed my expectations. They fit comfortably and the sound is awesome.
1,"Pretty happy so far. Sound is good, fit is comfortable.."
1,"The Headphones are okay, but I did purchase them so I could use them for bicycle rides based on the following product description: &#34;SENSO Bluetooth Headphones, Best Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7 Waterproof HD Stereo Sweatproof Earbuds for Gym Running Workout 8 Hour Battery Noise Cancelling Headsets&#34; Now when you're on a bicycle, even if you're riding as slow as someone would be at an average jogging pace, the noise is too distracting. So if you intend to do anything that's not stationary EXCEPT walking, these aren't for you. Otherwise, they're priced really nicely, and work very well at my desk."
1,"These are great headphones. The sound quality is very nice. These headphones get heavy daily use in the gym or out running. After 3 months of use, they wouldn't power on one day before a run. I contacted customer service and they agreed that they should not have failed. They verified my address and in two days, I had a new pair. Responded to my email at 7pm and shipped the product out quickly. Now that's great customer service."
1,Good item comfortable and the sound is good!
1,"So far, I love them. They are comfortable and loud enough to play my drums. I was tired of a cord head set, so these are working great so far.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Will Dillard"
1,A real nice set of ear buds. You know they are very good to second you take them out of the box!! You did not buy here? Well you may have paid to much!!!
1,Love the earbuds. They're easy to use and comfortable. Great sound and an excellent price. The company shipped quickly and had great follow up to make sure I was a satisfied customer.
1,Hands down the best headphones I ever bought. The customer service was exceptional and honor their warranty claim. I highly recommend them.
1,"Headphones are little bigger than I expected but with that price, I have no complains. The battery life is a very strong point especially if you workout for a long time or on a plane without a portable batter to charge."
1,"These earbuds are great! I’ve tried a few and they have amazing sound quality, long battery life, and they fit and STAY put! If I ever lost them I would buy these again immediately!"
1,"Love the headphones! So much so that I bought them for my husband and my grandson. Clear sound, easy to use, comfortable, compact."
1,Much more than I expected.  I purchased another brand and I would rate them a 2 and the SENSO bluetooth headphones a 10.
0,"They would completely shut off audio 30 minutes into a run. I would do everything possible to reset the buds in hopes of reconnecting and continuing the run w tunes but no luck. Only when I was at home  and plugged back into a power source would they revive, but still same result on next run. Not reliable, I threw mine away bc this all happened after the 30 day return window."
0,"Had high hopes this would be a great bluetooth headset but it failed.<br />It's supposed to reach 30 feet, but all I could get out of it was 3 feet and then it would get choppy and sometimes even lose connection.  I made sure everything was fully charged.  Reset to factory settings, re-paired with device, still the exact same problem.  Tried multiple times (with multiple devices) following the reset re-pair instructions but it did not help.  Clearly defective.<br /><br />I tried jogging with them and the sound of wind was not cancelled out at all, so not that impressed with the sound canceling claim either.<br /><br />2-star for decent sound and a good price - it would be great if it actually worked as they claimed."
1,Sound great even in noisy environments
1,"Great sound, paired easily. Added bonuses- the car charger and the charging cable has a micro USB and lightning adapter in one cable."
1,"They hold their charge, sound clear and are comfortable. I just bought a second pair for my kiddo."
1,Senso Bluetooth Headphones (two pair) I just purchased for Christmas gifts are awesome.  I charged them up so they are ready to work when gifts are opened.  I tried them out cross country skiing and the sound excellent!  Thanks Senso.
1,Well better than Beats.
1,Love these!!! They work great.
1,I like my new bluetooth headphones very much.  I use them when I go walking and they are very light and comfortable.  They recharge quickly and seriously sound amazing.  The case is nice and small and has a pouch for the charging cord.  I'm very happy with my purchase.
1,"I have had much more expensive head phones, and these preform just as good. Now I must admit that I am only listing to spoken word info (audio books and pod casts) so music lovers I Cannot comment."
1,"I loved everything about my senso headphones,  i used to have them a couple years ago,now June 2019 decided to buy them again (Old ones i sold them) love the price and quality of them. Honestly they are better then a famous brand named beats by (***) don't go off just the brand.  I give it a 10/10 ."
1,Love these headphones! Great for working out! Great price! Highly recommend!
1,They work just like I hoped they would.  The only drawback is the sound of air rushing over the one side when riding a bike.  I plan to try a smaller ear cup which may help that. They keep connection from close to far away with the iPhone SE. I would surely recommend this project. It is so much better than dealing with cables.
1,Great headphones. Easy to Bluetooth to all my devices. Sound is fantastic. My daughter bought these and recommended them to me. She was right!
0,These worked for 2-3 weeks then wouldn’t connect/ please contact me Re / options for return<br />R Starr
0,stays secure in the ear and sound quality is fairly good too.<br />So after a month and half this thing has stopped working. It just won't turn on no matter how long I charge it. Is there a number to call and report the shoddy quality of the product.
0,"I bought these because I really wanted something that would stay firmly in my ears while working out. They don't. It's nice that they come with three sizes of bud covers, but they aren't grippy. The loop over the ear is *huge* and doesn't actually even rest on my ear. I might cut them off. They just add more weight that pulls the buds out of my ears. Last, the sound quality would be pretty good if they stayed in, but when they hang halfway out you don't get very good sound. Disappointed."
1,These headphones are my new favorite for workouts and on campus. The sound quality is awesome along with the exceptional battery life. The value far surpasses the price.
1,"Better than expected. Sound great, feel great on ears, stay in place during hard running, and great battery life. Easy set up. Will recommend to family and friends..."
1,"If I put the earloop over my ear, the earbud part doesn't fit into my ear canal and rests outside of it.  I'm using the smallest tips, but it seems the angle of the hook relative to the angle of the earbud portion are not correct for my ear.  If the hook could be positioned in different positions I could probably make them work, but since the point of these is the earhook I'm only giving these 3 stars.  The earhook holds them in place, but the sound isolation is poor due to them not going into my ear."
1,"These headphones are light and comfortable. They connected without a problem, and the sound is great!"
0,"Received these as a gift from my husband in April 2017 - in the last month, they crackle after turning on. As in sound is distorted for up to a minute at times after turning them on and starting a podcast, music, whatever. In the last week, the left earbud wiring is coming disconnected, so I can't hear anything out of it. My hearing is already shady, and I use these in my office to tune out other people. I usually only have one in (usually my left ear) so one of them not working renders them useless to me.<br /><br />Okay product if you don't mind pitching them after a year-ish."
1,"My only gripe with this is the sound. While a lot of people would agree that this sounds nice, I think the bass is obnoxiously at the front of things with these earbuds.<br /><br />I get that a lot of people enjoy that but I think many elements of the sound spectrum are clouded due to the very exaggerated bass sound of these earbuds.<br /><br />Otherwise, I wouldn't have any complaints. I like a balanced sounding headphone that slightly favors the bass rather than exaggerates it to the front of the music. Definitely some of the most bass heavy earbuds I have tried and for that, I am not a fan."
1,Lasted about 4 months while being used 3-4 days a week for about an hour each day. They're solid headphones for the gym but I'm really disappointed on how long they lasted before the battery refused to charge anymore. Not sure what the common lifespan is for this product but I was really expecting it to be more than 4 months.
1,"The sound quality isn't the best due to too much base coming through. Fits pretty well, but would think they would be better off with a stiffer ear support piece."
0,Break to easy
1,They are a Christmas gift so it will be awhile before I know how they perform. Once my grandson tells me how much he likes them or doesn't like them I will respond
0,"I really wanted to love these headphones, but I can not. I have ordered two pair's of these headphones . The first pair, the sound quality was so poor that I had to send them back, and the second pair had the same issue. In the beginning, these headphones seemed like a good idea because they are wireless, but I traded these in for Apple airpods which are expensive, but definitely worth the money.<br /><br />So, if sound quality is important to you, do not buy these."
1,Good sound for inexpensive bluetooth headphones
1, I love these head phone... had an issue after a few months of use and the company promptly sent me another pair! great service to stand behind a great product
0,The bluethoot disconnects from my iPhone when I’m cutting my lawn.  During night time there’s a blue blinking light that lights up the room
1,"Music is super clear, and not at all distorted. Telephone calls come inn nice and clear. I'm a truck driver so the noise cancellation is important. So far these are the best I've used. Thank you"
1,I love them easy to use great sound great quality and battery lasts way longer than power beats! Excellent price!
1,"I just recieved  my new headphones, have not had a chance to use them yet, however, the set up was super easy and changing the ear piece to fit my small ears was a breeze.  I will comment more once I get to the gym tonight and actually have a real opportuntiy to use them for what I bought them for."
1,"The ear loops are too big and the pads for the earbuds are hard and very uncomfortable to wear. The sound quality is decent though, especially for budget headphones."
1,"I love the sound,the comfort, and the style. The headphones do a weird thing where the music becomes choppy. The headphones are full charged so I don't know why they do that.  Please help!"
1,"The sound is okay with these. A few times I would get static, my main complaint is that they dont fit on the ears that great. I run and one or the other would pop off and I would have to keep adjusting."
1,"Good quality headphones for the price. Only problem I have with them is the cover snapped off while I was working in a crawl space. I managed to find the cover piece with the power button but lost the two pieces that snap into the cover piece that control the volume and skip function :( those could be attatched to the ear buds a little better, but other than that the sound is good and I’m happy with my purchase!"
0,Not very excited about this order.
1,Just used them for the first time yeaterday. So far so good.
0,"I took a chance and ordered these blind having never heard of the brand. I can honestly say I'm not impressed with them at all. I'm about ready to return them for a refund and buy something else. If I would have paid MSRP I would be pissed not that I'm all that happy at 40. So what's the problems?<br /><br />The ear buds have a rubber band that wraps around your ear. The things are floppy and serve no real purpose. They don't hold the ear buds is place. They tend to slide off while walking, working, etc. Even a thin bendable wire would have helped.<br /><br />The wire has two ties so you can adjust the wire to not dangle. With or without them rubber coated wire catches your skin or clothes and rips the ear buds loose or out.<br /><br />The sound is not THAT great or loud. Bass comes through distorted and highs, mids come through kinda tinny at times. Noise cancelling? Ok sure I didn't notice at all. Blocked outside noise like standard earbuds.. not at all. I've honestly had pairs of skullcandy's that blew these away sound wise. And I only paid 10 for those.<br /><br />Bluetooth is shotty at best. I have paired them to 3 Samsung phones, 2 laptops, a home stereo and a tablet. Only paired to so many devices to test & everytime the Bluetooth would drop in and out constantly. I could put the phone right on the earbud next to my head and it would still drop out. I thought maybe the battery was not fully charged. So I let them charge overnight. Had a full blue light & tried again with the same results.<br /><br />The only good things about them is they look nice, come with a compact carry case, wires and a charger. Cant comment on battery life. Couldn't listen to music cutting in & out for 10 hours straight to find out.<br /><br />In the end not impressed & dissapointed. I will return them and more than likely avoid senso in the future."
0,"horrible reception, I loose reception if I turn my head while wearing my phone on my belt."
0,"Apparently works for a lot of people but lasted a mere two weeks for me. Faced a some glitches getting it to pair w/ my iphone but got it working and loved it for walking or jogging. No wires! But eventually pairing failed once and was a hassle to get going again. And, then, finally, it wouldn't pair at all; replacing app, returning to factory settings, charging, rebooting, etc. Nothing worked. There is a note in the instructions that the device is sensitive to moisture. I'm going to assume this is what happened. It was damaged by exposure to sweat. I used to have a similar problem with the iPod mini. Anyway, beware. Not a good consumer product."
1,"I got these for my boyfriend so he could use them when he went running. He has tried several other that we had kicking around the house, but he wanted ones that stayed on his ears while he ran. We found these and they have worked great so far. he said they stayed better and were comfortable, and sounded great too."
1,Work great!! Only thing i wish it had a led to let u know when its fully charged other then that no complaints
1,Sounds Quality is just acceptable - certainly doesnt sound as good as the standard apple ear bud.  I accept that this might have to do with the water proofing.  given price hrs features/ quality - Im still pretty happy.<br /><br />Best thing if these get broken or lost I won't be crying as much as if they were $200... and would replace them again with this great price point.
1,I have tried many headphones of every conceivable type searching for the one that would meet my expectations and Senso has accomplished this task completely. They are comfortable for long term wear and the sound quality is great. They fit snugly and comfortly if you are just sitting or jogging and the noise canceling is the best I have experience. A great Bluetooth headphone and a great headphone in general.
1,"Not much bass.  Good sound otherwise for the price.  The over the ear part is not rigid, but floppy instead.  I have a bit of trouble keeping them secure when moving around a lot...like skiing with a winter hat and goggles on while my 3 other family members have a different brand with rigid over ear pieces...and didn't have that trouble.  I love the case and accessories."
0,"Complete piece of junk that never worked properly. Just could not stay connected to any device. Don’t waste your time with this trash, buy a quality product."
1,I bought these for my daughter but had to try them out. They sound really great.
0,Broke after 2 charges
1,It's the best I used
1,"When I did an online search for &#34;best blue tooth headphones&#34; these came up first.  For good reasons! 1.) SUPER price. 2.) Great sound! 3.) Great product.  I'll elaborate on the latter: They're easy to use, they have just 3 buttons and a brief manual that explains the volume control/advance play buttons, and the main button's use for on/off/pause, incoming calls, etc.  They are comfortable with 3 earbud size options.  My ears are too small for the flexible over-the-ear clips, but they aren't in the way or bothersome.  I live in the snowy north, so for outside activity the clips actually fit snugly beneath my hat. Nice storage carrier to throw in a gym bag, pocket, or carry-on.<br />I haven't taken a call with these so I can't comment on how that goes.<br />Bought these for my daughter too - she also loves them."
1,"Ordered these for my wife after I got my pair.  They are great, simply put.  Super product.  I am glad I purchased."
0,Crackly and volume controls didn't work.  Followed instructions to reset them.  Worked for a day then crackly and volume controls didn't work again.
1,"Great value, my beats broke and these are great"
1,I have used these on 6 marathons and for someone who sweats a ton these are a great value for the buck. They are pretty sturdy and you need to recharge them after about 6 hours of running.<br /><br />The only major issue with the headphones is when you get a low battery notification it notifies you every 30 seconds. The frequency is pretty annoying and makes you want to rip out the head phones
1,The sound is amazing. Base is deep... Vocals are clear. These headphones are more than worth the money. For the price they where a steal! Recommend these to anyone. Got them for work. I'm a glazier. In the construction industry and the noise cancellation on these is top notch!
1,"My main reason for this purchase was for running. Unfortunately, these particular headphones simply are not designed properly for running. When running (or just outside with a slight breeze there is a rather loud wind sound. It seems that the design of these catches the wind (either blowing or generated while running) in such a way as to generate a lot of noise that is delivered right into your ear. I tried moving these around and there just does not seem to be a way that they can be worn during a run that reduces the noise.<br />Other than that issue they are actually quite good. The sound is crisp and clear (I listen to audio books/podcasts not music). They pair easily and connect quickly. The case is nice to keep them from getting crushed when tossed into a bag. They come with a couple different in-ear pieces. The typical rubber version as well as some that are foam. The foam ones are very nice and seem more comfortable for extended wear than the typical in-ear pieces from other headphones I have worn"
1,"Hands down much better headphones that my previous Beats.  Well designed, comfortable, and easy to use.  No issues whatsoever."
1,Love these earbuds. Great in the gym and on the mower. Excellent deal for what I paid.
1,"These are great. Very comfortable. I can wander around cleaning and cooking, and they never miss a beat."
0,Bought two sets. Both stopped working within 3 months of moderate use.
1,"Amazeballs!!! An ear bud for all ear types,  sound is better than my beats solo.  Very pleased, going to buy my son a pair too."
1,"I have had the beats wireless workout headphones for over three years now. They started to not work properly, so I gave these a try. I am very surprised at the quality of these headphones. The sound quality is just as good, if not better than the beats. I recommend 100%"
1,Great sound...easy to connect with iPhone 6
1,Very good performance at a very reasonable price. Well worth every penny.
1,working perfectly after years of extended use. Hands down best bang for the buck!
1,"Perfect gift for Christmas and excellent for people liking to listen to music during exercising, Fits comfortable in the ears and is light weight.<br />Great product with a nice box to keep it stored."
0,"These were good the first couple months. I love the way they fit, they aren’t uncomfortable or fall off like other headphones I’ve tried. But now they die almost instantly. I will have them fully charged and less than 30 minutes later they show that the battery is half way or more gone. Due to this they’ve become pretty much useless as I can barely go anywhere without having to be strategic about when I use them."
0,"Worked for about a month before left ear stopped giving audio. Super disappointed. The device can't handle exercise. Keep your box, keep everything, this piece of trash WILL break on you and you WILL need to return it. Better to spend 75$ on a lasting device than spend the 25ish a month for replacements."
0,"I have only used these headphones a few times and the piece inside the earpiece that connected to the charger is broken. The cord itself had a hard time fitting in and that's probably what did it. So they are useless now since they can't be charged.<br /><br />They were decent to use, but all the adjustable ear pieces it comes with, hurt quite a bit.<br /><br />Hate to say it but they were actually a waste of money. Did not last long at all and they weren't that comfortable."
1,The work just fine and sound very good.  I do not know what people really expect from ear buds because the quality is somewhat limited due to the design.  These headphones sound just as good as my $80+  LG Bluetooth earbuds.  The case and extra plugs are a nice touch.<br /><br />Sometimes I do have pairing issues.  After a quick phone/headphone reboot everything seems to work perfectly fine.
1,&#34; they sound great &#34;
1,Husband has been using them for awhile and seems to really enjoy them and says the quality is really good. Easy to work out with.
1,"These headphones are the real deal and I’m glad I bought them. Purchased the red pair in Jan 2018 and fast forward to now, Nov 2018, they still work great. My ears are weird and headphones never sit in my ears right, especially when working out. I never have issues with these coming out of my ears when exercising, they stay in place. Battery life for me is about a week which is pretty good for the price. Sound quality is great too. No connectivity issues, and they work fine at long ranges away from my phone too. My favorite part is that they drown out outside noise. With Apple headphones you can still hear all the noise around you, but these headphones are so solid I only hear my music and it’s great. Totally worth the buy."
0,Stop working in less than a month. First one ear stop working then I couldn't even get the Bluetooth to work at all.
1,"good product, fast responses when I had a question"
1,"Price, sound"
1,"This is a good pair of headphone for sure, but to remind anyone who is going to make their purchase, this is a &#34;Sports headphone&#34;. The headset itself is perfect to make calls and such with others, the voice comes out clear and loud, the communication between the headset and the phone is pretty strong, I'm able to get a stable connection standing about 12-14 feet away from my phone. But when it comes to music playback quality, it will be much lower than your expectation. As much as they say it's &#34;HD Stereo&#34;, it's not, a pair of sony in-ear headphones that range from the price of 8-15 dollars beats this pair in terms of sound feedback. So if you are a person who has a pair of &#34;picky&#34; ears like me, and looking forward to playing mainly music with this device, I suggest you look elsewhere."
1,Works great nice sound.
1,"Awesome sound, comfortable fit!  Would recommend to friends!"
0,"I got these on November of 2018 but within 6 months, my left earphone stopped working. No more sound comes out of that ear. It also is starting to have bad bluetooth connectivity. It takes about a minute for the earphones to connect to my device. While the connection is being made, it will give very scratchy, disconnected sound while my music is trying to play.<br /><br />The first six months were awesome, but for the low price point, i guess i cant expect a long-use  quality product.."
1,"Easy to set up. Comes with two replacement ear tips, car charger, charging cable, and a three foot charging cable. No plug for wall outlets.  My order came with a one year warranty and a 10% coupon for next purchase."
1,"These headphones worked great while I had them. The audio was fine for the price and the battery life was great. Unfortunately a year and half after having them, and only a little after the warranty expired, a connection came loose and the headphones stopped working."
0,"They sound good enough, battery is decent. But I can't get them to sit just right in a fast easily repeatable manner! The little ear loops don't have any tension or shape retention they are just limp, one sudden move and I have to adjust I'll be getting earbuds without loop next time."
0,Bought mainly to run and for work.. during phone calls would keep breaking up the call and make eco sounds to the other person. For running was pretty good couldnt really hear any noises but my music. Quality of the product is very bad . Dropped once from my desk and entire earbud came apart and never worked again.
1,"Back in February, I purchased a pair of these earbuds having only tried Apple earbuds or really high-quality earbud brands like Bose. This pair is the only pair I have found that I can say is on the same level as Bose and I can't recommend these enough. The sound quality is exceptional, especially for the price, the battery life is insane, and the only grievances I have with these earbuds is that they don't work that well over calls, which is a common problem among all Bluetooth earbuds, and that after 6 months of using them, the power/play&pause button got pushed in a little too far and wasn't working. I contacted SENSO and they were very understanding, and exchanged my broken pair for a new one after verifying that the warranty was still in place and that there was a clear problem with mine. If you are on the fence about these earbuds, please buy them. They are easily my favorite pair of earbuds and I always leave the house with my pair. Highly recommend!"
1,"Got these for my husband...he is thrilled with the snug fit on his fairly large ears. He bikes a lot and now can listen to music, etc., without the worry of losing his earbuds. Great quality, affordable price!"
1,These headphones are so awesome.
1,Good headphones.
1,"I've quickly sweated through and thus ruined many &#34;water resistant&#34; headsets.  These have lasted three months now, so better than anything that I've had.  Worth it, especially for the price"
0,"i have small ears and the small buds won't stay in,and the over-ear piece is too floopy to help."
1,Better than expected!
1,"FANTASTIC!! After sincing them to my iphone, I could not believe the quality these have.<br />I am very picky on quality and these have a good bottom sound. Full sound.<br />These have really surprised me. LOVE THEM!!!!<br />I have paid many times over for a pair of expensive earbuds and then sending them back. I won't send these back.<br />Get these and listen on Pandora to music station: Audiomachine Radio. You won't believe the sound!!<br />For the price, you are getting a really good deal.<br />If you don't like them, by all means throw your money into a more expensive pair just to say how much you spent...."
0,"Very very muddy sound, might be fine for certain music, but a lot of music sounds like you're listening underwater. Even the basic Apple or Samsung headphones sound better than this."
1,The headphones has good sound quality and has a nice bass to it. The behind ear part is flexible not sure if I like that but we will. No complaints so far. Will update my review if any thing changes.
1,The best. Hands down
1,"we were amazed at how easily these were to set up and use, and how good the sound quality is.  and very comfortable.  the on-device controls are very simple yet they well do what's needed.  the battery life seems to be as advertised.  really nice carrying case too ..."
1,"I love em, the only difference between these and the beats is the base. The beats base is a little better."
1,"Durable, washed it a couple times already and still works, i guess its waterproof, haha, GG"
1,Works great!!!
1,"Great headphones, great sound, good battery life, really comfortable to wear, easy delivery process. Would highly recommend"
0,I really like the sound and full bass you get from these headphones... BUT THEY ARENT waterproof... tried 3 different times and would end up throwing them in a rice bag for them to dry up
1,Love these!!!!! I am a runner and these are perfect!!! Sounds great and stays in your ear with no sweat
0,Horrible battery life. Die after going to the gym twice.
1,"Cost and simplicity.  These headphones are a great value!For the $20.00 price point, I dont know if you will do much better.  Fit, sound, battery life.  I was thinking of going for a $150 pair,  Glad I went this route instead.  Only minimal complaint is they stick out wide from your ears.  So you dont look incredibly sharp in them"
1,"Excellent headphones, and great costumer services. highly recommended."
1,"Great sound, super simple set up and I really like the case it came with."
1,Sound is ok.  I wish the power button is placed somewhere else so when the earpiece gets loose and you try putting it back it won't accidentally turned off the power.
1,"Amazing product at a great price. My first pair of Bluetooth headphones. Easy to set up, and sound great!"
1,Good budget earphones
1,"The sound is amazing!!! so much bass and comfy there like you are not wearing them, really good Headphones, they could however improve on the reception, some times I feel like it looses reception even standing next to the connected device, not a deal breaker tough<br /><br />I used them for work and workout, had them for a week and do love how they sound."
1,Good quality headphones. Amazon prime exceeded my expectations on shipping as usual! Thank you!
1,"Had them for a month or so. Great as far as headphones go. Not great for phone use which is quite disappointing. While the microphone picks up LOTS of wind noise, the location (quality?) of microphone means that my voice is distant and muffled to the person on the call."
1,Great performance and value for the $$
1,Can not complain about the price or quality they definitely give solid sound and bass.
1,Great headphones. I did have the pair stop working and was provided with a quick warranty replacement. Great customer service overall.
1,"I've only used them once but awesome sound for the price and comes with all the necessities (case, chargers, directions etc)"
1,"Clear sound, easy to use, would recommend"
1,"Easy to set up and use, very comfortable and the sound is great. First earbuds I've owned that don't fall out all the time."
1,They aren't as secure in my ears as I need them to be while i'm running or working out.
1,Great set of bluetooth headphones for the price. Comfortable and good sound. Easy connect to my Galaxy 5. They fit well and so far hold a good charge.
1,Good sound and microphone.  Easy to forget they are on.<br />Surprising range. Excellent value.
1,They don't stay in my ears and don't work well if you wear glasses. Will be returning for a refund.
1,Blocked out sound well enough for me and was perfect for walks and light jogging
1,These headphones sounded great during my time with them. I decommissioned them due to their poor Mic quality and echoing the most people of the receiving end experienced.<br />Surprisingly enough these headphones held on while working out and I intentionally had to violently shake my head before the even began to fall off my head.<br />On battery life the headphones lasted between 6-8 hours. Which is pretty solid for the price.
1,"this is my first pair of senso headphones...and I must say that I am impressed with the quality of sound, and the ease of operation<br />I am very satisfied with my purchase.<br />keep up the good work (quality)"
1,"This is my second pair of these earbuds. I used my first set five days a week, for work shifts lasting 8-9 hours, and they lasted about three years.  Three years!  And they never fell apart and only ever ran out of battery life when going on ten hours.  Charge them up for an hour or two and they'll last you all day.  I've tried other wireless earbuds and keep going back to these because for the price these are unbeatable.  Highly recommend!!!"
0,"Why does pressing the ""multi-function"" button twice redial your last number? It's seems pretty damn counter intuitive.. why would that not be skip track like every other headphone set."
1,Good headphones
1,"Nice headphones, comfortable.  I use them at the gym and they are very nice.  They are bass heavy so I used the equalizer to mellow the bass.  Would recommend to friends."
1,"Great headphones, worth every penny. Two days after I bought them the price went down, the seller was great and refunded me the difference, when Amazon wouldn't! I highly recommend these!"
1,I have been using this earplugs for a month and so far I had no issues. It is comfortable to carry around and connects to devices effectively. Cons is that it is not 200 dollars earplugs with pricey emblem so that sound quality drops when I listen to music with high volume on.
0,"Bought in February, failed in September.<br />Call vendie , replacement sent within one week!"
0,These are complete garbage - these sound like crap. I could do without the car charger and the cables and fancy case for a decent pair of buds. Returning.
1,"I've bought these before, and after stepping on my last set (I'm a little on the heavy side...they didn't have a chance) I was glad to see that Amazon still carried them.  Solid connection, good sound, and work great in the gym, working in the yard outside, or even for a walk.  I'll try and be more careful where I leave them...but I'd buy again in a heart-beat."
1,Lightning fast service. Surprised at how well these sound for the price. So comfortable I forget I'm wearing them sometimes.
1,"These are the perfect Bluetooth headphones for working out, need more so I can leave a pair in gym back and when at home gardening or what have you. Highly recommended."
1,Great headphones and super customer service when we had warranty issue.  This is my sons second pair and he loves them.
1,These are nothing short of amazing. The deep rich sound is really great!  My computer actually has 2 settings for them you can choose either Hands Free or Stereo.  The Stereo setting is the way to go.  Really great when watching Netflix on the computer. You pick up every sound in the show you are watching.  I haven't had a phone call yet  so I cannot comment on the quality of that. I will write back when I have some experience in that area. But from a music stand point....BRAVO!!  Best value around!!
1,"Connected easy, track controls, great deal"
0,"Was ok for a month or so but does not connect anymore.<br />Battery life was fine, but now it does not connect anymore to 2 different devices.<br />Worked for about a month on each and then nothing.<br />So not sure what happened."
1,These are great. I don't know why anyone would pay $150 for a more expensive pair. Battery life is good. Sound quality seems good. They stay in your ears and the price is right.
0,Headphones are nice but the first time my ears touched pool water they died. After drying out they were not operating. I don't understand how people say they are waterproof. They are if you do not let your ears touch the water!
1,Very happy with these great sound and price.
0,Worked great for the first few months but now it wont stay connected to my phone even when fully charged.
1,I like them. First set of Bluetooth headphones I've used. Though the instructions about getting them fully charged first was important. My phone couldn't find them on Bluetooth before they were fully charged. There is a slight moment after connecting that they have a hard time playing my music. Feels like the total connection is either slow or takes a moment for them to fully setup. Shrug no issue though.
0,Bass very loud in one ear more than the other.
1,"Nice phones.  I use them in the gym.  Sound quality is good.  For the most part they stay on well during workout.  I ended up using the largest ear pieces.  No issues with bluetooth connection, paired right up to my phone.  Would recommend."
1,Comfortable and clear sound.
1,Good headphones. Useful for running.
1,"Working outside in 100+ temps, these ear buds stayed in place and never caused a single problem."
1,I must admitt these work better than i thought.Especially for the price..I'm thinking on buying another pair
1,"Fantastic sound, easy to pair, inexpensive....and to use a bad pun...they beat...Beats on all counts.  Why pay $150 for a headset when Senso outperforms the competition for about 1/4 the cost?  After utilizing their great customer service I’m completely sold."
1,It’s great
1,Great sound quality. Noise cancelling. Comfortable to wear.
1,"Great for working out. Excellent quality sound. So far no problems, working great!"
1,"The design is a little bit too big. But it's very good, good sound, ..."
1,"I was super impressed with:<br /><br />1) Ease of use...just a push of the multi-function button and my iphone7 paired in seconds.<br /><br />2) Sound is better that anything I've tried costing 3-4 times as much<br /><br />3) Packed with great accessories<br /><br />4) Price...I bought 3 because I'll give 1 as a gift and also have a spare.<br /><br />5) They fit better than anything I've ever tried<br /><br />The best deal I've had on anything I've purchased online. I hope they hold up well, but they do have a 1 year warranty which is nice."
1,"I just received my SENSO bluetooth wireless earbuds and my first impression is it came with a bunch of stuff: chargers, extra earbud tips(different sizes), carry case, setup instructions, ect. So, I turned them on, easily paired them and started listening to different types of music to see how they sounded compared to my beats3, and my wireless yurbuds. One set is for home workouts, one set for strickly running and this set was for work. These were on 35 bucks so i can afford to buy another pair if these break at work. For the price, i don't think you can beat them. Rap sounded awesome, hard rock sounded great as well. just as good as my other 2 sets in my opinion. Bass and treble was very nice without distortion. Noise cancelling was good too. The only reason i didn't give them 5 stars was because the earhooks are pretty flimsy. they are not like the beats. the beats can be formed for you ear size where as these have no forming ability. they are strictly for keeping them from falling off your ears. Its not that big of a deal but i prefer the beats in that sense. Once you get the right earbud tip on based on your ear, they shouldn't try to come off anyways. Overall, for the money you cant beat them, they sound great and they're easy to use. i havent had a chance to test the 8hr battery life yet but other reviewers said they were just about 8hrs of life so im not too worried about that."
1,Headphones were received in a timely manner and they worked just as advertised.  Very nice set of headphones for the money!
1,"These earbuds are terrific! Comfortable and the sound quality is amazing. My ears are too small to accommodate regular hard earbuds and would not stay in short of using glue or tape- neither which would be recommended by any physician. I love them, thank you!"
1,"I purchased 2 pair for my husband and I. I have beats earbuds,  but they are wired, and i wanted wireless for exercise. When I received them, i immediately paired with my galaxy S7 and turned on google play. The packaging is great, the accessories are great, and the sound is unbelievable. I am so disappointed that I ever wasted money on the beats earbuds. These earbuds are all that I could want and more, and super affordable. Both my husband and I love them. They have loud, quality sound, they are comfortable, they stay in place, and they are cheap, who could ask for more."
1,"Just came in and I worked out with them for two hours straight. I'm a cross trainer and body builder, these head phones have so much base, they stay on your ear even when walking on your hands, they feel flimsy, but that's why the are comfortable!! Great buy !!"
1,Very high quality!  Sound is excellent!  Great value for the money!
1,They work very well the sound is very good they hold the charge all day
1,"Be careful, use the case. My son put it in the bag, and it broke into pieces. I have to put them back together."
1,I don't know if it was me or the product which is why I'm only docking one star but I was not able to adjust the wrap around you ear  part sock ended up giving it to my fiance.
0,I bought this item twice. The first time it only lasted a week. I purchased another one as I like the sound quality but sadly it only lasted a little over a month.
1,This is the second pair that I've had.  These things are workhorses.  The pair I'm listening to right know are 4 years old!  Insane!
0,EDIT-TO BE FAIR- Please read my full review and the manufacturers reply and my reply again!<br />These do not sound ANYTHING like described. The mids are muddy and the so called treble? It's nearly non existent. I contacted the company by email but had no reply. I have had many bluetooth headphones. This is the first that I have sent back.
0,The perfect headphones in my eyes and my daughters.<br />Well here it is just a few months after I purchased these headphones and they wont turn on now. My daughter is a little disappointed to say the least so make sure you buy a warranty if you do purchase these. They stepped right up and replaced them as soon as I contacted them. I'll keep updating as I go.<br />Well just a short time later this pair of headphones also crackled out on the left side. In reading more reviews it seems to be a common problem. Now I have to return this defunct pair of headphones and be without for what is an obvious ongoing manufacturing problem. I know I am getting turned off more and more buying &#34;Amazons Choice's&#34; and not liking that I am paying to get taking advantage of.<br />Here it is just a six months after the second replacement pair and they died. I spent 23 bucks for a pair off ebay 5 years ago that still work no problem....
1,The sound is great and the instructions to use the headphones are simple....I am enjoying my workouts now....no strings (wires attached). Thank you
1,Very happily surprised great sound great bass good battery life and most importantly 50-100$ less than what I was told I would have to spend for the quality only drawback I would say is if you're working out I can't imagine they'd stay in ur ear the whole time
1,"So these don't always stay as tight in my ears as I would like, but they hold better than most earbuds and the sound is fantastic."
0,"Worked great for a year, then nothing. Invest in a good pair of earphones instead of spending $30 or so every year to replace a crappy pair."
0,Big disappointment... I bought these headphones b/c the apple buds are really uncomfortable and I needed something that would tend to stay in my ears while being active. While bulky the earbuds were comfortable and for the most part stayed put while riding my bike which was a nice surprise. Things went downhill from there really quick as I noticed the sound quality was far from great.. the bass is absolutely dreadful. The speakers crack and distort with the slightest bit of bass and that's a real disappointment. These headphones are just about useless if it can't play music with reasonable sound quality. Will be requesting refund.<br /><br />I'm surprised by the 5 star reviews honestly... I read through a lot of them before buying but I'm starting to think that maybe these were fake reviews now.<br /><br />Don't buy this product if sound quality means anything to you.
1,Durable good quality
1,Bought a pair for my daughter. She raved about them so much that I got another pair for my wife and she loves them too. Great carrying case also. Fantastic value!!
1,works great would buy again
1,Lasted longer than any of the expensive brands ive bought
1,They are comfortable and sound great!
1,Comfortable. Great sound. Excellent battery life. A good buy.
1,"This product could of easily be a 5 star product. My main problem with Senso is that their products don't stand the test of time. Once one of their headphones hits near the 1 year warranty mark or right after, the product is at risk of malfunctioning or having it's life being cut short and no amount of charging can resurrect it back to life. I'm being a bit generous by giving this product 3 stars. This is my 3rd headset and 2 months in, the left headphone bud has a slight decrease in sound. This impacts the quality tremendously for this model in particular because of it's emphasis on it's bass quality. I really wish Senso can enhance their products to be more durable and sturdy against time. I'm not asking for decades long Toyota like quality, but at least until I can get around the proper expenses of having the budget for a new headphone. The quality is amazing in these headphones and are a great investment as oppose to burning your wallet in an open flame for the sake of some beats headphones. I just wish for better longevity."
0,"Sound quality is great. It initially appeared to be of high quality. However, I was forced to believe the opposite after the power button got sunk in and is stuck in that &quot;pressed&quot; position, making it unusable.  I live outside the USA, so it's very inconvenient to me to return the product. I am, hence, stuck with another poor quality pair of bluetooth headphones. Not recommended at all!"
1,"I purchased this item for my son-in-law who is very discriminating about electronic gear. I had to wait a few days to get some feedback from him and I think he said it all with one sentence: ""These earphones have a much better sound than others I have tried that were much more expensive."" The message is clear: Your company sells great quality merchandise at competitive prices. Who would not want to recommend your business and great service to anyone looking for this type of merchandise?  I heartily recommend you as a source for well-made gear and courteous service."
1,"I lost my airpods and needed a replacement, didn't want anything too expensive (I can't trust myself). These are pretty good. They mostly stay on nice and tight while running, need one or two occasional adjustments, but nothing terrible. I think the sound quality is great for a running headphone. You can't go wrong with these!"
1,I'm surprised at the quality of the product
1,Awesome sounding earbuds! Great for working out! Sweat resistant as promised and great fit. I would definitely recommend these bluetooth earbuds!
1,I just tested them and they sound good. Good quality for price
1,The product delivers on all key features.
1,A gift and he enjoys using it with TV or droid.
1,"I think if they were not so much overselling in the title (waterproof, noise cancellation etc.) I would have rated in 5 stars.<br />Cons...<br />First of all, it is not waterproof as I was lucky enough to go through reviews before taking them to the pool with me. They are only advised to be used under rain and not while swimming.<br /><br />Second, they are not noise cancelling, they merely come with earbuds that are very similar to night time ear buds that foams in your ear and blocks some of the noise, but of course this is not the definition of noise cancellation. On the other hand it is a great fit.<br /><br />Third; they seem like a bit heavy on the bass but you can correct that with the equalizer of the source (for ex. when listening spotify)<br /><br />Fourt; the mic sucks, especially if you have paired it with 2 devices. So think twice if you are planning to buy this for talking on the phone much.<br />the mic. seems to have a problem when it is connected to 2 devices. when I am only on my mobile I can talk without needing to remove the ear with the mic and holding it to my mouth.<br />Pros..<br /><br />1- Very light and good fit with the foam like ear buds. however if you need to put on the regular type earbuds because these are somehow small or else than it looses all the touch.<br /><br />2- eventough it is not advertised, they match with 2 devices which is great. so I can listen the music from my computer but talk through them when I receive a call on my mobile. However, as I wrote before the mic. seems to have a problem when it is connected to 2 devices. when I am only on my mobile I can talk without needing to remove the ear with the mic and holding it to my mouth."
0,Have had these for 6 months and now they won’t charge anymore. Every time I plug it in it flashes blue and red
1,"These headphones are far better than I could have imagined. They linked easily with my phone, they sound great, they fit well, they're comfortable, and they are easy to use. Great product!"
1,"Just okay to me; sound is decent for the price. Good battery, quick connectivity, and overall meets expectations for the price point. I do find them terribly uncomfortable and can’t wear them for an extended period of time."
1,So far so good. Great for the price. I’m so happy I didn’t pay for the really expensive name brand headphones
1,Sound great and light weight and last a while.
1,Very good sound quality they did stop working 7 months old but they did not hesitate to replace .
1,nice case and earbud variety.  sound is excellent!
1,I liked everything about the earphones!
1,Great headphones. This is my first time purchasing wireless headphones and I really like them. They are good quality ar an excellent price.
0,"I just don't think these sound very good. Also, the Bluetooth connection gets kind of choppy and will go through stretches where it cuts out about 4 or 5 times in a few seconds. That happens every few minutes when I use these. I use three different Bluetooth speakers and have used four different wired earbuds on my phone, and these are the only ones that sound bad enough for me to have to go into the phone's equilizer and try to tweak it to make it sound decent. Even after tweaking they still don't sound as good as stock earbuds."
1,"Got these for my wife and she used them one time and really loved the convenience of being wireless while jogging. She also loved the sound quality. However, after using them once ... they no longer worked. I contacted support and they immediately responded and were able to help me with a replacement."
1,"So far, I like the headphones.  I haven't had any issues.  They are very easy to use."
1,Love them a lot! Good quality for the price
1,Highly recommend it! I use it all day and everyday!
0,"work well but, not really comfortable, maybe good if  you are dumbo with big ear.<br />all accessory show , not exist , replace by BS  accessory .<br />i m kind of desapointed ."
1,"Second time ordering this product. Destroyed first pair... Toddler consistently yanking them, falling asleep in them. Used them everyday, all day. Stepped on them. Never had a problem.. Until now and re-ordered same pair. Never had a pair lasting this long until these senso."
0,I bought the head phones in February 2017 - absolutely loved them up until they stopped charging last week. I was just about to buy a second pair to keep at work until this set took a dive after four months.
1,"AS these are for the gym and are subject to abuse this is my 2nd pair, which says volumes. The sound is great and battery length is excellent!"
1,"Nice Headphones, sound is real Hd  Im really Happy with this product.."
0,"Ordered a pair in February. After a month, they went haywire; skipping and turning off for no reason. Got a replacement pair. They worked fine for a month, but then started skipping, turning themselves off for no reason, and randomly voice dialing."
1,"I was expecting more from the headphones since they were listed as sport headphones.  They do not grip my ear like i was expecting and do not feel as secure as less expensive models.  I do like the wrap around feature but again, they do not feel as secure as i would like when running.  Good quality sound, extra ear buds nice and the carrying case also nice.  Great for walking!"
1,"Excellent investment. Well made, great sound, quality case and extra earpieces. Free one year warranty shows that these are built to last.  Over ear soft hooks work well, holding on my headphones when I am working out. Nice bonus products included in box with earphones... The magnetic mobile phone car mount really works,  The stick on credit card holder is going to my wife."
0,These earbuds worked really well for 2 years.  Recently went to use and heard a zap and now they no longer charge.  We tried different chargers but seems like they are toast.
1,Can't go wrong for the price . after a while the wire that wraps around the ears got loose from headphone and doesn't really hold well to ear anymore.
1,"I just sent these earbuds through the clothes washer and dryer by accident... and they still work! Are these perfect earbuds? No. Are they worth $20? Absolutely.<br /><br />These are definitely not meant for outdoor use. As others have noted with the slightest breeze (eg if you run with any speed at all) you get a distracting whooshing noise from air going past the earbuds.  Other than that I'm pretty happy.  They are tolerably comfortable, my music sounds good, the batteries haven't run out on me yet, and they don't seem to mind my sweat or the rain I run in. Once in a while they get confused when in the presence of multiple bluetooth sources and get in an annoying state where the sound is garbled, but I've learned how to get them to settle out with resetting and pausing."
1,"This was the fourth pair of budget bluetooth earbuds I have owned. All the others were not as good as this pair that I have. I use these earbuds daily and feel like they are greatly designed earbuds and that fit on my ears well and do not create any pain. . A few of my friends own powerbeats and I think these can definitely compare if not better. The sound quality is good for the price and has a good amount of bass. However if you listen to heavy, bass EDM songs it won't be that great. I love the fact that the ear hooks are silicon so they wrap along your ear comfortably. Great battery life as well (8hrs+). These are a must buy if you want a good pair of working out bluetooth earbuds!"
1,Great headphones.  Perfect for working out.
1,The only problem I find the lowest volume is still too loud. I like the comfort of the earphones themselves.
1,"Love them, they've lasted me a whole lot longer than Beats have and these have a really long lasting battery they're perfect"
1,"Just started using them, and so far, I'm very happy. Easy to set up, great sound quality!"
1,Comfortable and easy to use.  Sounds good and comes with plenty of accessories. Headphones stopped working after 6 months but senso sent out a replacement.
1,"Originally purchased these headphones in January 2017 - I really started using them when the weather got warmer and they are my go-to headphones when I'm working in the yard, particularly mowing on my zero turn.<br />A couple weeks ago, after about 6 months of light use, I took them off my head and they wouldn't turn off (or on) - the button just quit working.<br />I contacted Invotek and let them know my situation.  I was very impressed to hear back from them within HOURS, not days.  Since I was well within my 1 year warranty, they just shipped me a  new set, which I received quickly - so quickly that I never even had to mow without them because the mailman showed up in my driveway as I was getting my mower out of my garage.  There was charge on the battery  and I was off and mowing with my ballgames and tunes!<br />I was thoroughly impressed with the customer service, and for this reason alone, I give them 5 stars.  It's a good product (I hope this pair lasts longer than 6 months) and Invotek's service was as good as it gets."
0,"They stopped working after one week of wear. They won't even turn on now. Sound quality was good, but only for the time that they worked."
1,"very pleased with these, amazed at how good the microphone is.  So pleased, I bought another set for spouse."
1,Just bought second set.. first one was destroyed in a motorcycle mishap. Work VERY well! Use everyday.
1,"These are really nice, especially for the price.  Very omfortable, pretty decent noise reduction.  I don't know how long they go until needing a recharge (I only used them for about 2 hours at a time), but so far, so good."
1,They fall out of my ears when I’m at the gym. Might be bc I sweat a lot but idk. They have good sound though.
1,"Had to return these. They didn’t fit nicely and really just weren’t worth the money. I’m very picky when it comes to my head phones. They did what they adviertised, music quality was ok. I prefer my Bose instead. Great for the price."
1,"So far, love them. Great sound!"
0,Quit working at 4 months
1,"No longer a skeptic, these sound awesome! The range is incredible , from acoustic to metal. Easy setup, user friendly, and amazing price. These will be my new go-to headphones!!!"
1,"Bose ear buds were the best but they were too small, fell out of my ears, and I lost 2 sets.  Jaybird was expensive as heck and I flat couldn't get them to fit in my ears.<br />The SENSO, so far, both fits, doesn't fall out on to the pavement, and sounds fantastic.  I previously paid approximately 10 times the cost of the SENSO and got nothing for my money.<br /><br />These are great"
1,So far so good.  Super quick delivery. Fits well.  Sounds great. Stays in place.  Easy to navigate.  Would recommend highly.  Couldn't get it to connect to BlueTooth at first but rebooted my phone and it worked.
1,I've had these for a few weeks now and they fall out.  The first week they were good but the sides become flimsy and when I run they don't stay in my ears.  They work good they just don't stay put for me.
1,Great earbuds
0,"Bought these april 2017.  February 2018 they have disintegrated- ear bud dangling from the frame by a wire. Took good care of them, use at gym 4-5 days / week. Very unhappy with these.  Would give zero stars if i could."
1,I bought these to replace my $100 plus set. I figured lets give these a shot instead of spending over $100 on another Famous brand. Best $25 spent! and sound just as good as wife's $150 brand name set. My previous $100 brand name set charging connection broke off in headset after about a year of use. I need the wrap around ear feature as I have yet to find a set without this feature that stay in place during workouts. These did not disappoint.
1,Hard to keep these in ears.
0,"I purchased this product in the beginning of January 2018.  The sound quality was good and the fit was nice?  I sweat A LOT when I exercise, but the buds stayed in place.  The cord would stick to my neck at times, while running, and eventually would tug off one of the buds - oh well.<br />The reason that I'm giving this product two stars is because recently the headphones would die after only 2 to 3 hours of use.  Today they completely died on me while at the gym 5/8/2018.  I only got 4 months use  out of these headphones.  SMH."
1,I mean I guess it is on the side of your head what can you expect.
1,Working very well I love it.
1,love them
1,I did brought the senso Bluetooth Headphones for a gift BUT I did not give the gift yet
1,"I give these 4 stars because they don't have a button on the headphones to change the song, whereas my past headsets have, and no vocal battery life status.<br />I like them a lot though, GREAT noise cancelling, more comfortable without my glasses, and sits well around my neck when I don't have them in at the moment. I have a Galaxy S6 for now and it pairs with no problems The bass is pretty decent to me as well and I listen to a lot of DJs (Bonobo, Gramatik, Emancipator, etc). If anything, you could always adjust the sounds settings on your phone.<br /><br />Hopefully mine wont go out after a few months or so like the other reviews have stated."
0,"I've been wearing these to the gym for abut 6 weeks now.  I love the little carrying case and it feels great to not be attached to a wire.  Good sound quality and the battery seems to hold up for awhile before I plug it back in.  Glad I picked them.<br />Update: I have had these for 6 months. I plugged them in to charge, and just in that act, the button that increases/decreases volume along with other functions just fell off.  I tried to put it back on, but it would not stay.  I have not used these roughly, and always kept them in a bag to take and use at the gym 2 or 3 times a week.  I was the only user.  They still work, but I will definitely choose another brand the next time."
1,"All I can say is Wow! Since purchasing these headphones in May, they have been my Go To headphones. I wear them every day, all day, until they need recharging and I sadly have to switch to a different pair while the Senso recharge. Recently, the Sensos developed a pairing problem.  Would not pair with phone or laptop. I was bummed. After a couple of emails with Senso support, who were incredibly responsive, it was determined there was a problem with the headphones. I offered to return them. Instead, they sent me a brand new pair in less than four days and just in time for a 8 hour plane ride! Great product. Phenomenal support! Senso, you have a customer for life! Thank you!"
1,Item arrived as described and works as proposed and intended. Relatively light weight with a secure fit while running and lifting. I have no complaints so far.
1,"Ordered them Sunday morning, had them Sunday night. Used them all evening. Great sound. Very impressed given their price. Added goodies too. Magnetic cellphone holder. Nice! Highly recommend."
1,I just started using them. Great sound at such an affordable price.
1,Perfect
1,These headphones sound amazing! My husband loved them but his dad talked him into giving them to him so we need to buy another pair lol.
0,"These headphones were fine when I first got them. Decent (but not great) battery life, and good quality sound. However, I bought them only 2 months ago and they have already stopped working and won't charge."
0,"I thought these sucked. The over-the-ear hook is way too large, and the only tips that will hold them somewhat in place are the foam tips - even then, if you sweat a little, they will work themselves out of your ears without much motion to help them. The sound quality is okay, but those two issues were dealbreakers for me. Look for something in the $40 range, and forget the over-the-ear hooks."
1,Great sound. Great purchase.
1,"Great pair of head phones. They have held up incredibly well, and I'll definitely buy another pair if these ones fail."
1,"Great sound and battery life in an inexpensive product.  I'm only at the end of week-one with Senos Active but I'm happy with my choice. The earbuds fit comfortable and do not cause discomfort after extended periods of use.  Claimed battery life seems accurate at ~8 hours.  Only thing I could want is track control buttons (Figured out after a couple weeks that a long press on the up and down volume is track control).<br /><br />10-month follow-up.<br />Headset was working great for 1-2 hours of use per day until the left earpiece started shorting out. I contacted the Amazon vendor, Tekatron, and they helped troubleshoot and then replace the headset. Despite the malfunction, the overall experience has been great. This headset is perfect for running, has good audio quality, and great support from the vendor and manufacturer."
1,used everyday.
0,Not made for smaller ears.
1,"Great value, good sound, solid and fast connection with my Samsung Note 5. Love them!"
1,Work great! I am a big guy and sweat a ton and they hold up great.
0,"I bought these as a gift for someone and tested them out when they arrived without any issue on my phone. The sound quality was decent, the depth of the bass was above average I’d say, the treble and middle tons were kind of hollow sounding, not as rich as nicer options but still I was happy with them. The construction seemed okay, the ear loop seemed somewhat flimsy.<br /><br />The biggest issue is THEY NEVER CONNECTED TO ANY PHONE AGAIN. Never detectable on Bluetooth. Read the manual online at least 10 times, followed every step repeatedly. Did the factory reset, turned phones on and off and not one time was the headset detectable. Completely frustrating and embarrassing as a gift."
0,I’ve had these for almost a year and don’t use them everyday. At first they were great for the gym. Then I started noticing them cutting out when they were in the pockets of my workout pants or coat. Then when they were not in a pocket they simply stopped working.
1,Very poor sound quality
1,"I absolutely loved this product. I've been using it at the gym and have even increased my exercise performance. Having a great quality wireless headphones made a huge difference on my concentration & focus.Thank you!"""
1,I have only used then a couple of times.<br />But so far do good.
1,"I wore these to the gym for the first time today. As someone who wears EarPods regularly, I was immediately and pleasantly surprised to find them nearly as comfortable in my ear. Beside being wireless, the other advantage that became apparent was the rubberized over-ear piece, which too was remarkably comfortable and kept them in place during my entire workout.<br /><br />Sound quality is much, much better than I expected for wireless headphones at this price point. Highs are clear and the bass is crisp when Hendrix is cranked to the volume I need to drown out the piped-in pop that plays at the gym.<br /><br />I *love* that these come with a case, a car charger and two charging cables, since that means I can leave them in the car and I won't have to hunt them down when it is time to go to the gym.<br /><br />I don't see myself giving up my EarPods for everyday use, since--in my opinion--these fall short of them for comfort and sound. But when I want to be untethered from my iDevices, these will do the trick quite well."
1,"These recently went through a full load cycle wash and about an hour of dryer time, they still work perfectly. Most credit cards can't handle that sort of treatment. 10/10 would use Gain again"
1,"These headphones were awesome, great quality. I sweat a lot and they stayed put during my long runs and workouts. However they stopped working after 6 months of use, but I called customer service and they were AWESOME at replacing them and sending me new ones. I'm very grateful and satisfied with this product and the customer service team."
1,"The price on these threw me off at first, didn't expect to get great quality for so cheap. But oh gosh these headphones are AWESOME! Such incredible quality for the price, great sound, great fit and they last for a good while before needing a charge. Would highly recommend these to anyone in the market for affordable wireless headphones."
1,These are great for an inexpensive pair of Bluetooth buds. They fit comfortably and stay on and in your ear. The sound is great...especially for $35. Highly recommend
1,"Earbuds don't always fit in my ears, but these work well for me."
1,"Bought as a birthday present for my husband and he loves them. Great sound, stay in ears and easy to use."
1,"Easily paired, comfortable and good sound"
1,I bought these when another pair from a different company fell apart. I'm very happy with the quality of the sound and the build. They feel substantial and sturdy. I'm very happy with them.
1,"Really nice sound quality. Seem to be well designed,time will tell. I'm really blown away about this Custmer Service. Just got mine yesterday,and a really nice E-Mail about my satisfaction with product. Yes,yes,I'd recommend to get these, and this Company as well."
1,"Bought this for my wife.  She likes it so far, audio quality not the most amazing but overall comfortable and great price!"
1,"Excellent sound, very light it feels like you have nothing on your ears, great connection, happy with my purchase."
1,"These headphones got great reviews, but...even I can tell that the sound quality on these is not very good (and I’m not usually bothered by cheap headphones). They also look kind of weird, especially when the light is blinking on the front of your ear. I think if you’re going to go Bluetooth/wireless, you’ve got to spend a lot more money to get a decent pair. For me, it wasn’t worth it. Returned these and I’m sticking with the Apple wired headphones that came free with my iPod."
1,It’s pretty comfortable wearing it while running on the trail.
1,"I love these headphones. They sound nice, the battery lasts long, the buttons work well! The only complaint I have is that it will connect to two devices sometimes and makes a weird beep if it does. It also gets mad(and beeps at me) when you turn down the volume too much, sometimes to me it's still too loud but it won't let me turn it down anymore."
1,"Great response, immediate delivery would definitely recommend!"
1,"Have owned these for a few weeks and very easy to operate.  Was worried that others may not hear me well when using the microphone for cell calls, but people say they can hear me fine.  Great purchase so far..."
1,"Great for running, stays in ears and also great for voice calls when working from home all day."
1,so far everything has been perfect... and the sound quality is outstanding!!  I can wear them under or over my sun glasses and comfortable either way. Impressed with everything to this point and SENSO has given me a good feeling about their support should I ever need it..
1,"The product is great...when working. After a week of use, the buds would not hold a charge...called customer service and they immediately replaced the unit. The second unit worked fine for about a month, then stopped holding a charge. Called CS again, and again they replaced the unit.  Excellent product...when it isn't all buss' up. Just received replacement today...stand by...(third time charm???)"
1,"This is a quality product, and I got exactly what I was expecting. The product is the same as described."
1,"I've used these for a few months now; running 3,4 times a week.  Absolutely no problems at all.  They are easy to set up and use while running.  Sound is great.  I love how low the volume goes!  I charge once a week.  Sometimes twice if I use them while walking to work also."
0,"The first 3 times I used them they worked. I enjoyed having them.  Yesterday, I could not sync them to my iPod.  I tried 5 different times.  Frustrating."
1,Just received the Buds. Easy pairing and the sound is great!<br />Looking forward to working out<br />Without wires all over the place.
1,I really liked these and used them every time I exercised. The only issue was the battery life could be longer and they no longer work after a year... but for the price they are great! Just don’t expect them to last too long.
1,These work great
1,Great sound comfortable priced fair
1,works great
1,"Can't really say much as I got them only two days ago, but they are working just fine so far. The sound quality is good and the controls are easy to work."
1,"Love these headphones. Great sound, Great Bass, Quick charging, and best of all very very comfortable highly recommend. Thank you!!!"
1,"Arrived on time! Great headphones to workout with, noise cancellation is awesome and no more fussing with cords while I run."
0,The earbuds are not at all soft and really hurt my ears. Wouldn’t recommend these to anyone.
1,Sometimes takes a couple of tries to connect. Once connected I have had no other issues. Overall a very good product.
1,"These headphones are awesome.  They were easy to connect and sound great for the price.  No they are not beats, but they do beat the beats cost.  I would recommend this product."
1,Great so far only been 2 days
1,"works well!! long battery life, no problem connecting,"
1,Great sound.  Connects easily.  Really like that it has the microphone also.  Good bass.  Can't beat the value.
0,Xmas present.  Broke within 3 weeks.  The connection kept cutting out and then coming back on intermittently.  Had to return.  Disappointed based upon the ratings.
1,Great product. Paired easily and I listened to an audiobook on my walk an hour later. Good purchase from a good supplier. I couldn't be happier.
1,"The best earbuds... EVER.  I have the apple airpods.  I have several other brands as well.  The issue is when I get hot I sweat and the other products quit working, volume decreases, or worse, fall out of my ear.  The SENSO buds don't have this problem.  And they are loud!  Fifty percent on my phone is all I need.  And while they don't sound like my expensive BOSE over the ear headphones, its NEARLY that good which is great for cardio. The price is amazing and the warranty is easy to register for.  Wish I had seen these before I bought the apple airpods.  I could have bought 2 for me and 3 for my wife for the same price!"
1,"I usually favor Skullcandy headphones for their supreme bass feature, but these easily compares to those. The sound quality is great and for the price, such an great purchase. I use it with my phone and laptop, i haven't tried with my PS4 yet though. I highly recommend it."
1,"I bought these to use at work, they sound awesome."
1,Nice Headphones for price sound great sturdy and comfortable what more do you want. Oh yeah PRICE. Only issues some connectivity issues and the flap for charging is tricky but you want headphones BUY THEM.
1,Was very satisfied with the purchase would recommend. Sound real good for the price.
1,"I wasn't really expecting much for such a low price, but I was completely BLOWN AWAY! I use these headphones to listen to music while I'm working and they last through a full 8 hour shift and even into overtime! The only time they've ever actually died, it took 9 and a half hours of solid use!!! Sound quality is actually very good as well. I absolutely cannot believe what a great deal I got on these headphones! 10/10 would absolutely recommend to anyone looking for reliable battery life in Bluetooth headphones."
1,Great product!!!! Great sound!!!!  Long lasting charge!!!  Very comfortable!!!!
1,"Work as advertised, stay affixed in the ears well, as least for walking and gym workout. I do not run with them."
1,"I weight lift and do HIIT with a lot of jumping, burpees, sprinting, ex and they never fall off or bother me. Love them!"
1,amazing sound quality - very comfortable - pleasantly surprised for only $35.  A great value and I'd buy them again at this or any price.<br /><br />UPDATE - these were great for a while but now they won’t connect and are useless.
1,"Good sound, seems to drown outside noise. Still working with ear tips to find a size that doesn’t fall out of my ear. This is a good value for what I’m getting, but I do not have a lot of control of the phone from your pieces, and they are a little bit prominent when they stick out of my ear. But for this price I can live with that."
1,"I base my award of 5 stars on the issue of value.  For the price, these are an excellent choice.  The sound quality is better than average, which is, to my mind, more than what I paid for.  So no, these are not studio quality headphones, but they are far above adequate to my amateurish ear.  They also come with quite a lot of extras, such as a car charger and multiple sets of earbuds.  My only question is durability, which will only be answered with time.  So far, after only a few days of use, I'm impressed."
0,Won’t hold a charge about 6 months after purchase. Constantly disconnects.
1,I will never go without wireless again! Life changer
1,Great Buy
1,"Great value for the price, works perfect at the gym"
1,"I love these headphones for running. They are lightweight, easy to turn on and off while running and mildly good at adapting to my sweat. I had a battery issue (they no longer took a charger after 5 - 6 months. But, after writing Senso directly for my registered product, they were quick to send out a replacement pair and offered suggestions to how I could fix issues with mine. The fast response and being taken seriously was important. Solid product, especially for the price. Recommended."
1,Loved these headphones but the left ear stopped working after 4 months . So I used my warranty and they hooked me up with another pair<br /><br />But these headphones
1,I think these will work well. I got these for an upcoming trip but they paired well with my phone and have good sound quality. Pleased so far.
1,"This headset checks every box - good sound, comfortable and stays in place on my ear. Bought a second one for my wife and was not disappointed. Good value at the price."
1,My mom loved it!
1,"Excelent service! The bluetooth headphones are easy to use, anatomical and provide excelent service."
1,"I'm very pleased with the headphones.  The earhooks are so flexible that it takes a little more effort to get them on, but once on they are very comfortable. Sound is good both with music and phone calls."
1,I have a hearing problem in my left ear therefore these really help.
1,"I looked at a variety of headphones,both more and less expensive, before choosing the SENSO.  The S-250 seemed to have all the features I needed. They are very comfortable and easy to use. Excellent value for the price.<br /><br />Just purchase  second set of these for my husband. I've used for over a year and have been very pleased. Great sound quality!"
1,I work out 5 days a week and these things are awesome!
1,"I like the headphones. I will give them 4 stars. It also comes with a very nifty cord that doubles as headphones charger and an iPhone charger. I love the idea, but the cord became faulty within a couple of weeks. I have been traveling for the last two months and this was my opportunity to write about it. Shame about the cord. The cord gets 1 star.<br />After contacting Sensi several times, I have given up on them. They promised a replacement cord 3 times and I have never received it. Their comments below did not follow through with the mailing of the cord as promised. The headphones are worthless without a charging cord. Another product goes to the trash!!!<br />August 12: Update: The replacement cord finally arrived after several months. Buyer beware!"
1,Got the headphones awhile back and they work great and never had a problem with it for a good amount of time<br /><br />At some point the power button had been defective and the company sent me a replacement headset! I was more over the moon than could be.<br /><br />Updated:<br />1/20/18<br /><br />At some point the audio did go out on my left piece and my I was having audio issues as well. I brought it up to the company who asked me to do a warranty replacement. Got my replacements today and they work wonderful<br /><br />Great customer service and great company<br /><br />Thank You
1,Great product.  Love the sound.  Comfortable.
1,Works great and fits snug in my ears.  I use them for working out and don't ever have to adjust them.
1,Great product. Paired with my phone the first time and used it during my workout and had very good sound quality
0,"not great , POOR sound quality, you can find better elsewhere"
0,I've bought these ear buds before and I got new ones because I lost them and with this pair I am having alot of issues! I tried countless ways to fix  the ear buds from automatically disconnecting and connecting every frickin 20 seconds non stop and the ear buds still  do not work! I would please like a replacement asap !
1,I think these are great!  I chose from the great reviews I read and I can’t find a flaw.  Thanks for creating a great product at a reasonable price.
1,"Not too many years ago, I purchased a set of highly rated, &#34;state of the art&#34; and expensive wire connected in-ear head phones. They were quite good.<br />When I purchased these Ivotek wireless SENSO Bluetooth Headphones  for my wife who listens to music with her iphone while at the gym or at home, I didn't expect they would be as good as my older &#34;state of the art&#34; wire connected earphones.<br /> I was wrong. These Senso Bluetooth wireless headphones sound just as good and are better in terms of comfort and convenience....and they are less than 1/5 the cost of the  highly rated, &#34;state of the art &#34; headphones  I purchased a few years ago.<br />Of note too,  is that the owners of this product have followed up this purchase with an email to be sure I am completely satisfied. If I am not satisfied or am having problems, I can respond directly to the email or call  the provided telephone number.  A very good product at a very good price and dedicated customer service rates 5 stars."
1,This is my first pair of blue tooth ear buds and I love them.  They come with a nice variety of accessories and a great case to carry them in.  They last a few long time in between charges.  I highly recommend them.
1,"Over all it's a good average workout headset, but I didn't keep this product because it didn't fit well."
1,"These headphones were quite a surprise when they arrived. They came with several charging cables, a car adapter, a zip up case, various rubber buds, far more than I expected! So far I have used them extensively while running and working out and they don't cut out at all. The sound quality is a little less than my EarPods but that's nothing I have a problem with. I have yet to test the water resistant feature since it's IPX7 but time will tell of these were a great deal or temporary pleasure."
1,Love everything except for over the ear part would be better if adjustable.
1,They would kinda cut in and out as if they were wired or like poor connection but other then that happening a few times it pretty good for the price
1,Very comfortable and easy to link to phone.<br />Excellent sound and volume.<br />Had to get my original set replaced they quit working. The customer service was awesome. E-mailed with my problem and within 2 hours my new headphones were being processed for replacement. Staff was very helpful and prompt in their response to my issue. I highly recommend this product. The customer service is heads and shoulders above the rest.
0,"Sound quality is great, but the biggest con to these ear buds are that they do not stay put. I have tried the different sizes (which I do not think they included the small size in my packaging) and they immediately fall out while running. The plastic piece that is supposed to fit around the ear is way to big. I have to try and tuck the plastic in my hair to stay in place.  I read other reviews that say the plastic is bendable which is not true. If you are planning on running, jumping, or a vigorous workout I would not suggest these headphones. The price point is okay but when these go I would not purchase again."
1,I am truly amazed by this awesome product
1,Why pay $110.00 for wireless earphones when these little guys do the trick? I charged these up and hit the treadmill with no slipping or falling out of place. The instructions were great and easy to follow so pairing with my iPod was a breeze. They come with all the extras the triple figures buds come with at a fraction of the price but all the sound and quality.
1,"We bought one pair for one family member, and another saw them and we needed to order a second pair. They are comfortable, easy to use."
1,"This is my first purchase of Bluetooth headphones. I have always been unwilling to give up sound quality for the convenience of Bluetooth. Regardless of the number of pairs of wired headphones / airbuds I would destroy, I kept going back to them. When I decided to take the Bluetooth plunge I spent hours of research, looking to find the best bang for the buck. I will say without a doubt that Invotek's SENSO Bluetooth headphones are absolutely amazing. I find that I am now listening to music, podcasts, etc. at times that I never used to because the wire would get in the way. And the sound quality from SENSO is incredible. I have lost almost nothing in sound but gained a boat load of freedom. I LOVE THIS PURCHASE!"
1,"So far so good, Bluetooth is great.  Sound is good... Battery life good..."
1,They were loud and hood quality but a lot more bass than I expected and not even clear bass all the time. Needs more crisp notes and treble range. I like that it can be in shallow water for up to 30 minutes though. Makes showering and swimming more fun.
1,Very cool earbuds with great people standing behind their product!!
1,Great product! The battery will last forever.  I use it for times a week and  I only have to charge it every three months. After a couple miles the earbuds do tend to get sweaty as with most products. But they rarely fall out. Good purchase!
1,Connectivity is the worst feature about the product. Someone I starts to go out when my phone is in my pocket or when its in my hand.<br /><br />Sound is good for the price. I primarily wanted something that was wireless for the gym or when im working around the house. The only problem is when I have my phone in my pockets. Other than that the product is fine.
1,"Since there are a lot of brands that are priced much higher, I didn't want to write before I give myself enough time to experience the quality of the sound. To my good surprise I found that the SENSO Bluetooth Headphones provide a high quality stereo sound that is both deep and without any static. The battery life is as long as 8 hours or a little more. The material is good and the box contains various sizes of ear buds. I think it competes very well with other higher-priced Bluetooth Headphones."
1,"No complaints. Great sound, they don't fall out when running and it pairs easily with a phone without dropping connection. Plus having a warranty is nice."
1,THEY ARE GREAT!!!!!!!!
1,"I've had these for about ten months. I use them at the gym and when reading as the loud coffee shop on campus. At the gym, they work great, though there are moments when they randomly cut out even though I'm only a few feet away. This happens very rarely though. At the coffee shop, they do a relatively good job of cutting out outside noise and the music of the shop. Though I've been impressed with them, I never felt compelled to write a review for them... until today.<br /><br />A few days ago the left earphone stopped working (this is probably partially due to how I throw them around and in my gym bag, as well the normal beating they take at the gym). I emailed Senso customer care and they provided a troubleshooting method that did not work. Since the headphones come with a year-long warranty though, they sent me a new pair. They did not even ask for the old pair back! I was so impressed with the quickness of customer care's response, and the ease of solving the issues, that I had to write a review.<br /><br />Top notch company and product! I would recommend these headphones to anyone!"
0,Im not sure about how I feel since I cannot pair it to my Samsung Note 4.
1,"Love the headphones, I already have co-workers ordering some for themselves."
1,"Very comfortable. Pairing was easy and immediate. Sound quality is good for my purposes (mainly voice, podcasts, etc). I am a bicycle commuter and they fit comfortably under my helmet. I would recommend these. I was not paid and did not receive an incentive for this review."
1,"The sound quality on these headphones is amazing! Great for working out with high intensity. At times, I find that the wrap around portion of the ear buds (while comfortable) is a bit loose. Otherwise, this was a great buy for the fit life I lead."
1,So I wanted Bluetooth earbuds for working out and corded earbuds were a hassle.  These were the tight price and get the job done.  Plus they come in a nice case.  Very happy with my purchase. Recommend these for anyone who can't see paying for overpriced ones.
1,Best Bluetooth earbuds I have ever had!!! Works without causing pain to ear and definitely sounds excellent!!
1,Even better than expected!  Great sound!
0,This is my third pair. They don’t last more than three months.  Will not buy again.
0,Will not hold a charge over one hour<br />Does not sinc up with all apple products<br />Looks great and feels great but it does not work well as advertised
1,"Great for going on a run. The audio quality isn't perfect, but is great for the price."
1,"Not sure how they could sell these for $170.00 but at the current($37) price point they're a great deal! First, the audio is pretty good, the sound is nice and clear also they can get quite loud if you need them to, the bass is fairly decent. The range is also a plus from my old ones I can leave my phone on one side of the gym and they still come in. (decent size gym) the case that they come in is a wonderful added bonus and the looks of the headset and the function are nice. So now the flaws first which I am most disappointed in and I took a star from it is the rubber things that go around your ears they hardly help, I wish they were a little stiffer they're soft and doesn't feel like they help all that much keeping them there. I mean on the other side they aren't hurting your ears if you have em in your ears for long periods of time which I don't really. But they don't slip out that easily they do feel slightly lose tho maybe just cause of my ears and other people might not have this problem but I seem to. I can't question the durability of these since I just got them but they do seem like they'll last unless the have some hardware problems down the road which I'll update if so. So yeah overall no regrets getting these and what everyone has been saying is pretty much on par."
1,Great quality
1,great sound and very comfortable.
1,"Product is great.  Easy to use.  Customer service is fantastic, bought a 2nd pair as a gift."
1,"Works well. Good sounds, easy to use."
1,I purchased these and have used them for a while. They work really well. I have lost them a few times to find that my daughter has been using them! She likes them too. I think I will have to purchase another pair....
1,"Only had them since Xmas 2017 but they seem to offer high quality sound at very reasonable price. I prefer the foam ear tips but only one pair was supplied and Senso do not sell them.  This is a problem as I subsequently bought two sets - Kinden and Veritas.  Kinden foam tips are too big, and these were recommended by Senso. (I made the Kinden's fit but wrapping some duct tape around the nozzle posts, but feel that I should not have to go to these measures).  The ones from Veritas (2.5mm to 3.5 mm) do not fit the nozzle. Perhaps the larger Veritas would fit but I am not spending more money and time on this.  I have contacted Senso but yet to receive a reply on the inner core diameter of the foam tips, and the diameter of the nozzle. My estimates are that the former is 3.97mm and the latter is 4.5mm.  Comply says the 200 would fit, but I am dubious as the inner core of 5mm would exceed the nozzle.  Also spending approximately $20 on Comply's eartips (including shipping) seems ridiculous as this would be two/thirds of the price of Senso's headphones.<br /><br />Update<br />On Monday 27 May 2019 the headsets were failing to connect to my iphone 6s having worked with no problem up until this time.  The connection would last perhaps a couple of mins and then cut out.  Reconnecting was difficult if not impossible and numerous factory resets and unpairing/forgetting the device did not solve the problem.  Therefore the life of the product was about 17-18 months.  I had used the product approximately  400 days over this period at the gym with each session about 1.5 to 2 hours.  I suppose I got pretty good use from the product and perhaps given the purchase price of $30 should not complain too much but I feel let down.  My daughter has a pair that she does not use because the earbuds do not fit her small ear canals.  I will try those and see how they perform before the next purchase whatever that might be."
1,I like the adjustable fitting and it actually has pretty good quality for its price
1,I’ve had these for over a year now and it still works amazing .
1,"Honestly  i love the headphones especially for the price i paid for them.. They are great quality!. And they came so quickly by mail.. Awesome, i am a very happy customer!!!"
1,Nice
1,Really enjoy my Senso earphones. Great sound for my music and my phone calls. Would recommend to a friend. Very comfortable too.
1,I love the fact that I am not hooked up to my cell phone when listening to my music.  It's great for the gym but also I love it for the beach.  You can put your phone somewhere it is protected from the sun and lay and listen to the music.  Sound is good.  I also used it talking on the phone and the sound quality wasn't the best but for my purpose (music) I am very happy with it.
1,It does what it says it’s going to do and it is waterproof but it does not work underwater so though it is waterproof it is not a swimmer’s friend
1,"These are fantastic, I have ordered 4, gave 3 to my family so they could enjoy the great sound. The ear clips hold them securly on, even bouncing around at the gym.  My daughter wore them on her 1/2 marathon and swore the headphones made all the difference to keep running, and running!."
1,"I was pleasantly surprised by how well these headphones worked given the price.  The sound is not bad, certainly good enough for my daily podcast fix. The range is pretty good, at least 30 ft without any noticeable signal loss. The microphone feature works pretty well with my phone, and the battery lasts for hours. My one quibble is that the design is not well suited to women with smaller ears.  It takes some serious wiggling (not always comfortable) to get them to stay my ears, and the over the ear loops are a bit too large to help out."
1,"SENSO Bluetooth Headphones are comfortable and the sound quality is wonderful. No static, no sounds from cords (the only cord is the connecting cord that you place behind your neck). I leave my smartphone in my bedroom to recharge and listen to my audible books while cleaning house! Great reception! I'm very satisfied!"
1,Easy to connect to Bluetooth and sound great!
1,"Finally, Bluetooth headphones that are easy to use and stay in my ears!  I actually use these earphones!"
1,I just got these and have only used them a few times but so far they seem to be a great set of ear buds. I have a terrible time with ear buds staying in my ear and these seem like they would stay even without the over the ear piece. The sound is good and they were very easy to pair and start using. I purchased a similar type of ear bud in the past that I returned because I had so much trouble trying to get them set up initially but these seem like keepers! I'm excited to use them again and think that they were a great price for the product!
1,!So far we love these. Sound is good. Instructions were easy and they came within two days of ordering!
1,"Just only received them yesterday.  I used them for the gym and the sound quality and comfort are nice.  I'll update to 5 stars after I get some more use if they keep up the good work...  can't beat the price.<br /><br />Update 12-19-17, still working good.  Can't beat that price.  Also still holding a pretty good charge.  Would buy these again"
1,"Absolutely Wonderful! High quality sound, durable battery, user-friendly."
1,Nice headphones but I lost
1,They work great! Very nice and comfortable
1,These are great.  Love the sound and the way they fit in my ear.  Highly recommend the.  Great deal for the price
1,These don't really fit in my ears well. They pop out when I run.
0,"I, too, have small ear canals, and researched earphones and earbuds carefully before purchasing these.  I had tried several cheaper products over the years, and nothing will either fit into, or stay in my ears.  These are no different.  They are so huge that they just fall out before I even can get them in - even with the smallest size earpad. And the hook over the ear is way too big as well, and is NOT adjustable, which is pretty ridiculous.  I am SO disappointed! I have my first 5K walk this weekend, and really needed these, but now do not have anything.  So I will be making a forced shopping trip out of town to try and find yet another pair that, hopefully, will stay in my ears - again.  If you have small ears, do NOT waste your money on these - mine are going back!"
1,gift
1,I am very happy with my purchase. The sound is great and the Bluetooth hook up was easy. I also like the extra ear buds.
1,I ordered these for my father...because he loved the first pair so much and he loves these just as much...good job!
1,Buena Batería!
1,"I'm really happy with by Senso earphones ( I've only used them for about a week) but they sound great! They are so light that I actually forget that I have them in my ears.<br />They came in a nice box with a carrying case, extra ear buds, charging cable for both the ear phones & my iPhone.<br />My package arrived much earlier than I was expecting.<br />I am extremely pleased with my purchase & I will recommend them to my friends & family.<br />Cheers,<br />Adanna"
1,I have been extremely satisfied with these headphones which I purchased in September of 2017 and they serve me well. I'm a runner so I need a lightweight pair that stays in my ears with good sound. Also it is waterproof as I happily found out when I ran in a rainstorm while training for a marathon. They are my go to headphones for my long runs. The only thing that don't like so much is that it's hard to rewind songs but that could just be the fact that I haven't read the instruction manual. Overall this is a good product for the money that I paid. So when they suddenly stopped working about a week ago I was concerned but then I remembered that they were covered under a one year warranty. They have wonderful customer service as they responded quickly to my email and I had a free replacement with a few days! I definitely recommend this product because it works well in the rain and the company stands behind their product.
1,They are great and work as described on the product webpage. I bought this one for my wife and she seems to enjoying them while working out.
1,Really intuitive and easy to use.
1,very good
1,They have great battery life and don't fall out when working out or running. Bought these as a gift for my father. He loves them and will surely buy them again for myself.
1,Simple set up / connectivity. I'm very happy with them!
1,"I love these earbuds! The sound is amazing! I kind of assumed the part that goes around your ear was hard, but it was flexible and stays on very well."
1,These are amazing. It was super easy to sync the bluetooth. They feel and fit perfectly. The sound is fantastic. I am VERY happy with this purchase. I would recommend this company and this product. Great find.
1,Keeps falling out. Wire at the back keeps sticking to the skin on the neck which pulls it out.
1,"My husband loves it, it stays in his ears and he has the damn things in almost 24/7 (no i'm not a naggy wife hahah)"
1,Very comfortable.  Holds charge well.  Easy to connect with iPhone and laptop.  Sound quality is not quite as crisp as with iPhone wired earbuds.  It is a little heavy on the bass also.
1,"They hold a charge for a good amount of time (4-6 hours) and the sound quality is good. The cord keeper isn't great, but I just loop the extra cord length around my ears."
1,Bought for my husband for him to wear while he welds in a machine shop and mows during the summer. He says they are AMAZING hopefully the quality stays this great for a long time.
1,Great bluetooth headphones for the money!
0,I have had these for less than a year and now the Bluetooth randomly connects and disconnects while listening to music. Sound quality is good and battery life is good. Wish they wouldn’t have messed up so quick
1,"Once these earphones finally arrived (Amazon lost them somehow but did refund the order and express shipped another) I quickly paired them with my Motorola Droid Turbo 64, a phone notorious for it's low volume on audio/video playback, I played some classic Pink Floyd to really test them out.  They passed with flying colors.  Light weight, comfortable to wear, controls easy to use, as was pairing, voice confirmation of commands.  All in all, I found them to be better than I expected.  Note:  I've not tried a phone call through them yet, but I'll update this review if it's not as good as the basic audio/video delivery.<br /><br />They also come with a nice little hardshell case to store them in and various wire connections along with 3 sets of ear pieces, small, medium and large.  Mine came with the large installed and those were quite comfortable.  They appear to be made out of that spongy material that disposable earplugs are made out of so they conform to the unique shape of your ear."
0,They suck. They literally go over your whole entire ear. It is so uncomfortable and the pieces that go in your ear are huge. Very disappointed
1,Love my headphones
1,"AMAZING HEADPHONES!!!<br />My coworker got the new Apple EarPods, these blow them away on so many levels!  They come with an extra long lightning cord for you phone and car charger too!  That was an added bonus to the headphones!!  I'm a trainer and also a marathoner, and sweat doesn't touch these headphones!  Not to mention they are comfortable!"
1,"**update***<br /><br />Issue resolved, hassle  free even though  I had them beyond Amazon primes return guarantee.<br /><br />Customer Support is excellent. If you are having issues with these not working  or you didn't get an item listed on the packaging, message them  immediately.  Among the best support around.<br /><br />Very happy!<br /><br />They were excellent at first the packaging was excellent the accessories that came with the headphones were very high quality I appreciated the foam ear pieces they were comfortable and really reduce the noise in the background. They work well in calls as well as sounded very well with my music. However, after 2 months I could no longer get the headphones to charge. The red LED light no longer lit up and they would no longer accept the charge the headphones would become warm as if they were charging but when I tried to use them it would always tell me low battery. I contacted Amazon Prime support and they were very helpful and getting me in cobtact with someone who could assist me with a repair or replacement because I had already passed beyond the window of return through Amazon. I'm really hoping that the seller or the manufacturer can make this right because I enjoyed these headphones a lot and it was an Amazon Choice product which led me to make the purchase and I want to continue to trust items that I see marked as Amazon Choice items. Up until they stopped working I was fully prepared to give them a 5-star rating based on price vs quality. I will keep you updated on my progress with the replacement or repair process and based on my experience with that I will update my review."
1,Awesome
0,They worked great until they didn't. The button to turn them on got stuck and that was the end of it. I had bought the 2 year insurance and they haven't help.
1,The sound was as expected. Generally appreciate the quality of the device.
1,"Good sound, quick sync up with my phone and the controls operates seamlessly.<br />Only comment is that I miss the magnets my old headphones had which made it easier to wear around the neck."
1,I loved this until the part where u plug it in to charge broke then I couldn't charge it anymore to use it
1,"Great deal for $30 bucks. Sound is good, bass is excellent, they connect to bluetooth fast, come with a case, battery life is good,  and they stay in my ears when running .I originally purchased the Apple Airpods but I couldn't justify the $150+ for them- returned and bought these and couldn't be happier."
1,These work great! I use them often for studying as well as running.
1,"The cord is a bit long, but other than that they work pretty well."
1,"For the price, I'm impressed with my senso headphones. They are comfortable and provide good sound. I'm very happy with the product."
1,Amazing sound but....
0,So far I like them. However I'm unsure if the concerns I'm about to mention are normal or if it's just my pair. The right ear bud gets very warm within the first 20 minutes of use also there is a small hum in the right side while playing. Additionally I believe the quality of the right side is not nearly as good as the left. Now they have been fully charged and within 2 hours have told me the battery is low. I do believe this pair is faulty. And I was so looking forward to a new pair of ear buds. I'm not a happy camper seeing as I got these days before I'm headed out of town and in desperate need of ear buds.
1,"They are great and affordable earphones for listening to music! Bad for phones calls! With everything that it includes, it's a deal! Unfortunately, I lost mine at the airport during TSA check. Furthermore, I will repurchase and recommend to a friend who does not want to spend a lot of money."
1,5 stars so far. Sounds good and paired up easy. Recommend these even more so cause they don't cost an arm and a leg.
1,"I love these earbuds! They work great, are comfortable to wear and have a compact carrying case just right for storing in my purse."
1,these are the same quality as beats for 1/4 the cost.
1,"For a long while I scorned Bluetooth earbuds because they were bulky and sort of ugly. A lot has changed in a few years and these are proof that the technology is getting much better.<br /><br />The sound quality is great for earbuds of this price range. I was especially impressed by the crisp mid range tones. Low range isn't spectacular but you'd have to pay a lot more for that.<br /><br />They're very light and hold a charge for about the advertised 8 hours of continuous use. Plenty of accessories to customize the fit, and a nice charger with a carrying case. My only real complaint is that the charging port cover is a soft rubber material that sits flush with hard plastic, making it difficult to remove with my fingernails.<br /><br />***Update April 25, 2018:<br /><br />My earbuds seem to have kicked the bucket. They suddenly stopped pairing with any of my music devices, even after a reset across multiple devices and the earbuds themselves. This is within the advertised one year warranty, but I have no idea how to redeem it or who to contact. They have a scant website with a product registration email, so I will see if it actually works or not."
0,"I’ve heard good things about these but I guess they aren’t as good as people say they are. I’ve had mine for 3 weeks and now they just don’t even turn anymore. No light come on when you old the power button, and no light turns on when I connect the charger to it..."
1,"When I found that my son-n-law, who is beyond techy, purchased these, I purchased them as a gift.  My friend (also a geek) loves them.  He says the sound is great and they ae very comfortable.  Great purchase....  thanks!"
1,Absolutely love it
1,"For a pair of sub $40 bluetooth headphones I was really impressed.  The box contained a ton of accessories from a car charger, two charging cables (longer one with an apple and micro USB cord) and a short usb --&#62; micro usb cable, and various ear buds.<br /><br />The sound on the bluetooth headset is clear and louder than a bose pair of $150 soundsports I have.  They stay on and in my ear during my morning run, as long as the waterproof technology is good and it doesn't short out my headset (like the Bose product I was replacing) they'll be all good.  The over the ear clips are soft and flexible, which I couldn't tell from the product description, very happy they aren't firmer plastic, they are very comfortable on the ear during a run."
1,"I use them to listen to music at work. We also have a loud night bell going off anytime someone is in the call queue. The outside noise cancelling isn't the best i've used before, but's it's definitely solid performance. A full charge from dead takes maybe 90 minutes. A full charge on average for me last about 8-10 hours, assuming the range is just based on difference in volume and stuff. The sound quality is pretty good as well, definitely starts getting kind of muddy at really loud levels, but at the level it loses sound quality it's too loud for comfort so it's a non-issue. I'd say they are good not great, but for the price they are well worth the money. This is the first pair of wireless headphones i have used with my phone, so i don't have a good comparison for the range from the phone while staying connected. These did pass my expectations though."
1,"I've only had them a week, but the sound is better than my Beats.  I bought them mainly for the waterproof feature."
1,Great product. Use it when I’m exercising.
1,"I've owned some more expensive wireless earbuds, a lot more expensive and I find these Senso earbuds to be competitive.<br /><br />Sound: Very solid and balanced. Pretty much as good as any earbuds (wired and wireless) that I've owned. I use an equalizer app on my Android phone to balance frequencies, and I didn't feel like I needed to do much correction for these ones. I dropped a little of the low/mids out and added just a touch of the highest treble for crispness, but I did the least amount of adjustment compaired any of my headphones, speakers or car. Really pretty smooth. These earbuds provide a thick low end that's really nice. A little &#34;thumpy&#34; but By dropping the low-mids a bit I was able to correct it.<br /><br />Comfort: The fit is amazing for me. I know that we all have different sized heads and ears so there's no telling what you will experience. I'm a very tall guy with a big head and large ears. I've had problems with retention with many of my other earbuds. They slide out and wiggle around. When the become loose, I find that the bass ranges become lost and I'm always shoving the buds back in. I use mine at the gym and for running frequently, and the movement has jarred all of my other earbuds out of position. Not with these. They stay put. The &#34;over the ear&#34; hooks are super flexible and soft, so they don't become irritating over time. It seems they provide just enough firmness to keep the buds in place without discomfort in long term wear.<br /><br />Usability: I've only used the microphone a few times, but it seems to work well. I had a conversation in a crowed gym with somebody and they told me it wasn't too bad. In quite situations they work great. They appear to hold a long charge - I've never timed it, but I've used them on and off for many hours without needed a recharge. One big suggestion. Put out an app for both phone types that displays power levels.<br /><br />Durability: I'll update in the future. Too new to say. Haven't put them to the waterproof test yet.<br /><br />Value: Amazing. With Prime and a special offer these were super affordable. My daughter has some very expensive Beats with a similar look. They've been great earbuds and have been super durable. Maybe they sound just a bit better. But, they were almost 5X the cost. I feel like I got a really great deal, and I won't go into some state of anxiety if I loose them. I'll just order a new set."
1,"I bought two pair of these in September of 2017, one for me and one for my wife.  We both loved the sound quality but both of us had issues with the fit, for me, the left ear bud would always slip, the right was great.  Recently, however, the volume/skip buttons on my wife's set fell out.  They still work, she just can't change volume or song from the earbud.  Mine won't charge.  I have tried several different cords but nothing works.  The battery died and there is nothing I can do.  They were pretty reasonable but for $30ish I would like them to last a few years more."
1,"Very good sound. Full range of charging options and a nice little carrying case. My only concern is the fit. The ear buds feel like they would fall out of the ear with a lot of movement, as the over ear piece is loose, a little large and very flexible. Good for walking but probably not vigorous exercise at the gym."
1,Great quality product. Love the soft silicone they used for the part that goes around your ear and the different sized ear buds are awesome giving you options. The case is sturdy and fits the item perfectly. Very pleased with the simplicity of its use as well.
1,"I really should have made this review a long time ago. I've owned to two pairs of these, love them, and the design even got a little better from my first to second pair - the second pair has stiffer but malleable ear hooks so that they sit firmly, the first ones were more &#34;floppy&#34; which weren't a problem but required adjusting from time to time. I tried another kind of blue tooth headphones after my first pair broke, and they did not sound nearly as good or were as comfortable to wear, so I went back to these. I would absolutely recommend them."
1,This was an outstanding purchase. The company/vendor stands for high quality products and service.
0,"They are uncomfortable, have TERRIBLE wind noise when outside, terrible muffled sound quality with very little volume control. Yes, you can change volume. However, the increments go from very quiet-quiet-right up to very loud with no good in between."
1,"i wanted a 2-1, mp3 player as well.  ordered another"
1,These are the best headphones!  Excellent sound quality and great battery life.  Wish I would have found this product a long time ago!
1,Very good quality
1,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!!!!!  I have purchased a total of 4 pairs of wireless ear buds both from Amazon and stores.  This was the only one that worked well enough to keep.  The ear hooks are soft and flexible but stay on perfectly without discomfort.  The car charger and usb was something I definitely find useful even having so many others around the house.  The sound is good and I only experienced interference when going into an area that I have smart devices. I won't use them very often so the higher priced ones was not a consideration so if you feel as I do these are worth it. They just work GREAT for my needs.  Highly recommend them these ear buds. I wish I had just spent the extra money from the start it would have saved a lot of time. Only thing a tad on the negative side is the size of the well made case.  It is a bit big for my purse but I don't think the earbuds would fit very well in a smaller case.  Very satisfied with my purchase."
1,These are superb headphones. The sound quality is awesome and so is the battery life! I liked them so much my husband bought some too. For the quality of these I would have paid double the price
1,"These headphones are awesome! They do everything they say they will, are super comfy, and are very user friendly. 5 out 5 definitely recommend."
1,Sounds good and charges fast
1,"Highly recommended!! I have a pair of Beats headphones and bought these as a second pair. They are pretty damn good. Sound and battery life are great. The quality of the product is about the same as Beats. They are little bigger on your ear though. Good thing about these headphones, they don’t have a controller on the wire so the wire doesn’t slide to the heavier/controller side like Beats -stretching your headphone in the ear."
1,These fit well and the sound is good.  I use them mostly for work.  Only thing that is different from my last $200 Bluetooth headset to this one is you have to have the remote side of the headset on the right hand side where on the $200 set you could chose.  Not that big of a deal but something to know.  also - The $200 headphone set broke twice in less than a year so I am hoping that these will last longer.
1,These are amazing ear buds. The sound quality is amazing and they fit very comfortable. I had one pair that stopped working on the right side. The manufacturer sent me a replacement set with out any questions. They were great!!!
1,such good sound! and for the base! only downfall is having to charge it after 6 hours of use
1,"Great headphones the bass is better than the old headphones I paid 4 times the price for, and the overall sounds quality is better too."
1,Ordered a second set.  Excellent product.
1,Great headphones. Awesome sound and great durability and quality
1,Love these headphones for running. The battery lasts longer than my Garmin watch! They stay on pretty good which is nice because I have a hard time with other in ear headphones. My kitten finally got to them and chewed them up so I bought another set to replace them I like them so much!
0,Great sound but broke after 3 uses
1,"They work great..... looks like the line of sight range is around 150 feet..... gets iffy after that or if have barriers in the way... great for when you have the pad/phone in your pocket, or nearby.  Are very comfortable and I have had no problems with sweat affecting them.  Using them for exercise time and while driving a loud truck at work....work well in both settings.<br /><br />******UPDATE******  3 months down the road and heavy sweaty pig use and the earphones worked great, but as sometimes happens with all electronics, they ate themselves... just stopped working.  Then you get to test out the customer support.  Im happpy to say that I have never dealt with better support.  I emailed them about the earphones and they responded quickly with the canned &#34;reset item method&#34; which makes us all go grr... went thru the steps to reset and still broken and I let them know via email and voila poof they responded quickly apologizing for the trouble and sent out a replacement set of earphones which I had in hand 2 days later.  I will definitely be buying from this company in the future due to the good product and them backing it up."
1,Awesome price and awesome product. I was skeptical at first cause I usually hate ear buds like this but they're very comfortable and don't slip while exercising.
1,"These earbuds are too great for words.  No plugs, just easy listening, with GREAT sound."
1,"Not the prettiest, design-wise, but GREAT sound and comfortable fit. Battery life so far has been very good. Easy pairing and easy operation."
1,"Sound Quality: 2/5 (Base is not so good an clarity is poor)<br />Made: 2/5 (I've tried lots of ear pods and ear phones and none hurt my ears before, this one does. Also the tangle free wire, when it came looked so bad, I am still trying to make it straight)<br />Battery Life: Very good. Lasts up to 6 - 7 hours on continuously play. I can connect it to my TV and watch movie all day.<br /><br />Overall ok but I won't purchase it again."
1,Bought this to replace a lost pair definitely worth the price its a great deal
1,I got these headphones for my husband.  He says he loves them!  They are very comfortable and the sound is exceptional compared to other sets he has tried out.
1,Great set of headphones!! Bluetooth connects easy and it has a great sound.
1,"Quite delighted w/product which I initially bought in Jul 2017 on sale from Amazon.  However, I had not used regularly and discovered after about 5 mos earphones had a defective port (connection would not stay properly seated and headphones would not recharge).  Called Senso and they took care of the issue promptly and courteously! Warranty was honored w/o hassle... sent brand new (in the box) headphones which I received w/in a few days w/attendant email follow ups. Kudos to them.  Also, comparatively easy to set up/bluetooth install."
1,"The head phones worked great, very easy to pair with phone and had great sounds. Unfortunately the stopped working, but the manufacturer has been excellent with a replacement"
1,With I ordered them sooner! Sound quality is great.
1,was worried when ordered these but they really nice headphones great sound and easy use would reorder
1,"Ok, I literally just got this in the mail and opened the box. I am so impressed with this company! This package is very well out together. This is awesome for the price! I love the headphones! The sound is impeccable! I definitely recommend this to anyone, especially if you have an active lifestyle! I would like to add that my headphones stopped working and I emailed the company and they replied in such a timely manner and their customer service was exceptional and they will be sending out a new pair of headphones for me."
0,Revising review. Piece of crap. Won’t turn on. Second pair.<br /><br />Don’t buy these.
1,"I compared these to my Jaybird x3 headphones that retail at $130 and to be honest, they are more comfortable, have better range and stay on better! The sound quality is the only place I'd draw the line. Jaybird wins there, but not by $100 price difference! These are quality headphones at a ridiculously low price!"
1,They worked great. They were clear and loud. I used them for mowing and yard work.
1,Recommend to me by my roommate. First pair of wireless headphones. They work great and battery lasts a long time. Stayed in during my workouts as well.<br /><br />A little too bass heavy but i just turned the bass down on my music apps and then the sound was perfect.
1,"great wireless earphones, good quality!"
1,"I use these everyday, excellent sound. These last a long time with short charge time. I would get another pair."
1,"Great headphones for an amazing price, I previously owned a pair of Dr. Dre Beats sport headphones and the sound quality between the two are very similar. The only difference is the price. Thanks for make great product for a more than reasonable price. I recommend this product."
0,"Not very good all around even for the price, the feel extremely cheap and I don't expect them to last long, sound quality is mediocre at best. I've had other headphones at similar price points that far exceeds these, these also seem a little buggy when it comes with connectivity with my iPhone 7. I'm convinced that the great reviews for these are not honest or false"
1,Third pair. Love it. Only thing doesn’t really stay charge for 8 hours
1,"These are the best workout earbuds I've ever had.  Tried numerous wired and wireless options over the last decade or so, but these rock!  The over ear design keeps them secure through long runs, or circuit training.  The behind the neck cord stays out of the way.  Battery life must be great, because I can only remember one time that I got a low battery warning in over a year of regular use.  I mostly listen to audio books and the voice quality is great, and is pretty great for music as well.  Highly recommend these"
1,These headphones have an amazing sound. The price was awesome! I hope to have them for awhile.
1,Although I used them for the first time yesterday I was very happy with the performance. In addition to that the way the product was packaged and the ease of the instructions was first class.
1,Works very well at the gym and everywhere else.
1,"Good sound quality, deep bass,. long battery life. Great headphones for the price!"
0,Very bad connection
1,excellent quality
0,The headphones looks ligite at the first time use but the next day the people that I talk to over the phone are telling me that they can’t here me I have to take the right side ear and put it beside my mouth so they can hear me clearly so far my expectation of this product is low and the cell phone mount doesn’t work also when I bought it I was expecting to get a usb charger for my car but it was not includ and it clearly said it on amazon
1,Great product! arrived on time and works really well.
1,LOVE these headphones!! Planning to buy more as gifts for family and friends
1,"Excellent headphones that work great for music, books, and phone. sweat resistant and comfortable."
1,"These headphones are very good, although After a few months, they had trouble connecting to my phone, and the cord started shorting out. I would recommend these but they only last about 6-7 months"
0,"I synced the earbuds to my TomTom Spark and could not get a good quality, non interference connection. I even switch the watch from my left to right wrist thinking it would help, which it did slightly. So far not impressed. Tried connecting to the computer to see about a software update, but no luck there either. Not sure if it's just the TomTom Spark but I'm not trading in the watch because of the earbuds."
1,They appear to be perfect. They are a Christmas present to my brother.
1,Finally i found a good ond this Headphones Extremely comfortable and very easy to carry.
0,"Great headphones when they work. My original ones lasted me over a year, new ones stopped turning on or taking a charge after a couple weeks. This is after trying the newer version first which failed even sooner. Don't waste your time with these. Customer service is non existent."
1,They artificially pump up the bass which sounds fine except that it ends up making the vocals of many songs more difficult to hear.
1,Great headphones very confortable and battery last the 8 hours. I owned the bose sports but all I can say Im thankfull to have returned them. You cant go wrong with this ones.
0,Worst earbuds I've ever used. No bass; lacking mids. It's like having the sound quality of the iPhone speaker in earbud form. Trash.
1,"The sound coming out of these were amazing, clear with just the right amount of bass. I have worn them for about 10 hours so far and even though they never died on me, I charged them at about the 6 hour mark so I can't tell how long they would have lasted. These are my first Bluetooth headsets so I was really pleased that they did not once lose connection and they pair with my phone rather instantly.<br />I wear these when I go running and the reason I gave them a 4 is because of the wind noise which if on a very windy day I would suggest not wearing these at all, the noise is so load that you cannot hear the music. I wish these were aerodynamically designed to cut through the wind. I will say that one of the reason's I bought them is because many reviewers said that they fit very nicely in the ear. From what I experienced, they were right. I have had several pairs of headphones where many of the reviewers would say they bought them because they fit nice only to find out that for me, that wasn't true. When I run, I normally run trails for about 2-4 miles and I find it extremely rare that I have had to push these Senso headphones back into my ear....that was a big plus for me."
1,Got these to replace some newer powerbeats2 that never satisfied.<br /><br /> Easy set up.  Fit great and sound fantastic!
0,"The headphones appear to be well made and are comfortable and nice looking.  HOWEVER, they music constantly skips and it drives me nutty!  I really wanted to love these!"
0,"Got them about a month ago and I've alteady had to return them to Amazon. The product started malfunctioning - bluetooth connection would start to come and go, then is turned off, it wouldn't turn on inmediately. The programmed voice of the device was distorted. In the month dince I got them, only used them about 3-4 times a week for a couple of hours.<br /><br />Not a good product!"
1,"easy connection, great sound, awesome base for amazing price, definitely recommend"
1,Loved getting my item so quickly. They work really well too.
1,I love these headphones as they are the only ones I own that stay in my ears. The sound is really good as well.
0,"Bought these yesterday arrived today. I charged them. Connect them to my iphone. Sound is terrible, especially on the right ear. it crackles and fry when music is paused, and when I'm playing music on low volume, and when I am making a call. After 20 minutes of usage, I can feel the right side warming up. Left side is okay, but the right side is defective.<br />I have been using them for less than an hour and I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND .<br /><br />The search continues"
1,Awesome headphones.  Work as advertised
1,"Ordered wrong product and they worked with me to get the right one. Fast, friendly, and courteous! Thank you!<br />Product is great for the price!"
0,"Love everything about this product EXCEPT, the sound is terrible. Sounds very muffled, like Im listening to it thru a pillow.  I love bass in my music but for once the bass response is too much.  Unfortunately Im returning the product and going to go with the Skullcandies this time around. Get the sound quality under control and Id be happy to try them again and give it 5 stars."
1,"Bought two pairs as gifts for my two boys.  They requested them.  So far, no news is good news!"
1,I’m not going to give them a bad review because they are amazing for the price however I will say I’ve used them like 5 times and the Bluetooth is staticky at a full charge already
1,"These headphones are wonderful. I've only used them a couple times so far, but they are really comfortable and stay snug in my ear during my workout. I bought them primarily for the gym. Really happy with this purchase!"
0,"Didn’t even last a year. They’ve stopped charging altogether. I guess you get what you pay for. As well, it was a pain to sync them. Hit or miss."
1,Just got my new wireless set. Charged in 1 hour and connected to Bluetooth on my iphone easily.  Sounds is great!  I'll use these at the gym.  Hope the &#34;sport&#34; feature with liquipel holds up.
0,"These are awful.  Don't waste your money.  They are easy enough to use and set up but the quality is awful.  The range is also terrible.  If you are standing 1 foot from the phone in direct line of site and standing still you get a clear signal.  Turn your head and the sound skips, pick up the phone and the sound skips, put it in you pocket and it skips.  Forget about exercise.  I can't speak to the battery life as I could only muster 2 runs before I returned them."
1,Love these headphones!  I also really like that they come with a case. Great value!
1,Headphones were easy to configure and great to use.
1,"The sound is average for a Bluetooth headphone set. The bass is not deep enough for my liking and decibels on the treble clarity is average.<br /> It's hard to hear the music when I'm running, cycling,  or in a crowd of people.  Also, it's irritating when using the headphones while wearing sunglasses.  Although it provides different sizes of ear buds, it just doesn't feel comfortable."
1,very good headphones
1,"To be frank, for under $25, I was hesitant but with the review, ifigured to give it a shot. Great sound, easy connection, decent battery life, good phone functionality. They are a little heavy but with all the different size bits, customize the fit and there you have it, comfort and the orange adaptors, you have passive noise deadening. All in all, an awesome buy, thanks."
1,"Humongous bang for your buck! I have two pairs and they are durable, and pretty good quality."
0,"So these headphones have great sound. The problem lies with the silicon earbuds and the consistency of sound being sent out. While wearing these, the first thing you will notice is that your music is extremely choppy at first, I gave it the benefit of the doubt seeing as I just booted it up, but it was persistently cutting out large portions of my music during my 40 minute walk. Another problem is that the silicon earbuds just keep loosening up so you have to keep pushing them back in, could be the weight of the earphones but the piece on top that holds onto your ear should fix that no? The piece on top of the earphones is very comfortable by the way, haven't had one as comfortable as those. Also, they are not noise isolating, while walking there was a breeze out and the air kept finding its way into the cracks the earbuds didn't seal in the ear and make constant radio static like noises. The pause button works sure, but when you resume your music, it starts at 100% volume for a second or two totally giving you a headache and destroying your eardrums, not cool. The volume up button also makes an obnoxious beep if you reach the max volume and try to raise it again, like very obnoxious beep and very loud. Overall, the sound is great but if the choppiness could be fixed and the silicon could be made to fit better in the ear, would be a flawless product."
0,"Not sure why, but it keeps breaking up! You can't listen to one full song."
1,I really like these headphones but the spongie earbuds dont last. I need more replacements but cant find any . Now I just have the cheesy plastic ones that just dont hold the sound and bass as well.
0,I liked this product there was nothing wrong with it. However I want to put this out there in case anyones experiences similar issues.<br />After about a month of using this product I got really itchy ears and had to discontinue use. Maybe I am too sensitive however when I searched online I saw reviewers having similar issues for more expensive wireless  headphones too.
1,These headphone connected easily to my phone and sound really good. They stay on while I'm running and are very comfortable. It's more than what I expected at this price. I also use them to watch TV and just love them.<br />Updated<br />After using them for less than three months they no longer charge. Very disappointed as I really enjoyed them while they were working.<br />Update<br />After getting in touch with costumer support I was able to get head buds working again. They replied very quickly. Thanks so much.
1,"I was skeptical about these because the price was so cheap. I'm honestly thrilled with them! The sound quality is GREAT, and people can hear me just fine when using them for calls.<br /><br />Just a heads up - if you try to connecting them to more than one device at a time, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. I recommend just doing one device at a time to avoid any frustration :)"
1,"Nice earphones, very easy to use.  They fit the ear perfectly.  Nice material.  Nice packaging.  Overall 10/10!!!!!<br />Update: 3/6/2020....we still rollin' lol 💯"
1,It arrived at my home within 2-days.  Great product for the price.  Easy to use and good sound quality.  It will make my exercise more enjoyable by not be wired directly to my phone.
1,"Great, functional bt headset. Get almost 8 hrs per charge"
1,great product. great buying experience.
1,"Good value for money, pretty bad sound if you compare it to any &#34;real&#34;, more expensive headphones."
1,These work so amazing.  The ear piece fits to your ear.  This is my second pair because I lost my first pair.  I love these and they work great!  Stay charged for about a week at a time or a little more.<br />Great quality and price is unbelievable!
0,"Headphones were a Christmas gift, headphones never worked about the box. Spend the extra money and get better headphones. Highly disappointed 0 stars"
0,"Ear piece ripped off easily, leaving wires exposed"
0,So at first I gave this product a 5 star rating. However through use the quality is apparent. This thing doesn't hold a charge worth a nickle.. it takes a little over an hour to charge then gets worn out after approximately 6 hours of use. The case the thing comes with isn't very great either and most of the earbuds don't stay in the socket very well.
1,"I was expecting these to be just okay, but I can't get enough of them - I opt to use them whenever possible instead of using my traditional headphones! Sound is GREAT (some reviewers noted a little boost in bass but I didn't experience that - I listen to Pandora and the Music app on my iPhone 6S and I've never had an issue, If you have an issue with bass it's incredibly easy to adjust, as another reviewer pointed out.<br /><br />DEFINITELY make sure you try different sizes of the earbud covers that come with the headphones - they have memory foam ones on already, but one of my ears didn't hold that in well, so I switch to the mushroom-cap-shaped ones and they're perfect and very comfortable. Pairing and button use are straightforward and easy.<br /><br />Only downside is that the cord clips come off a little too easily so my cord doesn't stay clamped together to shorten it very well but that's a non-issue for me."
1,nice product... good sound and battery
1,They were good but they only lasted a couple of months
1,Love the headphones. Great sound and sound blocking. Mine had an issue and I contacted them and they sent me a brand new pair within 3 days. No hassle return!! Very easy and pleasant to work with. Would definite recommend them they stand behind their product.
1,"Sound quality is decent. Bluetooth connection can drop in and out, especially when first connected. Headphones don’t like moving from wifi, it makes an annoying beeping and requires restart. Battery gauge is not particularly accurate, when gauge shows about 20%, it’s about dead. When the verbal low battery warning, it actually only has about one minute left before it dies. Hour long charge time is not true, takes longer, maybe 2-3 hours. All that being said, I’ve had them for about a year, and they keep trucking along.<br /><br />Update: they have finally died. RIP. Nov 18 - August 19"
1,The sound is fantastic! Great Base. The problem I have is they constantly fall out of my ears. If they could fix this problem these would be a 5 star. I have the more expensive popular ones and these are just as good. Just hate adjusting them every 5 min.
1,Great sound except for cracking noises. Not real easy to use.
1,"Very adjustable, great packaging. Sound quality was good, easy to use."
1,"Amazing for the price! The one con is the connection, but it is not that bad.great sound and are very comfortable! Don't by beats or jbirds. These do the job very well!"
1,Sound is really nice. Battery life is good. They stay in and are very comfortable. These checked every box.
1,Great set of wireless headphones. Clear sound & easy to use.  I would buy again.
1,Excellent product it stays put in your ears while jogging and loud clear music in my ears while I run!
1,These headphones are amazing..  GREAT deal GREAT price GREAT quality
1,Overall I am pleased with performance and quality of the Senso Bluetooth Headphones. I appreciated the extras that were included. One issue is that I'm not so sure the CVC 6.0 noise cancellation works.
1,Very easy to set ups on I-Phone 7
1,Great Bluetooth headphones at a great price. I was initially concerned about them staying in while I run but they stay in place mile after mile. Very happy with this product.
1,Absolutely love it!
1,Got these for my fiances birthday and he loves them! He said they are the best birthday present.
1,I use them everyday and I’m still satisfied with them
1,"So far so good. Sounds great. fit good. Connected easy. Doesnt seem to work with voice activation unless im doing something wrong. I dont use it anyways. Biggest complaint is cord catches when i turn my head left to right, have to lift cord and adjust what seems like a lot. Maybe a longer cord or mesh material that doesnt stick?  Bonus comes with cool dual cord for itrash phone and micro usb combo. 2 cords in paxkage and car charger  w/case and multiple ear bud styles."
1,"if you move 20 ft from sofa ,it cuts out and off. Very limited distance."
1,It is better than BOSE SOUND SPORT. ultimate product with great quality
1,I love my headphones. I received them for my birthday and use them when walking to stay in shape.<br />I download books from our local library and listen to them while trying to get 10K steps on my Fitbit.<br />They help me stay in shape and listen to the books I've always wanted to read.<br />I'd call that a &#34;twofer&#34; -- Thank you - Diane B.
1,"I have been pleasantly surprised by the Senso Bluetooth Headphones. They are comfortable, adjustable and lightweight.  I even accidentally stepped on them and they were fine (not recommended) I enjoy wearing them in the gym and in my trail runs."
1,"This is a great set of headphones.  I walk, run workout, etc and have no problems with them staying in my ears.  The only minor issue is that from time to time the sound will break up, but that's not very often.  The sound is clear.  I can answer my phone and talk through them.  I can skip music with the ear buttons.  It also holds a charge for a long time, although I'm not sure how because it has never run out of charge. After several uses i just charge it."
1,A nice alternative to BEATS for 1/8th of the price.<br /><br />I'll recommend this product for sure.
1,"I waited to write a review until after a few weeks of use. These are my first wireless headphones and I love them! I use them while working out at the gym and have had no issues. They fit my ears very well using the earbuds that came on them (they give different sizes if you need). I've had no issues with the sound or with bluetooth connectivity to my iphone. The battery also seems to be very good. I only charge them once a week or so, and they charge quickly. The company also gives you a carry case, micro USB/lighting cable charger, car charger and a bunch of other extras all for a great price. Would definitely recommend these to anyone."
1,I love them.
1,"Product arrived promptly, easy to set up, and sounds great!"
0,Sir/Madam:<br /><br />In December 2019 I bought two pair of ear buds... and kept one in reserve ... to use when the first pair burnt out.<br /><br />I  used the first pair ... but when tried out the second pair ... I found that the wiring is bad in them...and  the  earbuds lost contact with the  device I was using.<br /><br />Would you allow me to  mail the bad pair back to you?? Mostly you could repair them??<br /><br />Thank you<br /><br />Victor
1,They are really nice! Lots of extras! I have the Beats wireless also they are all as good as the Beats!
1,Update; if you suddenly have a problem connecting to Bluetooth or it cuts off an item you pair it with reset the system AND the system you’re using it happened with my iPhone and I just reset everything and it’s back to working fine<br />Back to my original review<br />if or an old lady like me who has trouble with all these new gadgets it took me 2 seconds to pair this with everything in my house amazing my other headphones were such a pain to pair with more than one thing these are just amazing I can’t say Enough about Them and the sound oy vey fabulous
1,"Very good speakers, fit comfortable and very clear."
0,Gave as Xmas present based on reviews. 2 pairs need to be returned due to static. Embarrassinf!
1,I have had these for several months now.  I use them with my Galaxy S7.  They connect almost instantly.  Great sound quality and nice case  Battery life is good.
0,"uncomfortable, I have small ear canals, the device was very heavy and kept falling out of my ear. I returned theses of something without a 'big' module hanging off the earbud."
1,"Just got them, so far I love the sound from them still playing with them. Will let you know more later."
1,Very good for music and talking just like a phone.
1,"Sounds great for price, battery life is very good and quality is fine. I don’t like the cord around the back of head as it catches and pulls earphones out."
1,"Love em / very comfortable and great sound / excellent headphones especially for the price! [[ASIN:B01G8JO5F2 SENSO Bluetooth Headphones, Best Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7 Waterproof HD Stereo Sweatproof Earbuds for Gym Running Workout 8 Hour Battery Noise Cancelling Headsets]]"
1,I prefer this style to the buds that fall out when I jump on the trampoline.<br />They paired easily and the sound is great.
1,The lowest sound setting is still too loud.
1,I bought 2 headsets. They perform pretty well. The battery on one set doesn't last as long as the other for some reason. That same headset is hard to get it started & in sync w/ my iPhone. The small connector on the long white cable doesn't fit anything. Useless x 2.
0,"NIGHTMARE, MADDENING TOTAL GARBAGE.<br /><br />I kept these headphones, despite the fact that they would drive me CRAZY. They were constantly cutting out, or just not pairing...you'd have to go back and reset them. . . and sometimes they still wouldn't pair. But being the cheap person I am, I stuck with them. They got worse and worse and WORSE and then yesterday (less than TWO MONTHS after I bought them) they DIED.<br /><br />I have NO idea how they have so many positive reviews. I did every trouble shooting thing possible and they were THE WORST EVER. EVER.<br /><br />SUCH A WASTE OF MONEY, TIME, EFFORT AND SANITY"
1,Good
0,"The ear wrap around is floppy, which means it does absolutely nothing to keep the headphones on.  I'm sure this works for the shape of some ears, but it does not work at all for mine.  Headphones just fall out, even when not really moving"
1,"headphones have great sound and volume control. Wires are little long for my liking, but otherwise great value"
1,These are by far the best headphone set I've ever had. EXCELLENT EXCELLENT EXCELLENT. Two of my friends also bought this set. Bravo on a great product. I wouldn't mind having another set but I can't afford it right now Bravo on a great product!!!
1,"Great sound, awesome fit, does a decent job of keeping sweat out of your ear...had it about 5 months, turned it off to charge yesterday and now it won't turn on.<br />I'm really fed up with earphones like this that work great until they don't.<br />Ugh."
1,good performance for the price point.  have purchased additional units
1,I like the feel. Very comfortable<br />The sound is also terrific
1,‘Twas a good pick. Using them daily and will continue to for all gym workouts.
0,They have a short battery and I can not listen to an entire song without them cutting out. I would not recommend.
1,Excellent quality and fast delivery!
0,They were not expensive but without much use they didn't even last two months. This was the last pair I bought and I've purchased many wireless earbuds over the past several years. I hope to get a good year out of them and anything more I'm happy with. Maybe this was a dud
1,"Just tried them out at the gym today, so far work great, the silicon adjustable fit is really nice because i have big ears and headphones never fit me"
1,Great headphones but out of the box the sound with music and calls are a bit muffled
0,"I had some expectation after reading the review and I was excited, but it did not work after I tried to turn on several times. My wife has a same one and hers is fine (not super good quality but ok), but mine is not working at all. Tried to contact the seller but was not able to find the contact. They contacted my wife when she purchased hers but we didn't get any email for this one. Have to return it now. Disappointed..."
1,Great product as advertised. I've gone through a few sets of wireless headphones this year and this is by far the best one ive seen.
1,Excellent product.  Excellent service.
0,"These are enormous and fall out of my ears. Literally, they are gigantic."
1,"Absolutely love this ! Pairing was easy both with smartphone and smartwatch, sound quality is good and there are 3 sizes of airbuds . Charge seems like okay not bad. Good noice reduction. My primary use is for running and gym, which is perfect. Doesn't shake or move at all. Recommend this product, way better than spending $200 on beats."
1,"I'm very impressed with the sound quality and battery life. Previously I had a pair of Bose SoundSports and after forgetting them in a hotel room I decided to get a less expensive option. I'm very happy I went with these. They have 95+% of the audio quality of the Bose at 1/5 the price. They are actually quite a bit louder, which may be the only difference in the sound that I can tell. Very well worth the money. I listen to them all day long at work and have never had the battery die. Charges pretty quickly, too."
0,"Awful battery life. I've replaced them twice. Should have learned my lesson. I literally can use them for one workout, which is usually no more than 45-60 minutes."
1,Best headphones so sar for working out.I was tired of listening both the TV and radio at the gym and my previous earbuds never stayed in my ears. These are perfect.
1,These are my first Bluetooth headphones and I just love them!  They're easy to use and I'm happy I am not getting a headphone cord stuck on things like knobs and handles. The quality seems good so far....
1,"Great headphones, works excellent"
1,I really like the ear phones. The unit stays in place while running. The battery capacity is great. The unit still has a charge after two days of workouts.
1,"These headphones/earbuds connected flawlessly with my iPhone 6s and have functioned well. Great sound quality on phone calls and for listening to podcasts and music. Nice carrying case. Came charged which was an unexpected bonus. I was so tired of the tangled mess of the cord from my regular earphones, so I love the ease and freedom of using these! I can create a noise-cancelling fit or leave the ear pieces a little more loose if I need to be aware of sounds around me. The ear pieces fit well for me, and there are three sizes.<br />The three-foot charging cord has both lightning compatible and mini USB connectors on one end - you slide back part of the cord to reveal the mini USB end.<br />I have been using these for almost a week and am very happy with my purchase!"
1,"I use the for working out and stay on even while I do hand stands, skip rope, kicks, and running and muffles out background noise."
1,Thank you excellent headphones great price and was a awesome Father’s Day gift for my husband 👌🏻
1,Paired immediately and I was enjoying 5 minutes after opening box without a charge!
1,"I really enjoy this product and would recommend it. My issue is shortly after buying, the sound would cut out. Almost like the wire shorts when you move it a certain direction. I probably should have exchanged it but it wasn't a big deal. Now that I've had it for so long, it's getting worse. The sound quality has been good and better than other wireless headsets I've tried. Plus, I really like having audio controls on the headset. This way you can easily adjust the volume, answer a call, and switch songs all while you're phone can remain in your pocket or wherever you keep it while running."
1,"First of all, huge thank you to the company for delivering the item the same day I ordered it! Not sure either I should recognize the Amazon prime for this fast delivery or the Senso! As far about the product -- absolutely in love with the headphones! Extremely comfortable and I don't even feel I am wearing them. Great sound, very easy to set up and enjoy! Very comfortable for long-distance running. Thank you for the product again!"
1,"Great, absolutely FABULOUS product.  I have spent over 200$ looking for a good set of Bluetooth headphones.  I finally found them in this SENSO product.  I highly recommend them to anyone....and the best part is I can wear them in the pool where I can walk with my bum knee and bad back.  These headphones sound great which is very important when you want to take your mind off of boring exercises.  Fast delivery too! Yep, get them!"
1,"I wanted Bluetooth headphones to use while biking. These are great for what I use them for. The sound is what one might expect from small headphones, but they are great for what I use them for. A great item for the price."
1,Early review and I'd give everything a 4 star based on 3 days of ownership.
1,Great headphones
1,"great sound...love these.  if you want a nice pair of ear buds for running, etc i recommend these."
1,"These earphones stick to your ears very well, they are very easy to pair and operate. I use them over my $150 Bose wireless earphones."
1,some connectivity issues with drops could be a faulty pair but sound great for the money
1,Very secure for running - the first time I’ve been able to say that about a product. Excellent
1,"I have only used these twice, since I've only had them two days. I like them very much. They are easy to wear and should fit every ear size. They came fitted with the medium size ear bud cover but I had to put the small ones on to make them stay in my ear. It was easy enough to do. I spoke with my husband over the phone using them and he heard me fine without complaints, and he is very hard of hearing. I have not listened to music with them so cannot speak to sound quality in that regard. I do listen to audiobooks with them and the sound quality is fine for that. The controls are on the right ear piece. They consist of the power button, which also acts as Pause/Play button when pressed and released quickly, and the volume up and down buttons which work by holding them down until desired level is reached. The volume buttons also move forward a track or backward a track when pressed and quickly released. Syncing with my iPhone was easy as could be - done through the phone's bluetooth device search in Settings. Haven't had them long enough to be able to say any more about them but so far I am very pleased."
1,Good tone and volume! Paired with my IPOD Touch with no problems.  I can't wait to try them on the trail!
1,"UPDATE: I reset the earphones to their factory settings, and since then they've worked with my phone again. I haven't tried pairing the earphones with my computer or a different device again, but at least I know how to fix the problem of spotty sound if it happens again. Original review below.<br /><br />These worked great when I only had them paired with my phone. No problems with sound; range was good.<br /><br />Then one day I paired them with my laptop. (The headphones specifically say they can be paired with more than one device.) All seemed to be well—until I tried to use them with my phone again. Then the sound started going in and out quickly, a couple of times per second. On my phone I deleted the pairing and re-paired the headphones, and the headphones worked again. Huzzah.<br /><br />However, the next time I tried to use the headphones with my phone, the same thing happened: spotty sound until I deleted/re-paired the headphones. Now I have to re-pair the headphones with my phone *almost every time I use them*. Occasionally the spottiness will go away after about 15 seconds, but that's maybe 10% of the time. It's a huge annoyance and I wish the return window hadn't expired, because I would definitely send these back."
1,These are awesome
1,"I was trying to get back into shape and wanted some decent wireless earbuds. I was looking at some different kinds and talked to my buddy about it and he said hold on, don't buy anything yet. He then told me he has bought the expensive ones and the cheap ones and they just didn't make the cut. He said they all broke from sweat. He mentioned to me these Senso ones and said he has had them over a year and they still work perfectly. This guy does intense workouts sweating up a storm so I knew they must be good. Mine just came in today and OMG. These things sound like they are BEATS headphones. Heck, they might be even better. I haven't worked out in them yet I just set them up to get ready to work out. They sound so amazing. They are so loud too. You can have the volume low and they are perfect. I can't believe how nice they are. Definitely worth the money. Instructions are super simple. They tell you exactly what to do and there's even a diagram of the layout where the power button, volume keys, charging area & light indicator are so there's no wondering where and what. There's even a troubleshoot FAQ as well and it's all in good English, not like those cheap products that have directions with sentences with words missing or misspelled. This is definitely a perfect birthday or Christmas gift. I'm tempted to buy another pair just to have a chill pair. Great job Senso! Amazing!!!!!!!! P.S. I use Spotify every day and a really cool feature once you pair this with your phone is if you want to change tracks of music or go back, you just hold down the volume up key for next track & volume down key to go back a track. I thought that was super awesome. You don't have to grab your phone to change a song. That's super nice. P.S.S. It tells you when it powers on and off. Also when the battery is low, it will start beeping. Like I said, AMAZING!!!!! FOR THE PRICE!!!!!!"
1,The sound is fantastic and they are quality headphones. My initial impression of these are very good!
1,Great wireless earbuds!
1,"So far, they have been great!  Had to get something for driving since Georgia went to a hands free law.  Thank you!!"
1,Above expectations. Easy to use. Comfortable. Good sound.
1,"They come in on time, and I’m satisfied with these, highly recommend, affordable and sounds really good"
1,Very useful and durable but I wish batteries lasted more
1,These are very comfortable and I'm very happy with the quality.
0,"I bought a replacement pair recently after I broke my old pair, and as soon as I took them out of the box I could tell there was a difference. The new pair just felt....cheaper. The plastic felt cheaper, the buttons made a clicking sound when you touched them since they were so loose, but the worst part was the ear hooks. I usually have problems with keeping earbuds in due to my inner ear canal shape, but the thing that I loved (loved as in past tense) about these earbuds was the ear hooks. I could do practically anything wearing them and they'd comfortably stay in.<br /><br />With the replacement pair, however, the hooks were just rubber pieces that couldn't be shaped. The hooks on the old pair had a piece of wire inside of them that allowed you to bend and shape them, thus the universal fit. But as soon as I put on the new pair I could almost instantly feel them sliding out of my ears, and of course the hooks did absolutely nothing because you couldn't bend and shape them! What's even the point! Seriously, they're just pieces of rubber that do absolutely nothing unless you just so happen to have extra large ears.<br /><br />To be fair, they still sound pretty much as good as they did before, but what's the point if they won't stay in? I even tried using the larger foam tips they came with, but they always would just fall out. I'm not even running or anything like that, I'm just walking and these things won't even stay in. It's extremely frustrating to have to push them back in every 15 seconds.<br /><br />I blame it all on cheaper manufacturing. Like I said before, the difference was instantly noticeable. It's such a shame that Senso has gone down the path of so many other corporate institutions that think they can cheapen their products and people will just be ok with it. I threw these things in the garbage rather than try to have Senso replace them with another pair that more than likely will still be just as cheap. Maybe I just got a bad pair, but I highly doubt it. More than likely this is just greedy capitalism at play: cut costs and make more money. Except in this case, where I'm gonna buy my replacement pair from somewhere else."
1,Great quality headphones. I love them so much that I ordered a second pair for my husband. We both purchased the Jbird sports headphones last year and one of them broke already so we are look forward to using these instead.
0,Not very happy with it was not what I Expected  But I will keep it for back up thank you for emailing me
1,"Can't really use with only one ear unit in, like to hear at work and such.  If you turn your head and then back the other ear unit will tighten the &#34;string&#34; and pull it out of your ear.<br /><br />Sound seemed good to me and quality seems good too."
1,Good sound. Bass a little intense but that can be changed with an eq app.<br />My first set of BT headphones and I liked 'em a lot. Sure do wish I could find 'em cuz now they are ten bucks more...
1,well priced and great fitting headphones. nice quality sound comparable to name brands
1,Sounds great and had no issues! I’ve had them a few months now and they still work great. Also comes with a USB and iPhone charger which is a must!!!!
1,This is my second set after leaving my first on a trip down south. I couldn't imagine a better set o headphones for the price and quality!!!!
1,"I have not used these much, but so far the sound is GREAT! and pairing was easy. They are bulky and don't fit inside my motorcycle helmet, which is what I bought them for, I can still use them for mountain biking and running, etc."
1,I love these so far. I have worn them on 2 runs and they have much better sound quality than I anticipated. They arrived on time and the packaging was great. They come with so much stuff! I really like that it has a case and extra charging cable for the headphones. I've been looking for decent bluetooth headphones since I plan to run a half marathon soon and these are great! My only criticism is that they do need adjusting during my run sometimes as they shift out of my ears. But that is to be expected and may also be because I haven't had a chance to get fully used to them or try different size ear pieces yet.
1,"I have to admit, I am very impressed at the first opening of the package. I have been using the wired Bose soundsport earbuds for workouts. My frustration with the wires finally led me looking into wireless earbuds. I did not want to spend $150 on the newer wireless bose soundsport earbuds. I decided to give these a chance based on the reviews. It has full functionality and I am very impressed.<br /><br />I do not think the sound quality is on the Bose level, but it is still very impressive for the price. Very good value and worth the purchase. I am hoping these will stay in for a sweaty workout, otherwise I will be returning."
1,Great Sounding headphones. They feel fine when wearing and come with a hard case and dual car charger.<br />I wore them all day today working in the yard and They tend to move around and my ears were hurting toward the end of the day. But I ware my headphones all day most days so I feel that I will get used to them. I seem to have headphones hurt my ears often so I'm not knocking a star for this.<br />I have many pares and the current other pairs Im wearing are the plantations which cost $110 dollars and they hurt my ears also. The only ones that don't hurt are my LG HBS 900 which are about ready to die.All in All  love the sound and will be using these for all day use except for working in the yard.
0,These didn't last a month. In less than 30 minutes it starts beeping like the power is getting low. My cheaper pair of TaoTronics are much better and still going strong for months.
1,great
1,They're  good headphones for the price. The headphones are durable and comfortable for working out with.
1,"Superb, good fit, excellent sound and noise reduction"
1,"I really like these so far! My ears are really small so it’s kind of a pain to get the ear wraps around them, but they’re decently noise cancelling and pretty loud, I’ve used them maybe 8 times and they’re not dead yet, so that’s a plus. I also like that you can change volume and songs right on the headphone near the on button! Hope to get some extended use out of these."
0,Would have returned these had they not fit my husband's ears. I have small ears... but these things were massive and uncomfortably so. Wouldn't recommend for petite or small eared humans.
1,"Great sound, Easy setup, Long battery life.  So great product for the price"
1,1rst pair of Bluetooth I have owed  fired up well paired fast sound quality is there good fit in ear cannel
1,amazing for work
1,"Fantastic quality.  First thought was that given the low price they would not be as high quality as the more expensive units.  However, I have run through two high end units that do not hold up.  The SENSO fit fantastic, sound is outstanding, perfect for gym or yard work.  I have started utilizing them in day to day at the office and very impressed.  Great purchase."
1,Work great for running and on a motorcycle. They even hold at high speeds with no helmet. Just enough volume to comfortably cruise at 75-80mph and hear music fine. Battery last about 6-8hrs
1,I have had these for quite some time and I love them! The charge holds for quite some time and I havent had any issues! Highly recommended!
1,Don’t work
1,"These headphones are exceptional for the price. Haven't tested the ipx7 water resistant, but just the way the headphones look, it's probably not exaggerating on that score. Not going to lie these headphones have pretty banging quality for the price, they also stay in your ears very well, and are pretty good at noise canceling. There are only two complaints about the headphones, the volume up and down seems like it should be switched (that's not a big deal). The other thing about them is that you can't really only wear one in at a time, yes you can see this from the design, but if you like to wear headphones with one out then these might not be for you. Other than that they are a great buy."
0,No good!!!
0,"Update from previous review: I had bought my 3rd pair of these headphones despite the issues I outlined below I still felt like for the price they were decent but now I’ve reduced rating from 3 to 1 star. Don’t buy these. From the moment I first turned this latest pair on I could tell the quality had declined even further from the previous 2 pairs (first pair was pretty great, 2nd just ok) They feel cheaper and you have to hold the button longer to turn on you can tell the company is cutting corners and reducing the quality. This pair broke after about 7 months. The charging port basically fell apart so I can’t charge them anymore. Done with this brand.<br /><br />These were really great while they lasted. They fit and stay better around my ears than any other cordless headset I’ve bought. I guess for most electronics these days you can’t expect them to last more than a year but I’m still kinda bummed they just stopped working almost exactly a year from when I purchased them. Now they will connect to my Bluetooth for a couple seconds but then turn off so basically they’re done. I’d rate them 4.5 stars for how well they functioned while working. My only complaint (besides the 1 year shelf life) is I  wish they gave you more of a warning when the battery was dying. They only tell you when you have maybe 3-6 minutes left."
1,The Senso earphones are excellent and a great value for Bluetooth service.
0,"Right ear bud broke a week after using, sound quality very poor and material feels super cheap. There are better options at this price"
1,Wry nice product and great packaging. They paired with my new X phone right away. Instructions are clear and quick.
1,Works without issue.  has a decent range. I wear them while I work (Construction).  My ears do get a little sore after wearing them for 3-4 hours.
0,"I used to like these, sound was good, lasted a while, but after about 4 months the first ones stopped charging. I got 2 more pairs around Christmas, one for me one for my fiancé...mine went out in about March, hers just went out last week. All the same problem, they stop charging. Sad day....."
1,They are okay . Getting money back though they die fast definitely not 8 hrs of play not very loud for me .. also they take forever to connect
1,Second pair. Still good but sometimes the sound quality is so so. Has an echo effect
1,This is great head phones it's ver confortible and the sound is more than what I was expecting.<br />I highly recommend to get this head phone.
1,These are so comfortable I can listen to sleep music in bed without disturbing husband!
1,"Lightweight, good sound quality, good noise cancellation"
1,It is super.  Good sound and a great price.. love it
0,The earbuds worked for 30 days.  I tried to use them on another phone  I reached out to sales team. Still couldn’t get them too work. I have a semi new pair phones that don’t work
0,It gets turned off every time I turn it back on!
1,"These are great , especially for the price. battery last as long as they promise and the best part  they actually can be bent or twisted to fit your ear size and shape perfectly.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B01G8JO5F2 SENSO Bluetooth Headphones, Best Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7 Waterproof HD Stereo Sweatproof Earbuds for Gym Running Workout 8 Hour Battery Noise Cancelling Headsets]]"
1,Works very well.  Pleased.  Wish they had a clip for shirt to keep cord from flopping around. They are a bit bulky and stand out from the ears.  Ideally the overhangs would mold over ear.  Overall work very well.  Sound quality is good.
1,"I have had mine for about a month now and enjoy them while listening to music but while on calls, for some reason the calls drop back to the iPhone?? Other than that issue good Bluetooth. And a lot cheaper than the Beats"
1,"I like everything about the headphones except the EQ of them. They have too much low end and not enough mids and highs. In order to get the mids and highs up where they need to be you have to turn the volume up and then the mix is too loud and the bass is distorting. There needs to be a way you can change the EQ and then I would give it a five star. I'm a musician and a sound guy so this really sticks out and bothers me. The way the headphones feel on my ears is perfect. Once they are on you can't hardly tell they are there. Connecting to the headphones was no problem. My iPhone 7 plus connected to them right away. As far as the user controls on the right headphone, they are pretty good. The big button on the side turns them on/off and answers/hangs up calls nicely. The volume/track buttons on top are crisp and also work like a champ. The volume these headphones can reach is definitely way more than anybody needs. But if your listening to metal or hard rock the bass is so high that the mix sounds really muddy and distorting. I realize these are only $36 so I really can't complain to much about the sound. For how much they cost you can't beat them. But if your going for sound quality, you get what you pay for."
1,"Ok, so like many other people on here, I have tried everything. I settled on a pair of Beats that my husband  bought for my birthday. That was January 2016 and I was a casual user. Fast forward to April 2017, and I started training for a few 5Ks I wanted to do in the summer. After 1 month of hitting the gym 5-6 days a week the Beats stopped charging. Since they were out of warranty, nothing short of throwing $$ away could help them. So, I came to Amazon. This is where the thousands of reviews on this item helped me make my decision to buy these headphones.<br />When they arrived I was stoked and threw them in my gym bag for the morning. Completely not thinking about charging them. I got the gym and prayed they would work and luckily, they turned on and paired. It would be two full weeks of gym use before I needed to charge them!!! This is straight out of the box!! Since then I have used them almost every day and through about 6 different 5K races! They stay in my ears, don’t bother me with my glasses, have kick ass sound and were $30!! I was blown away by how much better they are than the Beats that were about 5 times more money. Take a chance and get these!!"
1,Good head phones for the price.
1,Clear and loud. Very comfortable.
1,Just as Advertised!
0,Took one shower with them broke instantly
1,"The sound quality is nice.  For a small company the style, comfort & look is sleek, modern & plus the case is likened to  BEATS and other top shelf brands.  Easy to use and very practical.  All in all worth the price and meets MY needs.  I have had BOSE & BEATS... Gave them to my youngins’.  I like these for me, will try higher end from this company next purchase."
0,"I’ve had three pairs. All three stopped charging at various times. I’ve only ever used the chords sent by Senso, and did not use quick chargers ok the last two pairs I owned. Do not buy these headphones. Waste of money. Sadly, everything else about them are great."
1,Interested in how they perform long term and durability.
0,These headphones have cut in and out every 4-5 steps for the last 2 and a half weeks I’ve been running with them.
0,"These headphones lasted me 2 years and 3 months , they got used about 4 times a week. They have stood up against rain and sweat. This is the longest a pair of headphones has lasted for me , and they are the least expensive.<br /><br />I had to order a new pair of these head phones because my old ones stopped working.  Unfortunately, this time, I only got about 4 or 5 uses out of them. They wont even turn on anymore. They also changed the way they fit around your ear which i dont like. Very disappointing."
1,I have tried several sets of headphones to work out with and these are the best I have found so far. No issues doing a 7 mile run or cross-fit workouts. They stay in place and handled sweat with no problem. So far so good!!
1,So much better than beats and cheaper it also comes with more stuff inside the package. Great investment
1,"Works great, please with these head phones. Sound quality could be better but they are headphones."
1,"These are great headphones. The sound quality is very nice. These headphones get heavy daily use in the gym or out running. After 3 months of use, they wouldn't power on one day before a run. I contacted customer service and they agreed that they should not have failed. They verified my address and in two days, I had a new pair. Responded to my email at 7pm and shipped the product out quickly. Now that's great customer service."
1,"They are pretty good for the price. However, when the battery hits 30% it starts saying &#34;Battery Low&#34; in your ears every 2 minutes. holy eff, why tf would you ever in a million years think this is a good idea? just let me run out of battery. I get it, it's low, but that doesn't mean they're unusable... but when you've got a recording yapping in my ear every two minutes about the battery, then they ARE unusable. Just awful."
1,The sound quality is great and hardly ever fall out while exercising.
1,I really seriously love the fit and sound of the Senso Bluetooth buds but I can  only give them a three star rating due to the extreme lack of battery duration.  I am only getting about four hours of playtime with these earbuds and that is just not good enough given today's battery technology.
1,The noise cancellation are better for workout it mostly cancels the noise when u are getting annoyed by people etc
1,"My previous headphones (which were half as expensive) had a very limited range, so much so that I had to have my phone in my jacket pocket instead of my pants pocket or it would cut out. This lead to my phone flying out of my pocket and busting the screen on the ground so I decided it was time to up my bluetooth game.<br /><br />The Senso headphones not only have great bluetooth range but the sound quality is better and with the over-the-ear hook, I can wear them at the gym even while doing exercises on my back where the previous pair used to fall off and/or out of range. I happily recommend these headphones to others. They're well worth the money."
1,Excellent as described very satisfied
1,Extremely happy with these headphones. Sound quality is extremely important to me and these headphones impressively delivered. I'm used to Bose sound products and was afraid to try something out of the comfort zone. I wanted a wireless headphone for working out. I've been catching myself using them all over. The built in mic seems to work great during phone calls.  Really like the pause and volume buttons on the ear piece. Only issue with these so far is the garbage zipper on the case.
1,They work great beyond expectations
1,My partner does house keeping for a sorority so is frequently using these in a high humidity environment while cleaning and these headphones have held up perfectly where others have failed
1,Good sound quality and very comfortable.
1,"I bought these headphones a few months ago when I gave my mother my airpods.  I wanted something cheap that I could use for several months while I decided what I wanted to do on replacing my airpods.  But when I started using them, they worked great.  The sound quality is exceptional especially for the price paid.  I haven't tested the 8 hour battery life yet but I have used them for 4 hours straight.  The fit was so good that I had no problems having them in my ears for that long.  I've also used them on video conference calls and the other parties could hear me clearly.  I like them so much that I will not be buying any other headphones.  The only thing I didn't like about them initially were the hooks until I figured out they bend to fit behind your ears.  Not one of my best moments.  So I highly recommend this product."
0,"This is my second time purchasing the headphones. I purchased them back in October as well. Both pairs have broken on me out of the blue. I contacted the manufacturer about the first pair and they got back to me that they would repair them and they never did, so I bought a new pair. The second pair is broken and now I am annoyed. I treat them well and can't understand why they break on me. I have only have these for 6 weeks! It's very hard to get a hold of the manufacturer to fix them."
1,"I'd been eyeing these for quite some time and just couldn't resist when they showed up on a recent lightening deal.  Great set of headphones, quality sound and decent battery life. They even came with a carrying case, extra various sized ear buds, usb car-charger, and charging cable. I would absolutely recommend these!"
1,fits well very loud sound will buy again
0,Broken within 2months of having them. Not worth almoat $40.00
0,The sound was actually pretty good when they stayed in my ears. The problem I had was if I moved at all they would loosen up and then in the process of pushing them back in my ear I'd hit the control button pausing the music. I tried 2 gym sessions with 2 different sized buds before giving up and sending back. I spent more time messing around with getting them to stay on my ears than actually working out...which is annoying. I've been happily using a cheapo pair of Philips with a similar design so was disappointed when these didn't work out. I think if the ear hook was sturdy vs flimsy they would have stayed on and been great.
1,Great price and easy to use
0,The sound quality was awful. Decided to return them and quit wasting my money on cheap headphones and ultimately bought some Beats.
1,Great for the price. I had a question about some fitting and I received a response right away. Used them for a half marathon and they performed nicely!
1,"So far I have been very happy.  This is the 3rd pair of earbuds I have tried and they seem to be the best at staying in my ear so far.  While the sound is not as good as my blue tooth over the ear, they give me more flexibility than my over the ear.  I can wear them skiing under my helmet, under my earmuffs when mowing the lawn, weed wacking, or even using my chainsaw.  I love the sound you get from the over the ear headphones, but there are disadvantages to not being able to hear noises around you.  Try cooking with good over the ear and your pot is boiling over while you are not looking and you cannot hear it........  Overfill the sink with water because again, you are not paying attention and you cannot hear the water running.  Really like the balance the Senso's provide for the cost.  They allow me to have 2 pairs of Bluetooth headphones."
1,"Came package very nice, easy set up. Quality sound, used them in the steam room to text the water proof and no issues to date."
1,"I was worried that these headphones would have awful sound quality, flimsy construction or a poor bluetooth connection because of the price. I experienced none of those problems. They stay on snugly and stand up to sweat - a big improvement over the wired earbuds I had been using. I'm sure the sound quality of a more expensive pair would be better, but I'm no audiophile and mostly listen to podcasts or audiobooks."
1,Love these headphones! Great alternative for bluetooth on a motorcycle with a half helmet than one of the dedicated devices which are more expensive and hot around your ears.
1,"So far, so good!!! I️ am not a high tech person and this is great for me. I️ enjoy that there are no wires that would get in the way of my workout. It comes with additional earbuds, a case, and more wiring for charging."
0,"The sound quality is fantastic. Very good bass and range of volume. Maybe I got a bad pair but the Bluetooth range is just awful...being nice. Godforbide i have my phone in my pocket and turn my head, it disconnects every time. It only works if I'm standing still holding it level with my earbuds. If the Bluetooth signal actually worked, this would be been the best purchase and full 5 star."
1,Works perfect and easy-to-use good reception on phone when making calls
1,Great value. This company managed to offer great product and quality bonus accessories while offering affordable price. Very impressed!
1,The sound is amazing!
1,"Wear these all the time when working out, love em!!!"
1,"I have used these Senso Bluetooth Headphones since June of 2017 (almost 8 months).  For the price, they are a real value.  If you can deal with a few quirks in storage and human interface, they will serve you well.  I have used them while hiking, jogging, doing yard work and in rain, snow, and sunshine.<br />PROS:<br />- Great price.<br />- Great fit (at least for my ears).  Used both foam and standard ear pieces.  Foam works best for heavy exercise.<br />  Confortable for 2-3 hours a stretch.  I seldom push earbuds beyond that.<br />- Long battery.  Usually pushing 10 hours.<br />- Great sound, good base, decent highs, although a recent gift of PowerBeats3 earbuds have me experiencing far superior sound.<br />  These deliver very good overall sound and work well for when you are on the go; better than earbuds that have cost more than twice the money.<br />CONS:<br />- If you use the semi-hard case that comes with them, the earbuds often turn on unintentionally.  Not good.<br />  I've had to really watch out for this.  The main button (pause, take a call, etc.) that also switches them on/off<br />  has no protection from accidental presses.<br />- The controls are backwards from all other wearable blue-tooth appliances I've ever owned.  Annoying.<br />  Forward button should skip forward and increase volume; back button should skip back and decrease volume.  They operate opposite of this.<br />- The nifty USB cable that switches between mini-USB and Lighting gave up the ghost after 5 weeks of use.  All other accessories still work fine."
1,"These headphones are great. My favorite part, the power and sound control are in the right ear piece so they don’t have the clunky controls that most other headphones do."
1,"I have had these for over a year or 2 and they still work great. Sound good. I'm not that picky. Only use these when I workout and they function perfect. Never fell out of my ears.<br /><br />I was in between these and a much more expensive pair and ive been very happy with these. And will purchase again if/when needed.<br /><br />Negative would include the range and connection with multiple devices. I can walk maybe 20 -40 before they start breaking up. And if every time I use my laptop, I have to deactivate them afterwards otherwise on my phone they go in out very frequently. Like I said above, for the price they work great. The negatives are Minor annoyances.<br /><br />Battery life is average. Seems like I charge them every couple days after daily use of an hour or 2."
1,"I bought these &#34;by mistake&#34;, as my 15 year old son had showed me a pair of &#34;the other brand&#34; and I forgot to save it, I thought these were the one's he wanted and the reviews were outstanding so I hit the magic button.  He was worried when I showed him which one's I had coming, as he had his heart set on the other one's.  He's only had them for 2 days now, and is giving a tremendous review for these buds!  (Whew! Yay Mom!)  He is a huge gamer and listens to music pretty much all day and say's that when a really good song comes on, he'll just &#34;tap my ear and the bass absolutely thumps!&#34;  The charging is fast, the need to charge is seldom, they're comfortable, the carrying case is cool, easy to figure out... these are a BIG win in his opinion!  As his mother, let's not forget that price!!  Definitely recommended!!"
0,Bought it 03/29/2017. Now the volume on one side is coming on/off. So what can I expect from a product like this. Though the initial presentation of the product is good.
0,Sound quality is horrible. The signal is constantly breaking up while jogging.  Returning for a refund
0,"Not sure how these earbuds got great reviews.  I was not going to review it, but I feel compelled after being charged 6 bucks to return these things.  6 bucks?  I thought about giving them to goodwill, but I could not inflict these on another earthling.<br /><br />First, they feel cheap.  I mean really cheap!<br />Second, if you turn your head the music cuts in and out.... I mean annoyingly cuts in and out.... like I'm taking these things off now annoying.<br />Third, noise cancelling?  Huh?  Where?  I won't express my thoughts on the different rubber plugs.....<br />Fourth, the cord that ties the earbuds together..... yeah that makes a very nice resonating sound when I turn my head side to side.... really appreciate that sound.<br />Fifth, ???? Well, you get the point.  These really did not work for me.<br /><br />My advice.... keep shopping as these are pretty lackluster which is a nice way of saying well... I think my review was negative enough so I'll stop now."
1,"I bought these on sale for about 70% off,and I could not be happier with my choice. The sound quality is excellent and the battery life more than adequate. The only con so far is that there are some dead spots at certain angles to my phone, but that's probably an issue with my phone and not enough of an issue to really matter anyway. As for my opinion on if they're really worth the $170 price tag: I'm not sure yet. I might be able to tell six months down the line, and hopefully I'll remember to append my review once I'm sure."
0,"Took the headphones while a walk in the park and the sound kept cutting off, much static and it was very bad in a mild wind....seems as you can hear the wind funneling in ears more that the actual music in headphones. I even try to restart it and paired device several times as a restart but it didn't help a bit."
1,Easy to pair with my phone; good sound; comfortable and stable when running.
1,"So far they have been great! Ive only had them for a week but I've used them everyday for when I am at work. No problems with them at all. The quality is a bit lower when I am listening to music with serious bass. However, all other music sounds awesome! If you are not listening to music with ridiculous bass, these should be perfect. I am happy with the purchase and would buy them again."
1,Only used them 1 time so far. Good sound quality. Easy set up. Fitment good. They didn't fall out of my earstuff while running.
0,"These will not stay in, disappointed"
1,"These headphones have become one of the best purchases I have ever made.  Very flight and easy to use. For the price compared to the products, this is an amazing product.  I highly recommend."
1,"Use these for the gym, and I love them! Great for gifts too!"
1,Kinda stands out a lot from the ears...but still a good purchase~
1,great product - I had previously had the wireless beats and both products are very comparable
1,This was a Gift for my Wife for Christmas....She thinks they are Great.....She wore them most of the day singing around the house....Sure made my day peaceful .....Thanks Nice Headphones and Easy to set up....FIVE Star  *****
1,Last year I bought a pair of the Phaiser BHS-730s. I was happy with what the 730s gave me - good lightweight headphones to using while working out. Well I lost those so I saw that these Senso S250s were highly rated and priced about the same. So far they're far more comfortable than I anticipated and the sound is really great. So far I'm very happy with the purchase and would recommend it to others.
1,"I use my new Senso Bluetooth Headphones while exercising, while sitting at my desk during work hours, and sometimes when I am at home.  They are very easy to use and the sound quality is very good.  They connect/disconnect from my phone very quickly and efficiently."
1,Wonderful product! Extremely easy to use.
1,"Nice wireless earbuds, especially for the price.  Sound is great, and earpiece is comfortable."
1,Great Product! Works really well when I am working out. Sounds are crisp and clear.
1,Love these! Great sound!
1,Quit working after 11 months and I didn't use them every day.
1,"I have never left a review for anything that I can remember on Amazon.  I have had these headphones for three years and I use them almost everyday for listening to music, audiobooks, podcast, and talking on the phone.  I have gotten more use for the dollar out of this purchase than any other item I can remember.  They still work as good as new, have great sound quality, and the battery always lasts as long as I need them which is generally a few hours at a time."
0,Do NOT purchase these for cycling. The wind noise above 10mph is really bad over 15 is unbearable. I took them off mid ride as I could not stand the sound of wind roaring in my ears. I tried the different ear pieces none of them made any difference. These might be fine in the gym or a spin class but not for  cycling.
0,"I didn't care for these at all.  They didn't seem to fit my ears well, nor did they stay in place.  I returned them without issue."
0,I only use these in the gym and there is so much interference that I've gone back to using my wired earbuds. I had tried deleting the device in my settings multiple times and I continue to get interference. They sound good overall but I can't take all the static and going in and out so I guess I'll just have to bite the bullet and purchase a pair of Beats wireless earbuds.
1,"Stay in place while running and are soft and comfortable. Sound quality is good. Easy to use. I occasionally get some breaking up even with my phone right next to me, but it's infrequent.  I'm very happy with my purchase and recommended them to a friend who is also active."
1,Wow jus wow... excellent headphones and they fit great.. what really shocked me was the quality of the sound. Will surely recommend to everyone.
0,"I’ve used them like five times. Invariably, either they don’t stay charged, or they just don’t turn on no matter how many days they’ve been on the charger. Or they just don’t connect to my phone. They are so unreliable it’s impossible to use them without also having regular headphones as a back up. I wish I could return them."
0,"I purchased a couple of these in 2018 and they were great. The sound quality was good, the battery was decent, and the ear buds stayed on your ears. Unfortunately, this is no longer the case. The quality seems to have dropped tremendously to match the lower cost of this latest build (30% cheaper than what they cost in 2018).<br /><br />The sound is really disappointing now. It's like they stripped out the some of the low and high frequencies, and now it's just mid heavy. The case feels cheaper, and they fall off your ears easily due to the larger ear hooks it has now(and yes, I've tried bending them to fit my ears). I can't comment on battery life because they sound so bad that I have not worn them long enough to drain the battery.<br /><br />I'll be tossing these in a drawer for emergency use and looking for another full time use headset."
0,"So far so good. When these are seated well in the ear you get the best bass but otherwise a little on the treble side. Mine did not come with three different size ear buds like their manual has for the S-250. I got mine through a promo offer for $8.99 so for 9 bucks Im happy.<br /><br />UPDATE: Yah so if you get a year out of these count yourself lucky. Charging stopped, in the trash they went. Was actually good while they lasted, for not so long."
0,"This is the 2nd pair that I've ordered in less than 2 years.  The first pair just stopped working one day and I thought that it was a random thing, so I ordered a 2nd pair.  Today these ones stopped working.  They light up on the charger, but when I remove them, they won't turn on and none of the trouble shooting options are working."
0,"The sound is real choppy. They were a great price, but they don't work as desired."
0,"Looks like it is a defective piece, the person on the other side cannot hear me and it happen every time I use it. Returning it !"
1,"I must say, so far so great. I really enjoy the crisp sound quality that these earphones put out. And you can't beat the price. As of right now the sweat protection is really holding up. When I'm working out I sweat a lot, and so far, I haven't experienced any issues."
1,Good sound even in a loud gym!
1,Headphones are great and worth the money I’m really happy I chose them .. and the charger that comes with it as well is just a bonus in this package ... thank you
1,"they are a great product for a great price. I've ordered them for my friends and several co-workers have also ordered them, we are all happy with the sound and the performance."
1,Love it!
0,"This product worked great a few times. After about 6 months of use, the audio cuts out for about 2 seconds and returns. I just ignored it intially thinking it was my bluetooth connection but lately it has been happening almost every 20 seconds.<br />I cannot use it anymore."
0,"claim to be sweatproof, but won’t turn on after wearing for 32 days.<br /><br />Return policy expires after 30 days..."
1,Great fit and good quality. Choppy reception at times but very good experience thus far overall.
1,These were alright. I did not like the hooks over the  ears. Static did occasionally occur while playing music.
1,"By far the best ear buds I've had. Great fit in the ear, starts out and doesn't come loose, no heavy pull from the cord. Used them when weight lifting, doing cardio and core, and running. Also best sound of all I've tried."
1,Good sound. Long battery life. Works well. One problem that took one star off the rating: terrible wind noise when running. The wind nose is so strong I had a tough time hearing music. So had to increase volume to unsafe level. Eventually had to replace them.
1,"I just got them and am evaluating. What I seen so far I am impressed, the quality feels good and the packing is elegant and well done. I liked the follow up emails and the repeated statement of full warranty on the product. On to testing it for real, to be continued..."
1,Enjoyed them very much on my runs.
1,They were so easy to sync to my phone and work really well while I work out. I love the case that came with 2 charging options and plenty of extra ear bud covers.
1,so far loving these headphones!! need to use them on a run before I could give five stars
1,"Sound quality is not as good as some of the other, cheaper BT earbuds I own. Not a deal breaker, but not my go to pair either. I like the waterproof aspect of these over my other buds. They are light and fit seems OK so far. Time will tell how they hold up."
1,"I like it. Works good, connects easily. Just doesn't have that good of a base sound. But a great price."
0,The blue flash every 5 seconds while paired is very irritating
1,"I’ve had these for several days now. I’ve used them for about 5 hours so far and have not had to charge. Sound is actually better than I expected, even with the good reviews on them. They are LOUD. Which I like. Great bass, decent treble and mid sound. You really can’t go wrong for $30. In fact you wouldn’t go wrong with these for more than double the price."
1,"Price, quality and build is online with Powerbeats3. I could but 4 of the Senso Activbuds 250 for the price of the Powerbeats3. It would be nice if Invotek built a EQ App for IOS and Android to get more bass out of these activbuds."
1,"Works great, as expected."
1,"Very good headphones. Only downside, you hear the slightest wind will using running or outdoors. Otherwise pretty good."
1,Been using these at the gym for about a week and a half now and they have been great. They fit my ears nicely and I don't have to worry about them falling out mid set. I have not had any issues with skipping or dropping connection which is great. Sweat seems like no problem for them. When I'm lifting heavy and sweating a lot they just keep doing what they are supposed to.
1,"I have these for about two years now, and I must say that it's still holding up pretty well. These things are damn loud when you put them to the max so watch out for that. They are also pretty good at picking up muffled/lowered sounds when I use them to watch videos. They secure nicely to your ears, depending on what tip you put on (never changed mine and they fit well in other people's ears when they borrow them), and I have used them during exercise. The noise cancelling is passive, meaning that they act like ear plugs, and they do drown out background or environmental noises, not completely though but still pretty well that I find them good for calls. I love the added accessories too!<br /><br />My only gripe with the product is the Bluetooth connectivity. It used to be super easy and fast to connect to my Iphone 6+ when it was brand new, but then I have difficulty connecting it sometimes. It still works though, just annoying when it does not work on the get-go. Works well with a Samsung S8 too!<br /><br />Oh yeah, don't be stupid and assume that the battery life has a long duration like 8-240 hours. It might be like that when its new, but after a couple of months, you will see performance to drop as battery loses charge over time; it is also good to note that the duration of battery depends on usage.<br /><br />Overall, not bad!"
1,"I've only had them for a week but so far they've been awesome.  The connection is great, I haven't had any issues with them cutting out.  Plus I have smaller ears and they stayed in all workout long without any problems.  Plus my husband tried them because his other brand of headphones kept falling out and he liked them so much he got his own pair.  Great buy for the price, you really can't get any better!"
0,was fine for the first 3 times we used it but stopped pairing with my phone. I'm in the process of contacting SENSO to see how good their service is going to be.
0,Earphones stopped working after 5 months.  Would not pair and would not hold charge
1,fair
1,Work really well
1,"Great buds, but somehow died from lack of use.  Stood behind warranty and replaced after 10 months."
0,"When replacing my S-255, i accidently purchased these s-250. They are not nearly as comfortable nor do they have they same quality ... big disappointment"
0,Worked for a year. 7 days after initial purchase the left ear bud lost sound. Contacted the company and did the reset however did not work. Since I was only 7 days past the year warranty I was hoping they would make it right but told be I would need to buy new headphones.  Won't buy from this company again.
1,I have bought several headphones from Amazon and these are the best that I have owned. The sound quality is great and the bass is unbelievable and they fit very comfortable. I had a pair similar but these come with a cord organizer which prevents the cord from flopping around.<br /><br />These are highly recommended.
0,Worked great for six months but have stopped pairing with my iphone today. I have tried factory reset several times. I have tried forgetting your device. Nothing helps. I will contact customer support today. But I have also noticed others having this issue so just be weary as a buyer. Also any wind becomes very loud using these headphones so they really work best in an office.
1,"Great product especially for the price.  A quick 15 minute charge on the way to the gym keeps the earbuds charged for my entire 2 1/2 hour workout.  The sound quality is almost as good as that of Beats or Bose earbuds but at the price, I can't complain.  The case is quality and so are the accessories for charging.  Longevity is my only concern but time will tell as far as that goes. After one week of having these though, I rate them 5 starts and probably the best bargain I've come across in a long time!"
1,It is great not to be tethered to a device.  I am amazed at how far away I can get from my tablet and still hear the sound perfectly.
1,I love these headphones. I let my wife try them and I didn’t get them back.
1,Still using them. Been many months. Awesome.
1,"Excellent sounds quality; stay put throughout various activities; are comfortable. The microphone quality is lacking, so I wouldn't recommend this to make/take calls, but otherwise these are very convenient. Something to be said about the packaging and the extras - as other reviews mentioned, this set comes with a variety of neat extras. Opening the box really feels like you've given a present to yourself."
1,Awesome earphones for the gym.  I’m definitely happy I didn’t overpay just to get a brand name
1,"It was a gift for my son, for his birthday."
1,Perfect
1,Nice product! I'm very pleased!
1,Works as expected...good sound quality.
1,"They fir great, and I have very small ears.  The sound is perfect.  A great value.  I know I will buy more!"
0,"I bought this headphones twice. First time, I accidentally stepped on this and was broken. Second time, the press button on the right bud got dented with any accident. I could not press the button so that the switch could not be turned on. Other than that, from some point(4-5 months passed), this automatically turns on and off. Overall, performance is fine, but short life span."
1,"I'm always a little nervous buying headphones, especially blutooth headsets, because sound quality and comfort are always a huge issue for me. I was pleasantly suprised by the sound quality and overall build. Nice light ear buds that stayed in place while I ran. 10/10 product"
0,Cannot get the Bluetooth on my Samsung S7 phone to recognize them.
0,"Great value although right after warranty stopped working very disappointing, while they worked great, actually bought another pair for my father hope they keep working since the warranty is up on them also 😞"
1,"There is no readon to spend hundreds of dollars on very expensive earbuds. This SENSO is easy to use, has great quality and is backed by ONE YEAR WARRANTY that you can actually reach people by phone. 5 SOLID STARS!!!"
1,"I love these headphones because I could use them when I go swimming. However, one time water got in they  didn't work for couple of hours.  they work fine again. I love them because I can use them at the pool."
1,"Seems to be working out great so far, stays securely in place while running!"
1,Works well so far
1,Fit my ears perfectly. Sound is excellent at a very affordable price. The behind the ear hook holds them securly in place. I have tried standard ear buds only to have ear pain within a short time of wearing them. Senco Bluetooth headphones are designed where I can wear them for hours without any ear pain. Thank You!
0,Do NOT waste your money. The charger that came with it didn’t even fit the ear pieces and so first time I went to charge them they broke. I’ve had them sitting in box ever since bc idk if it’s my fault for damage or not or how to go about that.
1,"Great headphones, stay in comfortably, and surprisingly great sound. Definitely would recommend to anyone."
1,The device is very easy to pair with my phone and the signal rarely drops off.  The ear buds are quite comfortable.
1,Great value for the price and also great sound
1,Great for working lut
1,Love them at the gym.
1,Blown left speaker after 4 months of normal use at the gym. We have older pairs that work well. Trying to deal with Senso to get replacement. Not the smoothest process.
0,They don’t fit your ears good
1,Works as expected. Sounds great
0,"Unfortunately, this is the second pair of these headphones that I have owned in the last year and again they have began to falter. I understand paying for what you get, but I'm really disappointed in the lifespan quality of these headphones. I have had this specific pair for just about 8 months and the sound is beginning to go in and out from ear to ear. Not sure if I will buy again and might just end up spending money on better quality so I don't have to keep dealing with this problem."
1,Great headphones for the price. Sound quality is really good and the battery lasts quite a long time. I like that the hooks for the ears are flexible. They actually stay on my ears!
0,"When these first arrived and I put them on I was disappointed that I was unable to find ANY way to wear them without causing pain inside my right ear. I couldn't understand but assumed that as the right side is the control side it must be slightly different. I understand that I'm incredibly sensitive, but unfortunately that means that a piece of hard plastic pushing into the cartilige inside of my ear ends up being incredibly painful. Still, I tried to ignore this.<br /><br />I was happy when I was able to quickly pair the earbuds with my Samsung Galaxy S7 (shows how cheap I am, but I'm happy for the upgrade from my S5.) I was also happy when I was able to actually answer a call. The sound coming through was unbearably loud, but that's no surprise for me, again Ms. overly sensitive. The frustrating thing was that although I was supposed to be able to adjust the sensitivity so that the next time I answer and make a call it would be quieter, I found that every single time I answered and made calls I had to adjust the volume down once the call was connected.  Not very fun since I pretty much have to have the earbuds in my ears to do this. If I don't, I end up disconnecting the call with the overly sensitive buttons. I was on my way to blowing out my eardrums.<br /><br />Along with my being overly sensitive I am unfortunately extremely quiet. Not so fun for anyone else whom I'm trying to talk to. No matter how high I turned up my phone AND the earbuds, and not to mention put all the energy I had into trying to use my diaphram to control my oxygen and voice level, the person on the other end was always telling me they couldn't hear me. What people WERE able to hear however were any sounds that were around me, such as birds chirping, a slight breeze blowing or water running.<br /><br />These Bluetooth headphones were supposed to allow me to use my phone since I'm unable to hold it up to my head for more than a minute or two due to chronic illness related disability. It's been so difficult searching for a replacement Bluetooth for my previous Plantronic that I got at Costco many years ago. I especially miss the ones which were able to properly do voice-to-text.<br /><br />People don't understand how hard it is for the disabled to be able to acquire products and technology necessary to assist them in their lives while meanwhile people who don't need such things are much more apt to come by these products and technologies. Sorry for the gripe, it was more a reflection that I used to have this on my $30 bluetooth for my Palm phone, but once that sort of thing became mainstream it's all of the sudden $300 and requires a $1,000 phone. Ridiculous what some people will pay money for instead of deciding that's ridiculous.<br /><br />Oh well. I almost forgot the about the case. This headset comes in a semi-hard rounded zippered case. And my dog thinks it's the perfect size to grab and try to get me to chase her around the house for. So at least she likes the case. :) That's all that really matters anyways."
1,"Better then I expected given the price. The packaging is nice, a few extras in the box. The sound quality is good. I had been using the LG headphones, but the quality of those are dropping. While the charge of these doesn't last as long, I think it is less likely that these will break."
1,"I love them,  I'm thinking of getting my daughter and son a pair."
1,My son loves them
1,Headset is awesome; Senso customer service is even better. Highly recommend!
1,Just what I expected. Nice sound and staying in your ear. Pairing was a non issue. Delivery was fast. Black and red color scheme works for me. They are also light. Overall great product.
1,I bought these to wear while riding my motorcycle.<br />So far they are working very well. I would recommend them
0,These stopped working only after a few times using
1,my first pair lasted 4 months and stopped working all of a sudden. I contacted the company and they replaced them at no charge. Great headphones for the price and good customer service.
0,"Budget-friendly Bluetooth earbuds, good for working out, but... out of the box the ear hooks were way too big. I think I have average-size ears.  After two or three uses at the gym the right ear hook got loose, breaking the little tension there was to keep the earbud fastened to my ear. I bought these December 2019. Threw them away February 2020. They might have been a defective pair."
1,Ear phones are great! Simple to work and paired easily w Bluetooth connection! So happy with the purchase!
0,I personally didn't like this. They didn't stay on/in my ear when I moved about throughout the day. The cord either kept snagging my curls or fell over to one side when I turned my head. After a while I found my ears hurt from use. It just wasn't for me.
1,"Lightweight, comfortable, sounds good.<br />Have been told that the microphone doesn't sound that great by some others.<br />A little hard to operate just because they don't have many visual indicators.<br />They can pair with other devices and start beeping when you get out of range, so operation can be a little tricky.<br /><br />But for what I wanted: they do the job well and I'm glad I bought them."
1,"The sound is amazing. I love how they come with the dual charger, the charging cords, the extra earbuds and case. You can't beat the price for everything you get. I just don't like how the flaps that go behind the ear are so big and you can't adjust them to fit your ears. It's hard to keep them in my ears. I might give them to my boyfriend for that reason, he has bigger ears. But over all great product for your money"
1,My second set. I lost the first. Sound it good.
1,"Stay put on long runs, seem water resistant and are clear.  Stay connected fairly well.  For the price they seem great."
0,Dead after 9 recharging sessions.
1,"Another one of those products that I was skeptical about. I mean for the price I had expected sound quality to be garbage, but they are quite nice.  Look I am sure you can go drop $200 on some Boss or Beats and maybe have a bit more hi-fidelity, but I am telling you, these are awesome.  They are comfortable to wear, the ear hooks keep them attached to your head and the tunes a rolling.  I am also happy that I can use these while talking on the phone. I did not even realize that until after I had gotten them.  The charge seems to last forever, rarely do I ever plug them in.  Has a little carrying case so you don't lose them in your purse of gym bag or where ever you keep your things."
1,I'm really enjoying these buds on my walks/runs. They do block some noise but just enough so you still hear what's going on around you. I used the smallest rubber inserts for my ears and they seem too stay in just fine. I've tried several others and was not happy with them.
1,The headphones are very comfortable and the fidelity is very good.  A quality product.  I bought these headphone for myself and liked them so much I bought a pair for my wife and my son.
1,Fit and work great.
1,"The product was listed as a replacement for the OEM pads from Bose and it fulfilled that statement in quality, ease of installation, comfort and noise reduction."
1,Excelent.
1,"easy to use ,they sound great,best of all they stay in place when working out at gym.would recommend to everyone."
1,Very good bluetooth headphone.
1,Excelent
0,I bought these and they worked for three months and then the left side now only works about 10% of the time and is always cutting out.  I have reached out to the seller and they had me try to reset to factor settings but that did nothing.  I have reached out again but have not heard anything back.
1,"I've had these for a few weeks.  Love them.  They do not fall out while running.  The connecting cord is lightweight and is barely noticeable.  They produce nice sounding music, and the microphone works well for calls.  I have not had any issues with blue tooth connectivity; I typically carry my phone on my waist band.<br /><br />I had a plantronics headset forever, but it finally broke after years of hard use.  I actually like these much better.  Looking forward to logging many miles with these puppies."
1,I am really happy with them. Very easy to use. Thanks
1,My favorite headphones ever. This is my 3rd purchase not because the broke but because I’ve lost them!! I’ve gotten other people hooked on these. If you are looking for reliable headphones that won’t break with sweat buy these. The sound quality is nice and they are long lasting.
1,Excellent wireless headphones.  Easy to connect.  Good audio quality.  Excellent for sports and activities requiring moving.  Competitive price.<br />Thanks
1,Love these. Good choice
1,"Biggest negative is the battery life...they die pretty quickly and you must keep them on the charger between use.  I use mine on the motorcycle to get GPS directions and they are OK but can only be used with my half-helmet.  They are too big for a 3/4 or full-face helmet with doing some modifications to the helmet.  The sound is OK for GPS voice but not very good for music.  Mine are a bit scratchy and the bass is almost non-existent.  That said, they were not expensive so I was not expecting much.  The bluetooth connection to my phone and GPS was easy and works well."
0,Not worth the money. People can’t hear me unless I’m screaming out loud...but they are great for listening to music.
1,They work well and are very comfortable. Easy to set up. Would buy again.
1,"Got these a couple days ago and they are great. Comfortable, long battery, good sound quality. Perfect for working out. I highly recommend them."
1,Works ok but needs frequent charging. Not like a blade razor shave
1,"Headphones are exactly as described. I'm not a fan of the quality of sound though, and would likely spend more in the future on better quality sound. That is just based on my own preference, and might sound great to the next user!"
1,"These headphones are priced at such a great price.  The sound quality is better than my other more expensive headphones.  It comes with so many extras such as car charger, case, etc.  You cannot go wrong with these headphones."
1,Have only used them once but they are definitely the best I’ve ever purchased. I never touched them once during my 12 mile run because they didn’t budge. Also very comfortable and the Bluetooth connection was great! I’m hoping to have these around for a long time. The last two pairs I had either quit completely or wouldn’t charge after 3 months of purchase and I spent double on them. I’ll never buy an expensive pair again.
1,"Blown away by the quality of the headphones. Arrived on time and very light weight around the ears. Every call on my cell is clear and unlike other blue tooths others can't tell I'm one during a call. Great product, will purchase again from this company!"
1,Best wireless headphones I ever bought!
1,"They work great; however, I'm not comfortable with the cord going around the back of my neck. I move a lot and sometimes the cord will stick to the back of my neck and pull one of the earbuds out."
1,"I bought these for my Grandson , 17, and he loves them. He did all the research and found that these are &#34;THE ONES&#34;. He had the Beats and we had nothing but trouble he likes these better! Yeah Gramma!"
1,"They are ok. Two things: the volume does not go as high as my phone. This might be user error but I tried with my regular headphones and was able to turn up the volume higher. Also, they are too big for my ears. They work fine though."
1,Very good headphones. Perfect for working out
0,I was impressed by the sound quality and I have used it not frequently. But for past few days....the connection between my s7 edge and headphone keeps on dropping and reconnecting......I am trying to find a solution......
1,"Pairs quickly and easily, sound great, waterproof. Great value! One criticism, Bluetooth cuts out intermittently when my phone is in my left hip pocket, which is my usual phone pocket."
1,Great Bluetooth headphones. Don't fall out when using.
1,Amazing sound.  We bought 3 for Christmas and everyone loves them.
1,"Sound on these are better than average. Better than my Pixel Buds and probably my Skullcandy Uproars. When you get a good seal with the right sized earpieces, there is some decent isolation and the sound is great. Unfortunately I haven't gotten the left bud to fit with my ear so this design isn't perfect and the wire tightener that goes behind your neck is easy to lose (already lost it).<br /><br />I would maybe think twice before purchasing again but overall pretty happy!"
0,please get a warranty with product  these ear buds and all brand types  after 45 days battery goes dead not rechargeable  after  purchasing  4-5 different types . they all have short life battery life. unfortunetly you cant remove or replace batterys. Hopefully they make some types in future you can .Looks like were not there yet. Good luck  beware buyers.
1,"Great buy, beautifully made and accssorized<br />Noise canceling is passive, not active but it does the job"
0,I'm returning the product because the plastic on the ear piece won't stay in place. It's very loose and flimsy.
0,"Product is junk.  First pair lasted a month, they sent me a replacement pair and those also lasted about a month."
0,Mic stopped working in couple of months. Sound quality is good though.
1,awesome
1,Made of brittle plastic but The sound quality is amazing! Would recommend to anyone.
1,FIrst I bought the Wireless Beats and had problems with them. Then I saw the SENSO Wireless and I am super happy with them
1,"Overall very satisfied with sound volume and quality of sound. Fit to ear in ear is ok which is about the highest praise you can give as no earbud fits perfect in my world. Use during yard work and bicycling with no issue. Two minor issues, fit and finish is not perfect and when connected to two Bluetooth devices at same time buds cuts out periododicaly.  Small issues considering price point. The fix, turn off other BT device.  No issue as a result of fit. Would I recommend or buy again, you bet. In fact already bought second as backup."
1,When I first put the headphones on I thought they were going to be much too big to be useful. It didn't feel like I could get a secure fit on my ear. It took a few minutes of moving and twisting but once I found the right way to settle them they've been great. I went for a jog and they didn't dislodge even a little. I've worn them while cleaning and had no issues at all. It's a great product that just requires a bit of patience at first.
1,"I use these when I run outside. They stay in my ears really well. The sound quality is good and they do a pretty good job at blocking any ambient sound. The only thing that I don't like is that when it's windy, there is a lot of background wind noise."
1,bluetooth crackles and pops randomly from time to time.  just enough to be irritating.
0,Do not purchase. I have only used the earphones maybe 6 times since the end of May and my right headphone has already gone out. I am very careful with my belongings. The headphones have been neatly placed in the case until I need to use them or charge them. There is no reason why they would be broken. I am very disappointed. I purchased these thinking they would last me a while. NOT THE CASE.
0,"They worked fine for one day.  Then the sound would disappear for a few seconds, then come back again, then disappear.  So annoying.  I am returning them."
1,Very Happy
0,"Often had connection problems and would disconnect until I turned it off and on again. Occasionally this would work, but more often than not I would have to try several times before it stayed connected. There's much better Bluetooth earbuds you can get at this price. Sound quality was fine but not spectacular."
0,"I bought these for riding my bicycle. Maybe not a good idea.......<br /><br />If you plan on riding a bike and talking on the phone, or listening to music on your phone while riding a bike.....well.....it may be better buying corded headphones rather than these. Or perhaps purchase a better pair of wireless headphones if they exist.  Maybe buy lower profile headphones or ones with less surface area to reduce exposure to the wind. These kind of stick out and you may say they &#34;grab&#34; the wind. If you cup your hand in front of either side it removes the issue.......if you want to ride one handed or no handed in order to clearly hear your music or your friend on the other end of the phone that will do the trick but do you REALLY want to do that? Seriously, these aren't made for using while on your bicycle. I am disappointed.<br /><br />If you use these, plan on turning up the volume because if you are riding your bike all you'll hear is the wind in your ear. It helps if you turn your head left or right while talking or listening but that can be dangerous, annoying, impractical, or whatever."
1,"I have to go with 3 stars because I ordered two and one was defective, the other was great! I ordered 2 of these in one order and gave one to my daughter as a gift. She loves them! But I couldn't keep them on my ears. Recently she was in town and borrowed mine and said that mine were not the same. Mine had very floppy ear pieces which would not hold on to ears. Mine were defected and I didn't realize it until she showed me hers. How can I get a new pair? I'd love to hear from the seller. I'll write a new review if I hear from the seller."
1,"Bought these last minute for a marathon race i was running, for the price they worked great...  Beats buy $200 beats by Dr. Dre...  I would recommend them, you don't have to spend a lot on ear buds, since they are in your ears, you will hear the music just fine."
1,They are very comfortable and the battery lasts more that what you’d expect.
0,"Sound quality is not good... but yet again, what do you expect from a cheap knock off."
1,"I really like these headphones. I love the fact that they are wireless and not bulky. I can easily carry them in my hand, pocket, or purse. I have had issues before with headphones that are not over the ear due to multiple earrings that I have but these were not uncomfortable. They hook over the ear to help keep them in place."
1,"Great headphones. Seat well, pair with multiple devices (phone + tablet). Volume up/down buttons, track skip, microphone. Everything I was looking for! Great for connecting to a phone and a tablet / laptop at the same time so you don't miss a call."
1,"I love them!<br />Great value, terrific sound!<br />I wish I had ordered 2!"
1,"I am in love with these wireless earphones. They were very easy to pair to my iphone 7 plus by using the guide. I love the quality of them ( they're comfortable) the sound( clear and you can hear the bass baby!) , and the features that they have.  I like how when I put them in my ear and press the button they tell you that they are on or off. I also like that when I have a phone call, they call out the phone number that is calling ( without me having to go look at my phone).  I like how they don't take a long time to charge and last a long time. I also like how it turns blue when it is fully charged.  I love how they included 2 usb cables (1 long 1 short) and a car charger and extra ear buds. I highly recommend these. This is a great value for the price.The seller offered great customer service. I liked how they checked on me to see if I am satisfied with my purchase. They also reassured me that If I have any issues with the wireless earphones in the future, that they are covered under a 1 year warranty.  I highly recommend<br /> this seller. These earphones are well worth it."
1,"I am not an expert on headphones or ear buds, but I absolutely love these.  I have big headphones that I was using prior to these.  The quality of the sound of my ear buds is not as good as the headphones, but pretty close, and I  can use them inside or outside.  I can also talk on the phone, which is so nice for hands free in the car or doing other activities."
1,"Shipment came on time, connection (Bluetooth) to music source is effective.  Design is a small problem in that the ear hooks are very flexible relative to the weight of the ear buds.  So while running, if the buds are very snug in my ear canal, they can fall out/jostle about."
1,Great design. Charges fast and holds a charge for a long time. Sound quality is good for passive listening. I like the button functions make it easy to use
1,So far so good.  I like them I just hope they last.
1,Great headphones very clear and easy to use.
1,"I like that these buds were reasonably priced, were easy to pair with my devices and have good sound quality"
1,Extremely satisfied. Register your device they have great customer service.
1,I purchased these for my 22 year old daughter. She loves them. Would recommend to anyone.
1,"These are great headphones, I have had them for a while now and they work very well, the other stuff included is also nice."
1,Awesome Headset!
1,"Worth the price, battery lasts for weeks. Great sound quality."
0,"This is the 2nd time I’ve purchased these. The first pair lasted less than a year & just stopped recharging and the most recent pair has lasted 6 months and the place where they plug in for recharging actually MELTED. The sound quality is great, but they don’t last long enough to be worth the money."
1,Awesome! Sounds great for the price. They do need an adjustable strap for ear sizes. They fall out of your ears because the rubber strap can't be tightened in anyway. I suggest You Grow Your Ears larger so the straps will fit tight.
1,"The sound quality is great. The lowest volume setting is still loud I almost never have to raise it above 3 even when mowing and riding a motorcycle and I'm over 50. I don't get 8 hours run time with them, more like 4. Still more than adequate. Noise cancellation works well also. I can hear a normal spoken voice. They hold secure to my ears through all kinds of activity."
1,Excellent value for the price. Modern look and more than acceptable sound quality. Great for kids who tend to be rough on small tech items.
0,Horrible always came off on a run and we're very cheaply made mine broke after one side stopped putting out sound.
1,Fit is a bit loose on one side and won't bend to the shape of your ear like BEATS. Other than this it has great sound so far.
1,"I am enjoying this  product.  Although at times it has a little interference, usually this is not a problem when I am working out and keep the headphones well charged.  I especially like the phone answering feature that allows me to answer calls without having to get to my phone and then return to my music and workout."
1,"Particularly impressed w/ Teketron customer service.  First pair had malfunctioning volume control.  They mailed me new pair immediately, and provided return label to return the malfunctioning one.  Thanks."
0,I have purchased these 3 times. The first set lasted for a year under extensive use. The next 2 just a few months each. I've moved on to another product.
1,"Tech support is amazing!!  Packaging was amazing.  It came with 2 USB cords!!?!?  nuts.  Came with 3 sizes of ear buds and a car charger!?  This company rocks.  not to mention great sound!!<br /><br />Only one drawback, I wish the necklace was hardened and shorter.  But that is nothign."
1,I purchased a headphones and they stopped working. Contacted senso and they are sending a replacement. Superb customer service!
1,"These headphones sound and perform great during any kind of physical activity and intense workouts.  For the price, I don't believe that they can be beat!  In addition, the customer service is fantastic as I was sent new headphones immediately when I had issues with recharging after a couple of months.  They assured me that this was an isolated problem and supported their product quickly and professionally.  I highly recommend this product and company."
0,I thought this one would be better than the previous ones I purchased but it is basically the same. The quality is substandard and sound quality is nothing to write home about. I gave it to my daughter because I am fed up
1,"The Active Buds Bluetooth headphones from Senso are an incredible value!  They’re inexpensive, easy to link with your electronic device, durable (and water resistant), and deliver great sound quality. If you’re married or have teenagers, you’ll probably want to buy more than one pair!"
1,I've gone through some headphones similar to this via dogs chewing them up or just accidental breakage. These headphones are truly amazing and have a crazy long battery life.
0,I bought two pairs and one of the boxes was opened and had no headphones in them - just a bunch of wires and a charger
1,"Easy to pair, comfortable and they stay in my ears during my workout"
1,Live these headphones.  Price was awesome too!
1,"My main concern in earbuds is how comfortable they are with secondary focus on how well they sound and stay put. These earbuds are very comfortable and the over-ear hook keeps them in place when I run. The sound is good as well. I'm not an audiophile and have no idea how well it sounds at that level, but for my little daily workout, they sound just fine.<br /><br />These earbuds are wireless Bluetooth as well and were fairly easy to pair with my phone. The instructions were simple and easy to follow (which is good for me 😄).<br /><br />Included with the earbuds are a carrying case, multiple ear cushion thingy-s (for various sized ears), 2 charge cords, and a car adapter. One of the charge cords can become either a micro USB (for the earbuds) or a lightning port (for an iPhone) - so if you charge these two devices in the same place in your house, you won't need two different cords. It was an unexpected nice bonus."
1,The headphones are very comfortable and the sound quality is great. I am very happy with my purchase.
1,"The activBuds headphones is very good for the price. The setup was easy and the connection, quality and customer service were all very good.<br /><br />THE FIT - the earbuds fit extremely well and with the additional ear pieces supplied it is easy to find the perfect fit. They also stay on very well during workouts. The only thing to be mindful of is that the wires can stick to your neck when sweaty but I imagine this would be the same problem with all earbuds of this type, also it comes with a clip on piece to adjust the length of the wire which could prevent the wire from touching your neck.<br /><br />THE QUALITY- the volume is quite loud and depending on the ear piece you use you can block out ambient noise completely. The bass was exceptionally good and I was not expecting this for the price. The clarity could be a bit better but for the price it is great.<br /><br />THE RANGE - the range is not quite as far as the Beats but it is more than sufficient for working out with your phone in the same room.<br /><br />THE CUSTOMER SERVICE - as soon as I received my headphones I got an email from one of the owners of Senso checking in to ensure that I was happy with my product and advised that if I had any problems I can contact them directly to make it right. Hopefully I would not have to make this call but it is nice to know that the company is proactive.<br /><br />OVERALL - I think this is a great product for the price and an affordable alternative to the Beats. I would recommend this product."
1,I would buy again and again!
1,Only used once so far but it is everything i was looking for.
1,"Awesome headset! I have used them at work 9 hours a day, every day for 11 1/2 months.<br /><br />After nearly a year, I had an intermittent failure in the wire lead going from the power side (right) to the left bud. 1 call to Tekatron and a replacement was at my door in 2 days.<br />In comparing the 2 headsets side by side, I see they have reinforced the exit point of the leads with a longer flexible outer sheath. This should fix this problem from recurring again."
1,Surprisingly comfortable even with wearing eyeglasses. Great sound and easy to set up and use.
1,Incredible headphones that deliver quality sound and great performance while running or moving around. Silicone hooks are soft yet firm enough to hold headphones on ears despite sudden changes in movement during pregame warmups for a football game.
0,"I've had these headphones for a good semester now, but as I've written in the header, they don't even connect for more than a minute. I've done hard resets on them too but they still won't connect and it just makes me sad and I wish I could get new ones."
1,"Lovedddd my earphones and have been using them at the gym every day! I was bummed that the left earbud started to not work recently and the sound would be in and out depending on how the wire was placed. I contacted the Senso customer service and they were more than helpful and it was great that I got a response email right away! I am still under warranty so without hesitation, they were able to send me replacement ones! I couldn’t be any happier! Exceptional customer service, which is really important in my book :) Thanks Senso team!"
1,"These headphones have good sound and I really like not being tethered to my iPhone when I walk. They easily paired with my phone. Only down side is that, because the weather is cold now, I always wear a close-fitting toboggan hat when I walk, and these earphones stick out, so that it makes my ears very uncomfortable wearing a hat. I have had to go back to my wired headphones for now, but will return to wearing the Sensos when a hat is no longer required."
0,"Really liked them with good sound, effects until yesterday. Headphones stopped connecting with my phone via BT. Thought it was my phone, but it connected the phone with a BT speaker no issues. I used them almost everyday for work. Time find another pair that will make it more than 5 months."
1,"Finally, I have Bluetooth headphones that actually do what I need. I have small ears and I'm  often upside down in various aerial equipment and most ear buds fall out. These stay in and I can control my music from the air without bothering others. Great price too.<br />One small gripe... occasionally I hear the Bluetooth connection sound over my music."
1,Great sound
1,"Good sound , a bit bulky and uncomfortable"
1,Everything arrived as expected in working order and in a timely fashion.
1,Gift for grandson and he was thrilled!
1,"The sound was better than I expected--very good bass, wonderful volume and noise cancellation.  Quick set up.  I haven't used the microphone yet, but I plan on using this for exercising and walking--so haven't needed to test the mic.  Pairs and charges quickly. Comfortable, flexible rubber ear hooks.  Fits my ears nicely."
1,"As expected - lots of presentation, extra usb cable, ear-nuggets, zip-up faux carbon fiber case, etc... sound quality is like as if you bought a high-end speaker, put it on a mattress face-up, covered it with a blanket, and stood 10' away."
1,Feel and sound better than my Powerbeats 2. Perfect highs and bass. They can handle the toughest workout and stay put. Thank you SENSO!
1,These last for Ages on a single charge and have perfect quality. Why buy the expensive brand?
1,Excellent sound.  Great fit. Charging cord options a big plus.
1,"Great product, well worth the money."
1,Excellent
1,Great sound. Great value for the orice
1,Awesome headphone! My third pair :)
1,Work just fine.
1,&#34;Great headphones! They completely block out the sound around me. They just took a while to get my order shipped. :( Worth the wait though!&#34;
1,love the sound quality but the batteries run down to fast
0,"It worked fine, but didn't last even for 6 months. It is not worth spending money to buy this item."
0,"Well let me start out by saying that I have bought some very quality headphones over the past couple of years. These headphones are actually really good for the price, but the headphones that I purchased worked great for about a month. The button on the side of the headphones while listening to music one night stuck in the casing, it would not pop back out. I tried to use a very small sunglasses screw driver to pull it back out, but it was stuck in permanently. I called the insurance first as I paid the extra money for this plan, just in case I broke them as I do on most all of the stuff I buy. The insurance told me that this is a manufacture warranty and that I need to contact them, so I did. I first contacted them on Feb 21st by email. I received an email back on Feb 22nd saying:<br /><br />Senso Support 1 (sensohelp)<br />Feb 22, 5:18 AM PST<br />Hello Eric ,<br /><br />We are really sorry to hear about the issues with the headphones. We appreciate you reaching out to us and giving us this valuable feedback.  We take customer and product feedback very seriously and our goal is to ensure that each customer gets the highest level of quality products.<br /><br />Please send us your Amazon Order ID so we can look into this further.  Rest assured, we will take care of this issue for you to ensure you are fully satisfied.<br /><br />Thank you,<br /><br />Sebastian Lemond<br />Senso Support<br /><br />So, I thought, wow what great customer service. I responded back immediately with my order number and waited, and waited, and waited.  On March 16th, I sent another email stating that I have not heard anything back and can someone please reach out to me to let me know what I am suppose to do with the headphones.  March 19th, today I received an email stating:<br /><br />Hello Eric,<br /><br />We are sorry to hear that your headphones got damaged. Unfortunately, the Senso 1 Year Warranty covers functional defects and not accidental damage. We will not be able to offer you a free replacement but can offer you a 10% discount code that you can use to purchase a replacement.<br /><br />Really??<br />I never said that I damaged the headphones. They never even saw them or asked me what happen to them? I thought that they take customer service very seriously? This is not what I would consider customer service. I sent them a follow up email stating that I did not damage them, so we will see what happens. So, with all that said do not buy these headphones unless you are okay with them breaking after a month, just to go buy another pair."
1,"So far, so good.  I was able to charge and sink to my phone, no problem.  Now to use them in action.  Very impressed with the packaging and all the accompanying products that came with these earphones, like 3 sises of earpieces."
1,"Great quality, nicely packaged, and exactly what you expect."
1,"Superb product.  Excellent sound quality and comfortable to wear.  If you're in the market for wirefless earbuds, look no further."
1,Best headphones ever! Especially for the price. They sync easily and work very well
1,Bought as gifts.  My son and husband are very pleased!
0,This product is terrible. I bought it over a year ago and every 2-3 months it stopped working. They would replace the product for me but after the year was over and the warranty was over they would no longer replace product. TERRIBLE INVESTMENT
0,"Hard to place the headphone around the ear. Could tell what side was the right side or the left side. Not happy, but the package that it came in got thrown away. Going to another headphone."
1,Awesome product.
1,Great for the money. Good sound and the battery lasts a long time.
1,The clarity and ease of use. My husband loves them.
1,they work great and the battery lasts long
1,"Awesome headphones!! Stay in while I'm running, and link to Iphone easily."
1,These were great headphones.  Until one month after the 1 year warranty ran out.
1,The hype is real. These has to be one of the best purchases made on Amazon. Sound quality is on point and all the extras included is definitely worth it. Don't hesitate and miss out on this. Worth every penny. Cheers!
1,Great headphones for this price.
1,Best headphones I have ever owned. I washed them in washing machine was super bummed out thought they were done for good. 24 hours later after they dried out I turned them on and they worked just fine. I was amazed to say the least hence this review.
1,it is a good every day headphones ... little bit hard if you want to keep it in your for a long time and for hi quality you need to insert as deep as you can to you ear...all in all I give this item 4 stars score as it is holding excellent position in you ear at sport activity.... it is less recommended for just cellular inside talks ( this is the 1 star that missing)... as &#34;money for value it is 100% justify......
1,At first I was worried about how flimsy the part over the ear is but these have proven to be great headphones. I intended for use in the gym but have used them to watch Netflix on my iPad while cooking too. nice to be mobile.<br /><br />I also worried that the flat strap would be a little irritation but it has yet to get in my way or bug me - I'm very happy with these!
1,"Decent head gear, but not great. Cord sticks to skin causing unbalance on one side, which pulls ear bud out. Sound ok, need more bass and treble."
1,Gvh
1,"Great headphones. Lots of extras in the package. Good quelity feel, although it's been only a couple days so I may come back to this."
1,Works very well. Second pair bought as a gift. Long lasting.
1,"Ordered these back in October for $50 but didn't open them until January. Sound is good. Connects easy to my phone. After two months, the right side is outputting at about half the volume of the left. They're now $19. Probably worth that. Definitely weren't worth $50."
1,"I was in the market for some wireless headphones and these were on sale for under $40. I was skeptical but I figured I'd give it a shot. The product arrived promptly and to my surprise, they were very neatly packaged to ensure safety during shipping and they came with an array of accessories, such as multiple charging cords and such. They synced with my phone (Droid Turbo 2) flawlessly and sound great. They are NOT professional audiophile quality headphones, so while the sound is clear and pleasant, there wont be throbbing base. However, for workouts, bopping around the house, etc... they are great. The quality of workmanship is very nice  also, they do not feel cheap, nor do any of the accessories or case.<br /><br />Finally, the most important thing, is that they came with a little card in the box that said these have a 1 year warranty and that they hope I enjoy my product. I thought this was a nice addition. Today I received an email from one of the owners of the company, saying the same, and that if there were any issues, email him and he would make it right. That is a stellar level of customer service if you ask me.<br /><br />10/10 would buy again and recommend to friends."
1,"The sound is muddy and not great. I feel like I can barely hear the lyrics because the bass is SO high. That being said, I don’t mind that much because they are gym headphones, and they do sort of block out sound.<br /><br />On the plus side, I really like how well they stay on my ears, it’s hard to find gym headphones that stay in my ears because I have a tragus piercing. The hook is flexible, and it comes with an earplug quality earbud. I didn’t have to adjust my headphones once.<br /><br />I’ll keep them because I just need something to listen to at the gym that stays in, but the sound quality isn’t that great."
0,These we're supposed to be my swimming headphones. They didn't last a lap. They are nit waterproof or good for swimming.
1,I love these headphones. They are cheap and work really well. I've used them for running and listening to music in general. The bluetooth connects quickly and sound quality is pretty good considering the cheaper price point. I'm happy with my purchase.
1,"Works great, Easy to hook up and sound great"
1,"A woman at the gym was wearing some bluetooth Beats headphones, which she said cost somewhere in the neighborhood of $150! I hopped on Amazon and found these at a fraction of the price. I'm super happy with them! The sound is good, they fit well and don't slide around, and the on-ear controls are very handy. I was really pleased that it came with multiple types of chargers. This is a great value! Highly recommended!"
0,"These headphones worked well for me for several months, and hours and hours of running and biking outdoors. I ran outside with these in for about 30 minutes and now they no longer charge or work. I am disappointed that they are advertised as waterproof when they stop working when exposed to rain."
0,"I don't know if I just got a bad set or what, but one ear was louder than the other--I confirmed this by switching the buds to the opposite ear and the sound was opposite.  Also, the sound quality was not very good, and the blue tooth would cut in and out.  Obviously it was a defective pair so I returned them and will look for a better set of headphones--ditching the Bluetooth."
1,"Bought them for $20:<br />Great Value at this price.  It came with a dual lighter USB plug for your car, Iphone charging cable, and a charging cable for the device.  The acessories alone could have cost $20.  The sound quality is above average.  The two earbud sit heavy on your ears but the wrap around ear pieces keep the earbuds stable and in place.  I have used them with up 20ft of distance between the device and earbuds without any issues.<br /><br />Edit:  Earphones batteries died out, but the seller honored their warranty and they where quick in responding.  Buy with confidence!!"
1,Easy to pair and good sound.  Feel good in the ears.
1,Battery life is good. But 3 stars because mine have a very quiet noise when playing quiet audio in a quiet room. Most of the time I dont notice it but i bet it could really annoy somebody
0,The product felt apart right after I tried to charge the second time. Literally the charge ear output crumbled.
1,Really great sound quality. And the Bluetooth is convenient for running.
0,Don’t waste your money.  The range in this things are horrible.  I couldn’t put my phone in my pocket because it would cut off range I had to hold my phone up to my chest to work
1,I actually bought one of these for my boyfriend for valentines day and he loved it so much so i bought myself a pair and an extra pair for him so that he keeps one in his gym bag and one for work. These are great so far so good.
1,These arrived quickly and were for a gift.  He is happy with them.
0,They are comfortable but they constantly cut out. My phone was in my pocket whike raking leaves and it wouldn’t go a minute without losing connection. I guess you get what you pay for.
1,Paired nicely! Fit well! Sound great!
1,Bought these after losing my wireless beats headphones. These are honestly just as good. I was impressed with the packaging and accessories it came with. Sound is great. Very comfortable to wear and doesn’t budge while it’s in your ear. Great buy
1,"I have used these a few times, and so far this has been a good product. They quickly sync to whatever mobile device I have used and were very comfortable through my workouts. Even when running the earbuds stayed in place.  I would recommend this product."
1,The Headphones work great and are comparable to any of the other brands out there.
1,"These are awesome head phones. They sound great, and thr battery life is good. They pair with two devices at the same time.<br /><br />Update: After almost 2 months, I still absolutely love these head phones. I never heard of the brand before but they should be the gold standard for wireless sports head phones.  They sound better then my Bose qc 35 head phones, but with out the noise cancelling. They block out back ground noise like at gym a setting, but I doubt on an airplane.  They are great for hands free phone head set, you can heard well on both ends.<br /><br />Literally the only gripes I have are, it should  warn low battery before they start dying and to connect to two devices without hassle, the other devices must be on  before turning on the head phones.  They started acting flakey, but a factory reset fixed that.<br /><br />Also must more colors would"
1,Will use it for travel mostly.
1,"great in the car, running and light wright"
1,"I needed a pair of workout headphones that would not fall out but felt comfortable over a long period of time. These were a win , the hooks are flexible so you won't feel like it's putting pressure on the back of your ears. The bass is really strong and these headphones are loud!  I had no issues with the mic , people were able to hear me even outside in windy conditions. These are a great powerbeats alternative and won't cost you any limbs."
1,"After almost 6 months these headphones still rock, I have put them through light rain, hot days where sweat runs down my face, used them at work and here there are still functioning, i also have to say that within the same period of time I have bought Two other brand  specifically for work purpose I didn’t get more than 2 months out of each. So guys Senso headphones are very durable and reliable."
1,"So far the product is quite good, and taking into consideration the price i am very happy"
1,"Used these for over 3 years now when doing some workouts or when travelling. They weren't used every day, or even every week in some cases... But they still work now. For the price I paid, I'm happy and the sound isn't bad."
1,Awesome company.  I ordered a pair for myself and after liking them I ordered a pair for my significant other who was deployed overseas. Unfortunately her pair stopped working and I tried a few trouble shooting steps with the company. That did not work so they quickly sent a replacement out. Highly recommend for y'all to try.
0,"I got a fancy pair of wireless earbuds for Christmas that didn’t fit in my ears comfortably.  It prompted the search for “earbuds that fit in small ears,” which is how I found these guys.  For $20, they’re great.  I will say, they fit GREAT on/in my tiny ears.  I took them to the gym, and they work super well while running, lifting, etc.  However, during the course of my 30 minute workout, the music was cutting out really bad on two separate occasions.  Mind you, my phone was in my pocket, so it wasn’t a proximity issue or an accidental button push thing...  I ended up having to pause my music and restart the app.  This never ever happens to me with other Bluetooth headphones, so it leads me to believe there’s something funky with the buds.  But, like I said, for $20 it is what it is."
1,last a while and work great.
0,"The headphones stopped working about 45 days prior to the warranty expiring. I called tech support and they determined the headphones were not working properly and indicated I would be sent a replacement. I received an email from the warranty department saying they would replace my headphones in a few days. 30 days later I have not received my replacement headphones. I called the support line, the support representative said my case was still open and he could not tell me when it would be closed, when I would receive replacement headphone, or provide a way to escalate or call the warranty department. A very disappointing experience."
0,Ok while it lasted. Left ear stopped working after 6 months of use.<br />The ear hooks are a bit too soft for running.
1,Great so far. Sounds great
0,The sound quality isn't bad. It's not what others are raving about but it's decent. I use them in the gym as a spare incase my other headphones batteries die. Too much bass not enough clarity makes them sound muddy.
1,Today I used these in the pool listening to an audio book and they were great.  I was able to leave my iphone on the deck and I never did get out of range for the earphones.  They will be used a lot!
1,Usually I didn’t be surprised by a bluetooth earbud. but This product is awesome to the max!
1,"Wow-- These SENSO earphones are impressive!  They are very user friendly --easy to pair, easy to use.  Great clarity on both audio to me and to voice out to others!  Have been using them constantly since they arrived.<br /><br />I bought a pair of bluetooth headphones for my husband last Christmas on SALE for $150.00+ and these SENSO earphones are totally comparable.  I plan to buy 5 more pairs for my children and their significant others today as a little Halloween surprise.<br /><br />These earphones are not only great quality, but at this price they are a fabulous value.  Best new item for my Christmas gift list..Thank you SENSO!"
1,Great sound and great for the price. I wish the cord was longer because I don't wear 10 hours straight . But a really food value.
0,I don't know how this has such great reviews. Mine don't last 15 mins of play with a full charge. I'm hoping there's a warranty on these because they don't work as stated.. not for me anyway.
1,"I love them , light, smooth , great reception and sound"
1,"I've got to say, I was a huge skeptic about bluetooth earphones. I was always afraid my music would cut out or they wouldn't stay in my ear or the sound quality would be bad or the battery would die. None of these are concerns with these headphones!<br />The distance of connect-ability is pretty high. Compared to my Arctis7 headset for my PC, the range is decent. I can get out of the room and down the hall before the bluetooth disconnects.<br />These earphones came with a memory-foam type of ear bud (along with three sizes of the typical semi-hemispherical rubber/silicon) that are great! I thought I would give them a try as I'm not a major fan of typical earbud styles and I loved them! They conform to the beginning of my ear canal and stay put! No falling out while exercising or anything!<br />Sound quality is decent, bass isn't anything to write home about, but songs sound pretty amazing. They're definitely better than any pair of headphones you'd find at a local market, by ten fold.<br />[b]Battery life is consistent!![/b] I've had these headphones for a few months now and have consistently gotten over 7 hours of use out of them before I would charge them!<br /><br />Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend these headphones if anyone is in the market for bluetooth! Screw paying upwards of $100-200 for &#34;high quallity bluetooth&#34; headphones! THESE ARE LESS THAN $30 AND WILL BLOW YOU AWAY! Seriously, though. Totally worth it."
1,My gransons love them
1,"I've had these ear buds for about 2 1/2 years and they still perform just as good as day 1. The battery lasts through about 4 workouts at 1 1/2 hours each. I just ran them through the wash on accident when washing my gym bag. I let the ear buds dry out overnight, and they didn't skip a beat. These buds are built to last! I will definitely only buy these moving forward!"
1,"Very comfortable, the sound is exceptional and the accessories that come with are perfect!  For this price the value is more than there.  Am going to purchase more as gifts."
1,No longer getting caught up in the wire when exercising and listening to my personal trainers on Aaptiv! Love the ease and quality of Senso and the holder to keep everything in. Received right away!
1,"Great headphones and sound for the price.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Easy to connect, buds stay in your ears when working out."
1,"So far I have really been enjoying these headphones. The sound quality is good, they are very comfortable and I appreciate all of the extras that came with. The carrying case is also quite nice. I have yet to try using these with my PS Vita, but I can confirm they work well with my cell phone."
1,"I mean, I love the fit.  But, I think it's too bassy.  I wish the treble could be adjusted...  I'll try them for a couple more weeks.  My ears aren't that great, so I'm sure these sound awesome for someone without hearing damage. More treble would be nice.  It sounds muffled.<br /><br />A month, or so later.  These buds are AWESOME... I adjust them in my ear to allow for a balance of bass and treble, if that makes any sense :)"
0,"I purchaesed a while ago to replace my old (now broken) Senso ear buds (without the awkward ear loop piece) which I thought were 5 star for sound, battery life, comfort, and range...I could be quite a distance from my phone and still stay connected clearly. These new ones, however, are lacking in all those departments. So uncomfortable, poorer sound quality, no range (I must have my phone on me to stay connected). Not good at all."
1,"Great set of wireless ear buds.  I use these for work and having the Bluetooth connectivity allows me to monitor my calls and listen to my favorite tunes at the same time.  The sale price was very reasonable and so far I am very pleased with the weight of the buds, the quality of the sound and the ease of connectivity.  I also purchased a second pair for a birthday gift and have heard they work great for games."
0,Had issues with connectability to my phone and it stopped taking charge after only 1 year! I would not purchase again 👎🏽
0,Having trouble keeping them in
1,"The ear buds work well. Connect easily. Good sound. Stay in place while running. Not as comfortable as the jaybird, bud not uncomfortable at all. I hope they last. Time will tell."
1,"Forget the beats headphones... Waste of money..... These were so good, I starts exercising when I put them on... Heart was beating out of control... Lol... Sound is excellent, customer service is great.... Definitely worth the investment... And they look great too... Nice case and extras.... I love rhem"
1,I have purchased countless Bluetooth headphones for running. These by far have the best fit and sound quality for me. After I get running I hardly feel them but the musics still playing :) very comfortable
1,The sound quality is good for the price but it keeps losing the connection and is hard to connect to all devices
1,"I love these headphones. The packaging and accessories included are really great. The sound quality and comfort are fantastic. So much better than the far more expensive Jabra headphones. In my experience, Jabra customer support would not even respond to me. Thank you for asking for my feedback!"
1,"Great product, no regret of buying it.."
1,Absolutely fabulous. Sound great and stay in place. This is far better than other headphones I've purchased. I highly recommend them.
0,"Garbage, won't hold a charge.  Tried two full charging cycles and it goes dead and needs a full recharge the moment it's unplugged from the charger."
1,Just got them and maiden voyage was on an airplane.  So far so good.
1,"For the summary: I love everything so far. I've been through Hell trying to find a decent pair of wireless ear buds, and I've finally found them.<br /><br />I was recommended these by a work colleague and friend whose advice I trust. So I decided to give these a shot. I've been burned before many times, so I was very happy when I received these and...<br /><br />...they actually worked! For longer than a week, even!<br /><br />Most of the ear buds I've purchased usually short out in a wire, or are riddled with other problems. For example, poor LED visibility; come on, I need to know if it's charged and it shouldn't take an act of God to show me this very basic information. Or, in one case, the ear buds wouldn't even hold a charge - well, I'm certainly gonna get real far with that setup! It's all supremely frustrating when it happens. I'm happy that I've found something that works!<br /><br />I am very impressed with the quality of the wire connector between the two - it looks and feels heavy-duty. The ear configuration is adjustable, and feels pretty good overall. It was weird to figure out at first, but I'm just stupid and after I figured them out it was easy. Charging time is breezy - I haven't had a chance to fully drain them of power yet but the two times I have charged them it's been quite quick at less than hour or so. I can't really remember the times off the top of my head, but  The LED indicator is actually visible and nice in these as well - the last two pairs I've purchased you could not clearly see the LED indicator. It was frustrating because I had to crane at different viewing angles to actually see if they had held a charge. These are quite the opposite.<br /><br />I was also very pleasantly surprised to receive a magnetic sticker, a magnetized base to hook my phone into in the car, a carrying case, and a wallet card holder along with the ear buds. I don't really need the wallet card holder, but I could see the usefulness of it. The case feels nice and is fairly high quality. It's nice for holding the other sized buds, as well as the charging cord. It has a inner mesh which has a good strength to it. However, I've used it sparingly. That is not for a lack of want and it's very nice - you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />The magnetic phone holder, on the other hand, I needed desperately. I am happy to report that that it's wonderful as well. The magnet is actually pretty strong despite its size, both on the base and the sticker that it attaches to on the phone. I was happy to see that there were two different size adjustments. It's designed to go into an air grill in your vehicle, and while I could see that being a problem (it is blocking airflow in one of the car grills), it's a fantastic trade-off and I love that thing about as much as the ear buds. A+++.<br /><br />Extremely content with my purchase. The designers obviously cared for the product and I'm elated I finally found ear buds that aren't lemons. If I need another pair of ear buds in the future, I know who I am turning to. Thank you!"
1,"when i purchase those, i was expecting just for listening music, but is great that i can answer the phone and talk trough them, the sound quality is not the best, but i think that is good enough, i love my new headphones"
1,Great sound
0,"Deceptive description strikes again. It was claimed that the headphones were worth $200 before the sale price. I picked them up for $20 and thought I was getting a great product at clearance price. However, these headphones are worth only $20 and the description was just a deception. I don't necessarily feel ripped off because I got what I paid for, but these deceptive practices on Amazon need to stop."
0,They don't stay in my ears when running.
1,"These headphones have been great to me. I have worked in harsh outdoor conditions daily in them for months at a time. I have used these to workout and run over the 18 months or so I have had them. They sound great in my opinion. I have dropped them scratched them up and abused them. I used them throughout school heading back and forth from campus whether biking, boarding, walking or running. If I were to lose these or they broke I would absolutely buy them again. Cannot beat them for the price. I have gotten more than my moneys worth on these. The battery seems to last a long time too and hasn't been getting shorter from what I can tell."
1,Best I’ve ever had.  Best sound best fit. I workout everyday and when I work on my farm I have them on.  I’d recommend them to anyone.  They offer the best customer service I’ve ever had.  Thank you
1,"Cool! Really great sound (tossed the plug-in pair I had), paired with my phone immediately, and easy to use. Wondering how I'll know when they need charging, but I bet they'll let me know. One of the few &#34;geek gifts&#34; my husband's given me that I use all the time! (Oh - really comfortable with my glasses on, too.)"
1,"I just got these and have only tried them a couple of times, but so far they are good. I did think I turned them off and came across them on my desk and heard music playing, so I don't know what happened there."
1,So far so good. I really like my headphones. They fit comfortably and they are easy to sync up with my phone.  I am looking forward to using them at the gym! I also like the fact that I don't have to plug them in to my phone or device. Not having to plug headphones in makes life easier.
1,"Sound is great, build seems like good quality.  Bluetooth drops out occasionally."
1,"They stay in my ears when all other Bluetooth headphones fall out. Good sound quality, I can't hear the crossfit gym noise when wearing them."
1,"They are good headphones.  I only have a couple issues.  One is that there is a lot of wind noise.  I got these for running.  Because the body protrudes a bit from my ear, there is a lot of wind noise when I run.  I run a lot.  Also, the volume buttons are counter-intuitive.  The sound buttons are horizontal on top of the body.  They are not on vertical on the side.  In order to turn up the volume, you have to press the back arrow, not the front arrow.  They have been holding their charge for many days too.  I am active daily, so they are getting good use.  These were a great price too.  Finally, I wish the connecting strap wasn't so long.  It gets in the way when doing squats."
1,Great product
1,Very floppy over ear to the point of being useless. Great sound quality though.
1,"Durable, receives well and simple to pair with an iPhone."
1,"Comfortable, long battery,  Sometimes it is difficult to use the small bottons on the earbud. But a non issue because I personally never use that. Sound quality great. Cancellation of noise is damn good too."
1,Delivered very fast. Worked great. They paired easily with my Pixel XL..
1,"These actually stay put even while running, which is incredibly rare for me. Excellent sound and noise cancellation. Cons - takes a bit to pair properly after connection is established. Mic too strong - pics up every little noise and I get complaints from the other end of the line. Carry case too small and rigid to fit all accessories."
0,"I had these for a month before the left earbud stopped working.  I  followed instructions to reset to factory settings.  The sound comes out loud and crisp on the right side.  But the left side is so faint.  When I have the earbuds in, I really only hear it coming out of the right side.  Very disappointed."
1,"The headphones sound fantastic, have great range and battery life."
1,"Great sound, but not waterproof. Died in the pool right away."
1,Awesome wireless headphones. First wireless headphones i ever bought and i love them.
1,"LOVE THEM, GREAT DEAL, BOUGHT FIRST PAIR FOR MY WIFE LIKED THEM SO MUCH BOUGHT SECOND PAIR FOR ME."
1,I can't tell the difference in quality between this item and the BEATS ear buds. Great product for much less money. I will be purchasing more in the near feature for Christmas presents :)
1,"I waited to write a review just to see the longevity of it. The sound...AMAZING. They're not producing quality as I'm used to but they get the job done. Most wireless earbuds aren't truly noise cancelling unless your music is on, which they were. I'm satisfied with having the sound on medium.The buttons are easy to use and function well. The extra features, as the charger (having both an iphone and android output) is WONDERFUL. I already have the car charger so I can't say how I like that but it was a very nice plus. As for the incoming and outgoing calls, not the best. If I try to redial the last person I called, it sometimes calls the wrong person, and the microphone does NOT work, which is my only reason for 4 stars. The battery lasts me a whole workout session and then some (which is about 2 hours) and I love that it tells me when its about to run out of battery at the top of the screen. I would attempt to return em to get the microphone function to work but they weren't the reason why I purchased them. I just wanted comfortable headphones to workout in!<br /><br />Update: it's been an extra two weeks since I first posted and I'm starting to have trouble connecting. My phone will tell me it's connected but through a Spotify or pandora app, it won't play through the earbuds, just outloud. I try to connect and reconnect but seems like it doesn't work. Waited about 20 min and tried again and it worked. So not sure how to best fix this"
1,"Used these for working out, conference calls  and just listening to music. The sound is great and the quality is tops."
1,Loved the product worked better than I expected.
1,"Excellent device! Great price! Pairs nicely with apple devices."""
1,"This is my second pair, I love these for the price. They have good noise cancellation as I use them when mowing the lawn"
1,Value
1,it's meet my expectation.<br />thanks for good merchandise
1,"I wear them at the Gym, where they are really convenient.  I can bounce around all I want and they don't fall off. Nor do I pull the earplugs out of my ears because i've gotten tangled up in a cord."
1,I would give these headphones a better than average rate.  Well made for the price and the sound is better than average. I would buy them again.
0,Its good for hearing music. But anything that includes Iphone calling or Facetime or Faceaudio it goes really quiet. Which is what I mainly bought it for.
1,"My primary use of these Airbuds is for bicycling.  I was initially unhappy with sound momentarily cutting out, until I realized the culprit was the straps on my biking helmet, combined with having my iPhone in a holster on my left side.  Moving the iPhone to the right (the side of all the controls for the Airbuds) solved the problem.  Wind noise, especially with a strong headwind, is still an issue, but overall I'm quite pleased with them."
1,"Hands down the best freaking headphones ever. I could not ask for more. Bass is amazing, mic is clear and just amazing in every way possible.<br />*update*<br />I have had these headphones for 2 months, within this two month range I have used them nearly daily for 2 hours on average. The left earbud stopped working unfortunately, although that may not be because of the actual product. I tried to be gentle with them and take good care of them which I succeeded in but regardless I was rather rough with them and thats normal for me with headphones, I called up the number on the FREE 1 year warranty card and they tried to fix the problem. First time they fixed it for about a day but then it stopped again and I called them up and they said &#34;No problem, we will send you another pair. We apologize for the inconvenience&#34;. Now that just struck me because they first tried to help and then they sent me another pair within a minute, talk about amazing customer service. Side note I went swimming with these on which could have caused them to stop working, yes they are waterproof but I feel like they are more of serious amounts of sweat proof not fully submerged in water. So it may have been a user error, don't go swimming with them on XD But I still do highly recommend these basically power beats 3 headphones."
0,The second day of use the right eraphone stoped working
1,Sound is great!! Easy to setup and use..<br />Charge is fast and last long!!
0,"At first these worked fine 2 months in they were aweful. The connection on these headphones are is sparatic at best. They glitch out, disconnect and reconnect for no reason. Worst purchase I have ever made."
1,Love them! They are amazing! I recommend them to everyone I know!!!<br />I've had them for over a month now and everything is all good.
1,"love these, they are very comfortable. super fast shipping. i recommend"
1,I bought these after watching a review on YouTube.
1,its not good
1,Really like them....Read the #1 review I agree with it.
1,I wanted to try these before i invested in a $200 set. I like these so much i am not even going to try the other ones. Even my wife (who is quite picky) tried them on and asked me to get a set for her. They are easy to use and the battery lasts a while. Easy on the ears too. I would definitely recommend.<br />Wife vacuumed them last night and couldnt wait to order me a new set! On their way already. Thanks
1,Works great and easy to set up!
1,Cuts in an out at times. Sound is great.
1,Whoa! Totally was not expecting these to be as amazing as they are! Hella great buy! Buying some for gifts and an extra ;) great sound and doesn't even need to be turned up loud greats bass.<br /><br />Although the microphone some people say they cannot hear me too well. Which is a bummer cuz I bought these to use for work. I still love the sound quality on my end. Was five stars till I found out the microphone is kind of skimping. Still a better set than any other I have had.
1,I was not interested in buying the over priced Beats products and I am sure Beats are great but I know there are other products that are just as good. The Sensos has proven that to me and I am sure most people will agree when they try these wireless earbuds out.
1,"I am just getting used to them, but so far they are fine.  I am older, 74 in Dec., and I am not very good with modern technology.  Even I was able to pair them and get them working."
0,041919-a couple weeks ago my wife left these on the charger for roughly a week. After she took them off the charger they would not turn back on. She left them alone to see if maybe they need reset or something. She also tried another charger as well. No dice. So now we have a set of ear phones that are worthless and are barely over the 90 day support.<br /><br />011519-I bought these for my wife while she runs and works out. They are great since I have used them once or twice when she is not looking. Only negative is battery life. You have to charge them almost after each use. Of course that means every 4 hours or so I believe.
1,I loved my headphones but stoped working a 8 months latter . I got beats after these and honestly thses are better than beats. I need another pair asap
1,Worked great for about 2 months. Then one day the power button stopped working so they are unusable now despite being fully charged. Really liked them until then. Pretty disappointing.<br /><br />EDIT: My pair seemed to have a defect. The seller sent a new pair and they are working better than ever. Great Headphones
1,"These are really good sound for the price,  they are very light and fit comfortably.  Not noise canceling and are perfect for my use."
0,"I really wanted to love these headphones. They were so cheap, the sound quality was pretty good, and they were so convenient. However, I had too many issues and ultimately had to return them for several reasons.<br /><br />First of all, they were not really noise-cancelling. During my commute, I often could barely hear my music over the sounds of the subway, let alone block out those noises, even if my volume was turned was turned way up.<br /><br />Second and more importantly, the bluetooth connectivity on these headphones sucks. If I was just sitting in place, I had no issues. However, during my commute I'd constantly hear the music cutting out. This would only last about 1 second at a time, but it happened so frequently that eventually I couldn't ignore it. If I turned my head to look to the side, the connection would cut out. If I put my phone in my purse or back pocket, it would cut out. If it was raining outside, it was almost impossible to listen because it would cut out so often. I confirmed that it wasn't an issue with my phone or Spotify, and from reading several of the other reviews it sounds like I'm not the only one who experienced this."
1,I have used the product only once and I must say it was very easy to set up and the volume is very crisp and loud.
1,"I buy a lot of things through Amazon, and consequently am bombarded by requests to review products. I always ignore the requests, including the request that I received from SENSO after ordering a pair of their ActivBuds. My initial experience with the ActivBuds was good as they connected with all of my Bluetooth-capable devices and delivered great sound. Then suddenly they stopped working and refused to pair with any of my devices. I wasn't very happy about that. I emailed SENSO from their website, hoping that they would stand behind their product. I was SO impressed with the Customer Service and prompt action taken by Kim. I received a response to my email the very same day, along with a request for my order ID and assurances that SENSO would be sending me a replacement unit at no cost. I received my replacement unit today, less than two weeks after reporting the problem. My replacement ActivBuds have again connected to all of my Bluetooth-capable devices and the sound is great. I have high hopes that these buds will last, but either way I will remain impressed with SENSO for their exceptional Customer Service."
1,"The sound quality is good. If you are buying them to block out surrounding sounds they do not do that very well, it makes surrounding noise sound like echos in a cave;  I would also point out that they do not advertise that they are noise canceling.<br /><br />The comfort it not great. After extended wearing you can feel the pressure in your ears, jaw, and scalp behind your ear."
1,"I really like these. They give you lots of different cords to plug it in and different ear bud sizes to switch out. They are comfortable to wear for long periods of time and the cord is not long enough to get in the way of you working out. I think one side might fit better than the other, but I could have funny shaped ears!"
1,Awesome. Loud. Fits nicely. Awesome battery life. Great for the gym. Husband loves them!
1,"Very happy with these phones! My son paid $150. for a comparable pair, but these sound and work every bit as good at a fraction of the price."
1,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, these headphones. I wear them to them gym and under a head wrap. I have never had an issue with these at all. The get wet, dry, banged around in the gym bag and work first time every time."
1,Great product at a reasonable price.
1,I was really surprised by how great these headphones sound. I read all the reviews before making my purchase & I am glad I bought these. Very easy to connect to smartphone & the sound is really clear.
1,"I received these earbuds as an early Christmas present, and was very satisfied by the earbuds! First off, the earbuds have a premium feel, with soft-touch rubber on most of the surfaces. The build quality feels very stable and durable, and it looks like this will stand up to heavy use during intense workouts. Sound quality is very good for Bluetooth headphones, and I am very satisfied with how they sound. The controls are very intuitive to use and are located on the right earbud itself. This is much more preferable than having the controls on the wire, as you do not need to fumble trying to find the controls and stop your workout. Overall, they made these headphones as high quality as you could ever want at the price point.<br /><br />In addition, you get a ton of accessories and bonus items that are all also the same high quality, including a protective carrying case, extra eartips, portable charging cable, and wire-ties to keep the wires from bouncing around your head if you are running or jumping around. All of the accessories easily fit inside the carrying case so you can take it all with you. You also get a 2.1A USB car adapter and a dual Lightning/MicroUSB charging cable, both of which are very nice items to have.<br /><br />If you're looking for nice cheap workout headphones that sound great and give you a very high bang-per-buck, look no further!"
1,"I bought my son two sets of Philips wireless earbuds. The first set stopped working after two weeks. The second set kept disconnecting from his phone. I did some research and saw the good reviews of the SENSO headphones so I thought I'd give them a try. He uses them every day and loves them. Great sound, strong signal, never disconnects from his phone. We actually had to buy two sets because the first one was chewed up by the dog, and haven't had a problem with either."
1,"""These are some awesome little bluetooth headphones. I got them for the gym and they stay in place well even when dripping in sweat. The sound is great. The gym where I go can be very noisy and these cancel out the noise so I can hear my music and focus on my workout. If you don't have an extra $100 plus to blow on the ""high end"" ones, you will not be disappointed with this affordable purchase."""
1,Great sounding and fitting earbuds!  Ships with lotsa extras as well. Recommended!
1,"Bought them for my son and he really likes them...No complaints. I would put in the description that they come with a case, that would have been good to know"
1,These headphones are so simple to use. They exceed my expectations. Definitely would recommend to a friend
0,"I received this item months ago, but just had time to get to use it. The first time I took it out of the box, the cord wouldn't plug into the headphones in order to charge them. There is no option to return this product and now I am out 40 dollars, and have no headphones."
0,"Too large for my ears. I bought this design hoping the earbuds wouldn't fall out, but that didn't work. Tried all three different sizes and still no luck. Don't buy if you have small ears!"
0,Though they were initially great headphones to start off with- quality was good and they are comfortable- they just stopped working after 2 months of use. How did this happen?!
1,"***7 years later, and these ear buds still work on a daily basis! Good quality!<br /><br />These work VERY well! I love the audible 'Power On' and 'Connected'. I haven't had much problems with them at all. In fact the other day they let me know I had dropped my phone... they started to lose their connection.. I looked back and sure enough, my phone had fallen out of my pocket! Score!"
1,These headphones are amazing. I like the way the part that wraps around your ear can be adjusted to secure to your ear better. They're very comfortable and easy to connect.
1,Grandpa lived them
1,Bought these as a birthday gift for my wife and she loves them.  She works out at the gym often and I thought they would be good to replace the chorded earphones.  She likes that she can leave her phone upstairs in one spot and can go throughout the entire house without losing the signal. She says that they are light weight and comfortable but she is still trying to get use to the loops over the ear that holds them on.  She said the sound quality is very good.
0,These are terrible. They didn’t even last a month.  Won’t hold a charge.  I’m so disappointed. Never buy these!!!
1,"One of the best investments .. I had a lot of trouble finding right headphones for workout, especially running. When you run for 2 hrs+, you need one is comfortable, that doesn't keep coming off or hurt your ear. My past headsets would start slipping, have to change the ear foam ($6-20) after few months, can't use in rain, etc. All of these are now things of the past..<br />Senso gave bunch of additional things in the package (2 charging cables, 2 slot 2.1A car charger) which is nice and adds value. But the headphones alone is worth the money.<br />Sound if ofcourse is great. I'm not looking to hear audiophile quality music. It works great & battery lasts for several hours. I run 5 hrs a week & charge it once a week."
1,Great product and amazing customer service!
1,These are some great sounding headphones.  They're loud enough to hear while riding my bicycle
1,Excellent quality for the price!
1,Great sound but having  trouble keeping them in my ears. Think I'll just use them in the house otherwise I think I need over the ear headphones
1,"Good battery life, good sound, good price. I've used them and abused them for almost a year now. Thrown around in my gym bag, lots of sweat, bent out of shape several times. For the price, I think they're hard to beat."
1,They sound great and the design keeps them in my ears even during my most sweaty workouts.
1,Great product !
1,These headphones are great for the price and come with a lot of accessories. I purchased these to use with my iPhone and Apple watching while outside doing yard work. The headphones charged up quick and connected to both devices easy. However when I got outside I had a lot of issues. My phone was less than 5 ft away from me and my watch was on my wrist. The headphones kept cutting out unless I stuck the watch right by the headphones. I then disconnected it from my watch and had to carry my phone around in my pocket which kind of defeated the purpose of why I got them. When connected to my phone they worked great and I didn’t lose power while using them for about 6 hours. They just didn’t seem to stay connected to my watch very well.
0,3rd pair. Loved the first pair until they stopped holding a charge after a year. Next pair only lasted a day until it stopped holding a charge. Same thing with the third pair. I'm Done!
1,"great product, great sound so far. easy to connect and use"
1,"These are great. They work well, they're easy to use, the battery lasts plenty long, and they don't fall out when I jog."
1,I just received these today and just finished set up and about one hour of use.  My initial impression is that the quality is very high and one thing I really noticed at first is the lack of feedback from the connecting cord.  I have another set of Bluetooth earbuds and there is a constant thumping each time the cord is bumped.  Setup was easy and the selection of eartips was excellent..  Great product that I would highly recommend.  I hope in the future they will have a completely wireless product. (no connecting wire)
1,I got more than expected.  Excellent sound quality and earbuds fit securely. The storage case was a plus!!<br />Highly recommend this product!
1,"It's only been a couple of weeks, but so far these headphones work like a charm. The instructions for setting them up are easy to follow and while the initial sound quality wasn't all that great, I attribute this more to Spotify's equalizer being all out of whack. A few adjustments and the music sound pretty good, at least to me. It can sometimes take a minute to get them to line up when inserting them into your ear, but once you get it right, they aren't moving very easily at all. I can definitely recommend them."
1,"I liked the headphones, but had to give them to my husband because they were too large for me.  The hook behind the ear is not adjustable and is simply too long.  They seem to fit him fine and hopefully he will enjoy them.  Would not recommend if you smaller features."
1,They work amazingly and fit great in my ear
1,A good device for that price and connect quickly and a combo of mini charge and 3 feet long cord. The only thing I don't like is the cord gets stuck in the hoodie.
1,"I had it for a year and still works fine. Sound is good, and battery lasts enough for my daily workout."
0,"If you have small and sensitive ears, do not purchase these headphones. I'm sure they work fine for ""normal"" ears!!"
1,I like it. Was able to connect to my MacBook once then not again. Connects well to my phone. Haven't tried to see how many hours of talk or play time it gives as yet.
1,Love these!
1,"Took me a minute to get used to, but now that I understand how they work I love them.  I like that my ipod tells me how much battery is left.  They are comfortable, though I wish the part that goes around the ear would be adjustable, so I could get a snugger fit.  The sound is good."
1,Love it . Sticks well in your ears and has very good sound. Buttons are easy to use. Works well in collaboration with Fitbit Ionic. I download my music on there and listen to it with Bluetooth wireless. Only improvement I would say is they could add earplugs that are fitted to your ears for optimal earfit and prevent them from falling out when working out.
1,Liked it so much I bought two!
1,good range<br />good bass<br />great sound<br />good directions<br />easy set up
1,"Little sad about these, but they are low in price, so you get what you pay for. They could be great, the sound is actually pretty great, but one hour into use and the Bluetooth connection is choppy for me (my phone pairs well with other devices) and the around ear fitting is far too large for me and you can’t adjust it. So, if you have smaller ears these will be uncomfortable. Hope you have better luck with the connection!"
1,Great for working out ... excellent sound
1,Lovd them until the left side got a short and quit working. I. Was imediatly given a replacemment set as per my protection plan.
1,Excellent product! I had to reduce the volume while mowing the grass.
1,Bought these for my use at the beach. Wife has $149 Jaybirds...she likes these better. I had a huge problem &#34;pairing&#34; these to iPhone7+ Until I found that my wife had them paired to her iPad😡 Once &#34;corrected&#34; paired easily. Function and sound worth more than price paid...highly recommend
1,Love them they work great.
1,These headphones were too big for me to even wear. I received them and had to give them to my b/f as soon as they got here.
1,"I have had 3 different pairs of bluetooth headphones over the years.  This pair is my favorite.  There is an off/on switch on the right ear bud, I can easily get to the port for charging, super simple to pair (even if I don't have instructions nearby), very very nice hard sided carrying case, an assundry of ear cushions, and two different cords for charging for android/pc/iphone.  Also tells me when the ear buds are charging and when they are fully charged."
1,Excellent sound and comfort
0,Stopped working after a month and looses connection when you are more than 10ft away from your phone.
1,"I really like these... I set them down, walk feet away, and no issues with the sound. Reall good stuff!"
1,"The sound is excellent, these are the most comfortable earphones I've worn, battery holds quite long, well-made quality product with a lovely case and wire accessories.  The only minor shortcoming I can report is that the Bluetooth function is a little weak, i.e., I can't stray too far from my smartphone when I loose contact (max 10-12 feet in a straight line).  That aside, I would purchase these again and would highly recommend."
1,"The best part of these headphones are the ear cushions.  They are similar to concert earplugs that expand to fit your ear.  It truly cancels out any noise that you may be trying to block out or to increase focus.  If you dont like those, they do come with more standard rubber ear pieces to swap out."
1,"These headphones are fantastic. They cancel out the work office noise (phones), when music is on. Nothing play, the noice is muffled and not as loud."
1,Great sound quality.  A definite value.
1,The sensor earbuds sound wonderful full rich sound connects easily to my iPod. It takes some adjustment to fit just right with the 4 different sizes of buds and flexibility of over ear hooks so far works well. Time will tell on the longevity of the rechargable battery.
1,These are great. Exactly what I needed. They stay in place during workouts and the sound is incredible. Battery life is good. Highly recommended.
1,Great sound and long battery life
1,It's been about two weeks & I think it's time for a review. So far I am truly enjoying the sound quality the bass and the feel of these SENSO Bluetooth Headphones. I've never had BEATS but I have had BOSE. Honestly these give you just as great a sound at a truly great price! The only downside so far is sometimes the connection goes in and out but that was after a few hours if listening to music. I haven't had any problems  while talking to someone  on a call  I haven't gotten a chance to workout while using them so I can't give any input on that. Overall I standby my 5 star rating. Thank you INVOTEK & SENSO I'm glad I waited and found such a great product.<br /><br />As I continue to use these I will make further reviews let's see if they make it to six months
0,I really wanted to love these because it took quiet some convincing my husband on getting them. However. The thing that goes around the ear is not adjustable nor does it hold. Very flimsy. And too big to put inside my ear. The sound quality is nice.
1,"So I love the fact that they are wireless, they fit well, and are a good value for the price, the bass appears to distort on certain songs at a low volume, but then works better at a higher volume, they are great for working out, or just relaxing, for the price I am very pleased with the product."
1,"I’m basically using the headphones for workouts mostly. Sometimes at home for music/podcasts if another is out of charge etc.<br /><br />I like the design and style. They are quite secure with the loop but I guess it could be better in that aspect. I mean I’ve to make sure that they are secure, they don’t snap into place. Maybe im expecting too much :).<br /><br />The sound quality is very good. Im completely satisfied in that aspect. No issues with sweat either.<br /><br />One improvement I can suggest is to add magnetism in both buds so one can wear them securely around neck when not in use."
1,Work good.....bought them for my husband
1,"light weight, fits in the ears well. great sound!"
1,These headphones perform as well as the  ones selling for over $150.00. They are comfortable throughout my 2 hour workout at the gym. I dare you to find a better sound for under $200.00. I  have recommended these to my friends.
0,"Not that great they can be loud, but they dont sounds great. Buy something else"
1,its good
1,These headphones are great they sound perfect when exercising and are also very nice to the ear
1,"I could believe sweat-proof, but I was not ready to believe waterproof.  Well, my wife just retrieved my Senso IPX7s from the wash.  That's wash and dry.  And what do you know, they STILL WORK.<br />I have seen reviews slamming the quality of sound, but they are the best sounding buds I have heard.  They cost much more when I got them.  Now they sell for $20.  This is a great value."
0,"These sound very good but kept losing blue tooth signal, cutting out every few minutes. I would love to keep them and tried to make them work to no avail."
0,Nice people at this company but buy the higher priced buds.
1,Good value.
1,"They last exactly 2 years, but at this price, I keel ordering them 😊  Perfect for gym"
1,"I just received these yesterday and used them today. The reason for the 4 stars is because this is based on initial use. The pairing to my phone was easy and the sound was very good when talking on the phone. (I have an iPhone) They are very comfortable and the sound is great when it comes to listening to music, no crackling or too much treble or anything like that. I haven't tried running with them in yet but I'm sure they will do just fine. I like the case that they come with, they won't get squished in a drawer. They also come with a car charger. I think these are great for the money and especially for working out or mowing or anything where a cord is cumbersome. I will increase or decrease stars as I get more use from them."
1,"Coming out of my ear, it would be good to have adjustable ear holder"
0,"Bought on May, 31, 2017 and completely died on July,20,2017. I'm 47 years old and I take real good care of my belongings. I wanted to return but only has a 30 day return window. I'm pissed and disappointed."

1,Perfect!
1,"I received these headphones today and I am very happy with them so far. I have some beats solos which I love but have found them to be hot around my head during the summer months. So I wanted an in ear alternative and I wasn't about to pay the ridiculous price being charged by beats for their in ear option. So I came here to amazon and found these Senso headphones at a great price. I have to say most of the reviews are pretty spot on.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Light weight.<br />- Easy to set up<br />- Tangle free cord<br />- Voice caller id - My wife was calling me and the headset read out here number to me. So you don't even have to look at your phone to see who is calling assuming you actually know your friends and families number by heart.<br />- Great multifunction charging cord that can be used to charge my iphone 6 and the headsets.<br />- Good noise cancellation<br />- Conversations work well in nosey situations. I was shooting basketball in my driveway and the wind was blowing. But my wife could hear me perfectly in fact better than my beats solo.<br />- Charges quickly<br />- The carrying case is nice and compact and great for carrying<br />- Wire tie is a great addition to keep the wires from dangling all over the place<br /><br />Cons<br />- It has a lot of bass which is usually a good thing for me. But the voices or treble sounds washed out. I thought it was just audiophiles being over sensitive but even I noticed it and it was a bit of a let down.<br />- The over the ear hooks are very soft. That's a good and bad thing. You can't adjust the shape which would be nice. But it's not a deal breaker.<br />- Can't figure out a way to initiate siri with this headset. It would be awesome if there was some hard press or other way to get that to work.<br /><br />Overall I am happy with my purchase if they could fix the sound quality so that voices in my music sound match up better with all the bass this produces, it would be damn near perfect. And if they can figure out a way to initiate siri then addressing those two short comings would make this a 5 star product. But for the price it's still worth it. Enjoy!"
1,"The ear buds fit well have have good sound. I have only used them to listen to audio books so far, but I'm very happy with my purchase. ☺"
1,Great sounding and nicely constructed .
1,These are wonderful.  I have tried quite a few and these fit perfectly with grear sound.  Very happy!
1,Just got these a few days ago... Sound is amazing. Really nice base. Light and comfortable. Not sure about the battery life so I bought a second pair. For less than $40 these can't be beat..
1,"I bought this product for my girlfriend's birthday. She enjoyed them but she noticed after 2 months the headphones would randomly shut off while she was working out, despite being fully charged. They are good headphones despite that problem, so be wary."
1,Great fit<br />Good sound quality<br />Great for working out in
1,"Bought these because the headphones I ordered were not good at all, I returned them immediately. I ordered  Senso, As soon as I<br />Started playing music the sound was terrific I especially liked the deep bass. Priced right good product."
0,"This thing fell apart in my pocket with normal use. I contacted them about the warranty, but it doesn't cover 'physical damage,' I'm sorry, the head phones are clearly in good shape except for the plastic backing which fell off. They offered me a 5% discount. No thanks. Don't lie about a warranty if you aren't going to go through with it.<br /><br />I am updating this to say that they did do a warranty replacement after a couple of nasty emails. Still, I am adding stars because of that."
1,Absolutely love these!
1,Bought these for my boyfriend. He seems to like them.
1,I bought them for my friend and she absolutely loves them.
0,"Connection is not very good, uncomfortable fit that digs into ears, sound is not very crisp. These are not the best to use while running/biking. I would expect this quality from earbuds for maybe 10$ but almost 30$ is a bit much for these. Once these break (which they invariably will sooner rather than later) I will not buy them again, and I will probably stay away from the company in the future."
1,"These headphones work great - and when I was having a technical issue, SENSO responded quickly and very helpfully!"
1,"The earphones use a combination of over-the-ear loops and insert-able ear buds.  Though they are not officially noise-canceling, they do keep out a lot of extraneous ambient sound when I use them.  Another feature that I like is that as soon as I power them on, they connect with my phone and are ready to use - no repairing or reconnecting required as with other bluetooth products."
1,Great product for the price and great customer service!
1,Very happy
1,"I've had these for a little over a week so this is an initial review. These are standouts for two reasons. 1) The sound is excellent in clarity, range of tone and volume. 2) These are extremely easy to setup and use. The on-ear controls are tactile and give crisp clicking feedback."
1,The sport senso headphones were by far the most comfortable best sounding headphones I ever had the grip your ears so well and comfortably also the rang is amazing 👍👍
1,I absolutely love these headphones! I listen to TRAP music/ Dubstep/Heavy Metal/Alternative and every song sounds amazing! The bass for the TRAP/Dubstep is phenomenal and the metal and alternative sounds amazing too. My music is comparable in sound with the system in my daughters honda.
1,"Delivers more than I expected: comfortable - stay on while running, well built, reasonably good sound, nice packaging, lots of extras included, great price.<br /><br />Only downside is that they're a little strange-looking while on. My wife says they make me look like Frankenstein. Of course, this keeps my teenage son from borrowing them."
1,Honestly wasn't expecting too much out of these headphones after my beats stopped working. These went over and above. Very light movement if any when running and comfortable. The ear loop is a bit flimsy but doesn't make too much of a difference.
1,"The sound is great, and the price is reasonable, and better then the LG, s that I use and had to replace about every 6 months.<br />The only suggestion I have is the neck part, if there was some way to secure it around the whole neck so when you remove the ear buds they could hang off your neck with our falling to the ground. But other then that great headphones.<br /><br />Thomas Marlowe"
1,GREAT headphones for an exceptional price.
1,"The sound quality is excellent when connected to my IPhone, however can’t connect to my Apple Watch Series 1. I tried a reset as per Customer Service. I’m not sure to hold on or to return."
1,These were for my daughter for Christmas so I am going by how she liked them<br />which is great
1,"General first impressions: - these headphones are well constructed and sound good, but do not look very nice when worn. I have never cared much for the rectangular-block-in-the-ear look. In spite of that they are not too conspicuous, and overall this is a better experience that the old wired buds that I have had in the past.<br /><br />Setup - I never read instructions if I don't have to, and the only trouble I had getting these up and running was identifying the main button cleverly shaped into the logo. There rest should be familiar to someone who has previously used a Bluetooth device. I am very impressed with the connection on these. I, unknowingly, left my phone at my desk and walked away and I didn't hear any loss of sound until I got about 30 feet away.<br /><br />connecting two devices - I was able to connect both my phone and laptop at the same time but it was tricky (again, didn't read instructions). To do this I paired and connected the phone. then I disconnected it and paired it to the laptop, then I turned the headphones off and back on again, it connected itself to both devices. I did experience some loss of sound when trying to run sound on both devices at the same time so you do have to carefully manage each each device it will not play sound from each device simultaneously.<br /><br />Sound - I am no audiophile so take my opinion for what it is but I thing the sound is great.<br /><br />Mic - Used the mic for several calls. It was great while driving and I could be as loud as I wanted but had trouble picking me up in the office when I felt the need to be quieter. I do love the hands free driving.<br /><br />Comfort - This is why I docked a star. extended use leaves my outer ear feeling raw. I find that I need to alternate ears if I want to listen for longer than an hour. On another note I love not having a cord running to my phone that is constantly getting yanked and caught on things.<br /><br />misc - charge time 1-2 hours and use time was 10-12 hours. I thought this was great.<br /><br />Pros: great quality for low price, great Bluetooth connection, sounds good<br /><br />cons: can get uncomfortable over time.<br /><br />Over all I think it is a great price for good headphones."
1,Money well spent...
0,Stopped taking a charge within a couple months.  Bluetooth range was awful.  If my phone was in my pocket it would cut out.  Had to hold the phone to stay connected
0,No good
0,"These are very comfortable but, they lose the connection very quickly on any devices I have paired."
1,Nice headphones. They are great when you can't keep your phone on you. They were quick the charge and made washing the car fun and easy.
1,"Good headphones for price range. I use this primarily for the gym and it has great range and sound. There are some breakups in sound esp when the phone is moving around. But for the most part it's all I need. I prefer to have ambient sounds coming through and this does the job. packaging is a plus with the 2 usb cords, case and earbud sizes<br /><br />Update 6/28/18: Moisture damage from workout. Tried to dry it out with silica packets overnight but short circuited (Smell of burnt electronics and plastic) when charged the next morning. Contacted seller, Tekatron for a replacement since it is only 3 months old."
1,my son loves these! he claims the base and sound are awesome and the best ones I have purchased for his so far
1,Excellent portable headphones. Clear sound and easy to pair. Highly recommended.
1,Fantastic for the price!! Great sound and feel
1,Just received the Senso headphones I purchased and I am enjoying them immensely.  Great product for the price.
1,"I tried two other pair of Bluetooth ear buds and sent them both back.  They both had the worst sound you could imagine.  These senso ear buds have the best sound.  One of the previous pair had zero bass.  Not these, they have incredible levels of bass."
0,It is disconnected from phone all the time
1,"So far this has been an awesome, cheap, better quality than any products I have purchased on any type of headphones. I’ve only had this for a day and the sound is amazing. I didn’t star the battery life yet since I only had it for 4hrs. But I will come back for another review once I start using this more."
1,Great. Great sound and fits and stays on my very small ears!!! Also same for my sons big ears!! Ha Ha
1,I use this product for the gym and can say that i have loved it. pretty good on the sound quality and durability in a busy gym.
1,"I think this product is wonderful. It's sturdy, price is fair and the sound quality is outstanding."
1,"Great sound. Very comfortable, and they stay in place, unlike I-phone earbuds"
1,"Deep and rich sound quality, excellent noise cancelling, durable construction, comfortable even in my very small ear canals due to three sizes of bud covers to choose from. Liked them so much that after six months of use, I purchased a pair for my son and a pair for my husband. After my son damaged his on the first wear I contacted their customer service and they immediately sent out a new pair. 5 Star product, 5 Star customer service."
1,Excellent I have no issues so far the battery last throughout the day while connect to my 2 cell phone the sound is very clear. When it’s around your neck you don’t even notice that you are wearing it at time
1,Item as advertised. Seems to be great quality and value. Paired up easily to my phone and smart watch. Very comfortable. I love the hard case it comes with.
1,"Great sound, easy to use, comfortable to wear while exercising.  Big improvement over my old LG bluetooth headset.  Very happy with my purchase."
1,Very good headphones for the price. My first pair was a Jaybud set that cost about 5x as much. This pair is nearly as good. I tried a couple others and returned them because they have too much bass and the sound was distorted. These sound pretty comparable to my Jaybuds.
1,I bought these to replace my worn out ones that were a different brand that I had for years. The only draw back is me getting used to the button location. I do really like how these respond to a incoming phone call. The charging and charged light is nice also.
1,Great headphones for the price. Wireless makes them easy for running. Very lightweight and comfortable.
1,ok
0,"Senso used to be one of the best inexpensive ways to have good battery life and a killer sound . The last pair I got , the speakers were blown out and the battery life was shot .I had send them back and will never trust their brand again ."
0,Clips that hold buds to ears are too large
0,"I only tried to use these a couple times while biking. Each time the blue tooth kept cutting in and out. I set them aside, figuring they were too much effort, but decided to give them another try. Now the blue tooth simply does not connect. I bought these on Prime day and now just 3 months and a few days later I cannot return and do not have access to support."
1,"I'm not sure why others are as impressed am with this product. It came with much more that headphones. In the box it included a case, charging cables, iPhone and micro USB cable combination, extra sizes of earbuds, and more. For $35, you can't get better quality than this. This is the best purchase I've made in a long time."
1,"These are great. Only 4 starts because once in a while mine drop out (lose connection) and you have to do a hard reset, which is easy and only takes a minute. I like them for the price. Bought my wife a pair. She loves them. They don’t compare to high end headphones, but at this price, that’s not a surprise. Have had them for about 4 months. Wear mine to the gym 3-5 times a week. I also like functionality, when you turn on, the audio cue in headphones tells you they are on, then connected or disconnected."
1,These earbuds are comfortable and easy to use. They are light and fit well.
1,I only got the test them for a couple of minutes my major test will be tomorrow as long as it doesn't rain because I will be cutting my grass. My Quick Test had great sound good base.<br /><br />New add: have been using now on one charge with out charging it again for over 5 hours. Great sound. Love the car charger micro USB and apple in one. Sounds great.<br /><br />Even newer add: the car charger makes are radio stations static. Unlike are other brand we use in the same dodge caliber 08 that I took for my car and was using this one to replace it.
1,"These headphones are great! They have a good battery life, and I enjoy the noise canceling feature. Recently the multifunction button on my headphones stopped working. I contacted Senso and relayed the issue. They quickly honored their warranty and sent me a new pair that arrived in under a week! I highly recommend these headphones."
1,Shockingly good at that price point.  Very good sound quality.
1,"I have used these headphones only a handful of times. At first, they started disconnecting every few seconds. Then, stopped working for no apparent reason. I have contacted manufacturer regarding the 1 year warranty, since it is past the 30 days allotted through Amazon. Still waiting to see if they respond.<br /><br />Update: They responded right away and sent a 2nd pair in two days.  Now enjoying new headphones which are working really well."
1,Works well so far. Though it does have some bluetooth connectivity issues if the phone is in your pocket. Amazing sound though!!
1,Great pair
1,"I love the senso blue tooth so I recently ordered two more, one of them didn't stay charged so I sent it bank and ordered another one, but overall I love the one I've had for over 8 months now"
1,"For the price this are pretty good headphones. I use them mainly at the gym, comes with various size cushions to adapt to your eat"
1,"This is my fourth set of Bluetooth headphones.  I finally found one I like.  Sharp, clear sound.  Comfortable. Connectors included for all needs."
1,My $300 Bose noise canceling headphones broke after three years. Their idea of a replacement was buying the same pair for a &#34;discount&#34; at $189. I started looking around at other options and found these with lots of good reviews and decided why not since they are so affordable. I couldn't be happier with my choice. Pairing them is easy and now I don't have to worry about cords. They sound great and the battery lasts a long time. Now I just have to figure out what to do with my extra $150
1,For some reason it seems to drown my voice out as I am talking on the phone and amplify the background sounds for the person I am talking to. Its like the noise canceling works backwards.
0,Item broke after a short time. Very disappointed.
0,They don't stay in my ears when running.
1,GREAT SOUND AND FOR THE PRIZE YOU CAN'T BEAT IT. BEATS? WHAT BEATS?
0,"Now after a full 24 hour charge it says battery low after about 2 min. Shame, as I did really like these headphones, and they had great reviews. Maybe I just got a bad one?"
1,These headphones are awesome! They sound amazing and stay put when I'm running/working out. I received them as a birthday gift and I'm very happy with them!
0,Too big! I didn't know it was going to be this big. I wanted something a little more comfortable.
1,Works as advertised. I like the old ear hook design better though because these fall out of place a lot. I also wish that there was a way to see the battery on your phone instead of just waiting until that it's less than 10% and tells you it's about to die.
1,"My bro had originally bought me a blue pair last year and I loved them. After a year and four months the left side went out so I bought these. A couple of days over a month they started having problems. Wouldn’t stay connected and the sound quality got bad. Contacted customer support and they sent me a new pair around late August. Now these are having problems holding a charge. They die around two hours after being fully charged. Maybe I just have bad luck with the red ones but I still gotta give them four stars because they so sound great, are comfortable in my ears and their support team does try to help."
1,These are great. I have had several pair and for some reason the the right ear bud would ALWAYS fall out. These are easy to operate and have good sound.
1,I got these over a year ago and they're still going strong. I've purchased more expensive versions that developed shorts or just stopped working within a few months.<br />They're not the most comfortable but the sound quality is equivalent to ~$100  and the battery lasts all day.
1,"Love these headphones! Recently switched after 3 straight pairs of the q800 neckband brand and wow! What a difference. Hated the clunky neckband and tight wires. I forget these are on and i use during high intensity running and lifting. Love the pouch, i hate having to buy extra pieces to ensure product safety. Will buy again and recommend."
0,Horrible sound and doesn’t fit snug as it should be falls out of here very easily I would’ve asked for a refund but I forgot to do so
1,My husband uses these for working out and he’s loves them. They are his second pair!
1,"Works really well, no lag or buffering. Cannot comment on battery life yet."
1,"I loved the price point. I was so pleasantly surprised buy the very good sound quality. I’m a vocalist and an avid listener of music, Jazz, Country, Classical and Pop. So full sound is important to me. I have already recommended them to others in the market. I use them as my hands free device and I’ve not heard any complaints from anyone on the other side of the call. They are also comfortable in my ear. The iPhone ear buds are not. I Have tried other name brands and have returned them all because of poor sound and material quality. Thanks for this product. I would like just a little more bass. I will definitely make you my go to company for ear sound devices."
1,"These are my first Bluetooth earbuds so I really can't compare to other brands, but what I can say is A) They don't fall out like wired earbuds. B) They sound terrific, with some rich bass. C) Battery life is pretty impressive. D) They're reasonably priced. If those are the only factors that really matter to you, then I say go for this product. Someone mentioned excessive wind noise while running. While this initially bothered me, I stopped noticing it after a while. These pair nicely with an Apple Watch. Enjoy!"
1,"I've struggled to find the ideal Bluetooth earphones/buds for exercise. After reading a range of reviews on the Senso I purchased these figuring that they were worth the risk for the price. The good: they fit, are comfortable, and they stay in place. That has not always been a given for me. Their construction and quality of materials is reasonable. Bluetooth connection is solid as long as the paired device is very close. Not surprisingly with distance (&#62; 5 ft) things get a little flaky.  The sound quality is mediocre and this is probably the only drawback, and again, given the price, not surprising.  Compared to cheepo buds, it's quite good but it's too much to hope that it will compare to Bose or Klipsch or any really high quality headphones/buds."
1,"The sound is good, the blue tooth works great, I haven’t worn them enough to commit on the long term use but. For the money there great."
1,"These are great for around the house and casual uses but when I wear them running there's a lot of wind noise. Not good for running, for me. Wind noise is annoying & distracting."
1,Amazing product for the price!  Easy to use and easy to re-charge!
1,Noise canceling quality is excellent.
0,The battery life on these things is terrible! It states &#34;4 hours&#34; of use but nowhere near that! Great design that stays on ears but they battery life makes this a product I wouldn't buy.
0,"TL;DR Just OK, stopped working after a month or so.<br /><br />So when I got these, I was very excited because product reviews were great, it was Amazon’s Choice and all. It came in a nice package with many different things that really made it seemed worth the price. HOWEVER.<br /><br />I bought these Feb. 25, 2018 and it is now April. 17, 2018 and they have stopped working.<br /><br />I only used them for the Gym which was every other day. Within the time it was working, it would occasionally get static and disconnect itself. The volume buttons took a lot more pressure to work than when it first came in. And in the middle of a workout, it just shut itself off and stopped working. No indication of low battery. The red light didn’t turn on while charging so I charged for 30 minutes like the manual said, but it is still broken.<br /><br />Side note, the charger that came with it. One side of the Lightning Cable stopped working shortly after purchasing it.<br /><br />I essentially paid $20+ for a micro usb and half a lightning cable. Very disappointed."
1,Just as good as my beats that broke (ear loop) that can't be replaced - on a $200 pair of earbuds. Highly recommend!<br />Update: case cracked open & lost volume control pad. With a couple quick emails had a new pair in 2 days! Excellent customer service!! After using them for a couple months now - very happy with  them --- 6 STARS!!!
1,"[[ASIN:B01FVIS4TE Bluetooth 4.1 Transmitter and Receiver, Inateck 2-In-1 Wireless Bluetooth Adapter with 3.5mm Stereo Output, for Headphone, Speakers, TV, MP3 / MP4, iPod, iPhone, Tablets and More]]<br />Use these two items together to make any entertainment source with a 3.5 mm earphone jack totally convenient.  Work, chores, and exercise are now a pleasure.  I changed the ear pieces to a memory-foam type for more comfort and less extraneous noise."
0,"sound quality is good,  but they constantly fall our of the ears if you're running.  I've adjusted the  wires, traded out earpieces,  etc.  They're just awkwardly made for running  - heavy centerpiece and flimsy rubber ear support.  They're better in the gym, without jarring movement."
1,Use these for work all the time. They're perfect for jamming out to heavy metal. I'd recommend these to anyone!
1,These headphones rival beats sound quality is great and yes they are water proof at least shower proof!!! Battery life is unbelievable.
1,"They are sweat resistant and stay on my ears through any activity. Come with 3 different sizes of inner ear pieces. The part around your ear is like silicone and super flexible, which I think makes them fit better than being a hard plastic. Connect perfectly every time, long range, never an issue there. I wouldn't call these noise cancelling, but the sound quality is seriously amazing! They can also get super loud, too. I would highly recommend these to anyone with an active lifestyle. Whether you're deadlifting, running, hiking, or anything in between, I would highly recommend!"
1,These headphones were easy to set up with my laptop and my iPhone. I've used them in the house and on walks (with my phone in a jacket pocket) and they are working fine. The tone sounds great and they are lightweight and comfortable.
1,Exceptionally Happy!
1,"I go through wireless earbuds about twice a year.  These were good when they worked.  About 9 months of use and I had to get a replacement under warranty.  Second d set lated a little longer.  A little better longevity then other brands.  However, I still think these should things should last longer."
1,"Absolutely love them and I only had them for a day. They sound great, the instructions were easy to understand and use, plus they fit great. The little extras included just made my day, The cable that converts from a lighting cable to a USB just made my day. They didn't have to do that but they did and I think that's just nifty. I sweat profusely, even in winter and knowing that if somehow this may cause damage, I have the piece of mind of a warranty. For the price and extra effort the company puts in to make their customers happy, I don't know how you could go wrong in trying them."
1,"Superbe, very good sound, stays perfectly in your ears when running or when on my mountain bike. Very well pack with a lot of accessories. A real bargain for that price."
1,sound great for the price
1,"So far so good!  Ordered these about a month ago and decided to give them a try given that I was tired of paying upwards of $150 for bluetooth wireless headphones to use during workouts that continued to fail (yes you JLAB and BEATS) and have the worst customer service and figured why not try SENSO.<br /><br />Only 4 stars at this point, as I am waiting a few more months to see how they hold up as I have read several reviews that indicate the durability isn't there and they have had them fail.....as of 1 month in with daily usage consisting of weight-lifting, running and competitive basketball training...these headphones ROCK!!!!<br /><br />Good sound, they stay very secure in my ears through all aspects of training and the battery life is very impressive.<br /><br />Some have complained about the soft year supports that wrap the ear - I love them...they are comfortable and do block ambient noise well...although not fully which is fine for a set of headphones being used outside.<br /><br />Will check back in within a few months and update the review!"
0,"The ear wires don't have any spring -- you wrap the wire behind your ear every time, and the shape pulls out with every little tug on the wire. The housing on the side with the controls falls open continually, and after a couple of weeks, the connection failed completely so one side still sounds great but the other is dead. I've had these about a month."
1,"Great product & Excellent customer service! Love my ActivBud S-250s and use them all the time. After an IOS update on my phone, my Activbuds wouldn't sync. I emailed customer service and they responded in LESS THAN 2 HOURS with a solution!!  That's really unheard of these days!  Honestly, I wasn't expecting a response for at least 24-hours."
1,"*********Legitimate Purchase...paid full price and non-promotional review********<br /><br />I have a friend who loves his Plantronics bluetooth earbuds which sell on Amazon for $82.00.  We go to the gym together and work out together and I was asking him about how he likes them as I was struggling with my own bluetooth earbuds that kept falling out of my ears or getting caught on my shirt collar.  As soon as I got home I started looking on Amazon for those and was about to purchase when I say these advertised as similar items.  Being less then half the price it was worth taking the few minutes to give them a look.  The style is similar but I pay a lot of attention to quality reviews and these were off the charts with 5 star ratings.  Shopping with Amazon Prime means if I buy something and think it sucks I can easily return for a no hassle money back, so I decided to give it a go.  And I'm very glad I did!  Simply WOW!!!  This is a no brainer purchase.  I HIGHLY recommend giving these a shot before you shell out $80 - $200 for bluetooth buds.  I can promise you won't be disappointed.  Sounds is about as good as you could expect from earbuds.  I've tried no less then 30 sets of earbuds over the past 5+ years and these are undeniably the best sounding for tone, range, and volume I've experienced.  The fit is also extremely comfortable.  The earloops are flexible silicon, not stiff like the rubber wrapped plastic hooks you'd expect, comes with 3 sizes of earbuds to fit your earhole, and a flexible, tangle free flat cable connecting left to right.  The right side unit houses the multi-function button, volume +/- buttons, charging port and LED indicator.  These are are waterproof with soft rubber/silicon closing over charging port.<br /><br />The package comes with the earbuds, a short 12&#34; mini USB cable, a 3' long flat lighting cable that has a dual mini USB and iPhone charging tip, car charger adapter with two ports and LED backlit, and rigid zippered carry case.

1,"I use these headphones to run, mow the yard, and other regular activities. They give a high quality sound and are comfortable in the ear. The headphones stay in my ears during a run so that I am not having to slow down to adjust them! They have a microphone in them to make it super convenient for phone calls while I'm out walking the dog."
1,These were just ok. The sound is phenomenal but I had trouble getting them to stay connected to my Apple Watch Series 1. They would disconnect every 3-4 seconds so I returned them for a different style.
1,I have used the beats2 wireless in the past and broke both of them due to sweat damage. These have far superior sound to the beats wireless and at such a better price. I have zero complaints with these and they are better than I had hoped for
1,"I love these headphones. I've had them since April of last year and have had pretty much no issues with them.<br /><br />Recently, the left side of my headphones has become faulty and when i move the wire in a certain direction the sound cuts out. Thats likely a problem just caused by wear as with most headphones. I contacted Tekatron about the issue and since I still have a week under warranty they graciously sent me a pair of replacement headphones.<br /><br />Honestly I've owned Studio Beats and other headphones here and there but these are the best headphones I've ever owned. Comfortable, good sound. I like bass in my headphones and honestly with these headphones I never really noticed a bass issue. I just recognize that its just right for what I like. Battery life is great. I've been caught in the rain and actually tested out showering with them and had no issue. I didn't just let water fall on them though. Water splashed off in small amounts onto the headphones but they were fine. I'm sure drenching them in water would be a different story.<br /><br />Would definitely recommend these headphones for anyone. Affordable, great quality and a very responsive company. Replied within minutes on a Sunday. That deserves 5 stars on its own, haha."
1,"I've bought a lot of Bluetooth headphones and these have been the best, they are awesome, great sound easy to use the accessory charging cord is a cool idea and works great for me, thanks-tim"
1,"Just received the headphones and they work great. Easy to use, easy and comfortable to wear. Definitely a keeper."
1,Need i even write this?? Just read one of the other 12k reviews.
1,"The headphones are good, I enjoyed it and they are also cheap in quality"
1,Excellent wireless headphone.
1,First wireless headphones and the sound quality is excellent! Highly recommend!
1,"Amazing! I read the positive reviews and ordered. They are just as advertised. They look good and feel very comfortable. The first evening I had them I wore them for several hours without any discomfort. The sound quality is very good as well. For the price of $35.00 or so, I would have to say they are very much worth it.<br /><br />Thank you Senso for making a great well made product that is very affordable."
1,No complaints
1,"Pros: easy to use,easy to connect, good sound quality, comfortable for running/walking, good battery life.<br />Cons: not a great distance for connecting if walking around office or house."
1,I bought these for my daughter for her birthday. She loves them and is happy to be able to do her workouts without hassles.  Nice and light weight!
1,work well with my devices and sounds great
1,"Love them, they work great!"
0,These were bought as a Christmas present. Would you mind NOT spoiling the surprise?
1,"My  husband really likes them - says they are soft, flexible and clear."
1,My son really likes these. Good reception and they lay well on his ears.
1,Great Fit and Great Sound! Love using these while working out!
1,i was looking to purchase the expensive beats headphones..but i came across the Senso headphones which lool very similar.but the price was ALOT cheaper! the quality of these headphones are excellent! wish the wire was a bit longer..but i love these and im glad i saved SO MUCH money! get them .they are MORE than WORTH IT!
1,These are okay.  Takes forever to fit them properly over my ears.  I thought I had normal ears...maybe I don't and that's the problem!  I have to fiddle for ten minutes to get a proper fit.  &#34;Ain't nobody got time for dat&#34;!
1,"It works, stayed in my ear and played music. What else do you need to know about some god damn headphones."
1,Good sound!! Great price !! Exactly what I was looking for!!
1,"I have been using these headphones for a couple of week and I am 100% satisfied. I love that they are very gentle to the ears, they don't fall off like others. The sound is clear and they can block out the noise. I am super satisfied  with this product. I will definitely order again. I am glad I didn't order the expensive ones . I workout 5 days a week and sweat a lot, so these are sweat proof and so far so good."
1,The earbuds are great...for my husband. I personally could not wear them as they made my ears thump and swell. I will be buying headphones. My husband loves them and has no problem.
0,"These headphones fit well and stay on while being active.  However, they have terrible sound quality.  It is muddy, muffled, and awful.  Have to turn the high frequencies way up on the equilizer to compensate.  But then had to fiddle with the equilizer when other output devices are used that actually work right.  Not worth using these."
1,"Cost effective, nice set of headphones. Would order again for certain.<br />Update, my first set was stolen, so I purchased another set, as I continue to enjoy them."
1,I love it. I use it everywhere.
1,"I got these to use for both swimming and water aerobics. Whenever my ears are in the water, the earphones stop working, so they don't really work for swimming. Fine for water aerobics. I'm not brave enough to have my phone on me in a waterproof case, so my phone is on a bench next to the lane I use in the pool. They might work just fine if you have your phone in the water with you. Also the battery life is not great. However, otherwise these function very well and the sound quality is good."
1,"Decent for the price. When I talk on the phone, the other person can hear a lot of background noise."
1,"Great headphones.. Work as great as the really expensive ones.. Music sound is clear and works great for receiving calls in the car.<br /> This is my second pair.. i have my first pairs for a few years and they still work. just wanted a back up pair .. They are fabulous, Sound is great. Use them everyday ."
1,"Love these Headphones.  Second pair I bought.  Had my first pair for almost two years until I left them in a hotel.<br />Sound quality is good. Battery lasts a long time, even after two years (at least on my last pair).  No issues when sweating all over them during a workout.  And they stay on my ears without issues.<br />Would order again and again.  Love them."
1,"很好用，音質不錯，性價比很高！it's easy to using, sounds good, I bought 2sets, one for me and other for my son, we both like"
1,"UPDATE: Buds fit nicely into my ears and stay in place after taking the SENSO customer support advice.<br /><br />As some others have mentioned, the buds simply wouldn't stay in my ear and would just rest outside the ear canal (I tried all 3 different sizes of buds that are included). This basically deprives the sound of all bass and allows for outside sound to get in. I'd never be able to run in these as they would just fall out. The sound is great if I push them into my ear but then they just slide out. Maybe I have strange shaped ears, who knows. They seem to be working out fine for other people. UPS is picking them up tomorrow to be returned."
1,Estoy altamente satisfecho con este audífono me encanta el sonido nítido  es muy cómodo de usar y la duración de la batería cumple con lo prometido. Su  nitidez en el sonido es inigualable
1,"I was able to easily pair these with my iPhone, use the controls, and listen to a boook or music while walking and biking right away. It's easy to take a call while using them, too These are the first earbuds that have fit my ears and comfortably worked for me."
1,Easy to charge..love the case..LOVE THE CLARITY OF AUDIO.. I LOVE THE COLOR RED... The length of the wire was just the right length so was not to be cumbersome.
1,Received and synched 30 seconds out of the box. Amazed at what the headphones come with. Great value!  Registered for warranty in minutes.
0,Unhappy with this product I bought. Headphones worked great when I first received them. Then stopped working after 2 months. Unhappy with amazon allowing this seller to sell products that don’t work. Would not recommend.
1,"I was, at first,  very skeptical about purchasing these headphones.<br />When they arrived and I opened the box up I was pleasantly surprised by a few extras as well! A nifty little charge cable both for Android and iPhone, a cig lighter USB charger for the car and an awesome hard case to store things.  The headphones themselves were of great quality! Not the best sound quality but not bad either.  Just wouldn't recommend to an audiophile. I really love how the product has a slightly velvet like rubber around the earpiece."
1,"These have been great. Super easy to pair, they last a long time between charges (even though i frequently forget to turn them off). Ive had some trouble with 'skipping' while im walking, so i dont know that they would work for exercising, but for my commute and at my desk, they've been great. Good range too, 30ft at least."
1,"Great product, great price, great service!"
1,"loved these. They work, sound incredible and ccx easy to connect"
1,I feel comfortable hearing to music while I travel. I have to test on life of this. But  yes good for the price.
1,"I lost my Bluetooth wireless headphones last week. The pair I lost were considerably more than the Senso Bluetooth headphones so I was not expecting much.  Boy was I surprised, these things sound great.  I received the package in 2 days with no issue and had the headphones connected within minutes.  My only regret is buying the really expensive ones prior to this. These are awesome sounding and fit well. Thanks."
1,Pleasantly surprised! It works great!..Better than my Motorola.
1,Only issue I have is the ear hook is too flexible. Will not stay in place if for some reason the cord gets caught on something and pulls on it. I wear glasses and the ear hooks  have a hard time staying in place because of my glasses. I occasionally have to keep adjusting the hooks to keep it in place because of its flexibility. Everything else is fine that's why I gave it 4 stars.
1,"Finally!  Through trial and error I finally found these headphones.  Very comfortable, they stay in my ear, good seal and great sound.  That little over the ear piece is very soft and is not noticeable in use.  Used for running, elliptical, weights, floor exercise, .....  I use a small gym and leave my phone in the cubbies in the middle of the room so blue tooth distance is at least 30'.  Battery life seems excellent -- I have 8 - 10 hours on the first charge so far.  Bonus in that they come with a case, car charger, two charging cables....  These are the headphones I have been searching for."
1,It stop sometime
1,"These things are amazing for working out. Easy to use, durable, a really great &#34;sleeper&#34; product. Highly recommend."
0,"Just a few months later and these stopped working. Seems to be charging okay - get the blue light, but they won't turn on. Wished I would have spent the additional money and purchased a higher quality name brand."
1,These have awesome sound and work great
1,My second pair. The first ones had speaker problems after about 9 months. They are reasonably priced and so that's not too bad. Reloaded.
1,Love it! Thank you!
1,"LOVED these headphones. The sound quality is excellent, with great sounding base. The only reason I rate them as 4/5 is because the product had the wrong charging cord. The cord that was included with the product was a lightening cord, it should have been a micro USB.<br /><br />I bought a second pair, anxious to see if I get the correct charging cord this time."
1,"Awesome headset, easy to set up and use. Sounds great with great range.GOOD JOB SENSO."
1,listening to music and hands free phone answering for my safety
0,"I wanted to like these so bad. They seemed like such a great deal and I thought they'd be great to wear when I go for a walk.<br /><br />My #1 problem with these headphones is their poor connection with my phone. When connected, I cannot place my phone in my left pocket without the audio starting to cut out. Same if I hold the phone in my left hand. The connection is only stable in my right hand or right pocket. Don't know what that's about--I'm guessing the bluetooth antenna is in the right ear?--but it's incredibly annoying, and I'm seriously thinking about returning them for this reason alone. We're not talking about the phone being 30 feet away--it's literally three feet away, in my other pocket. Very frustrating. The earbuds are fully charged and it's not my phone, which connects to a bluetooth speaker in the kitchen just fine.<br /><br />Also the bass is tuned way, way too high on these out of the box. I *still* haven't gotten it turned back to normal. I hope you like 90% bass, because that's what you're getting.<br /><br />The earbuds do fit comfortably in my ears and get plenty loud enough. The accessories are nice. Pairing setup was easy and they pair instantly when powered on."
1,I actually bought the headphones for myself. I like the style and comfort of them. It was easy to pair with my phone . I also like the sound. I would recommend.
1,would recommend this product
1,"Good headphones, they fit my ears, they sound nice and they work on the shower."
1,"Excellent sound quality, very comfortable, and when one of the earbuds started malfunctioning, customer support was very helpful (and prompt) and when it was found to be a hardware issue (wires breaking internally), shipment of a replacement pair was also prompt at arrival."
1,One of the best products I’ve ever purchased! I’ve had these for years now and they still work like new. Fantastic sound quality and block out all noise
0,"Worked great for 5 weeks and it started cutting out and then it started turning off on it's own.  Would not turn back on unless I placed it to charge.  I knew the battery was charged, but it it did not seem to matter.  I emailed Invotek and they never replied."
1,Great product!
1,"Does the job well, battery keeps for 3-4 30-45 minute workouts. Stays on ears pretty well. Good purchase for the price."
1,"I wanted to write a review and say how happy I am with the headphones especially after I sent through the washer and dryer in my pants pocket and they worked perfect afterward.  They drop out from time to time; however, have been consistent on quality and battery life.<br /><br />Thanks"
1,for the price I wasn't sure how this product would be but they have the best sound pound for pound I would recommend this product to everyone I know
1,"Came fully charged and the sound is great. Just a little bit of wind comes through when you are running.  Spectacular deal though for roughly $30......headphones, short charging cable, long charging cable either a lightning jack and a car adapter, along with a carrying pouch and multiple sized earbud accessories.  I have no idea how they can sell so cheap!"
1,Works well with my iPhone exactly as described. Sound quality is good.
1,"Fantastic buds. Great sounds, super easy to use, stay in ears while exercising. Glad I purchased these buds!!!!!"
1,"Easy to pair.  Great sound.  I use it to connect to my smart TV.  Listening to movies is life like sound as it should be.  Amazing how it simulates my sound bar on the TV.  The price you pay is great compared to the higher priced and not very good earbuds.  This is as good or better than my Sony over the ear head phones and it was one seventh the cost.  Noise canceling feature could be better, but it also works as well as my expensive head phones do.  So far, I am very happy.  Oh yea, very comfortable fit on the ear.  Just make sure you try all the earplugs furnished so it fills right for your own ear.  Will try to update later after a couple months of use."
1,I'll update this if my opinion changes but so far these are great.  I purchased them to replace my damaged Powerbeats2.  I was skeptical at first  but so far I like these far better than the Powerbeats2.  The sound is louder and the ear fit is much better.
1,"Your earbuds are fabulous!!!  I have many many headphones and headsets and these are the best I have ever bought. After trying the first set, I purchased two additional sets for my wife and son.  Everyone should buy them"
1,"Very satisfied with the sound, but my callers say there's a lot of background noise.  So I have to make sure I'm somewhere quiet to be heard well."
1,"It's obvious why there's almost 20,000 reviews for this great product. It works as advertised, great sound, easy to pair and for a price that you can't beat. I've compared the sound quality with my $100 Bose wired earbuds with all different types of music and can't say I noticed that there's a dramatic difference between the two. If this $30 item turns out to be anywhere near as reliable as the $100 Bose then it's a no-brainer decision to purchase this item."
1,"Beautiful headphones, easily set up. They arrived immediately. I'm delighted! The sound is just beautiful, and they stay in my ears effortlessly when I run. I can't say that about many earphones. I was looking online for a company video showing set up, but short of finding that, only reviews, I relied on the instructions. Extremely small print makes it hard to read (for all us baby boomers!), but the directions aren't complicated. The rubberized features and the angle of the earbud that fits into my ear are exactly right. Initially a friend showed me his, and so I looked for Senso on Amazon. The price, as you can see, was what sold me right away. It's the quality that hooked me."
1,"I really enjoy these headphones because they sound and fit great. They work well while running and seem to be durable. I would definitely like to see the charge light be a little larger but besides that there is no real complaint. Plus, the extra charger/ear buds in the package were a nice added bonus."
1,"I just got this thing, and I love it. It also includes many things that aren't even really useful for the earbuds. Im giving this a four star because as how much I love it, it was difficult to open and was confusing upon setting up. Would recommend."
1,These are awesome! Comfortable to wear & stay put. And the sound is excellent! Just ordered a second pair!
0,"Product did not work, I missed the returned date."
1,These have great Sounds! These are so much better than the wire ones that kept splitting. I bought another set for my son and he loves them.
1,"Easy connect, sound is great and the noise cancelling seems to be very good. Nice case to keep them protected as well."
1,"I didn't want to break the bank for a pair of workout earbuds. I didn't want to sacrifice quality either. These did not disappoint. I just received these last week and I've had these with me at all times. Great sound and great fit for running and gym time. Music is loud and clear, and forget complaining about no bass-- these will give you more than you'll want. It can sometimes be overwhelming when listening to deep bass music. Bluetooth headset feature is great as well as I've had no complaints from all my calls and I can hear them very clearly as well. Distance from phone is pretty good as well-- I've tested about 15feet with no issues. I'm not going into too much detail anymore since there are already 20k+, 5-star ratings for these headphones. Buy these- you will be very happy you did!"
0,Defective. One ear didn’t work.
1,Primarily used for workouts.  Workout 3 hours a day.  They sound great and only have to charge after every other workout.  Depending on ear canal size you may have trouble getting them to stay put.  However thet included some foam tips that work great for me.
1,I've bought two pair of these headphones and have recommended them to others. When I had a problem the service was excellent!
1,Great sound. Don't fall out when working out.
1,"After my latest pair of Powerbeats 3 wireless earphones broke, I decided to shop around rather then spend another 150$ for beats. After shopping around, these Senso brand earphones seemed like the perfect replacement. Overall, I am happy with this pair that is 100$ cheaper but some things are lacking.<br />1) I really like earbuds that have the around the ear plastic piece to help secure the earbud into place all day long. Unfortunately, this Senso brand ear piece is very flimsy and cheap, they hardly make a difference. Very disappointed in that feature.<br />2) The actual base is almost identical to the beats, I'v very satisfied with the base and it has more options than the beats - Senso wins hands down here, Im very happy these are better with the pause/forward/rewind features on teh base itself compared to beats only having volume control.<br />3) Overall sound - beats do sound a bit better and bass but not 100$ better. I mainly use these for listening to music in the office and to take calls. They sound really good and I am happy with the quality of the sound and bass.<br />4) Call quality - All calls Ive received and made, everyone says it sounds great, no issues there and is another big deal for me. I'm very happy they sound great.<br /><br />Overall, definitely worth saving the 100$ and using these. If you are worried about these things coming from a higher brand similar to the ones I was using, the cheaper price is worth it, don't let it discourage you or think these are junk because they are quite good for the value."
1,"I waited before reviewing these! I have to say for the price they are really good..I had a really expensive pair that died on me after minimal use, these are comparable."
1,I love it! good quality and the sound good.
1,The sound quality is top notch and the comfort is unreal you don't even know your wearing a loop to secure it in place. Way better than the hard style other brands offer.
1,"One of the best headphones I've had. Excellent sound, super comfortable and the battery lasts much longer than you expect. 100% recommended.<br />Excellent product!!!!"
1,This is my 5th BT headset and the first one to actually stay connected to the phone (HTC 10) almost regardless of how I move. Every other set stutters often enough if I look around while walking that they all sit unused because that's what I bought them for. Also the included memory foam cushions are awesome.
1,I was sceptical but glad I bought them cause  i paid 50 dollars for a pair that last bout 3 hrs and these will and have been running 8+ hrs a day
1,"Sound, clarity and fit are great in general but with the price paid, they are a grand slam. I'd highly recommend them!"
0,Didn't have these long before the inner ear bud completely came off and was hanging on by the wires. Actually would get stuck in my ear. Save your money and buy something else.
0,"Left ear stopped playing after one year of use. To be honest I'm glad to have the excuse to by a new pair. These headphones can't play at low volumes and catch the wind to easily, making an awful air blowing sound in your ears. As for the sound, the bass is way too heavy. Definitely recommend a different pair."
1,Me encantaron
1,"Great wireless headphones. Excellent sound for a reasonable price. The headphones come with an attractive case with several accessories. As a number of other reviews have pointed out, a stiffer earpiece would be an improvement. Would buy again."
1,"I delayed upgrading to my iPhone 7 - partially because I thought I'd also have to buy a pair of $200 Apple Beats wireless headphones and I just didn't think I wanted to own a pair of $200 headphones - it seams excessive (owning a $750 smartphone is hard enough - but that's another story).  But I upgraded anyway hoping something would work out.<br /><br />As a long trail runner I need headphones that clip on my ear, are comfortable, and won't easily snag on trees.  When I saw these SENSO headphone on Amazon - along with the high Amazon review rankings - the design (and the price) looked great so I thought I give it them a try.  These.  Are.  Amazing.  Great sound.  Great battery life.  Great connection with my iphone.  And great call / mic quality.  Why would anyone buy the Apple version at 4 times the price when they could own these?<br /><br />Just ordered my second set - after 1 year of hard use I damaged something and now hear alot of static.  But it was my fault."
1,Very easy to use with a very nice sound.
1,"The sound quality is fine, but they just don’t stay in my ears well."
1,Love these!  So nice to not have wires hanging all over the place.
1,Amazing Headphones
1,"I have a love hate relationship with headphones. I’m a long distance runner and love listening to Audible while running. Headphones don’t fit in my ears, and despite minimal wear and tear, fall apart too fast. I have had these for over half a year. They have been great. I’ve also had business calls while on my runs, and the clarity and ease of use is perfect. THEN, my button got jammed. I don’t know why. It was fine one day and not fine the next. I contacted Senso through their website figuring I’d get some lame response a week later. Instead, they got back to me within the hour with a really well written email asking for my Amazon order number. They confirmed my address and have a new pair on the way to me since it’s under warranty. This has to be one of the best customer service I have ever received. I will be a Senso headphone wearer for life."
1,Love these buds. Bought a second pair for my wife and she loves them too.<br />Comfortable with good sound and the best of all is the price.
1,If they had been magnetic and announced battery life they would be perfect
0,"These Bluetooth headphones were great when I got them in Feb. But two months later (today) and using them the same way I always use them (for running) they just died. I thought first they were just out of charge, but I had just taken them off the charger this morning. I put them on the charger when I got home and no light came on and I tried switching the outlet and nothing worked. I'm outside the return window, but I'm not recommending these headphones because two months lifespan isn't worth the purchase price!"
1,"The ear pieces are not able to mold to the back of your ears; the buds simply stay in place by putting them directly into your ear hole. Sound is good, connection is good, no issues except I wish you could mold them to hold in place behind the ear."
0,"If you stay absolutely still the sound quality could be okay. I specifically bought these headphones for the gym. I can be doing deadlifts, barely moving and there will be annoyingly poor lapses in sound quality. That is when my phone is 5 feet away. If you are 10+ feet away from the device you are connecting to, the sound quality will be absolute trash. AVOID."
1,I love them!! Very satisfied!
1,"So far so good. I haven't had any of the problems with these headphones like I have with ones before- the battery is lasting, it does not cut in and out of connection with my phone, and I haven't had complaints about it not picking up my voice during calls. It fits securely in my ear though the wrap-around rubbery part is a little awkward to get adjusted at first. So far these have met the criteria I was hoping for!"
1,"Purchased these for active wear and they work pretty well.  They come with a pair of foam ear tips which you can compress a little when putting them on--kind of like foam earplugs.  These are nice, but they also have the standard s/m/l rubber ear tips like just about all other earbuds come with if you like those.  The ear clip/loops are OK, they are not at all stiff so you cant really adjust them to hold the earbuds in place; however, they do keep the earbuds from falling all the way out."
1,Great Product!
0,"I JUST bought these and am not very happy with them at all...first, the fit is just terrible..I have small ears and am using the smallest ear pieces they offer and they still just fall out constantly..but the most irritating thing? They do NOT connect well to my iMac! I have to repeatedly go through the connection process every day to make them actually work..once the sound actually flips over to them, they're fine and they'll stay connected all day, but I shouldn't have to make the attempt at connection over and over again!<br /><br />Update: I have discovered a workaround for the connection process..I think there's a glitch in the process of powering on and the auto connect? So I have to let it go through that, and then manually, via my computer, disconnect it and connect.. Then it's fine.. Still overall not satisfied with that, or the ear fit.."
0,Stopped working after about 2 months of use
0,The sound started to short out after like a week
1,"I bought these to replace some uncomfortable sports earbuds.  I wasn't disappointed.  The price was good.  The features are great and they're plenty comfortable.  The cables and car adapter are a great bonus.  I've only had them a week, but so far I'm impressed."
1,Love them for the money
1,Excelent trust 100%
1,"Awesome! Very happy. My old Motorola headphones quit charging after about 8 years. I bought new Motorola headphones and they sucked. The senso headphones sound great out of the box. The bass is there, treble is there. I can't wait to get to the gym and zone out."
1,Just loved these headphones...for a while. I clean pools all day so I love to have my music with me and hear when someone calls. Easy set up and use BUT it has been just over a year (June 2017)  and now I'm having to force it to connect with my phone every time I get to another location. Royal pain in the *** Going to have to look for others I guess :(  7/20/18
1,they work excellent so far
1,"I had originally ordered a pair of Phaiser BHS-730 and at first loved them.  However, after I started running they kept hitting against my body which created a lot of noise.  Additionally, they are heavy.  Long story short, I returned them and purchased these Senso which are half of the weight. They fit perfect, are super light, comfortable, and pair perfect with my G3 Bluetooth watch!  Much better product!!!"
1,Great head set sound is good battery lasts
0,"asked for wireless earphones, gave all other not necessary stuff.<br />Sound- quality is good. Cannot comment on that<br />Ear buds- not cool. Felt like kept some heavy object in my ear.<br />Mic- worst, kept next to ear buds, need to talk in high volume for others to understand over phone.<br />Charging- said 8hrs but is down after 3hrs of use.<br />I will return it back"
1,"Honestly better than my beats, comfortable fit, great product better price."
1,I just received them and only had the opportunity to wear them once. So far so good!
1,Awesome earbuds- stays on your ears and the sound is wonderful. Easy to charge. Great product for a great price. And waterproof too!
1,Incredible product for its price point.  I was impresssed to the point that I went back on amazon to verify what I paid for them. I was expecting that I clicked the wrong ones and got $80-$100 ones
1,"They sound fine and they sync with my Samsung galaxy without any problems, but I have normal adult human ears and they won't stay on my head."
1,Very impressed with sound.  I bought a second pair for my daughter.
1,"I am pleased with these headphones. I will tell you the first set I received I sent back since they would not charge. HOWEVER, the tech support was great, handled the issue right away and I received the second set the next day. I used these with my computer and with my phone.The charge lasted longer than a previous set of headphones I had (from a different manufacturer). and the pairing was simple. Glad I took the chance on a second set."
1,I use these when I workout or mowing the yard. Work perfect for me!
1,"I use the headphones primarily for running and they have served me very well (over 10 months).  A great product.  Also, they stand behind this product.  I had an issue and after I wrote them an email.  It was fully resolved within 48 hours!"
1,The base... just wow. It has a really strong and clear base sound. All other frequencies are good as well but the base is astonishing.
1,"Great product.,,"
1,"I've only used these a couple times so far, but I know I'll like them more and more each day! They're comfortable, sound GREAT, and way worth the price. I read reviews on here for a month trying to decide whether or not to purchase them, but I vote YES because I finally found a pair of quality bluetooth headphones that connect automatically, don't move around when I run, and simply sound great. Buy these like the thousands of others say!"
1,"So far, good. Phone calls are clear on both sides. I purchased a similar pair (hippox) that failed after one charge. If I have any problems, I will contact you. Thanks"
1,"I got these for exercise, but use them around the house as well because they're comfortable and work very well. The wire actually works to keep the ends together whereas the separate headphones they replaced had two tiny parts that fit in your ears and a much larger case to keep them in. Battery life is great. I've run them dry a couple times (it gives you one warning a few minutes before they die) and I can't say it happens easily. They do make a fair amount of wind noise as they stick a fair amount out the sides of your head at the front, see picture. I needed the smallest set of rubber ear inserts for them to work properly, if you aren't getting any bass response try changing those inserts out with the others supplied."
1,Works great but a little too bulky under a helmet.
1,"These are just awesome!  Now if I can just keep crazy Bob the cat from dragging them out of my purse and eating them . . .<br />But seriously, they stay in your ears, great sound, easy to use, can answer calls and hear caller and they can hear you just fine!  I love them!  Buying a second pair just in case!"
1,"Work well.  Very secure.  Unsure of noise cancellation- can't really tell.  Others are right that there is little to no warning that the battery is low, so its on you to keep them charged!  These are my first wireless set, so difficult to compare."
0,"Worked good for 13 months, now they won't hold a charge at all."
0,Wouldn't recommend these if they were free!! Don't waste your money. I use them while mowing the lawn and it like I'm back in high school with a CD player in my pocket cuz it skips so much and beeps then skips again terrible!!!
1,Better product for gym people...its water proof and very good sound quality
0,I purchased these headphones in April after my other headphones quit working.  They worked great for about 2 months until they simple stopped working.  They were not damaged or anything.  I used them for workouts in the gym and for runs.  I cant get them to charge or turn on.  I have tried everything.  Would have given this product a must higher rating if they had lasted longer then a few months.
1,Great Seller! Love these Blue-tooth enabled headphones for my home office (answering calls hands free from my cell) and listening to music while I work out. Lightweight. Great sound quality!
1,Best fit!  Incredible sound!  Easy to use!  No complaints!  Would order more or recommend to anyone!!!
1,"+ Easy to turn on. Easy to pair to IPhone.<br /><br />- For some reason, I do not seem to get them to stay all the way inside the ear. As the headphone moves out the quality of the base suffers. You end up with a lot of treble, little base. I'll give them more time to get use to them."
1,"I bought them for jogging, but now use them for everything. They stay in my ear perfectly, and are very easy to use. Sound quality is very decent, but when the wind is blowing, it seems like they magnify the sound of the wind, forcing me to increase the volume quite a bit."
1,"Work great, fast shipping, and at a great price."
1,They work well and sound great and are very comfortable to wear
1,"I love these! Great sound, easy to use, and they stay put! I can leave my phone in my gym bag and be on the others side of the gym and still get crystal clear sound. Great find and great buy! Money well spent!"
1,These are Awesome! Great deal. I would have paid double if I know all they do and how well they work.
1,"These headphones are amazing, I have some boses noise cancelation , these sound every bit as good, I bought a pair for me and my two children, for the price , you can't beat it."
1,I love it when a person answers the phone and give me an clear and simple answer to correct the issues.
1,"Been using these on my runs for a couple of years now. I have odd-shaped ears that won’t hold in-ear buds, like Apple’s, so I really appreciate the over-the-ear hooks. Never had a problem with them connecting to or maintaining the connection to my phone. The button controls are conveniently located above the right ear. Battery life is good for about three runs before needing to recharge. My only complaint would be, when there is a headwind, there is so much wind noise that gets into my ears. I guess it’s just my weird ears, but the silicone tips don’t seat well enough to block out the wind."
1,I absolutely love my headphones.
0,"These headphones were great, but stopped working. I bought them only about 6 months ago, which is why I give this product two stars."
1,"UPDATE: These do have a really stupid feature where if you double tap the &#34;multipurpose button&#34; then it calls the most recent person you called. This just happened to me today and my headphones butt dialed my best friend 41 times... (if you don't typically put them in your pocket then it shouldn't be a problem) also those 41 calls drained my phone's battery pretty good.<br />OTHER THAN THIS SILLY FEATURE, If you're looking to buy bluetooth earbuds, these are what you want. Perfect low end, perfect mids, perfect highs. It's got a microphone, it's water resistant, they don't fall out of your ears. Amazing, i'm super impressed. However, the buds themselves fit just fine into my ears, and the rubber bits that go around your ears don't come off. That's the only downside for me, but otherwise, 10/10, would buy again."
1,"I couldn't be happier with this purchase. The product works exactly as advertised. The minimalist look and feel is augmented by a powerful set of speakers that features a sterling sound. Set up is quick and easy, and the accessories alone are worth the price of admission.<br />If you're looking for a GREAT set of wireless Bluetooth headphones, buy SENSO."
0,Horrible for running -- the wind (even on a windless day) noise created while running (don't bother trying these on a bike) is unbearable.  Totally drowns out the music.  I've tried different size ear pieces - no affect.  Fine for walking or working out in gym or alike.
0,"Cheap, you get what you pay for unfortunately, they broke after a year."
1,Love these. Fit great and have all around great sound. Wireless is so nics
1,"I was surprised to find that the silicon ear hooks are ONLY made of silicon, very floppy and loose.  I expected them to be useless compared to the older earbuds I had with a wire-like, form-able ear hook, because on those I could pinch the hook to fit my ear and they held nicely.  But, I was also surprised to find that once I put the correct size ear piece on these, they stayed in place very well.  The floppy silicon hook offers just enough stability, I guess, to make it work, and no more pinched ears!  The true test will be after a few miles of running, which I've not done, yet, but initial trials seem to say these will work just fine.  Oh, and sound?  They sound great for the price!"
1,Very clear! Charges fast!
1,I am madly in love with these headphones. I have probably owned more than 20 sets of headphones and these take the cake. Incredible rich intoxicating sound quality and comfort like weightless velvet.
1,"This is my second set of Bluetooth earbuds, and they perform perfectly.  The package (headphones, 2 charger cables, case, adaptor, etc) is top notch.  Great sound quality, and comfortable."
1,Good product but don't fit my ear well. Returning.
1,Love the sound and time on . Great while mowing the lawn.
1,"Headphones work when pairing takes, but more often than not, the headphones say they’re connected, but my watch says they are not."
1,I really like the them they work great!
1,Greetings!  Very pleased with the service. Great product!
0,Died in like 4 months
1,"sound great, but sizes provided where all too big.  need something a little smaller to fit well over a run."
1,Sound is great but the string connecting the two parts is so annoying!  It gets stuck on my sweaty neck or shirt collar while exercising.
0,"too bad they break so easily. 2 pairs and one is dead. The other? Well, it's been over a month and they are still working. We'll see!"
1,"Got these headphones a couple of weeks ago. I was dissappointed because they are not as good as my previous pair. I tried these ones thinking they would fit my ears better. They fit my ears better, but they are not as great. They start to halt everytime I go into another room (very near and sometimes only separated by a door). And the range is not as far as what they stated. My previous ones won't have any such problem. It is a bother to return them but I wish I just ordered my old headphones."
1,Bought this for my wife.  She loves it.  She can do so many things now and can listen to her music or anything.
0,"Even for its low price, this product is not worth the purchase. The sound quality is horrible and the buds will not stay in your ear if you plan on walking, running, or jumping. Please do not waste your time with purchasing and immediately returning this product like I did."
1,Awesome headphones! Didn't expect such good quality for the price. I hope it lasts a long time.<br /><br />Recommend it!
1,I was skeptical at first because I have very small ears and most of these headphones don't fit. Not only do they fit but they stay secure in place with amazing sound quality. I highly recommend
1,"I just got them 2 days ago and so far so good! They are easy to connect and use, they do cancel the outside noise!"
1,"This device is Great and the price was a good one to boot, thanks.  (sure wished it had a longer range though)"
1,"Simply the BEST bluetooth headphones I've ever worn!  Had previously owned a Jabra bluetooth headset, but had a few issues with them and they were NOT very loud. Then bought a set of Dre PowerBeats 3 to replace them, but those damn things would not pair to my Sandisk MP3 player, and neither the Apple geeks or PowerBeats Technical Support could wrap their heads around the issues, so I returned them and bought these. These are incredible! The feel great, they stay in place when I'm moving around, and they rock the sound! Why spend $150 for Dre's when these are less than a third of the price, pairs with everything bluetooth, and has the same or better sound quality as the Dre's? DON'T!"
0,"Loses connection too often, even when the phone is in my pocket or on the seat/table right in front of me.<br />Good battery life though."
1,"When i found out these were the same as the beats (which is over rated crap as far as im concerned), Literally a different molded switch cover, over the identical electronics, same earpieces, cord and everything else for way less than the cost of &#34;look, ive got money cause i wear beats&#34; I had to try them, so i did. And im glad i did too! They do everything that i ask of them. They can (for me) be worn for hours and hours with no discomfort whatsoever. Loud enough, and crystal clear, no matter my activity. I can heartily recommend these to anyone."
1,Good
1,"Fit  is very comfortable for extended links of time. Sound has good clarity in both upper and lower frequencies. These just do the intentended job very well. What I like most about them as it's almost like you are not wearing them at all, you get so used to them !"
0,"I purchased these earbuds a few months ago because I need a new pair of running earbuds. These were the first Bluetooth earbuds I have ever bought and I spent a great deal of time evaluating other products before choosing these ones. However, I must say that I was extremely disappointed with them. The sound quality is good, but there is way too much base in my opinion. In addition to this, the claim that these earbuds have ""noise cancellation"" abilities is completely false. I can have these earbuds in and still hear others around me. This may be attributed to the fact that they are way too big. The only support for these earbuds is a thing that hooks onto your ear, but the hook only comes in one size and is way too big. Because of this, there have been times when I've been running, and they just fall off. One of the only redeeming qualities is that the battery life is excellent. I can use these earbuds for hours without charging them. All in all, you can probably get a better pair of wireless earbuds for the price."
1,"best headphones I've ever had, sound quality is awesome, very comfortable in the ear and love the feature when a call comes in tells u the number, highly recommend this product!"
1,"these seem like nice headphones except they stink for I needed them for. These are easy to use synk to Blue Tooth, sound good, comfortable, look nice and come with nice accessories. BUT - I purchased these to wear while I'm out bike riding and all I can hear is the wind slamming up against the flat leading edge. It's seriously loud and makes listening to them just awful. I'll be returning to my old cheap wired earbuds while biking and maybe use these for listening while indoors with no chance of wind."
1,"First time using them at the gym. (Received on 6/13/19). I got these because like many of other reviewers , my Powerbeats 3 stopped working only after only 8 months. I sweat a lot When I am at the gym so I needed something that would actually be sweatproof and not just claim to be. I must say I like these a lot so far. Pretty similar to the beats but ofc not identical. I did however experience some static interference at the gym ( the kind you encounter when you are too far from your phone and connected to the earphones ) even though my phone was right next to me. I’m hoping it was just a glitch and won’t happen again but we will see. So far for the price point I can’t complain."
1,Pretty good wireless Bluetooth headphones for a very fair price.
1,Really great headphones and they came fast
1,Used while walking good sound even at low setting.
1,These are my first headphones; recommended by a friend. They were easy to set up and the sound is very clear.<br />I'm sure I'll love using them.  I think I'll buy a couple of pairs for gifts!
1,great sound and great price
1,Poor quality. There is a constant low noise and the sound quality is also not good enough.
1,"They are not true noise canceling headphones, but for the price, these things are great. I feel like they look a little clunky or big, but they are pretty comfortable. A full charge lasts forever, and the sound quality is fine for wearing them while running. I've had mine for about 5 months now and they have held up well."
0,Mine worked great for about six months and then it wouldn’t charge. I’d plug it in all night and as soon as I turn it on it tells me the battery is low.  Save yourself the trouble and buy from a reputable brand as you’ll end up having to buy another pair of headphones because these are not made to last.
1,"Rather tinny noise comparative to sets that are just 40 dollars more.  If you're looking for a cheap workout pair, these fit the bill, but if you're looking for sound quality then you might seek elsewhere.  For the price, I'd say grab them as your &#34;I don't care about these&#34; option."
1,"From the fit to the sound, I really enjoy these wireless earbuds. Hear the mids, highs, and lows on music, good range for Bluetooth, comfortable, secure fit, and clear sound both ways on phone."
1,Good quality headphone
1,"These have great sound and do seem to block the noise.  My only issue is, I must have really small ears.  These tend to want to fall out and the the loop for around the ear is WAY too big for my ear.  I wish I could change that out the way I can change the inner ear piece.  I'll try them for a little while long, but I hate to keep struggling with keeping them in my ear."
1,Works great while running. Especially for the price
1,My son loves them & uses them for drum practice too
1,Nothing to dislike!
1,"These are middle of the road head phones. Sounds is ok, not great. Bluetooth connection is very weak and choppy. Phone call quality is good -- about the only thing I was happy about.<br /><br />They were also very bulky, bulkier than I thought.<br /><br />I've tried many headphones and these definitely fall in the middle of the road. I am debating retying them, as they fail to meet my expectations and I'd rather put my money towards a better set."
0,They stopped working within 30 days. I wouldn’t buy them. They aren’t worth the hassle.
0,I had the previous version of these and they lasted almost two years...this version lasted one month.
0,"I read tons of reviews on wireless headsets and settled on these, and I am so disappointed by the selection. When I try to connect these headphones to my phone, there is often a pairing problem and they connect and disconnect quite often. Its frustrating when you are trying to listen to podcast, music, or anything else. I wish I had returned them sooner."
1,Best blue tooth headphone purchase I have made. Lasts a good amount of time. The range from your phone or whatever it's using is realy far. I could be on the opposite side of the house and it was still connected. Fits very comfortably and they provide a lot of size options.
0,They were good until they suddenly stopped working. Expected higher quality. They also didn't play as clear as my Skull Candy ones.
1,"Great sound quality, very easy to set up and go. Nice carrying case, great value"
0,These headphones worked great for a while as long as I wasn't trying to talk on the phone with them. But now after about 9 months all of a sudden they have stopped working. Sounds like a CD player skipping when I try to play music.
1,These are just what I was looking for getting back into a running routine because I would always accidentally catch my wired earbuds and rip them out of my ears. With these I have no problems.
1,"The Senso's provide an interesting set of accessories, and are clearly liked by a wide array of people. But ... are they the best option out there? In my video reviews and written reviews I compare the Senso's to several other pairs of budget Bluetooth headphones including the Zeus Outdoor.<br /><br />Overall I have found them to be suitable pair of headphones of headphones for the average user. Bass is heavy, while clarity (particularly in relation to spoken word), is lacking. Features, including Bluetooth range, isolation, and build are very typical for headphones found in this category. They don't offer the customization and premium feel of the Jaybird X3's (which I have also reviewed), but they do provide a viable option for someone seeking a Powerbeats like option without the associated cost."
1,Love it!!!
1,Awesome sound and fit.  Also has some very cool features. Best headset that I have ever had. Would buy again.
1,These headphones are a great value.  I bought them and tested them out immediately.  The range is about 30 feet and the sound is good.  The battery lasted about 6 hours out of the box and I am just completing my first full charge.  I would recommend these to anyone who doesn't want to spend $200 on &#34;name brand&#34; headphones but still wants active wireless headphones with a mic.
1,Connects to my phone and tablet without a problem. Sound is outstanding. I have used other earbuds that cost four times what I paid for these that don't sound as good. Well pleased with this purchase.
1,"The quality is nice! Appreciated the accessories, made it fit perfectly."
0,"These were great for a year, then they quit working. Not buying them again."
1,"For an inexpensive set of Bluetooth headphones I honestly didn't expect much....but these are awesome!  Easy to use, comfortable, and great sound.  I highly recommend!"
1,"Good sound quality, fit really well and are generally comfortable. Suffer from wind noise when wearing them outside. Neat packaging and accessories."
1,"These headphones work great. The material is smooth and silky to have in ear for a while, They're low profile enough and comfy you can almost sleep with them in! Plus the battery life is more than I expected. So far so good, comes with extra ear pieces of various sizes and a tiny charging cable, mini USB. That's all I would suggest is maybe a little longer cable? they hang off my computer while charging, probably not the best setup but overall very happy and would buy again if I break them"
1,These are great and in my opinion sound just as good as beats for a fraction of the price! Also come with one year warranty and their customer service is top notch!
1,These are as advertised. They provide great sound and stay in place during activity.
1,Excellent item
1,Received the headphones yesterday and I am pleasantly surprised. The build quality and sound are both phenomenal. For the price I would recommend these to anyone who is looking for a cheap alternative to the more expensive options.
1,They were a gift and I know the person who received them uses them quite a bit and no complaints.
1,"Great product, outstanding customer service!!!"
1,Excellent quality
1,"Works perfect straight out of the box! Id give the audio quality a 7/10, but it's really good for wireless. Great quality headphones for the price!"
1,"I like so much, really good"
1,"They actually stay on during workouts including running.  The are light weight and I don't find myself readjusting them very often during my workouts.<br /><br />They come with cable adapters for USB, lightning, different size earbuds, case and car charger with 2 ports ( very nice).<br /><br />2 weeks in and they seems to fine.  They fit snug in your ear and drown out almost all of the external noise.<br /><br />They are easy to put on, comfortable and the sound quality is good for music and  phone calls. The microphone when speaking is good as well.<br /><br />I have 2 other headsets that  cost 2x - 3x (Motorola and Jabra) and these are just as good for less money."
1,"I am a multiple headphones owner, like many.  I received the SENSO BT Headphones quickly (Prime), and a nice follow up email from the folks at SENSO.  The product is packaged nicely, comes with extras, and a nice case.  My ears are smaller, so I appreciate the option of changing the buds, which I did.  The headphones paired quickly and easily with my Samsung GS5.  They work great, and sound great!  Good balance of bass to treble.  I bought the headphones to ride my bike, AND ride my horse, I have not done either yet, however, I do think they'll hold in place.  Thanks SENSO, they promise to be a really nice solution!!"
1,Bought these based on friends recommendation and I'm glad I did. Since receiving them I have used them a lot working in the yard spring cleaning and they did not let me down. Even lets you know when battery needs charged. Just ordered another pair for hubby.
1,Boy these Senso Bluetooth Headphones are nice! Very easy to set up and work great! These folks thought of everything from the nice carry case to all the accessories. I highly recommend them! You won't be sorry!
0,"I dislike these earphones , I got them because i thought they were gonna be better but I felt them loose when working and the wire that goes behind the head was uncomfortable when sweating , I tried using the clip to shorten the length, It made no difference , the sound quality is great but the earphones are not to comfortable . I ended up giving them away . I do not believe that the price was set up to $160 and discounted to $39 they're simply not good enough to have really been at that price."
1,"I LOVE these headphones!  I do have other wireless headsets, but the main one I was using naturally goes around the neck; well after wearing these in the gym for 2 hours then going to work and using them all day long while working that weight on your neck (even though ever so lightly) tends to weigh on me and eventually leading to a headache, neck ache that never really goes away everyday!  So this is a MAJOR PLUS for me because it feels like you don't even have these on!  Sound is great...would definitely recommend these - great price!"
1,"So far so good, only used them twice and seem to be a good buy..time will tell if they will last"
1,These are great wireless ear buds. Easy to sync to Bluetooth. Phone audio is good too. Very comfortable too.
1,I have had a lot of issues with earbuds in the past. They are constantly falling out of my ears and have poor sound quality. The bass has been poor actual reproduction has been poor . I LOVE this ear buds!!!! They stay perfectly in my ear and the sound production is amazing. Fabulous bass and all around sound reproduction. They are extremely comfortable to wear and the buttons are easily reached. I use them while on the treadmill and I can work the volume buttons with no fear. Great product.
1,"This is my first Bluetooth headset.  They are easy to pair with Droid Turbo 2.  The music sound is great quality.  I had a problem getting the phone audio to work, but after rebooting phone it works great. They are very light, and feel comfortable on the ears, even with reading glasses on.  The accessories are great, especially for car charging.  The case is great quality.  There is no wall plug for charging, so have to use a device with USB port.  My laptop charged them within 30 minutes. I haven't had a chance to evaluate the sound during a long run in wet and windy conditions, yet.  Overall, I am very happy with the (indoor) sound quality and value for money."
1,"Great sound great head phones but I use an Apple Watch 3 to run so I don’t have to take my phone. I know Bluetooth works through air not body so if you wear your watch on your right hand you’re golden, if you wear it on your left, it cuts out once your hand goes behind your back. Needs a little strong Bluetooth connection. If you use a phone just keep it open connection to your right ear. Took me a little bit to figure that out. Didn’t work for me so I returned. Good customer service, good price just didn’t work for me."
0,These headphones stopped working 8 months after I purchased them.
1,"I sweat out headphones every 6 months.  I just got these and am hoping for the best, BUT, these sweat proof headphones come with a 1 year warranty!!! They cost less than half as much as the brand I was using, but sound just as good.  I'm ecstatic about my purchase!!!"
1,Omg ... I’ve order these on Friday 10/20 it came Sunday 10/22 when I say these wireless earphones are the TRUTH I TELL YOU NO LIE.. these babies are 5 ✨ stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️The bass is excellent.I’m in the zone with these on .I’m the type of woman that but expensive things . These are only less than 30 bucks compared to $150 I was surprised 😮.But when I read the review on how good these little babies are I said to myself Hummm in thinking 🤔 mode. I was going to purchase the beats little ear plugs because I have the beats wireless headphones. I’m glad I didn’t purchase the beats .BOY IM SOOO HAPPY WITH MY SENSO.. it lasts about a full 8 hrs. Before charging and when I’m talking on the them I just press the side button and talk it’s very clear. Please do purchase these it’s worth it !!’
1,Good quality
0,These sound great but they broke after 2 months.  I barely used them and stored them safely after every use.
1,Stayed in my ears while running!  Very good sound. No issues whatsoever!
1,"decent ptoduct, good for the price. great range, sound quality is ok. a little too much bass, if there is wind you really hear it with these"
1,Love this! It.Simply.Works!
0,"Great earbuds, good sound... but.... In 2-3 months it has stopped to work without reason and nobody couldn't fix it. My heart is broken 💔💔💔"
1,Second pair purchased.  This time for a friend.  Can't say enough about how good they are.
1,I am repeat Customer. These are very good headphones at a great price. Paired with iphone without a hitch. Sound quality is excellent. I am happy with the purchase.
1,"These headphones were exactly as promised and the price was ideal. Very easy to pair with my phone and use. Registering my warranty was probably the easiest I've ever experienced. Hope I don't have to use that, but if their customer service is as easy as their website, don't have any expectation of difficulty."
1,"Used them for first time today, AWESOME!!"
0,"Only worked temporarily. I workout alot and I was expecting these to work for at least a year, but they didn't. One of the ears lost sound very early after I bought the.."
1,"After two weeks, these seem to be a good deal for the price I paid (bought them on sale). The case they come with is just a little too small I think which has lead to the headphones turning on by themselves a few times. Now that I'm aware of the problem, I haven't had any repeats. I have my doubts that these could take much abuse, but for my purposes they seem to have worked pretty darn well."
1,"Really enjoying these earphones. Comes with foam tips which are really nice and help against the ear fatigue pain that other earbuds have. Great bluetooth connection, really easy to use and pretty great sound quality. Very satisfied so far!"
1,"I have to admit I was very surprised by these. The goal was to find a cheap, workable set of wireless earbuds for when I'm working in the garage. I was not looking for the best sound, the best features, just cheap and plays from my phone (Note 5). I searched through reviews and landed on these and they had a lot of reviews and weren't expensive, so they went into the cart on the &#34;whatever go for it&#34; idea. They came in a very nice box with a case, different ear-bud fittings, a charging cable, a car adapter, and decent instructions (not great, but good enough to get going). So far, they've been awesome. They run for hours (at least 5-6, I'm not usually wearing them for longer and I put them on the charger each time I'm done so I don't know if they last for longer). The sound is good. They aren't top-notch headphones so don't go in expecting mind-blowing sound, but they work for workouts and labor and such. Durable? Well, I've certainly put the pair I have through hell, and they still work, still function fully, every time. I've dropped them repeatedly, stepped on them, hit them with things, sprayed all kinds of chemicals on them, sweat sweat sweat, had the cable get caught on tools for (short) hits, etc, and they're still on my workbench. I've only used them for calls a half-dozen times or so, but I didn't get any complaints from the people I was talking to and they sounded fine.<br /><br />Cons? Well, when they DO run out of juice, they let you know with repeated voice-warnings like every 60 seconds, which can suck when you're in a tight spot and can't get them off or pause them right away. They're not always intuitive to orient correctly (left from right) even though the buttons are only on the right. Also, because the cable is flat, if you put the cable behind your neck and you sweat, it can grab and yank on them when you move your head around. Depending on what I'm doing I usually have the cable in front so that doesn't happen.<br /><br />Only con I really don't like (and the main reason for 4 stars) is whenever you do something like use one of the buttons to adjust the volume or change the track, it acknowledges with a loud tonal beep. It's not like too-loud but it can get annoying, especially if you're jumping through song a lot.<br /><br />So all in all I'm very happy with my purchase and may even grab a second pair just to have."
1,"Paired these up with my iPhone 6s and iPad Air 2, with no trouble.  The fit was perfect and they feel secure.  I am traveling to a very wet region and the IPX7 will come in handy.  The volume can go considerably higher than my Plantronics headset which I like because I'll be able to hear my media on the plane where noise is always an issue with me.  I tried a couple of phone calls and the clarity was good in both directions.  Another clear advantage for me is that I won't have to lug my large headset with me.  The buds come with a really nice compact zipper eggshell case so I can slip them in my pants, or jacket pockets.  It came with 3 different sized ear cups (S,M, and L).  These &#34;eartips&#34; are soft and comfortable.  They come with a dual USB cigarette lighter adapter and cables.  I saw where somebody had complained that no wall charger was included.  Really?  If I knew who to send them to, I've got a drawer full of micro-USB chargers that I'd be glad to turn loose of.  Whether, or not, these are super HiFi is not a question I could not answer, being in my 60s and an old Rock & Roller.  The cable is tangle free, as advertised.  I don't jog, or play running sports so I can't attest to how they ride (and I don't intend to wear them when I swim...).<br />I highly recommend these and certainly would to a friend."
1,"what a great product, I bought my second pair as a gift. I use mine at the gem and jogging, they work great and comfortable too."
1,Excellent sound with zero outside noise. For me they have a nice balance of sound and just enough bass for music. Crystal clear sound when listening to audiobooks. Connecting is super easy and I love that it comes with different size ear pods so you can fit them to you. I'll be purchasing a second SENSO so I'll always have one charged and ready. Great find!
1,"""I'm enjoying my purchase. Thank you"""
1,"EXELENT PRODUCT, AND SERVICE VERY FAST DELIVERY (GREAT)"
1,They work and they don't fall off my ears when I climb or trail run
1,Received the item right on time and the earbuds are awesome sounding! I am very happy with my purchase!
1,The first one had a problem and I contacted the manufacturer. They sent me replacement  earbuds and they are now working. Very good customer service
1,"Totally no problems in 1 year. Awesome buy for this price. Much better than my previous headphones, has better bass and a lot of additional stuff."
1,Good for listening to music but not good to use for phone calls.
0,"These headphones are advertised as pairing with multiple devices. They don't. Once you have paired one device, you cannot pair a second. I've tried many times. If your happy with that limit, then the sound is good and the value reasonable."
0,"For headphones at this price, the last thing I would expect to have is the buzzing noise in the background. No matter how many fancy functions they have, such as water proof, noise cancellation, sound quality and their comfort fit, that continuous, loud buzzing in the left earbud kills them all. I can't even bear wearing them for 10 seconds.<br /><br />Before writing this review, I tried charging them to full battery and restoring to factory setting, none of the methods solved the problem. So I have to return them, very disappointed."
1,The hard plastic shell is very uncomfortable.
1,"This has a high quality sound, but doesn't seem to last very long.  This is my second pair,  this pair lasted from june till now.  Left side has totally gone out.  Previous pair the wire over the ear broke off.  Called customer service and they sent me a new pair.  Will follow up when they arrive."
1,These are awesome ! great sound  comfy  stay put during workout  high volume level  easy to use and cheap  highly recommend 5 stars
1,Use it around the house from the time I get home until I go to bed.
1,I love everything about them
0,"I bought these headphones almost a year ago. They are WAAAAY TOO LOUD if you have an iPhone.  On the lowest volume settings the sound is as if it were almost halfway up to the max.  I guess thats fine during the day, but if you like to watch a little youtube while you fall asleep at night, FORGET IT.<br /><br />After a year the Battery wouldn't hold a charge so i emailed customer service.  At first they were helpful, providing me with a few tricks to try to reset it.  The promised me if it didnt work they would replace it since it died just be fore the warranty expired.  BUT THEY DID NOT HONOR THAT PROMISE.  They told me I was out of warranty and give me a MEASLY 5% coupon to buy a new pair from them - YEAH RIGHT!!!  Let me buy ANOTHER piece of garbage.  i pointed out in an email how they went back on their promises and got no reply.  2 more emails after that and STILL NO REPLY.<br /><br />Thanks for nothing SENSO - you are the WORST!<br /><br />DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!"
1,"Great sound, when running the ear cover keeps coming loose."
1,Great ear bud for the price not much more you could ask for
0,"These are alright not blown away by them. Quality is meh, only ear buds that dont hurt after a short period are the memory foam ones, but they fall off very easily and I lost them quickly."
1,"Absolutely amazing product, great headset and comes with several other products too. I'm impressed, I will definitely be buying from them again. Thank you."
1,These headphones are really great and durable. The quality of the bass through these pieces are great given their little size. Most earphones cannot produce such good quality.
1,"Quick delivery. Great quality, great sound. Perfect for small ears. Didn't hurt after extended use like others I've tried."
0,Unable to pair with Bluetooth less than two months after purchase.
1,Great sound and fit. Range and connectivity could be a little better but works fine. One ear died after 7 months and the manufacturer replaced them same day.
1,"I’m giving them 5 stars because they’re definitely worth their $30 price. The sound quality is not as great as other headphones I’ve had but honestly, past a certain point I don’t really notice. They do feel a bit cheaply made as far as how light they are and the plastic materials used but it doesn’t bother me. The only thing that does bother me is that the hooks are a little too big for my ears so when I run with them I feel like they’re going to fall out. But I ran 8 1/2 miles with them today and they didn’t fall out. They came with a bunch of little accessories like a little case, a car adapter, and even an iPhone charger(?). Maybe in the future I’ll invest in a more expensive pair of headphones but I feel like these will meet my needs for the foreseeable future"
1,I am very happy with these headphones. They sound good and the price was excellent. I highly recommend them.
1,"Great price, works fine haven’t had a problem, sounds fine!"
1,Great product...amazing quality and sound.
1,"Great headphones.  Last all day, great sound, fantastic price.  I just bought three.  Also, the company followed up and offered tech support."
1,I’ve purchased 3 pairs of the Senso headphones. They are comparable to the more expensive brand headphones. They all seem to last for about 1 year (I use them 6 times a week at the gym and when mowing my grass so combined use of about 10 hours a week). If something happens within the first year you just have to call them and they will send you a new one (I have had that happen twice). Before the Senso headphones I had several pairs of Beats. While sound quality may be slightly better it’s not enough to for the price difference. The beats only lasted me 1 year as well and they died as well. I would recommend to everyone (and have) to get these headphones. So much cheaper and similar quality as the Beats.
1,"I've had a number of bluetooth headphones and was never fully satisfied. Some were uncomfortable. Others had short/poor battery life. And still others had a 1-3 second delay in voice transmission when trying to watch TV without disturbing others in the house. The SENSO headphones have, so far, been wonderful,,,comfortable, long-life, good charge time, great sound quality, no sound delay and, overall, a really good value,"
1,"for what i need them for ,i have no complains..."
1,"No issues, these work great for wear while exercising. I've only had them a little over a week but I wear them everyday at the gym and I whole running."
0,Great product for the price....while it works.  Very quickly the battery degraded to the point of being unable to hold a charge.
1,"These headphones are amazing! If you are looking for a great pair of bluetooth headphones to listen to music with look no further. As far as talking on the phone, these are terrible. No one can hear you at all. I'm assuming because the mic is poorly place on the inner part of the headphone. So if you are looking for a good quality bluetooth to using the telephone this is not for you. I mainly use these while working out or at work and the sound quality is amazing. The BASS is really really good, I was very surprised at how well these sounded. I would have given these 5 stars, but because of the poor microphone quality I'm giving it a 4. I personally did not mind, but whenever I did want to use the bluetooth to talk it was just super annoying because I would constantly have to scream at the person on the other end or just turn the bluetooh off all together and talk using the phone."
1,"set up was easy, sound is good.... 4 stars only because I need to find out how the batteries hold up over time.  I have high hopes!"
1,"Not only is this a solid product (I've gone a full 16 hours once with it on, and about 3 hours of uptime with music and calls, all good quality sound), the customer service from senso is phenomenal. They are very willing to help, troubleshoot, and send replacement headphones if necessary if you're still under their 12-month warranty. I would 100% recommend this to friends, and I have!"
0,You get what you pay for. I did not want to spend a ton of cash so I opted for these. The headphones say connected but do not play music. Takes a few power on/off to get them to work and then it is static city until you tap them gently. The sound is mediocre and could use more volume as I can barely hear them over a spin trimmer for example. Again...I opted to go cheap so it is what it is.
1,"I purchased these in February 2017. This week (May 2020) they finally started dying after only one run, I’m assuming that’s because the battery is just worn out.  I’m going to buy another pair, they lasted over 3 years so I count that as a huge win! Highly recommend these - good base, comfortable, and I never have to worry about them falling out."
1,Great head phones for the price. Works as they should and charge lasts for a long time.  I can't say exactly how long the battery lasts but I use them several times for a couple hours before I charge them.  sound is pretty impressive for the price.  They do not have bass like beats but are still full sounding.  Definitely recommend for workout headphones or a cheap alternative to more expensive ones.
1,So far so good!! Battery lasts a decent amount of time. I use them on long flights.
0,I bought them and there is no bass at all. Sounds like tin. If you press them deep into your ear canal they sound good but that's painful and likely not how they are supposed to be used. I don't know why these are best sellers.
1,These headphones work just as described and they have all kinds of extra accessories that make the purchase absolutely worthwhile.  I would definitely purchase again!
1,Sound is incredible for the price paid.  Have a little trouble keeping them in my ears when I move my head side to side because of the connecting wire that hangs in the back.  Not a big enough deal to impact me buying again.
1,They’re ok.
0,"UPDATE#3: Replaced pair having major connectivity issues (cutting in an out of sound with phone 1ft distance) and customer service is unresponsive. I bought another kind of the same headphones and those have stopped working as well, both in less than a year. With the amount of money I spent on these different pairs I could have put it towards better headphones which I'll have to buy anyway.<br /><br />UPDATE#2:<br />registered the product on the Senso website and contacted them regarding the issue and the 1-year warranty. They were very quick to respond and asked for pictures of the damage, and info. they sent a new pair in a manila envelope with no headphone packaging. a bit odd to package it, but so far they work well. We'll see how long these last...<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />9 Months after I purchased these headphones, they broke. The section connecting the earpiece to the rest of the ear set broke. Now I have to push them back together before using. After a few uses it comes out again and I have to push it back in again.<br /><br />OLD REVIEW:<br /><br />Overall this brand has lost quality over time.<br /><br />SHORT REVIEW:<br />-Bluetooth connection spotty<br />-Adjustable over earpiece is a mess<br />-Microphone overall terrible, and unusable if any noise is present<br />-Sound quality and battery life is decent<br /><br />MORE DETAILED REVIEW:<br /> I had a pair that lasted 3 years, set in place over the earpiece, and good Bluetooth connection (sometimes I would leave the room and return with the connection still intact). The microphone was not great so I would use it mainly inside, but the overall sound quality was decent enough that it made the headphones decent to use. One day one ear stopped working, so I decided to get a new pair.<br /><br />Bought this pair and have had them for 8 months now. When I got them I immediately noticed 'adjustable' over earpiece was a mess, I have to adjust it pretty much every time it goes over my ear. The Bluetooth connection also isn't very great. Sometimes I turn my head with my phone in my pocket and the sound cuts in and out. This happens often, especially when I'm walking on the street. I have to press down more than once sometimes to get it to turn on as well.<br /><br />I still use the headphones but am seriously looking for a better quality option. If you need quick cheaper headphones this might be good but, but definitely not a long term solution."
1,Very good value. Headphones connected easily and hold a charge much longer than I expected.
1,"Great sound quality, and work great right out of the box. for the price, you cant beat these. The only thing that could be better is an adjustable earpiece or one that just a tad bit less flimsy, but they still work well and the headphones dont slip around or move at all. Very happy with this purchase."
0,"The headphones themselves worked well.  The problem was it failed within a year - it appeared be the power switch is defective since it wouldn't power on even though  led light indicated fully charged.  Senso support did send a replacement as it was under warranty, however, that unit failed in even shorter period of time - 6 months.  I guess I shouldn't expect them to last for the price."
1,"Simply the best headphones, especially when considering their cost. They sound great, they fit great, they are easy to use and their Bluetooth range is exceptional. My only issue with them so far is That I had some difficulty pairing them with my iPhone 6 and my iPad Air."
1,"Excellent for resting, mowing the lawn, or any other activities.  Definitely recommend!"
1,Awesome earphones for great price
1,So far very good headphones with a amazing sound and price! Just a week of using this but it is working well for me.
1,Love these. Bought them with my new Samsung TV on amazon for when I work out in my basement gym.  Setup and use easy! Looking at buying another set for my other tv's as I am hard of hearing.
1,Bought these for my son for Christmas and he loves them. He said they are comfortable and stay on! They have taken his workouts to a new level!!!
1,This purchase was for my oldest son who graduated high school recently. He wanted ear buds that stayed in placed while running. Item also arrived quicker than expected.
1,Works great! I use this in the gym and sometimes while driving. Never had a problem pairing. The microphone allows me to take calls hands free. People I talk to say I come in clear and does not sound like I am on a wireless microphone.
1,These work well and seem to last around 6 to 8 hours continuously.
1,Nice product. Lots of features. Described exactly how product is. A+++. Would buy from again. L
1,Great sound and great fit!
1,Use: running and while working. In rain performed well. Soft-plastic buds with varying sizes gives a good fit.<br />Cost: ideal<br />Battery life: excellent<br />Sound: good. Nice bass response.<br />Controls: good for volume only.<br />Use with phone: some reports of slight echo.<br />Cons: Some wind-noise as with anything. The lowest volume is a tad louder than I prefer. &#34;Sound cancelling technology&#34; is simply a tight mechanical fit and does not cancel sound in the engineering sense of producing sound waves that are the reciprocal of ambient acoustic noise. The mechanical nature is fine and I knew this before purchasing. I personally don't like marketing teams that assume customers are idiots... but then again... most of us are.<br />Overall: completely solid set. Excellent value. Completely recommend for active runner (5-10 miles/day).
1,"Excellent sounds, good bass , awesome price. I cant see the difference between these and my Beats."
1,"They have a beautiful sound,,Crystal clear,,,Confortable to wear..They are perfect..No complaints here,,Excellant quality"
1,"I just got these bluetooth in-ear headphones. I got these at a substantial discount from list price via Amazon. My items arrived on time and in perfect condition.<br /><br />I've only had them a week, but so far I really like them. I wanted an affordable in-ear, sweat-resistant option for sports/yard work, and these seem to be great.  The silicone over-ear pieces are far more comfortable for my ear anatomy than hard plastic. Set up and pairing with my iPhone 7 was easy. The sound quality is better to me than Apple's standard EarPods (I'm mostly a classical listener, so don't need the mega-bass some people want). Phone calls seem to work fine with the built-in microphone. The total package (includes a USB car charger - a nice bonus) left a great impression. I can't assess durability, but so far so good!"
1,Fell in love with these.  Use them everywhere.
1,"If the gel tip type buds stay in your ear and are comfortable than these are perfect. For me anything but the hard plastic ear buds are uncomfortable or don't stay in your ear. For me this product is more of the same.<br /><br />Honestly though, great sound and quality parts for the price!"
1,"Love it. Fit for everyday workout. The only problem is, sometimes I just take it off without turn off. So it ran out of battery without me knowing it.<br />But the recharge is very quick"
1,"The sound quality is great and it stays in your ear while running or working out, I'd recommend this to everyone."
0,"I have purchased 8 pairs of these over about two years. They will break at around 3-6 months of usage, if not sooner."
1,Great value!
1,"Exactly what I was looking for. Fit great, work great, no complaints."
1,Works good sounds good little limited on distance
1,So far so good.  Fits well and sounds good.  This is my fourth or fifth pair of this style (not this manufacturer).  Most have stopped working after 6 months or so.  I've only had these a couple of weeks.
1,"All I can say is WOW! I've owned Beats (when they were made by Monster), Jaybirds, and skullcandy (louder than my skullcandys) headphones before and these are on those levels of loudness and clarity. For someone who has 2-12&#34; subs in his truck, I like loud but I also like it to sound clear at high levels. These headphones do just that, and I'm very satisfied with my purchase.<br /><br />UPDATE: After a few months of owning these headphones I really liked them, they stayed in my ears while running and working out. But they cut out when I ran in the rain and they also cut in and out when you step 20+ feet away. I wouldn't mind it, but when I just walk to the water fountain it bothers me."
1,So far this have worked well...they fit good and sound great.
1,"These are great earbuds. They are quick to charge, easy to pair with smartphone and very comfortable. The soft &#34;squishy&#34; materials insure a snug fit in the ear.  My only complaint is the treble could be improved.  The bass is great.  I have not checked the charging time, but will shortly.  Will buy them again."
1,Works better than expected
1,Have worn them at work and it’s so nice not to be attached to a chord!  Also worked great when I had a call come in!  Great deal for the price and they stay on my ears better than the iPod ones.  Much more comfortable.
0,"Sometimes, the earphones disconnect while I'm already connected and using them. The range is absolutely horrible. Can't go past 3 feet."
1,Awesome sound quality great price I'm very pleased with my purchase!!!
1,"this is great for using at the gym. if you need to listen to music to get your motivated for your work out and not get tangled up and or have ear buds fall out, this is for you."
1,I like them they work really well phone call clear too. They have more base than the reviews.
1,"A little bigger than my last pair, but well worth it. They fit great and the sound is awesome for the price. I couldn't use my prior pair while mowing, but these work great without having to jack up the volume. Even without music they muffle the sound of the mower."
1,It does seem like there is a lot of outside noise when the wind is blowing.  But other then that these headphones seem to work great!
1,1 year warranty really work
0,"After only 4 months, these headphones are completely dead. From the moment I bought them, there were issues with syncing to my paired device. It would sync, work for a bit, and then the music would start skipping. To solve this, I would have to turn everything off and resync the headphones, which usually took several attempts. After this nuisance, they usually worked for the duration of my run.<br /><br />I grabbed these for my run this morning, and they would not turn on. Even though they still should have been charged, I plugged them in to the charger, but they did not indicate that they are getting a charge. Tried a different charger with the same result. After several hours, they still will not turn on."
1,Great!
1,"Have a pair already but wanted another so I bought another...<br />Snug fit, good sound, connects easily via Bluetooth.<br />All I need!!"
1,"If you are on the fence with these, GET THEM! I bought these for $30, and they sound just as good my Bose SoundTrue earbuds ($120), plus they're bluetooth. I'm very happy with the purchase."
1,These headphones are perfect.  Great sound.  Perfect for running.
1,Excellent headphones and got a great price.
0,Sound quality was great for a while. Then the right ear gave up. Need to buy new headphones. I think they worked for 9 months. I’d rather not have to replace headphones every year.<br /><br />*Update* 10/2018<br /><br />They replaced the unit in May 2018. As of October 2018 the unit is longer functional. It lasted about 5 months. The company admitted that the replacement unit could be defective but will not replace the unit. They did offer a whole 5% discount on a new unit. I’m going to pass on Tekatron moving forward.
0,I'm a runner and like to use wireless headphones. The par I had dropped out 1 1/2 hrs into my run so I decided to give these a try. These headphones have out performed my expectations. They lasted through a 3 hour run with no problems. I will buy them again in a second.  GREAT PRODUCT!!!<br /><br />Update: I've went through 2 sets of these headphones. They stopped working after long runs in the rain. I really did like these but I won't be buying a third set.
1,I bought these headphones right before I headed to the beach on vacation.  I have run three days in steamy humid weather and so far I've had no issues.  They stay in place no matter how hard you're hitting the pavement.
1,"These headphones are not the best, but for ~$35 you can't get many better deals. There are a couple of minor issues that I've noticed after using them for a couple weeks. They occasionally skip audio for an instant, playing from my Galaxy phone. They have a dull white noise that's noticeable when my surroundings are very quiet. Minor issues on the whole. They generally are pretty good for blocking outside noise, and volume limit is not an issue."
1,Does the job!
1,The price is right but I wasn't impressed with the sound quality. There is basically no base. Not bad for the price though.
1,Have only had them for a week but the fit and sound is exactly what I was looking for!!!!!!!
1,My son in college for whom I ordered them for says “they are GREAT!”
1,I do hear wind in them and push on my tragis piercing. But they sound good.
1,so far so good. best bluetooth headphones i've had yet..
1,Very happy with them and with amazon. Thinking about getting another pair to have on hand liked them that well. If anyone is looking for a wireless set theses are the ones price is great sound great.
1,"I like the headphones. I haven't found them super comfortable yet, but to be fair that maybe my weird ear.<br />The sound quality sometimes is awesome, and others just ok, I don't know if its a bluetooth signal problem or what.<br />I don't know if is just me, but Mic quality is horrible, i used them to record, send audio messages and calls, and was very inconsistent, with heavy interference."
1,"It comes with the great box and quality is very good as expected. I bought it for my friend and he really likes it. Especially, it comes with a car mount for phone in its box. I think that's a gift and my friend gave it to me."
1,"Great product, earbuds are comfortable to wear and they sound great."
1,"Best $35.00 I have ever spent.  The headphones are crystal clear sounding with heavy BASS.  They are comfortable, flexible and so far.... long lasting. This was a great investment.  I hope they last forever.  I would absolutely purchase another pair for the wife.....  Easy to set up...  Easy to plugin and charge....  No complaints thus far....  I usually keep quite about my purchases....  This deserves a huge thumbs up!  Good job Senso!..  No I do NOT work for the company.  I just think that they are an excellent product.....  Senso please reach out to me for any additional comments: chrhub@aol.com"
1,"I loved these earbuds. For the price, they could not be beat. Sound quality was amazing. They were durable. The battery life was still reliable after a year and a half... and then I lost them.<br /><br />I bought the newer version (s255) and the sound quality is comparable. However, I learned that the old s250's did not have adjustable ear hooks, and that made them better than the s255.<br /><br />I came back to the s250 to order what I thought would be a pair just like I bought in 2017. Unfortunately, the new s250 are adjustable and have a different grippier plastic on the ear hooks that gets tangled in my hair 100% of the time I try to use them.<br /><br />People without long hair will most likely see the adjustability and grippiness to be a benefit. For me, it's always a struggle."
1,"Love these - they’re m y second pair. No problems w/ the other ones, I gave them to my son. Great sound, they  stay in my ears, and don’t hurt. Easy to use too."
0,"I have had this item for a week and use it over four hours each day. The sound quality is acceptable but not very great. Has a tendency to “buzz” when the volume is turned past 1/4. I have had zero noise cancellation with this item. If that is what you are getting them for, don’t. The battery life is quite good though."
1,"Good sound quality.  Wish it had rich bass tones.  Comfortable fit, easy charging, and I like the carrying case that came with it."
0,I’m literally going crazy. Am I really going to have to spend $150 on some Bluetooth headphones that WONT skip? Every set. And these seemed so promising. They’re no different than any other cheap pair and they hurt my hears... but I won’t of accepting the pain for nonskip...<br />Oh and they’re not held together very well. This was after they slipped off the counter.
0,Arrived on time but seems chopping with signal easily interrupted even at short range
1,"These earphones are amazing. Because these are over ear, they stay in when I am running. The sound quality is also very good. I get clear mids and highs and a very rich base. The lows disapper on some songs but that is expected in earphones in this price range. Even at max volumes, the speakers maintain the vocals and there is very less distortion.<br />As for wearing comfort, I love that I can wear them over extended periods without any ear pain and when I don't need, they just hang from my neck, ready to be used when I need it."
1,I got them the very next day that was awesome. I didn't even have to leave home. They work great most headphones are very uncomfortable in my ears and they really bug me I can hardly tell these ones are in and the sound is great. My old ones would fall out when I started walking fast so far these have not come out once. I am sold.
1,Excellent product. I recomend.
1,Love them
0,"I was optomistic these would be great earbuds as so many reviews stated they were a great price for the money. I would have to disagree and here is why...<br /><br />Pros first<br />1) Style, they look good<br />2) Materials- Feel fine don't feel cheap with the exception of the ear tips<br />3) Functions and connectivity- I have had no issue with the buttons housed on the earbuds or the bluetooth connection with my phone<br /><br />Cons-<br />1) SOUND- The most important part of this to me is sound... The sound is almost distant, I feel like even though the buds are in my ears it feels like the sound is traveling a distance to get to me. It also sounds muffled. Yes I have owned beats in the past and they sound much much better and yes they are much more expensive but even my earbuds that have come with my cell phone like my Ear Pods sound much better. Very disappointing.<br /><br />2) Fit- I have tried everything to get these to feel like they are secure on my ear but the band that goes over your ear is very loose and wiggles. They don't fall off but it doesn't make me feel like they are not going to. Also none of the earbuds fit well. They make popping noises as they move in my ear due to the cheap material they are made out of.<br /><br />I didn't have high expectations for these, I just wanted something with clear sound with a good ear fit. I realize these are not premium bluetooth buds but I can tell way too much of a difference from the sound difference to enjoy these."
1,My son really likes these.
0,Broke after a month of use. Pretty pathetic! Not happy!!!!
1,"so far so good.  My dog ate my last earbuds so I got these.  I work from home and these are working out real well during my calls.  I haven't had any issues.  They paired easily to all my bluetooth devices.  The only issue I have had is that I have small ears and they are quite large.  I have to def wrap the ear piece tighter around my ear to stay in place.  Thankfully, it's flexible and moves easily."
1,Work great. Instruction manual could be more descriptive.
1,Wow! These buds are way better than my last pair that I spent $100 bucks on.  I was concerned that the quality might not be there because the price was so low but I am happy to say I was dead wrong! Great earbuds. :)
0,I can't keep these more than 3 feet away from my phone or else they cut out
1,"These headphones are very easy to use and are sweatproof as described. The bluetooth connection works for the specified distance then starts going in and out when I'm across the gym from my phone, impressive range. I recently purchased a Garmin Forerunner 645 music and many people report having trouble maintaining a connection with their bluetooth headphones while swinging their arm away from the headphone because it's too far, these headphones paired and maintain a connection without any issue. Suck it Beats and Airpods.<br />Also, I ordered 2 pairs of headphones but after 10 months of use one of the pairs stopped working and after contacting Senso, they are sending me a replacement pair 2 days later. Even if they didn't send a new pair I would still say these headphones were worth it."
1,"I don’t usually write reviews, but these headphone are a great product for the price. I invested in some other products like THE DASH BY Bragi and what a waste of 200$.  These Senso are perfect for everyday use and have long battery life.  Highly recommend!!!  One electronic nerd to another.<br /><br />Jason"
1,Its a total value for money!
1,"Can't beat the price and the sound is quite good. I also didn't realize that there's a build-in microphone for phone calls (I wasn't event thinking about that when I got them!).  Connecting to my phone was very simple as was turning the volume up and down.  Once I started walking, I had a few problems with them not quite connecting properly but I think it was the arm holder my phone was in.  Once I switched arms, the headphones worked great.  I think the arm holder was hitting buttons on my phone.<br /><br />The carrying case the headphones come in is adorable and convenient. The instructions are great- easy to understand with helpful hints such as: Don't use with a fast charger.  It also came with a car charger that has 2 USB ports and a very long charging cord.  All in all, I couldn't be happier with these at this point.<br /><br />Update to earlier review:<br /><br />4 stars due to range but otherwise really like them.<br />The headphones don't seem to have much range.  If I'm more than 10-12 feet from my phone,  they cut out. One benefit,  I guess,  is that it's harder to set my phone down somewhere while wearing my headphones and then walking away,  forgetting about my phone. But I can't walk around my house...<br /><br />I have worn these while running - they stay put fairly well but you've got to make sure they are rotated properly.  Also,  I thought I had the smallest sized ear pieces on but I found a smaller size in the carrying case.  Made the headphones much more comfortable."
1,"Exactly as described.  So far, a great experience.  The sound is much clearer and truer than any of the wifi earbuds I've tried with great separation."
1,Great value. Music sounds incredible. Very comfortable too. Thanks.
1,The only issue I’ve had is that the connection can be spotty. I usually have to shut the WiFi of on my phone when I connect them otherwise it cuts in and out a lot. Other than that these have been great. I use them for 15-20 minutes a night and they lasted nearly a month of the initial charge. I charged them once since then and haven’t had to worry about it since.
1,THANKS
0,I ordered these hoping to use them at the gym or while cycling. Even when the volume is turned all the way up they don't seem to produce enough sound for me to be able to enjoy the music or podcast. They are constantly falling out of my ears even after changing the insert pads. sigh.
1,"Very comfortable to wear, easy to use.  There is a richness to the sound quality.  I was pleasantly surprised with the sound experience.  Noise reduction is outstanding.  You will not find a better product for your money.  I highly recommend these headphones to anyone looking for great quality headphones for a great price."
0,I wanted to like these headphones. They look great and that's where it ends. These do NOT stay in your ears. The right ear on my pair doesn't even fit at all. I'm giving the 2 stars for sound and extra accessories. If you can get them to stay in your ears they sound okay. They come with a ton of extras.
1,The headphones are awsome. They have great sound and are really comfortable
1,"This is actually my second pair. I bought my first ones four years ago, and they have been great. The ear stem broke in my luggage somehow so I needed a replacement. No questions asked, I went right back to the Senso earbuds and ordered another pair. They come with different sized ""buds"" for fitting to the inside of your ear more appropriately. Bluetooth connection is strong. Buttons are well placed. Microphone picks up nice and clear.<br /><br />The only qualm I have may not have to do with these earbuds themselves, but sometimes when I don't have these connected to my phone I hear my phone ring and answer it only to realize I can't hear anything. After hanging up I try calling back but can't hear anything. Low an behold, somehow these earbuds have turned on and connected to my phone! So I was getting sound all along through the earbuds in my pocket and therefore couldn't hear anything through the headset itself. How did the earbuds get turned on? Was it automatically, or was the button pressed just right in my pocket?"
1,"The headphones are decent for the price. However, I have experienced periodic skipping while playing music. It would also work a little better if there was a clip to use to secure them to clothing in the back. The comfort in the ears is ok."
1,"Excelent sound, easy pairing and use. Great product!"
1,"So far I'm very happy with them. The sound quality is much better than I expected, with surprisingly robust bass. It would be nice to have an option to rewind 10 seconds with the push of a button instead of just having the option of starting a track over but that's a small nit. The are comfortable for medium periods of time but after a couple of hours my ears hurt a bit. Nothing outside of what you would expect for an over-the-ear configuration and I might be able to eliminate that by exchanging earpieces (although the default ones seem to fit fine).  Overall I'm happy."
1,Very comfortable
1,Good sound! Hard to pair.
1,Great product! Used them right away and love them!
1,"Great, very easy to pair with iPhone8, excellent quality, tested today with a 3 mille run; exact what I was expecting."
1,"The best Bluetooth earphones I have owned. They are soft, accurate, and incredibly clear. They are very comfortable over the ears, and I am actually wearing them as I write this review. The volume buttons are a single click to raise or lower the volume. Pairing the headset was easy and the battery life is good. I have used them several nights a week for an hour or two at a time and I've only had to charge them once. Would definitely purchase them again if these ever fail or break."
1,Awesome headphones used them almost every day BUT sound went out in left ear after a few months then the right.
1,Perfect headphones!!!
0,"The on/off bottom got jammed and I cannot get it out. This started happening a few weeks ago but I was always able to get it back out. However, it's finally gotten stuck and now they cannot be used.<br /><br />Prior to this, they worked fairly well but I've had other brands that had longer lasting batteries and a larger range for the Bluetooth.<br /><br />Overall, I would not buy these again as there are better options in the same price range."
1,These headphones are amazing. I am glad that I purchased them.
1,"These are excellent headphones. They hold charge, stay put, are comfortable, good-great sound quality."
1,Epic headphones for the price same as beats for forth of the cost
1,They are comfortable and sound great for the price!
1,cool
1,These work really great glad I purchased
1,"I purchased the Senso ActivBuds S-250 via Amazon.  I am very impressed with the sound quality and how comfortable they fit.  Excellent bass.  Very light.  Love the flexible over ear piece.  The noise cancellation works really well.  Easily my primary headphones for working out now.  It's hard to complain about a lack of features at this price range.  That said, my only complaints are that the unit does not indicate the current power level when the unit is powered on (audibly - Power Level Low, Power Level Medium, Power Level High, etc); and, there is no way to mix outside ambient noise into the mix (the noise cancellation works really good so stay alert while jogging outside).  Nice warranty.<br /><br />Note: I've owned several wireless headphones in this price range ($20-$40) primarily used for working out.  This pair is EASILY the best of the pack...BY FAR.<br /><br />Good job Senso!"
1,Headphones seem to be working great . We will have to see how it stands up over time . And will they last
1,"Easy to pair with your device, easy to use and they sound great."
0,I was really excited about these but was disappointed firstly with the size of these and they really dont fit well in my ear.
1,"These have been awesome for the price! The battery life is amazing. I use them for about 2 hours 3-5 days per week while at the gym and only charge them maybe every other week; the batteries have only diet on me twice. The sound is clear and even on calls it’s great. No interference noises. I had to change the ear bud to a smaller size, but it came with several, so it wasn’t an issue. The only downside is that the curved part that goes over the ear is quite large for me; I’ve gotten used to it now, but if there was a way to order sized ones, that’s the only suggestion I would have. These are as clear as my beats, but the battery lasts much longer in these!"
1,Bought on sale for an amazing $36.<br /><br />Great sound and comfortable. I like the soft over the ear attachment.<br /><br />The controls are small and sensitive-read the instructions and practice.
1,SENSO Bluetooth Headphones:<br />These Headphones have a lot of Bass  which I find a little overwhelming for ear drum. I do like the fact that they do sit nicely on the ear and do not fall off.<br /><br />I prefer when the sound is a bit more even all around for better listening quality.
1,"I've had these headphones for over a year now and I'm incredibly pleased. I feel the battery life (about 6-8 hours) is comparable to any other similar product. The sound is actually really good. These headphones don't have the tinny sound that other similar products have had. The bass is clear and deep. Honestly, I wouldn't probably spend $150 for other brands when you can get a really amazing product for this price.<br /><br />Cons: they require adjustment every 15-30 minutes if you want them to sit just right. No fast charge option. The wire does get caught on my shirt and tug at the headphones occasionally.<br /><br />Pros: incredible sound, no ear fatigue (I can wear these for about two hours with little to no pain in my ears you can sometimes get), and great battery life for the price."
1,"Excellent sound quality. light enough in weight, can wear all day. 1st pair of Wireless, love'em"
1,"I couldn't be happier! First of all,  before I ordered this,  I read many reviews on this product! Then when I  was about to order this, a sentence came up that if I order it today they would send me a second one free! I put in the  order, and sure enough I got a second one for free!<br /> Everything that they said was included, did come in the box! After reading the instructions, I was ready to test them out.  They come with three sizes of earbuds, the small ones were comfortable for me. First I tested them on my iPhone 6 Plus,  they paired easily and sounded great! And everything I tested them with, I was able to adjust the volume  accordingly to my comfort. They fit well around the ear and are secure. I work out on a treadmill  about two hours, four days a week and have no problem with the earbuds moving around!  Also I have a 10 inch android tablet, that also pairs easily with and also  has great sound! Then, I tried him with the cell phone, and had absolutely no problem hearing the person on the other line,  and the person on the other line had no problem during me! I've had Bluetooth headsets in the past with complaints that another person on another line of their cell phone  I always had trouble hearing me. If you're looking for Bluetooth earbuds, I highly recommend these, you will not be disappointed!"
0,Got these headphones for my wife for Christmas.  She started using them in early January and only got 4-5 uses out of them.  Was able to recharge them once and now they will not hold a charge.  Now trying to figure out if I can return them  but can't find any information on the listed 1 year warranty.  Definitely wouldn't buy them again.
1,works great
0,"The only reason they get 2 stars is because it came with a charger and case and some other stuff. Those things were worth the price I paid. The headphones themselves worked fine for a month, then they just quit."
1,"They are nice, but they sometimes fall out my ears when I run or work out."
1,Outstanding sound! The earbuds fit quite well & don't jostle about while jogging. Great product @ a great price!!
1,"****Update #2 - It is now July 2019, I purchased my first pair in 2017 and loved them. Last week I dropped them and stepped on it smashing it into pieces. Whoops! I purchased set #2 and I am very happy to see they have made this product even better than before. The fit seems more snug (in a good way) and the sound seems a bit more advanced as well. The only thing that irked me was when you turn it on and off, my previous one would say ""connected"" or ""disconnected"". It now says ""your headset is connected"" or "" Your headset is disconnected"". It's a simple stupid thing and if I didn't have it the other way before I don't think it would have bothered me as much. Still, i'm very happy with it overall.<br /><br />*** Update- I have had these almost a full year (it's the end of Aug 2018) and still use them daily without issue***<br /><br />I purchased these back in September 2017 and they work pretty good with my apple watch. I am able to run and workout without carrying multiple products like Mp3 players that fall out of my pockets, etc..<br />Some minor things I have had issues with:<br /> 1. When I first connect it works fine but if click on a work out mode on my watch it &#34;skips&#34; and I have to turn it off and turn it back on and reconnect. It is always fine after that. Since I am used to it and expect it I just set it before I start working out. It doesn't do this any other time, it also connects to my Skype work meetings, etc..without issues.<br /><br />2. They fit better than any other headphones I have ever used, that being said my right ear must be wonky because when I run it will become lose and I keep having to fix it. My left ear doesn't have the same issue so I guess it's me not you.I previously corrected this by using an &#34;ear hook&#34; but it's so small and I eventually lost it somewhere in the abyss....When it's cold and I wear a beanie it stays perfectly.<br /><br />Does this work, absolutely!<br />I would definitely buy this again, for the price you can't beat it."
1,Used for less than month. Work great so far. Easy to use.
1,"I bought these because the &#34;in ear&#34; ear buds I was using kept popping out during runs. I figured I'd try out these with the &#34;over ear&#34; feature to hopefully keep them in place. That feature works perfectly for my more rigorous runs, as they stay perfectly seated on/in my ears! The noise cancelling feature works superbly, and the sound quality is on par with some of my higher end over ear/on ear headphones. I will say the bass is a bit over boosted, but honestly for working out, that is A-okay with me! All-in-all, this was a great purchase, and I highly recommend for anyone that does a mixture of circuit training and running.<br /><br />Fit: perfect/comfortable<br />Staying in place: perfect<br />Sound quality: excellent (while a bit overboosted)"
0,"I often use wireless headphones at the gym and when running outdoors. So I thought these will be great because of the lasting battery time and being sweatproof. I like the form factor and the battery life. But now, just 2 months after my purchase, they simply died. I charge them and the blue light comes up, but when I try to turn them on, they simply will not respond."
1,"Exterior quality is pretty durable, I like the soft feeling plastic coating on these headphones. They are very comfortable and stay put in my ear without issue. For running on the treadmill, these are perfect. However, taking these outside and running in wind produces very annoying wind-noise. Using a hoodie to cover the headphones fixes this issue.<br />In terms of audio quality, I was slightly disappointed with how these headphones as they sounded fairly muddled. I'm not very a bass loving guy but this pair does deliver pretty amazing bass. There is a low hum sound coming from the left headphone that gets irritating at low volumes but is drowned out at around 20% volume.<br />The battery life on these guys are pretty good, they last around almost a week with moderate use. The &#34;battery low&#34; warning is irritating but manageable.<br />Also now, my pair gets occasional split second cuts regardless of its distance to my phone, which gets pretty annoying after a while."
0,Headphones worked good for a couple months and then one day they just stopped working. Spend  a little more money to get a quality product.
0,Well I got these 1/5/19 it’s now 3/04/19 and guess what THEY WoNT CHARGE!??  So they were good for the piece while they lasted but they are toast now. I guess it’s the old “get what you pay for.”😡
1,"I love that it does cancel noisy while outside, wind nor rain affected the sound quality or incoming calls. The only thing is that is a bit bulkier. other than that I give them 4stars."
1,"Stayed in without issue for a 3 mile run. Sound is really good quality, easily the loudest and most clear of any wireless earbuds I've ever had. The only issue I have (and it's a very small one) is power button on the side of the headphones. This doubles as the play and pause control, and I always seem to accidentally hit it whenever I re-adjust the earbuds."
1,Awesome earphones!
0,Update:  these quit working after about six months.  I was looking for a basic set of headphones that would stay in my ears when running and stay connected to my phone.  These do both great.  The sound quality is fine for a basic listener.  I do find that I have to recharge them quite often.
0,"Died today... 6 Months of use. Great when it works, attempting to contact company, see about replacement."
0,"They are great sound quality the earpieces that he product comes with are great they fit any ear, the ear wrap pieces are flexible with a rigid core so they stay moulded, great headphones, but the warranty is baloney, I bought these circa 4 months ago and they just randomly stopped working and the microphone is not the best it started randomly going in and out then the headphones wouldn't take a charge."
1,Best headphones i ever had
1,East to use & nice design!!
1,"Nice packaging. Easy to use. A little bassy as someone else pointed out, but not an issue. Music sounds great, headset works well too."
1,"Really good headphones for the price, plus you're getting a lot of other cool stuff in the box. I've only had them for a couple days so I've yet to see how they hold up. But, I've been very impressed with Senso. They seem to care about their quality and even offer a one year warranty free of charge. Took away a star bc the over the ear piece seems to be a little big and doesn't fit perfectly- but maybe that's just me."
1,Good quality headset and quick customer service.
1,"I use these at the gym to be cord free. I don't care for the ones that just hook in your ear, they always fall out. I prefer these types that actually attach. The hook on these is flexible and comfortable. They clearly say when your connected and disconnected. The red logo is your on/off/pause button. The sound quality was better than expected with a nice balance of crispness and bass."
1,Great sound and quality product for a fraction of the price!
1,These are great! The first pair I ordered were damaged and I was unable to recharge them but the company was super easy to work with and sent me a new pair. Been wearing them consistently while running for months and find them to be very comfy and decent enough sound quality.
0,These headphones are useless. They don't stay on my ears while I am working out and within a week of buying they broke.
1,I was skeptical about the quality but it had good reviews so I got them. They arrived today and I am trying them now and the did not disappoint! They have great sound quality and very comfortable and lightweight. I barely know I'm wearing them
1,These aren't as rugged as I was hoping.
0,"These things charge fine, the sound is OK and the packaging and delivery was fine.  What you don't see from the pictures is HOW BIG THEY ARE!  Holy cow, they are anything but discreet when you wear them."
1,"These are awesome. I previously both another pair that did not come with a charger or instructions and I couldn't figure out how to use them, so worthless to me.  These came with everything you need and are AWESOME. Great fit. Quality is good."
1,"I see allot of politically correct reviews about different products. This is not one of those. To cut to it, these headphones will beat your brains out for several hours straight all while cancelling the outside world. If you want no $#!+ headphones then buy these. The only complaint I have is that my cat keeps eating them. Please stop putting katnip in them. Thank you."
1,Absolutely love them...i am currently deployed and they have helped tremendously.  Thank you for the amazing product!
1,"While I gave it a good review for quality, etc; the fit in the ears isn't very comfortable even after several ear plug exchanges."
0,"We returned these when the first pair kept cutting out.  Now that it's past the return period, the second pair are doing the same.  I wouldn't bother with these."
0,"I really liked these when they worked, but after maybe 25 uses they simply wont work anymore.  :("
1,👍🏾
1,"These headphones look like beats but hold their own, very thankful for a good product, plasticy but hopefully waterproof I wish they had a skip button or a phone feature,"
1,"They cut out from time to time with phone calls, however for listening to music they seem to work great. I use them while I am at work to help keep focused without having to hold my phone, I also use them in the car to talk to my wife while I drive that way I am hands-free."
0,"I am using this for about  3weeks now mostly while working out. Its holding is not bad, but little awkward due to angle of insert part and holding part. It just doesnt completely fit to my ears somehow, but still hold them right. My biggest complaint is it doesnt equalized right and left. I can still listen to both side, but not same volume. Sound quality is not so great. I have cheaper one and  prefer the cheaper ones for the sound. I ordered this expecting better holding. Now I have better holding, but worse sound quality."
1,These are excellent. Stay in my ears while I run. It's so nice to not deal with a cord. It comes with a bunch of convenient extras like the iPhone charging cord and the carrying case to avoid tangling and keep them in good shape. Great quality product!
1,Sound quality is excellent. Noise cancelling is okay.
1,They are great ear buds. Linked quickly toany devices. I know sound as I worked in this industry. These are like having the music coming from within my head!
1,Headphones are very comfortable and customer service was great. Matched the lower price!
1,Muy buen producto
1,Me gusto su diseño ergonómico y sus colores
1,Wow it does everything it says it does and the speakers and mic are awesome.  The battery lasts a good amount of time
0,Doesn't hold a charge very long.  Always need to charge prior to use.
0,The sounds quality is good but I have had two pair of these and on both of them the charging port has broken.
1,Fall out of ears too easily
0,"Great sound, great price, but when my son received them, the &#34;over the ear&#34; piece on the left was so stretched out it hung free of his ear. This was highly disturbing as I needed to be able to adjust to his ear, this was preformed and stretched out of preportion beyond a normal ears physical fit.  Please contact and forego any instructions on how to &#34;fix it myself&#34; as it is the responsibility of the company to make the product they advertised to its entirety. I either want my money back or another correctly made pair. We trusted you. Fix it."
1,"Pretty neat, I can leave my phone in one room and walk to another room and still hear it with my Senso headphones!"
1,Paired easily with my MacBook Air. Sound is good. They are comfortable to wear. I'm happy.
1,These are really good. Easy to connect and solid sound all around.Comfortable and clean. Good product
1,Great headphones.
1,"I love it so far considering I kinda used to the headsets with cable plug in although every time I played something with any audio it makes kinda static noise for few seconds, but after that it sounds smooth."
1,Awesome crisp sound
1,"Easy to pair. Lightweight. Great sound. I've only used these SENSO Bluetooth headphones for a few days, but so far I'm very impressed!"
1,some of the best earbuds you can buy you don't need to spend big bucks to get quality earbuds
1,Great product jogged the neighborhood with them very please ! Would recommend these to any one doing a fitness run!
1,it works great love it
1,The base isn't all that great but it plays loud music and blocks out sound. For the price these are decent
1,"Love these headphones!!! They sound great, and are great for the gym!!! I had a problem with the pair that I ordered, and they were under warranty, I contacted the seller through Amazon, and they sent me a brand new pair, no problem. Customer service was fantastic!!!"
1,"This product was much better than I expected for the cost.  The battery lasts long, the sound is terrific and the fit is perfect. Really could not ask for more."
1,"These are the best headphones, I have ever used they sound and fit great!  I highly recommend  this excellent product."
1,Given as gifts and users LOVE them!
1,The best Bluetooth headphones Ive ever owned
1,I ordered these headphones on the claim they were sweat proof!<br />I find them extremely comfortable and the battery last the 7-8 hours.<br />But the charging was an issue and after 15 months they stopped taking a charge. so now I either have to plan on buying a set once a year or trying a different brand.<br /><br />They do black out a lot of noise such as wind while running or walking but when riding there is a lot of outside noise.
0,Can't get to stay on for more than 20 minutes. Battery life is horrible
1,I used them in the shower they work great went swimming with them in the pool  They don't work under the water but when you come out of the water they work perfectly fine.
1,"Very nice sound quality.  However, the pinna wrap around piece is huge and the headphones fall off my ears when running.  I am trying to figure out how to rig this so it will fit.  I really like the sound quality"
1,Have used these at a gym. Left my phone in jacket hanging on wall and went around the gym using the different equipment and the earbuds worked great also plan on using the in an Aqua Zumba class.
1,"These are defiantly BEAT killers. Amazing quality for the price, If you're looking for good headphones to workout with and affordable this is it."
0,"Its okay fit good in the ear and look okay BUT:<br />1. Having the mic on the earpiece does not help voice reception<br />2. Audio is breaking up when on the move, even walking at normal pace<br /><br />So basically, I have to hold the phone close to my body when walking or moving around which sucks!"
1,I have get the best sound quality at a low price
1,"I love them. These headphones are most definitely base heavy. I think they still are most definitely a stell for the price. I didn't believe that they were waterproof for the price they were, but they are. I like that thay come with a 2 in one iphone charger and a charger to charge the earbuds. The case could be a little bigger, but the  case is the about the same size as most earbud cases. I think they stay in pretty good. The extra earbud pieces that they come with are a little hard to put on but, it has to be hard to put on to keep it to be waterproof. When you are going to get them wet make sure the charging port is closed so no water gets in it ruins them. I also really like that the warranty is good for like 2 months. The ear think that wrap around your ear is a little flimsy but, they do not fall out of your ears."
0,"I bought this product on mid October, 2018 and on January 8, 2019 (less than 3 months) isn't working anymore. It bothers me that I bought this to be broke so soon. It<br />sound pretty good but it didn't last more than 3 hrs. At the beginning one ear bud stop working and in less than a week it became unresponsive completely. I'm a mail carrier (hard job under the weather and around the holidays, 10-12 hrs per day 6 days a week) and listening to music while working makes my days more bearable. I would appreciate if someone contact me cause I miss the window to return it and because is not fair either."
1,Wow. These are great. Wonderful sound quality and comfortable.  I use them at the gym. Great value. Highly recommend these.
1,Nice headphones
0,stopped working within a few months
1,I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He loves them. They are amazing. He said it's the best gift he's ever received.
1,"For my birthday I was going to ask for some Bose headsets but saw the reviews for the SENSO headphones and thought 'why have loved ones spend the extra money?'  I am glad I asked for the SENSOs, the sound is phenomenal and you seem to have thought of everything in your packaging.  With the case, I can stop shoving my headset and wires into little plastic bags which is probably why I go through so many..  Your 3 ft power code is so innovative with its dual micro USB and Apple charger heads and you also included a 2 port car charger and a short micro USB cord.  I was anxious to start using the headphones and to my surprise, it was already charged and ready to go.  It took  no time to pair it to my phone and your instructions were very clear on how to use the various functions.  You got it all right.  I am sure your company will do wonderfully.  ."
1,Easy and capable of everything I want it to do.
1,"Very good sound, stays in ear okay (will have to try out different sized buds), sticks out from ear further than I would have liked."
0,only took 2 weeks to stop working
1,"Fine sound quality with an intuitive and attractive design. Affordable without losing quality. Excellent fit and finish, though YMMV. I would recommend to anyone tired of getting their headphone cord yanked when running."
1,Love this product!
1,"These come in handy for working out and listening to a device while walking around even other rooms. I clean the earpieces regularly, so I don't worry about moisture much any more.<br />The volume adjustment is a little hard to deal with, but it works.<br />No pairing issues.<br />They don't hold really tight to the ears. (+/-?)<br />The battery seems to last all day, at least."
1,"Just got them. Music sounds better than my plantronics backbeat fit , and my lg tones. The adapter and cables it comes with would run more than $25 at a retaile<br /><br />Sounds great, but virtuously useless for calls<br /><br />Edit: how have these lasted 2 years? I have not taken care of them. Earned a 4th star for longevity."
1,The quality and sound is more compare to my expensive beats Bluetooth. I bought two of these for my children and they love it.
1,These fit well and sound good. Plus its nice to answer calls with 1 button.
1,Great for the gym
1,Great ear buds...pairing was the easiest and they came with different sized ear pads and I was able to change them out quickly and they fit perfectly. Sound is excellent...no cutouts and they were delivered as advertised and on time...would buy more products from these folks. Thx.
1,"These are the perfect beginner and decent priced wireless headphones for working out! The battery stays charged for a really really long time, and connecting to Bluetooth is an absolute ease."
1,I love my new headphones
0,I need to change my review. After using these for a while the Bluetooth cuts out often. It seems that if I put my phone in my pocket they cut out more than they work. As long as there is line of site they work good. It is a nice product I really wish they worked better they are definitely loud enough.
1,"I have been using these for approximately 4 days now and love them, I am still learning how to operate them as they are user friendly."
1,"Love the sound, love the fact they honored the warranty and sent a new pair... Thank you Invotek"
1,"I am retired and go on hikes of several miles lasting hours.  I needed a set that could give me at least six hours of usage on one charge.  So far, I get eight hours and am ecstatic.  Sound is good.  Easy to connect.  Can't ask for more."
1,I think it's great ! It's pretty loud (the way I like it) and the packaging is great.
0,"I had a pair of these I used for the past two years teaching online video classes and they worked really well.  When my old pair no longer held a charge, I decided to purchase a new pair.  Well, these are nothing like they used to be.  I could tell immediately that the headset is much lighter in weight and feels cheap.  I used this new pair today for the first time and had to stop using them.  My students could not hear me at all, and I just heard a bunch of static in my ears. Too bad."
1,Can't beat the price.  Good sound and comfortable to wear. Earbuds charged quickly and setup was a breeze. Satisfied purchase.
1,"Great sound and I like the &#34;open&#34; wrap around the ear, vs. another model that crimped my ear."
1,"I like this product as the batteries last for a long period of time. Sound quality is good, probably not the best. But withing this price, it is a great deal I must say."
1,Very useful device
1,Why spend a ton of money when these work perfectly.
1,"Great earbuds for working out. Sound quality is loud and clear, pairing to iPhone was simple and carrying case and charger make it a total no-brainer. Would definitely purchase again."
1,Sound quality is good. easy setup.
0,"I bought these headphones hoping they would good for my variety of activities from house chores, running and trail riding (wearing a bike helmet). Unfortunately, these frequently drop the Bluetooth signal from my iPhone SE, which is a total failure for this product. What the user experiences is that the sound keeps dropping out when using these, which is enraging. I have rebooted my phone, ""forgotten"" and re-paired the Bluetooth device, but nothing helps. I hope the seller will take these back. They are either a defective unit or just lousy quality. Be warned."
1,"I rarely ever give anything 5 stars because nothing is perfect and truthfully that's unrealistic. The Senso Bluetooth Headphones by Invotek deserve an overall grade: 4.<br /><br />So the pros:<br />1. Well, the first pro is huge since these are the only headphones that have actually stayed in my ears for workouts, elliptical, running, biking and general weightlifting.  I have tried Jaybirds, Spigen wireless and others, yet none stayed in.  The key here is the flexible wrap around the ear holders.  Now, these are super soft and rubbery so they won't hurt or grip your ear with force but they hold just snuggly enough (yes I said snuggly) enough to not move.  And a note to others if you think you can purchase something without ear wraparounds and they will still in while you move on a workout... you are going to find yourself frustrated 9 times out of 10.  And the JBLs (or others) with the metal portion that lies on your neck while the earbuds are in your ear?  You will find those pop out and you sweat around your neck so the main piece around your neck become disgustingly wet and sweaty.<br />2. The Sound?  Wow, these things get loud.  Now I listen to Hip Hop (Golden Era, Native Tongues, Common Market, etc.), Folk, Pop, Reggae, Soca, R&B, Jazz and Soul.  So each genre has a different need of bass, treble and mid-tones. These did not disappoint.  They want be the best sounding but pretty good.  Now of course with a tighter fit the better it sounds.<br />3. The pouch? priceless! It's a nice small carrying case.<br />4. The price? $37? You can't go wrong.  Let's compare to Beats - $149 for workout headphones?  Come on son! I have better things to spend my money on like Automation of my house.<br />5. Phone answering feature is great and mic worked when riding my bike.  My wife could hear me clearly.<br />6. Connectivity not an issue. (ex. I drive a midsize suv: I put my jacket on the passenger's seat, then walked around back of the car to driver's seat and never lost connectivity or a heard a skip. At the longest point that has to be 10ft.<br />7. Finally Music/Calling ending/Turn on and Off button works well.  As well as additional volume controls.<br /><br />So the cons:<br />Really there is only one and I didn't anticipate this but when riding my bike (and possibly running) the encasement of all the circuitry has a flat service to it, therefore when the wind hits it you get a loud wind noise because of the flat surface.  Now, I turned my head a bit to the side and found the wind noise went away.  I was moving pretty fast about 15 miles an hour and it was windy out. Now I have to try the different ear fittings to see if they provide a more secure fit because the tighter the seal the less you hear the wind.<br /><br />Therefore I'd still recommend.  If you are an Android person find tips from me on: www.facebook.com/nyandroidexaminer<br /><br />Note to Invotek: build an encasement that is more aerodynamical (think droplet shaped) and this noise should go away."
1,I don't normally use Bluetooth headphones because I worry about it killing my phone battery.  I previously had a pair of Panasonics that I had bought for $80. With prime I only paid $35 and these headphones are amazing! On top of the high quality headphones I also received two charge cables and compact case for the headphones. I really appreciate the presentation.  I always have these headphones on me and they're the best I've had.
1,Great sound for the money!
0,Purchased this product on 10/10/18 today’s date is 10/16/19. Headphones just stopped working will not turn on at all don’t know why but because it is 6 days past the purchase date I was offered a 5% discount. Headphones worked great up until this day. Convenient that they stopped working 6 days after the warranty expired. Not happy with this product at all or the customer service.
1,I just received them today and they sound really good they don't move out of place. I'll be leaving feedback when I have used them for some time but so far... 5 stars!
1,"Easy to use, nice sound, soft and comfortable material, stays on ears, good up to 25-30 feet in my gym. I keep my phone is my gym bag and work out with them. For the price, I stole them. I am buying a pair for my best friend. No really, it is great gift."
1,Great! GF loves them more then my beats
1,perfect sound
1,The headphones worked really well. They connected to my phone every time I turned them on within a few seconds. They never fell off during my runs. They never ran out of battery during my runs and they lasted a lot longer than expected. The sound was really good for the price.
1,"Waterproofing is pretty good but have had an earpiece go out for like an hour as it dried out.  The batteries are decent, I get like 6 hours of music.  I have had some pairing issues, it has forgot my phone's a couple times.  I use it with 2 android phones."
0,"i am giving this one star because even though they started out great, once they fully died and i charged them, they will not connect to my phone anymore. I have tried to reset them and my phone and they will not pair up. i use these for the gym and they will connect to my computer but not my iphone. only had these for not even 1 year and i am very disappointed"
1,"This is my 4th purchase of these headphones. Not because they broke, I lost one and purchased a replacement I listen to books on line and always have a charged set of headphones as a backup. They charge quickly, good price, sound is good!,"
1,"The earphones are light and comfortable.  The playback is bass heavy, but that's how I like my music.  The only problem I had with these was when I was running in the wind.  The earphones seemed to pick up a lot of wind noise to a point where it was so loud, I couldn't hear the music playback.  The wind wasn't that strong, but the earphones amplified the wind noise enough to overpower the music.  If I ran indoors, or in a place where there was no wind, then these earphones would work great."
1,"These headphones are amazing. I bought a pair for my husband for Christmas and after trying them decided I wanted a pair for myself.  They come with different size earbuds and a case to keep them safe. I was able to sync them right up to my phone, they have great sound. I highly recommend."
1,"Great headphones, delivery was fast."
1,"it is very light and durable set, easy to control on volume and dicintly clear. I only have one thing want to say when someone calls me the set disconnected."
1,"Great sound, fit well."
0,"Before making my purchase I read other peoples reviews who also purchased the earbuds and kind of knew what I was getting into. At first glance you can tell they are cheaply made and will probably not last long. I remember seeing some photos other individuals posted showing the earbuds separating from the seems and mine look like they were about to separate as well. My main gripe about the earbuds is that the bluetooth signal in them SUCK!!! I usually put my phone in my left pocket when I workout at the gym and notice during my workout the audio was cutting in and out. I thought I need to charge the earbuds before I used them but then I remember I had them on the charger all night just to make sure they had full juice for the gym the next day. I started to diagnose the issue by cover the top of my phone and notice when I did that the audio to the earbuds would cut off totally. I've never experienced that issue with my other bluetooth earbuds made by Jabra, Beats by Dr Dre, Motorola, LG and Samsung. When I made the purchase for these earbuds I saw the original pricing was around $140 and was dropped down to $35. Now I know why the huge price drop and returned these the very next day and will stick with name brand earbuds"
0,"I was looking forward to using those, based on reviews. The sound is truly amazing, better than my Beats 3. Sadly I encountered a few problems in the first 5 min. 1- The bluetooth connectivity disconnected & the music blared from my iPhone 7. 2- The main part of the ear piece (black/red) is so heavy it kept falling out. 3- The over-the-ear part is super soft & as light as a rubber band, therefore not helping with the second issue :("
0,"I ordered these because I lost my LGs, now I regret it. The sound is good, especially for $40 bucks. The problem,  I cant step more than five feet away without the damn signal breaking up. While at the gym, if I do inclined sit ups,  breaks up signal, if I am doing planks, and phone is on my left side, signal is choppy. If the phone is at my feet and I lay on my back, signal breaks up.  It comes with a wallet sticky for the back of your phone, a carrying case, and a nifty sticky magnet so you can mount it on your dashboard, mounts with sticky tape (metal is about the size of a quarter). The truth is, if you want to lay in bed, sit in a chair and stay put,  GREAT!  If you're planning on purchasing for GYM, don't waste your time.  I will be returning them if its not too late.  To better describe the issue, it sounds like a scratched CD or CD player with no anti-skip. ANNOYING as F***!"
1,"Low battery warning at 70%, then turns off after few minutes. Either the battery indicator is defective or the battery is. If u turn it back on, it works for few mins and then the same error. I turned it on/off until power drained to 50%"
0,"The headphone sound is okay, it does not cancel noise at all. Also, the loops that go over the ear are too tall. They loop in my hair and not the top of my ears. The placement of the mic makes my callers have to constantly ask what did I say. The only way I remedy that is to take the ear bud out of my ear where the microphone is and let it sit on my chest as I speak. Please fix that."
0,Could not get it to go into pairing mode.  Not much use for a blue tooth set that can't be paired.  Returned it.
1,"Pros: These sound good. They pair easily.<br />Cons: After 3 years of light use the connecting cable started to fall apart. Don't buy if you need durablity. It's a shame, because I relly liked them."
1,These held up for almost 1 year but recently the left ear stopped playing.  Contacted customer service and they are sending me a new pair.
0,The range is pathetic. The sound is terrible. The hooks that go over the ear are useless. Zero sound cancellation.
0,"I bought these to use when exercising at the gym.  Unlike my previous ear buds (Wemo) these did not stay in my ears, even when doing light exercise (e.g., on a stair master or elliptical machine).  I doubt that they would stay in my ears while dong any activity other than sitting and motionless.  If that's all you need them for, you might find them useful."
1,"By far the absolute best Active Headphones I have bought at this price range. They sound better than even &quot;cough cough&quot; Apple's earbuds. They fit nicely, they sound nice, and come with a 1 year warranty. My biggest concern was the sweat, and these are labeled as &quot;Sweat Proof&quot;. It is a qulity product which you can see in the craftsmanship, and even in the materials used in all components. We need more &quot;Senso&quot; like companies out here . . ."
1,My teenage son loves them but the distance sound is compromised when 25 feet away. He does have real beats as well. They sound just as good. So far they are working great.
1,These headphones work very well.  I use them when I ride my bike to work.  They can be a bit challenging only having one ear in.  The Bluetooth connection is nice and it provides ample sound for the ride.
1,"Great headphones! They are easy to use, hold a lasting charge, and block out all outside noise. Wish I would have bought these sooner"
0,Doesn’t stay on my ears!
1,"Wow. That's my first impression. Just wow. I had zero expectations for this product because I haven't had great luck in the past with Bluetooth headphones at a variety of price points.<br /><br />However, when I received these, I was really impressed. They come with premium accessories--lightning to USB cable, car charger, carrying case, plus more.<br /><br />The earbuds are super soft and comfortable. They stay put very nicely because of the piece that wraps around your ear. That piece is also made of this buttery soft silicone and you don't even know it's there--unlike many other plastic models that start digging into your ear after awhile.<br /><br />The sound is good. I'm not an audiophile, so my expectations were that they would sound good and block out some extraneous noise while at the gym. Mission accomplished.<br /><br />This isn't a sponsored review. I purchased these because of the overall consensus that they're decent. I'd like to say that they're pretty amazing for the price. I would have paid more for them, to be honest. They're that good.<br /><br />Last one: They were fully charged out of the box and paired instantly with my iPhone."
1,"I ordered a pair of wireless headphones from Senso after going through 2 pairs of Beats in 2 months. I love the product it's easy to use and has decent sound quality. As an added bonus the headphones come with a car charger and extension cord. Recently, the headphones stopped charging and I emailed the company, after 48 hours a new pair was in the mail to me. Excellent costumer service. Highly recommend."
1,The only reason that I gave this only four stars was that I can’t get them to stay behind my ears to good.  The sound was great though. I evidently have little ear openings. I really like them though.
1,So happy with these.  The case is great and the sound is really good for the price.  You seriously can’t beat these.
1,"Great headphones!<br />I had a little of a problem with the sound cutting out.  So, I emailed the company.  Response was close to immediate.  They were willing to return and get a new set, but gave advice on how to reset and pair properly.  There has been no problem since.  Good product, outstanding customer service!"
1,"I think the product is very good. It's easy to wear and does not irritate my ears while wearing. The only complaint is that when I'm talking on the phone while using them, background noise is easily heard. Otherwise it's a great product."
1,DO NOT BUY BEATS.<br /><br />These are literally the same thing and better than my jay bird x2s... these are great. Must buy.
1,"Great sound,  good battery life.  Very good set of ear buds for the price.  Replacement buds are hard to find."
1,The headphones work great. They pair easily and are very reasonably prices.Would buy them again.
0,"I have only had these a short time. I have used them once.  I charge them, put them in my purse to use at a later date and when I put them on to use them again, no charge.  They do not hold the charge. I don't care how many times I charge them.  The next time I go to use them they are dead.  It is frustrating."
0,"Lasted for about 6 months, now will not connect to phone."
0,They changed the over ear hooks from previous models.  The last models were malleable and able to be adjusted.  These are hard and stay in one position. I have cauliflower ear in both ears so the Malleable version made it easier to lock the earbuds in place.  These new over ear hooks that don't adjust are terrible.
1,"Have to admit I was hesitant to buy a brand I didn't recognize. I sure am glad that I did. These headphones are lightweight, comfortable, easy to connect, and sound better than my previous pair."
1,"Fits perfectly,good quality, crystal clear music- connected in seconds to iphone 6"
1,I was deciding between these or Beats bluetooth headphones. I decided to go cheaper first. And when I say cheaper I mean price. I'm glad I did. They have a really nice sound and they fit well on my pointed ears. And with the money I saved I took my wife out to a nice dinner. Do yourself a favor and get the Senso.
1,"GREAT PRODUCT!  EASY TO USE, GREAT SOUND!!  I PURCHASED A SECOND PAIR, ONE FOR THE OFFICE, ONE FOR HOME."
1,Awesome! So worth the price!
0,It really makes me wonder when other reviews say the sound is really good. Now I can see why there are so many new artists and songs out there. A lot of people really don't know what good quality is.
1,I use these headphones all the time. Actually about to purchase a 2nd set. Accidentally stepped on the right earbud and broke it. They still work even after the mechanical break. Wear them in the shower and I wore them once in the pool and they still work like new. The battery for me has lasted for way over the 4 hours that has been recommended.
0,"I got my headphones this week and am loving them thus far! The carry box is beautiful, the charge seems to last a good amount of time, the audio is great and most importantly they stay in well through my workout!<br />Update: I have now been using these headsets for about 3 months and one day when I went to take it off the charger, I realized that the on botton (which has been acting up) is now permanently depressed and won't come out or press down any further. This means I have no way of turning the headphones on :( It worked beautifully, but I can't believe it only worked for 3 months!"
0,"I had really high expectations on this product. Build quality is meh, they aren't the most comfy headphones out there and sound isn't good at all. Too pricey for what you get"
1,"I originally rated these with just one star and stated that they failed to work right out of the box and made plans to return them for a refund. But after my post Senso Support reached out with a prompt reply and based on their reply I gave them a second look. The problem was one of user error. These are awesome, they fit comfortably and the sound is great. Dollar for dollar these are the best wireless sports headphones I've tried to date. And I've tried all of the higher end units."
1,"Son liked them, said they do the trick for running"
1,"Headphones were great. Sound was loud enough to block outside noise. Pretty comfortable.<br />However, the turn on/off bottom stopped working after two weeks of being used."
0,Runners don't waste your money.<br />Buds don't stay in your ears. Create this terrible suction in sweaty ears then fall out. Flimsy.  I'll be returning. Very disappointed.
1,Thoroughly enjoying my SENSO Bluetooth Headphones. They arrived early in secure packaging. I take them to the gym regularly. I’m very pleased with the material and sound quality. Battery life is impressive.  I would recommend these headphones!
1,"Pro: Sound good and has good bass, loud, look nice, connect fast, water proof.<br />Cons: battery doesn't last too much, kinda uncomfortable at first but get used to it after,"
1,"They are truly the best for the price, cancels out noice and very powerful. Sweat proof is nice cause I'll be using them in the gym. Love them"
1,"These ear buds work great. The voices sound a little higher but that's fine, maybe it's just me and my allergies. The only thing I really found difficult was changing tracks.  I'm watching one video and was hearing something else.  It works fine I was just slightly confused as to how to do it. A techie wouldn't have a problem. Overall they are excellent.  I would definitely buy again."
1,"Great quality for the price. Super easy to pair, took me less than 3 minutes. Very happy :)"
1,"These headphones worked alright for the first couple of months but after a while it took forever for them to connect to my Bluetooth, and the buttons for volume are not working properly anymore, when I want to turn down the volume it actually turns up and vice versa. I bought insurance for them and I would like to get a replacement"
1,"Let me start with how much I enjoy my wireless purchase,I'm 63 years old I've been using them while grocery shopping , house work and of course by the pool in Hawaii."
1,"These are my dog's favorite bluetooth headphones. He particularly enjoys the soft, chewy part that is meant for the ear, but also doesn't mind the crunchy parts either. I know this because he has gone through 2 pairs already! Thanks SENSO!"
1,These headphones are great! They fit well. They keep the outside noise out. Calls were clear. I would recommend trying out a pair. You won't be disappointed.
1,"I bought my husband a pair. He loved them  Ordered 3 more for myself and sons. Love them!!!!  We all could be in same vehicle, sync our headphones with different devices without problems!!!’"
1,I haven't tried them all no doubt but these are the best of several that I have and at a great price!
1,"Pairing and sound works great. Very reliable, use almost daily for work for over a year."
1,"I am very happy with my new head phones.  They are light weight and comfortable and the sound quality is good.  They stay in my ears.  The only thing I can't rate is how well they will last.  I've only had them for 2 weeks, but so far so good."
1,"Good sound, connects quickly to Bluetooth, very nice for the price."
1,I loved the headphones but the battery runs out slighty fast but mostly the shipping tooked longer than expected that was a big no no :(
1,Great product and it even comes with a nice set of accessories. I liked it so much I bought a second pair for my husband to use at the gym.
1,"Less than two months use and they will no longer turn on. Followed the directions on charging and care. Blue LED illuminates when plugged in and when button held to restore to default settings, there is the flashing LEDs and a double tone. Contacted Customer service and was immediately impressed with their response. Attempts were made to repair the headset but no luck. A new one is on the way."
1,I think these headphones are great they are as good as all the reviews I read before I purchased them
1,These are great!! They stay in place while running and the sound is amazing! I love them!
1,Are not sweatproof. Sound became faint within 30 days of purchase and right headphone went completely out after a run.<br /><br />That being said customer service has been great. I look forward to receiving my replacements.
1,"Wasn’t expecting much given low price point but have been pleasantly surprised.  Was a little concerned at first as the connection would cut in and out frequently but if you hold or wear your phone (think armband for jogging) on the same side as the Bluetooth transmitter in the earpiece, it works just fine and I’ve experienced much less cutout since wearing armband with phone on my right side.  Plenty of volume.  Wouldn’t say they are noise cancelling but that’s also not why I purchased them. Would recommend."
1,I have hearing loss and these make my exercise great by allowing clear music and podcasts. Easy-holds charge well-good clarity
1,"UPDATE on 10.15 - I was trying a variety of things hoping to make them work again, and I guess eventually something worked (not sure what exactly) so even though I appreciate being contacted by the company immediately, I will not be calling them, at least for the time being. I have headphones again, they’re working just fine at the moment, so there’s no reason to call customer service (unless god forbid they conk out again). But thank you for the quick response and attempt to resolve the issue!<br /><br />Approximately 3.5 months since I got these, and they've stopped working. At first, I loved my new headphones. I had no complaints, everything about them worked for me. I waited to write a review since I haven't had them for very long, but I was ready to gush about how amazing they are. Then today all of a sudden they won't play anymore.  It said &#34;connected&#34; and my phone showed that it was connected but I got no audio. I tried disconnecting and reconnecting them, restarting them and finally resetting to factory settings. Nothing."
1,"Sound, quality is good.  One ear piece does not stay in very well."
1,"comfortable, stay in place and have great sound."
1,just the best....
1,Quality product with great sound! Love it so far!
1,Never charged this much and for the price these in-ear phones are great. Used almost daily in the gym.
1,I like it and I am very satisfied.
0,"They can actually stay in my ears pretty well when I use them during running. However, the problem is that they cannot stay paired with my iPad. Constantly telling me “disconnected....connected” drives me nuts...."
1,"Very comfortable, nice design, love the travel case.  The sound quality is not that great...plenty of base but not much treble and clarity."
1,Great product!!! I had mine over a year now...still work like the day I got them. Just bought another pair for my wife!!! Would definitely recommend them!!!
1,"I love these earbuds, they hold battery charge great, they have good sound quality and volume controls and they're out of the way because theres no wires leading to the device itself, it's very handy when i want to listen to music at work and it can drown out the loud equipment i'm using."
1,"I have no complaints about these headphones. For the price, probably one of the best purchases I have ever made."
0,They are very comfortable and fit snugly in my ears BUT they are skipping/connection going in and out. My phone is in my pocket as I walk the music will go in and out. I was having flashbacks of trying to walk around while listening to a portable CD player back in the day.
0,"I couldn't hate these damn things more if I tried. They are uncomfortable, difficult to get to set properly in the ear. In all fairness I can run on the treadmill without them falling out but spent a couple weeks messing with them before they didnt just fall out. They have maybe a 10 foot range with my phone, if that. So forget about leaving your phone at the back of the room with your jacket, connection will be lost quite easily. Sound quality is garbage, treble is incredibly loud over the bass. Would NOT recommend at all. I'll be trying a different set once these give up the ghost. They are (okay at best) for weight lifting and i'll continue to use them for a bit given the money spent. Honestly they are incredibly cheap feeling and sounding for the price."
1,"Have used them 4-5 times, but so far, I'm extremely impressed with ease of connectivity, comfort, sound quality.  I'd recommend these."
1,"Latest Update: I sent the company a note via their website's ""support"" tab. They replied quickly with a procedure to reset the product. It did not work. I emailed them to let them know. They sent me another pair in about 5 days. That's great customer service in my estimation. I hope this pair performs for a longer period of time.<br />______________<br /><br />First Update: After a good experience (see original review below) for 6 months, the right side has now failed. The controls still work but the volume is about 5% of the left one. Being vigilant about taking care of them is not enough; I did that and still they need to be trashed in 6 months. No longer recommended. Very disappointing.<br />______________<br /><br />Original review: I've purchased expensive (>$100) wired earphones for years, being overly concerned about sound quality. This is my first pair of Bluetooth earphones and I'm almost shocked not only at the sound quality at this price level, but how well they fit. I've gone running with them and used them at the gym for several days and find them to be excellent. On the gym floor, I'll get occasional, momentary dropouts since there are often another 30 people running Bluetooth signals all around. Except for that, these are highly recommended. Note: it too me several days to get the cord between them just right (cable management clips are included). Battery life is also impressive. So far, it's been about 7-8 hours for me. Highly recommended."
1,"Have only had for a few days but they have been awesome! Great sound quality, they came with a case and a charger. I had been using much more expensive ones until they went through the washer (oops) and decided to replace them with these (they were 1/3 the price) and I'm glad I did."
1,"Using it with an iPhone 6S Plus.<br />1. Sounds more expensive than it is;<br />2. Heavy on the bass;<br />3. Still, sounds like a cheap bluetooth phone  with Facetime calls.<br />I think this bluetooth headphones offer a very good value for their price, coming with a lightning/micro usb cable and car charger, and their sound quality is very good for their price - much better than an old LG bluetooth headphones I had."
1,"I gave these 3 stars only for the detail in packaging and accessories the earphones come with. I have not had a problem with them yet but putting them on is a bit awkward, there are no R and L markers and most importantly, the sound quality is poor for music and calls. I would have been willing to spend another $20 on better sound quality. For the money, accessories and sound quality, I rate these a 4 ( from 0-10 )"
1,"Very comfortable to wear.  Good, clear sound.  Easy to set up/link."
1,These earbuds are amazing. I can’t believe how great the sound quality is in a $30 headset. Thank you Senso!!!
1,So far these head phones are awesome. I use them when I run.  They stay put and are really comfortable. They are loud and sound quality is good. When they say they are noise canceling they are not messing around.
1,Muy rápido y muy bueno!!!<br />Súper recomendado!!!
1,They stayed on when exercising easily and the sound quality was much better than other Bluetooth headphones I have used.
1,"I tried many Bluetooth headphones before finding these. My biggest issue was having any fit in my ears without falling out. These not only fit my funny ears perfectly, but the sound quality is amazing. Very easy to use and highly recommend."
1,"I was hesitant to buy wireless headphones since all I use is apple headphones but I decided to take a chance. These surpassed my expectations and are way better than my apple headphones. I love that I can use these at the gym everyday and they do not get in the way like wired headphones do, especially when lifting weights. I love all the extra things it comes with like the carrying case, iPhone charger, car adapter, and the different sizes for the buds. Get these headphones they are amazing!"
1,"I bought these in 2017. They lasted a long time until I broke them while on my motorcycle. That was my fault. I’ve tried a few other ones since then and they don’t measure up. These are the best and such a good value! That’s why I’m back and just ordered my second pair today. Another important point. The volume on these is really good. I can have these on while riding my motorcycle and it’s better volume than having my Apple AirPod pros on. In fact, much better. Just so you know. 5 Stars."
1,"With so many real reviews and me shaking my fist at Apple for removing the headphone jack from the iPhone 7, I decided to give these Senso bluetooth ear buds a shot. Wow! They sound great and are powerful as ither reviewers have said, but use the EQ setting on your iPhone and put on Bass Boost and these things sound like $200 Beats! Know how to access your EQ? On the iPhone OS, first play any music and (while music playing) go to Settings&#62;Music&#62;EQ and choose from over 20 settings! The only bad thing about these are the silicone ear loops. They are not adjustable height and this is a bummer because the loops are almost as tall as my ear and are a flimsy...so the ear buds always need constant adjustment to feel like they are in. They would be so much better with simple plastic hard ear loops that are height adjustable. I guess a small price to pay for amazing sounding music, talk, and strong battery life. Just go for these Sensos. You'll love them if you have the ears for the loops."
1,"Amazing item. Works perfectly. Comes in very nice box and is packaged with protective case, two charging cables (why?), and a car charger adapter."
1,Best sounds ever
1,"I love having wireless headphones. However, getting these to connect to my iphone can be difficult. Sometimes, it connects fine and other times I have to go into my phone settings and disconnect and reconnect in order to get them to work. It will be connected but then play my music through the phone speakers but will pause and play through the headphone button - what the heck! It's really annoying when it disconnects when I'm driving and I can't fix it. Three stars because they are just okay and sound quality is fine. I wouldn't purchase again though. I'll look for another brand that doesn't have these connectivity issues."
1,"So far I am very pleased, great sound, great fit. I use these not only for working out but also at work and on the farm. I say so far because they are still new, as long as they last I will be a bigger fan. And reasonably priced as well"
1,Good
1,These work great! I charge them about 1x a week when I go to the gym about 5x a week. I have had no issues with them!
0,"Everything looks great and the sound and fit were fine, but day 1 at the gym and already had issues with sound cutting in and out with the phone in my pocket. Moved the phone to the other pocket (closer to the main right bud) and it got better, but still would happen.<br /><br />That is some fairly poor range/reliability. I actually think it had less to do with range then it just shorting out when a sudden movement happened which probably means wiring is poor quality.<br /><br />Returning the unit, which is really disappointing given the nice extra's they had."
1,"These are my second pair of Bluetooth headphones and I have have to these are amazing. Their comfortable, easy to use, and well put together. The only gripe I have is that it take a little to long for it to pause and unpause my music but other than that great headphones"
0,"headphones are cheap quality, charger is even more cheap quality. used the charger for a few charges and it took a poop on me already. very disappointed, but that's what you get for such a cheap price. surprisingly the headphones are still working. any way instead of spending 30$ every few months just get some well known brand and save some money in the long run."
1,"For the price great set of headphones, good sound an they do block out bout 85-90% of ambient noise"
1,"Fantastic Bluetooth headphones for the price. They are extremely comfortable. For those with smaller/bigger ears, the headphones come with 3 sets of different sized buds. Sound quality is very good for Bluetooth. You still get that slight &#34;underwater&#34; lack of clarity. These won't be audiophile approved, but they are the best I've heard for under $100."
1,These will run for an extended period of time on a single charge!  They stay in my ears and do not fall out easily.  I also use them listening to late night radio while in bed.
1,Very nice product !!!
1,Incredible quality!
1,Sound and look great!
1,"Very comfortable, easy to set up, and looking forward to my walks with the headphones."
1,I can see why these are the best selling waterproof earbuds here - all claims and reviews are correct - they are the best exercise buds I've seen. Delivery was earlier than expected - packaging and accessories excellent. I would buy again.
1,"The quality of sound was what I expected, it did come with a great charging cord and charger also, Bonus!"
1,I have beats studios and the 1st wireless sport beats. These are way better sound quality. The case is better too. I have sensory issues and these are so lightweight and comfortable i love them. Super easy to use and def waterproof because my water resistant beats have a short. These i run in and pour sweat they still are like first day i got them! I can not believe they are less than $40
0,These did not work out of the box.
1,"Best one I owned..I had the beats wireless which died because of my sweat within 6month, the pantronics from costco, same thing in 8 months...those were the cheapest and i had them for over 1 year, still working"
1,Awesome headphones!  Bought them for my husband for the gym and he rarely takes them off. Even bought another set for a Christmas gift after my cousin saw them and loved them.
1,Pretty awesome set of headphones.  If you lift weights in the gym these were basically designed for you.  They Stay secure on your head and do not interfere with any movements.  The price is right too.  Love them!
1,"Ordered 3 of them, Great earbuds, wish they get a better microphone"
0,"Second pair purchased..ugghh.. first pair are awesome.. However, the newer pair have adjust ear holds that bend.. they are terrible.. i can't get thru an excerise without them falling out.. The first pair has sturdy plastic hold ins which are great.. Sooo until they go back to original design DO NOT PURCHASE!"
1,"I bought these as a replacement to another brand that suddenly stopped charging. I am more than satisfied with the run time, stand by time, charging time, comfort, volume and controls. I would certainly recommend them to anyone. I have used these in a variety of activities and the only time they had to be adjusted slightly was while running. You won't be disappointed with these."
0,"I have had these since August.  They don't keep the best connection consistently.  Not sure if that is because I have used them between my phone and laptop.  But there is a lot of interference during phone calls, static with music, etc. The price is great but honestly, not sure if it's worth the cheap price for the quality of sound and poor connectivity"
1,"So far, I don't like the rubbers around ears; they are stiff and don;t shape around ears. However, the ear buds seem to hold the headphones in ears snugly without need for tight rubber around ears. The other thing i don't like is the sound, it is not crisp, feels too much bass coming out. The sound is disappointing but not intolerable. All control buttons work well.<br /><br />It has been a few days of usage. I will update for durability and  workout functionality after some time."
1,"Range= 5/5<br />Battery life = 5/5 (out of the box)<br />Sound quality = 3/5 (bass heavy, mids and highs are barely there, sound stage is medoicre)"
0,Terrible audio quality
0,"Did not know what to expect from these but not that I got a chance to listen to them on my iphone and my pc I am impressed! they feel comfortable and overall sound is pretty good. I can say they are close to sounding like my apple headphones. They go loud as well, also love the fact that they came in a case, extra ear buds, a usb charger and an iphone lightening cable which I was not expecting. I will be using these in the gym so I will give this review an update after noticing how well battery life is, overall comfort and quality.<br />--------------UPDATE-----------<br />50 DAYS AFTER MY PURCHASE AND THESE THINGS DONT WORK ANYMORE. What a waste of money. I only used these on an average of 5 hours a week inside the gym. I have had a $20 pair of bluetooth headphones that lasted over a year without a problem. And now I cannot even return them."
1,"They are working great. I love these headphones. When my original pair died, I did not hesitate to order another pair."
1,generly good but sound quality gets low when the charge is low.(like %40) and i cant turn this off
1,Awesome quality and great to run with
1,Use them everyday in the office since I acquired some very chatty cube neighbors.  Allows me to blissfully focus on my work while I listen to music and my neighbors blather on.
1,Love that it is blue tooth. Stay in ear and is very light. Great speakers.
0,Perfect waste of money. My toilet sounds better.
0,"Purchased 2 within 2 months, they will stop charging after a month"
1,"They connected to my phone very quickly, and during my work out didn't move a bit.  I was worried because I usually don't like the rubber ear things, but these worked great.  They do block a lot of the gym noise, which is great.  The sound is also excellent, and I am very picky about how well my soungs sound during the gym.  I haven't run with them yet but, doing the sit ups the way I do, I'm pretty confident they will be fine.  Also, comiing with different sized ear things is great to get the right fit."
0,"Work for a year, after that left side stop working"
1,"""I love this product it doesn't come out or fall they feel good i had to get my cousin some"
1,"Awesome wireless earbuds. This is my first pair of wireless earbuds. I bought a different brand for XMAS presents for my two adult children and at twice the price, but these SENSO buds had all the features and sound great! I use them everyday!!!"
1,"These are great for the price!  I use my Beats Solo 3's at the gym and wanted something comparable for my outdoor runs, but without the $300+ price tag.  These fit that bill!  They sound great and stay put!!  Would order again and again."
1,"Love these! Great fit, excellent sound."
1,The best Bluetooth headphones I've used for a long time. Perfectly made and perfectly priced. I had some 90 dollar ones that weren't as good.
0,They simply don't work well. Signal cuts in and out unless I hold the phone up to my head. I guess you get what you pay for.
1,"These headphones rock, they sound awesome and price you cannot beat that. Would totally recommend these if you are in a budget"
1,"One of the best-sounding headsets I've ever owned.  Lightweight and durable, and every bit the quality and sound of some of the more expensive brands.  Very happy I made the choice to go with these Senso Headphones.  They're PERFECT at the gym, too!"
1,Great headphones.  I have been using them a lot since I bought them.  They sound great.  My one complaint is the blue blinking light on the front.  When it is lower light it reflects into my glasses.  It is kinda annoying.
1,Not comfortable for ear
1,Gift and well received.
1,"Now I’m all for affordable nice headphones but sometimes I want to be able to use them for everything. The good: Bluetooth connects well, comfortable earbuds, good sound.<br />The bad; I can talk to folks with these headphones, when working out and a call comes in you can’t answer it so it’s a little annoying.  All in all I’m pleased so far with the purchase."
1,"Used for long distance running, lasts long."
1,Great for music and for phone calls.  If I turn them down all the way I can still hear important sounds of cars when I am walking.  When I turn them up I hear great base and new sounds in my music.
1,"so I decided to purchase this item because I watched a youtuber recommend it. However, the thing he failed to mention was that if you were a woman or someone who had relatively small ears buying this item, the rubber part that was supposed to hook on your ears would NOT fit your ears. This is quite annoying especially if you have long hair like me. The headphones will get caught up in your hair constantly because it will not properly hooked on your ear. With that being said, everything else including the sound and battery life etc are good as advertised. I highly recommend this item as a gift to men or people who have relatively larger ear structure."
1,Perfect headphones for a workout or a walk.  They stay put and you can hear perfectly!  The customer service couldn't be better!  First rate!
0,Horrible product the headphones do nothing but skip. I will be returning them today
0,It literally fell apart after a few months and before that never automatically synced to my iPhone 7. Also sound wasn’t synced to video
1,"Just what I needed. Easy to set up, fits in my small ears and very good sound."
0,"These worked great for the first 2-3 weeks. Now, just under a month of having them, they are acting up. When I turn them on, they connect to my phone right away, but the sound does not automatically transfer to the headphones. I usually have to disconnect them, reconnect, and even then sometimes it won't work so I'll do it a couple of times. This is quite obnoxious when I'm trying to get my workout started and I'm fumbling with the headphones.<br /><br />EDIT 5/9/18 - Had to downgrade to one star. The headphones just won't work properly. I am having the same problem that I wrote about previously, but it's much worse. They connect to my phone and the headphone button will play/pause the sound, but the sound still plays on the phone. Really really annoying."
1,the sound is perfect
0,"This Bluetooth headset is a joke. I bought it cause of the positive reviews but it’s a piece of plastic junk. There was a steady hiss coming from both ear pieces as I listened to music. The build quality seems very cheap. After 2 days normal and gentle use, the left ear piece split open as if they were put together with a very cheap glue or adhesive. I regret spending my money on these and was so angry and disappointed I just threw them in the garbage. I recommend you spend a little more money for a better quality Bluetooth headset."
1,These are fantastic!  Love listening to a book while my husband drives the car.  My walking companion on daily walks!
1,I bought these Best wireless Sports Earphones for my wife as a Xmas  gift she loves them she goes on a treadmill every morning these Earphones are ideal for her to talk and still have her hands on the treadmill it is also a quality product I would buy this product again I am very happy with my purchase!
1,"Excellent,Very good sound,and quality for the price. Given pairs of these as gifts also...."
1,I do not have any problems with the Bluetooth headset it has a loud enough volume to enjoy the phone conversation of music and I would recommend this to everyone to enjoy thank you
1,Sometimes it works and all of  a sudden it doesn't work. It must be the connection problem.<br />I know that it will work again a while later.
1,Used them for less than 2 months and they stopped working. Wouldn't turn on or take a charge. I contacted the company and they are sending me a replacement pair at no charge. Hopefully they last longer than the original. Giving a 5 star because their service was very good and really quick to send me a new pair.
1,Bought them for my husband and he loved them! Had purchased a diffrent pair and had to constantly be charging them. These are great!!!
1,Very satisfied although it took me a while to figure out how to operate the switches.price couldn’t be any better.
1,"My son has been using these and says they are great for the price. They have worked out for what we use them for in our workouts and not having to have a cord hooked up to our phone. The only problem I have is with the attachment that you use to hook to your ear. It is kind of big and I have to really work at trying to mold it so it stays on. Otherwise, this is a great headset."
1,These headphones are perfect!  Just what I was searching for.  They are lite weight and comfortable and has great sound.
0,The right ear bud is barely working after 3 and a half months.  The left side significantly louder. Save your money and buy elsewhere.
0,"I purchased the wireless headphone in April 2018.  The product worked well until earlier this month (May 2019), when the left side no longer played audio.<br /><br />I contacted Senso’s customer service, who instructed me to perform a factory reset.  I do so several times; however, the left side still didn’t sync or play audio.<br /><br />Senso informed me that it has been 12 months since I purchased their product, so they couldn’t provide a replacement.  I was provided a 5% (five percent) discount code for purchasing another set of Senso headphones instead, so that’s something.."
1,These headphones are comfortable and feel secure. They sound good and also work well for phone calls.
1,"I unfortunately had to return this headphone. Even though I returned it, I give it 3 stars because I want to be fair in my review.<br /><br />POSITIVES<br />- Excellent sound quality<br />- Proper fit (left ear bud) really cancelled out noise<br />- Proper fit (left ear bud) was very comfortable<br />- Easy pairing with my iPhone 6 plus<br /><br />NEGATIVES<br />- Over the ear hanger would not stay in place (I have very small ears)<br />- Improper fit (right ear bud) resulted in the earbud popping out<br />- Improper fit (right ear bud) was very uncomfortable that it caused pain<br /><br />The improper fit of right ear bud may be just my ear. The left ear bud fit perfectly that I wonder if my left ear canal is just a tad tinier. ?? I think some people, like myself, just can't wear these types of ear buds. For me, the Apple type ear buds sit nicely inside my ears -- no pain. Otherwise, if you can wear this type of ear bud, it is exceptional."
1,"Wow, what a great product.  This is a quality pair of headphones with professional packaging and plenty of accessories.  I tried the unit immediately out of the box and it worked without any fuss or hassle.  It's intuitive so I didn't need to read through the laminated instructions provided in the box.  The ear buds fit snug in my ear which is not the case with other products I've used in the past.  The tight but comfortable fit blocks out sound from around you.  It's not noise cancelling, but it definitely dampens the environmental sound.  The sound from the headphones is extraordinary for the price.<br />Usually, headphones in the price range don't fit well and are too quiet.  These fit well and are quite loud.  I find myself backing off the volume instead of wishing for an extra high setting.  The sound and the bass is as good as a pair of wired Beats that these are replacing.  Great job.<br />The headphones feel soft but durable.  We'll see how they work after a few work-outs.  They do appear to have sealed covers for the ports to enhance water proofing.<br />The range is good.  I can walk across the room without any distortion, loss, or quality issues.<br />Skip the Beats and try SENSO.<br />I highly recommend considering these headphones."
1,I love it!!
1,Good sound quality and works great when working outside.
1,"The quality of sound that comes through is pretty good but unfortunately the way the ear buds are designed, they keep coming out of my ears which gets frustrating."
0,"I bought these six months ago, they use to work great, but now the battery life only lasts 15 min max. Such a disappointment. I will check the warranty on this and try and contact...doubt i will get anywhere, will see..."
1,These are great for their price range. The charge lasts for a good amount of time. I like them! Great for the gym. They stay on while running too!
0,Stopped working in a couple of dsys
1,"These are now my go-to Bluetooth earbuds.  Small, lightweight, and no annoying battery/control setup on the court itself; everything is contained in the ear buds themselves so the cord doesn't tug or otherwise bother you.  Battery life lasts all day so I'm happy rhere as well."
1,"Purchased these SENSO Bluetooth Headphones on a tremendously discounted flash sale and frankly wondered whether this price cut was due to excess inventory, inferior quality, or some form of product recall. To the contrary, these SENSO headphones are among the best of five different brands that two of my family members (one a nationally renowned fitness athlete and Krav Maga instructor, the other a female triathlete and physician who needs serenity when transcribing medical records) and myself have worn in rugged environments and almost daily use during the past two year. The other products included good-to-top-of-the-line offerings from Bluephonics, TaoTronics, Phaiser, and another manufacturer. Only the superior sound, better battery life, and overall quality of Tsumbay's product (Wireless Headphone Active Noise Canceling Bluetooth Headphones, Sports Sweatproof Earphone with Mic APT-X HiFi Stereo Sound 8 Hours Battery Life for Cycling Jogging Gym) was in the same league. Albeit at a much higher price point. The SENSO pairs easily, is comfortable and almost too secure with rapid movements and gyrations. It appears immune to heavy sweating and light rainfall (I would not test this or any water resistant/waterproof headset in the shower or a torrential downpour, but imagine it might just keep on playing.) Several of the other headphones mentioned either crapped out after 30-60 days of use or did not stay in position when transitioning from running-to-biking-to-rowing type environments. The packaging and charging accessories SENSO features are terrific. Beyond anything else, however, the 24/7 LIVE Support provided was phenomenal. I had a question about the capability of connecting two devices at once (iPhone, iPad in my case) and Customer Service picked up on the first ring--on a weekend, no less. The rep (Nideen?) was professional, knowledgeable and courteous. And responded without hesitation to my question and a potential work around. The one year, hassle free warranty is also a plus. One note about the box of goodies and accessory chargers. The short charging cable accommodates the iPhone 7/7+, whereas the 3 Foot elegant charging cable facilitates all other charging connection hardware (iPhone/iOS, Android, MP3, etc.)."
0,"They were ok.<br />Cable is too long and annoying but otherwise they were comfortable while working or running. They however were not comfortable for everyday use which was disappointing.  I would wear them on flights or trains and found that they pinched my ears and the buds restricted my inner ear from getting any ventilation. Sound quality was ok, but I'm by no mean an expert. I just want to hear music.<br /><br />The biggest disappointment however was that it took forever to connect to my iPhone or iPad. Now it won't even connect at all.  It lasted basically 6 month. Not sure why it won't connect when it use to. Maybe iPhone updates. But it's still useless to me now. I'll be looking somewhere else for my music."
1,"Wow! What a great buy. They really did these headphones right. The noise cancellation is spot on, the quality of the sound is great. Once paired it will instantly pair again with your phone after turning it off and back on again. I love that the cable cord is a dual one that is both compatible with the head phones and my eye phone. Absolutely recommend these. I was blown away at the quality of these given the price I paid."
0,They are large in size and are heavier than expected
0,The sound quality is very good. But that’s the only positive thing about this item. The loops that wrap around your ears are way too big and don’t stay on. And the plastic buttons on the headset are so lose that you hear them clicking as your running. It is very annoying. I am very disappointed with this product.
1,"They were ok, had to talk to loud to be heard on the other end, I mumble so not use to having to talk so loudly."
1,"First review ever!!!  But this product deserves props.<br /><br />Just returned my $170.00 Jaybird Runs for these.  The Jaybirds were a real pain to pair.  They dropped out constantly.  The sound was good and the app that could be installed was good..... But ultimately the basics just fell way short.<br /><br />These are probably the deal of the century.  Beautiful packaging, clear instructions, 24 hr customer service.  CHEAP!!!<br /><br />Inside the box:<br /><br />Wireless Headphones<br /><br />Charging Cord<br /><br />Ear Tips 3 Pairs- small, medium, and large (the ones that came installed fit me perfectly, no slippage)<br /><br />Dual Port Car Charger<br /><br />Nice Case<br /><br />Pairing was easy (Google Pixel 2). The sound is good.  The volume can blow out your ear drums.  The controls are easy to use.  They also are noise canceling.  Phone calls are easy to answer and end.<br /><br />These could be sold for much more.  If you need wireless headphones buy these!!!!!"
0,I bought this headphones for my jogging and daily commute on the train. Sound quality is not great but good enough as I mostly listen to podcasts. The fit is secured enough to my ears while working out. My biggest complaint is the battery life. Not even close to the 8 hr. listen time and 240 hr. stand by time. I got 1/3 of the time claimed.<br /><br />Update: Battery failed after less than a month. I returned the item.
1,"Literally the best ear buds I've owned. I generally have trouble keeping silicone buds in my ear, but the foam buds don't budge. No more adjustments!"
1,Great service. I bought these as a gift and they are a great product!
1,"The Senso earbuds are great! The Bluetooth capability is fantastic and is easy-to-use. The noise-canceling ability is decent, but when running, you can hear the wind along with the music. They also stay in the ear while running, which is terrific. All in all, I think this product is definitely worth it."
1,Great quality sound but a little clunky and big
1,My Fiancee purchased these for his self to use at the gym. Apparently they are pretty amazing. They come with a little carrying case so they don't get lost. He loves them. No complaints. He's happy
1,"Charges holds as advertised.  I have run 3 miles a day since receiving these. Loses bluetooth connection when wearing armband on left arm. Had to move armband to right arm so they would not lose bluetooth connection with phone. Tried all sizes of ear buds provided (3). Right side sometimes comes out of ear. To be fair, most headphones using the simple ear buds have trouble staying in my right ear.  Sound output quality is middle of the road. Not show stopping, but OK for me while I run. Over the ear loops are very flexible. Almost too flexible for my taste, but I am just one person."
1,These were exactly what I was looking for but didn't have a lot of money to spend! The quality is excellent! More than I expected! I bought 2 pairs for myself and my husband but I know where to go when my kids need some!
1,Works well.
1,I do like these headphones.  My only issue is my ear bud does not stay in my right ear. I have to smallest bud coushion that fits my ear so I really don't know why it doesn't<br /> Stay in.
1,I had a $200 pair of Beats before these. I ordered these by Senso based on the reviews here. They are fantastic. Better than Beats by a mile. You won't go wrong with them.
1,Received these guys and plugged them in to get a full charge. The headed straight to the gym. Pairing was easy. Sound quality is the best I've had so far with blue tooth headphones. It seems like customer service is every active with checking up on there product (very good thing) I hope they last a long time.
0,Garage. These don't keep a charge. I'm about to go for a run after charging ALL night at battery is low. I know from yesterday's experience that this means a voice will interrupt my music every few minutes to tell me the battery is low. Then they will die. So disappointing. Also very large for a women's ears.
0,Horrible
1,Headphone is great for the price you pay. Do note that the left ear side of the headphone will malfunction after half year of usuage but seller give a easy free replacement as long as you are wishing 1 year warranty
1,I gave this to my mother for listening to sermons and phone calls while walking. She likes them as they fit comfortably and work well. They have good sound output and the mic sounds great when I have talked with her. She is happy with them. My only complaint is that it comes with a car charger instead of a wall charger. Good thing she already has a compatible micro USB charger.
1,"For the money, you can't go wrong. I've been through 4 pairs of Beats. These bad boys soak up a lot of sweat on a daily basis and keep on producing good sound. I'm not a huge fan of the flappy ear hooks, but they do stay on just fine during workouts."
1,the sound is good and the Bluetooth connection is so fast.There are two things i wish this thing has<br />1- mike to talk<br />2-if it gives a heads up when the battery goes down
0,"Lasted a few months past the end of the warranty period. Then the volume buttons, which are also used for pairing, stopped working. Now completely useless and worthless."
1,"Great product. Easy to set up and good battery life. The case makes it convenient to throw in a gym bag or work tote and includes a compartment for the charging cable. This is my third pair. Now I have one to keep at office, one for the gym, and one for my husband."
1,"despite being so cheap thing works perfect, sound quality isnt all that but brings car charger, usb cable and more"
1,Neat headphones!  Comfortable to wear for hours.
1,Amazing sound quality. Great product
1,Great sound very comfortable
1,"I love these earphones and highly recommend them for anyone -- I use them while working out, cleaning the house, and walking around town.<br /><br />PROS: Great fit (comes with multiple different ear pieces so you can pick whichever suits you); surprisingly great noise cancelling; fits securely; appears to be waterproof? (I don't soak it in water or run in the rain, but it works despite my sweat?); great battery life; good Bluetooth connectivity<br /><br />CONS: The cover for the USB charger can sometimes be a pain to pull off"
0,"I lose connectivity when the phone is only in my pocket. They also don't stay on my ears well while jogging or hiking, which was the main purpose I bought them. Very weak bass and poor frequencies."
0,"Loved the look and fit of these, but when I tried listening to hip-hop...the bass was by far the worst I've ever experienced in earbuds.  I tried multiple artists, multiple albums, played around with the volume control and equalizer within my iPhone, couldn't get anything but fuzzy, blown out bass sounds but without the low end.  I then played it through my sound bar and was like, oh yeah that's what bass is supposed to sound like.  Then tried through my laptop speakers and it was significantly better than these too.  These are just awful for bass tones, unlistenable.  I'll keep searching for a good pair of bluetooth buds."
1,Pretty impressed so far ....<br />these are the first blue tooth head phones I have owned. They sound great easy to use and they are comfortable.
1,It stopped working all of a sudden after 6 months of successful usage. It was working great initially. I was expecting it to work for at least more than 6 months.
0,"From day one they sounded like I was listening to a skipping CD. I sent them back today, super disappointed. I have friends that bought these and theirs work great but unfortunately mine did not. However, I did like how they fit and sounded when they weren't skipping and cutting out."
1,"After reading many of the raving reviews on here, I decided to give these a try. However, I am now returning them.<br /><br />Reasons for the return:<br />1. I've had them for a little over two weeks and have already had issues connecting them to my devices. In the first few days, the headphones connected quickly to a computer, iPad, and phone. Then, after about a week, there were periods of time when I was unable to connect the headphones to my phone. I would reattempt the connection, turn the headphones on and off again, turn my phone's bluetooth on and off again, but I continued to receive an error message. My Fitbit, however, had no issue connecting to my phone during this time. I decided to give the headphones the benefit of the doubt. This issue, unfortunately, continued periodically over the last two weeks with both my phone and my computer.<br /><br />2. I found the sizing of the ear hooks to be a bit big for my ears, causing them to fall off during my runs.<br /><br />3. The microphone quality seems to be poor. When I have answered phone calls using these headphones, I have been told that I sound very distant and that all of the background sounds are amplified.<br /><br />I have still given these headphones 3 stars because it seems like my experience is not a common one among the reviewers. Also, though I am not an audiophile, I did really enjoy the sound quality with these headphones. Finally, they also come with a decent number of useful accessories."
0,They have stop working. There is no power and no lights come on. I have tried charging them with numerous cables with no success. Apparently I can no longer take them back so I am left with some nice looking headphones for a desk weight.
0,not good
1,Great set of ear buds.  They are noise cancelling and the sound quality is fabulous.  A comfortable fit and will some in handy at the gym!
1,They are way better than the other ones! they don't bark in your ears like some others do and they hold an amazing charge! I uses them all day at work and only recharge them over night at work plugged in to my computer! Great fit and plenty loud!
1,The headphones has a great quality sound but the system to place them around your ears is not the best. It doesn't stay in place. Battery last a long time.
0,Arrived broken- piece of plastic that loops over your ear was not properly aligned
0,"Ok, so I've tried to love these...and I do; partially.  The headphones drop signal very easily.  I can have my phone in a holster on my arm, in my pocket, or strapped to my chest and if you turn your head, jog to hard or your shirt covers the phone, it will make the music/connection very choppy.  I find myself turning off the head phones, and just blaring music through the phone speaker.  It is a definite headache, while working out, or doing outdoor work."
1,"Perfect for running. I have small ears and they stay put, they get very loud if that's what you like, I never hear static (I connect to my phone worn on my arm with a band), and great price. Look no further."
1,"Initially a little uncomfortable in the ear but they feel great now. I'm no expert but the sound is great, clean across high, mid and low. The over ear hook doesn't seem to do much, at least for my ears."
1,Nice products
1,"I love my ActivBuds S-250... it has a solid and incredible sound... and i registered my one year warranty, i recommend it... very good product!!!"
1,great headphones
1,Great product! Sounds really good and easy to use
0,These started off great. It has been 8 months and they are dropping the sound on the left ear with only a slight movement. It seems as though the wiring is disconnecting.
1,These were a gift to my son he loves them this is his second pair. 1 st pair was lost so had to reorder the same one
1,"I bought this product because had 4.5 stars with over 11,000 reviews. I'm very yahoo with my purchase. These headphones are well designed, comfortable, sound great and priced right. What more could you ask for? They even have a mic so you can take phone calls!"
1,"I imagine for the price these are fine. Maybe I'm spoiled because my previous set of Bluetooth headphones were Jaybirds (that I accidentally left at the hotel in Brazil).  Oops!<br />These just were not as comfortable and the sound quality was inferior. Again, if you're shopping for price these are fine."
1,"For the price, they are very nice.  There are things about them that feel a bit cheaper than a very expensive brand name set like the connection sounds and pairing process.  It's not harder and functions just as well... it just doesn't have quite as polished of a feel."
1,Very satisfied with these. I've owned beats wireless headphones and overall.. I'm acually happier with the Senso brand (over $100 less too)
0,"When I started hunting for headphones I needed something cheap to use while running as well as watching movies without disturbing my dormmates. These headphones not only surprised my, but blew me away. They originally caught my eye because of all the reviews, but there's so much more to be excited about!<br /><br />1) The came super fast, but I don't know if that's just because of prime, but always an upside, I got to use them less than 12 hours after I ordered them.<br /><br />2) the packaging was nice. It came in a professional box that boasted quality. It was actually so nice I'm not sure I want to throw it away quite yet.<br /><br />3) Upon opening I was happy to find the case, an Android/iPhone cord (i know! Awesome! It can charge both!!), and a car charger! All seem pretty nice, but WAY nicer than what I was expecting. The case is small, and holds the headphones and their charger well. (it could probably fit the phone charger too)<br /><br />4) the headphones are good for the price, not even taking into account all the goodies. After receiving it I was just itching to write a review! What a pleasant surprise!<br /><br />**********EDIT**********<br />Whelp. As much as I didn't want it to be true, all the 1 star reviews ended up being right. Even thought they look perfect, the started to fail. First, the reception on the ear buds got worse. I started to notice it when I would leave my phone on the dresser and pay in bed listening to something; it would start to break up if my body was between the phone and the right earbud. I didn't think much of it at first, I'm pretty easy going after all. However, it got worse and worse until I couldn't even leave the phone in my pocket because it would start to break up. Now I can't get it to play music without my phone being less than a couple feet away and with nothing in between. Just when I thought it couldn't get any worse, the left earbud gave out, refusing to even squeak any sound.<br /><br />Basically, if you're reviewing the reviews for these headphones just know that the one star reviews are true. They work for a couple months then they just stop working completely."
0,"Glad I got these on sale for under $40! I'd be quite upset if I spent $170 on these.<br />Pros: Comfy, the over ear piece is very flexible and fits with my Oakley FlackJackets, they feel solid, earbud fits very well. Great for $37!<br />Cons: very poor quality sound. Like KOSS ($10 dollar gas station earbuds) bad! Foggy sounding with ambience built in to the EQ apparently. I expected something more HiFi at the $170 price point. These don't come close to the Apple headphones that came with my phone, or my Sony earbuds I use for exercise.<br />I would only recommend these to people that aren't audiophiles and are looking for a cheap set of bluetooth earphones.<br />I gave them 3 stars based on the sale price and comfort. If I paid full price these would be screaming at 1 star!<br /><br />Update: Gave it 3 stars due to comfort and feel. Now after just a few hours of listening I have to drop to 2 stars. The signal cuts out continuously and I am not even moving. I am sitting at my desk with my phone less than 2 feet away. We will see how they perform during exercise, maybe getting away from my wireless mouse and keyboard will help the signal. I am going to give them the benefit of the doubt, but I did read other reviews that said the same thing about cutting out....<br /><br />Another Update: did multiple factory resets, quit cutting out so much... until I put my phone in my pocket and they cut out completely. Going back, simply can't use even with poor sound quality."
0,Well these broke the moment I tried them on... so who knows how the sound quality is
1,Easy connection and easy operation. I work maintenance and these stay in all day without needing adjustments at any angle. Noise cancelling isn't fantastic but I don't insert these compleatly like many earbuds. Seem to be comfortable enough for all day use and work with my safety glasses.
0,Left earphone stopped working right at the1 year mark.. customer service was not helpful.
1,Wow this really is great value for money.The audio clarity is great with my Samsung S7 spotify listening and the connection inferface responsiviness is pretty good.The carry case and  charging wire are very handy.Love it.
1,Perfect choice
1,It was a solid product while it lasted. One speaker died (goes in and out) at about a year though.
0,These resemble the very popular Beats headphones in style and looks. They even sound pretty decent. The problem comes when you try and use them for any kind of activity. I went for a run and couldn't even keep my phone in my pocket because the connection would keep cutting in and out. I had to hold my phone which is a Galaxy Note 5 up by my head just to keep the sound from cutting out. I tested it inside my house and I could leave my phone in one place and walk almost all over my house without it cutting out. But I guess the bouncing up and down from running or something causes the connection to be bad. Pretty disappointed overall. I would recommend these for just casual use but not for working out of any kind
1,Excellent!
1,"Great sound, and awesome bass. Stays locked on to my ears despite heavy running and movement. Excellent A++++ support team. Fast response and replaced my defective unit within 3 days. Now that is service."
1,Awesome sound and work perfectly! Great purchase and came with great accessories too.
1,"Please note this. I purchased and reviewed these. Like many, I wonder how reliable is the label of sweat proof, waterproof, water resistant on items. I have used sweat proof ear phones that shorted out in a fog. Watches that died in a heavy sweat. Where these exceed the label in my opinion. I used, charged and placed these earphones in their container. Somehow container and contents ended up in dirty clothes. Were washed in front loading  machine on regular with extra rinse. I checked them and USB cover was still in place. I placed them on counter to air dry for a few hours. Charge was still present and I used them for a few hours. Now three days and 18 hours of use later they still work perfectly. Most comfortable sweatproof earphones I've tried. I have a problem with ear buds because they don't stay in place. Earphones that stay on with pressure leave sores in my ears. I don't like to use headphone style outside because they block too much surrounding noise. I kept looking for something that would work. I saw these and decided to give them a try. I love the way they clip around ear. There is no heavy pressure on my ears. The sound is excellent. I only need 30-40% sound. That's good even with a lot of surrounding noise. I can easily keep one bud out of ear to keep aware of surrounding noise when walking outside. They did run easily for nearly 9 hours. I had no trouble connecting to kindle fire 3rd and 8 generation as well as 4 year old iPod touch, and new iPod touch. I haven't used it with LG phone only connected it. I am rating this a 4 because I need to check durability."
1,"These fit great, have excellent sound, and come with a lot of extras.  I appreciated the extra buds to find one that fit my ears well.  I find that one charge lasts for two 45-minute runs.  I highly recommend this product."
1,The product just kept disconnecting and the sound went static after a few months.
1,"Easy to use, good fit. I used them a couple times while biking to work, with my phone in my backpack. So far great headphones!"
0,"Bought a pair for myself and my wife. Worked very well at first but they both started cycles of connecting / disconnecting. We both keep our phones on our person, depending on the way you move they will loose connection every few seconds. Sometimes if you power off / on it will work normally but it has become such a hassle they are now in the trash. Sad because I really liked them when I first started using them. Would not recommend them at all."
1,"My son bought this headphone because he thought he could take a shower with it. well, he likes everything about it, but the customer service advised him not to shower with it! So he had to buy another one. :("
1,VERY HAPPY WITH PRODUCT
1,A quality product with good sound. Needs better instructions on charging and changing earpieces
1,"I can definitely see the good reviews! The volume on these is insane on my native Apple Music, it’s great on YouTube also. Build quality looks like a pair costing 2 or 3 times this price. Will definitely update as I use more, so far extremely impressed."
1,"I bought these in September of last year. I wear them everyday, I've really enjoyed them. the right side started shorting out, so I sent the manufacturer an email, and after a couple of informational emails they sent me a new pair. I'm glad that the warranty is so good. this was the first set of Bluetooth earbuds and I've been really pleased."
1,"They are okay, they don't stay in that well when I'm boxing or running, and the sound quality is just okay. Honestly I started using the JBL wired earbuds that came with my phone because the sound quality is so much better. They actually stay in better too."
1,"Wow, this is a really good pair of wireless earphones for the price.<br />Good sound and easy to connect.<br />The only thing that I don’t like is that the main button clicks really loud. I simply don’t use it."
1,These are great earbuds with exceptional sound. I look forward to using them on our upcoming flight and cruise.
1,Great noise cancelling ability and sound quality. Easily connects to my phone and I prefer these over my Apple AirPods for working out. Highly recommend.
1,I needed some Bluetooth earphones and these were a good choice. I have not had problems with them and I like the design and look of them. They connect fine with my laptop and phone.
1,Item arrived promptly and as described
1,"The  best headphones that I have amazing like wow 😱😱🥰🥰These were a lot better than I was expecting Battery is good right out the box it will last 9 hours, also included Cary case ,short charging cable ,cellphone card wallet ,and cellphone car mount . easy to pair, just turned them on and found them in the bluetooth settings.<br />Fit pretty well Easy controls, they are located in the right headphone.<br />And also calls are very clear people can hear me so good.<br />MUST HUY THIS IS GOOD COMPANY HAPPY CUSTOMER 💋"
1,Great earbuds so far. I just ran today with them without any problems.
1,Great
1,So far they are working better that expected
0,"I chose this product to replace the one I had purchased two years ago that served me well until I closed my car door on it. I replaced it with the same model however upon receiving the newer version, it did not voice dial. I thought that was poor marketing. They were both the same S250 model. I have since then sent it back for a refund and bought a more advanced model."
1,These headphones offer great sound at a very reasonable price.  They stay in place well and connect seamlessly to my iPhone.  I would highly recommend this product!
1,"Easy to use - connected instantly to my phone's bluetooth.  Sound quality was pretty clear and they fit comfortable.  My previous bluetooth headphones only lasted about 6 months before they died out, so I'm hoping these last longer."
0,"These don't stay in my left ear, even with the smallest ear piece. I've tried every angle and cannot get them to stay in."
1,I'm very satisfied with this product. High quality from packaging to the items itself. I'll recommend to friends
1,Purchased for a friend great for work or play excellent product
1,These things are pretty amazing!!! And for the money you can’t beat them.. I bought 2 pairs just to have a spare that’s how much I like them.
1,"I bought these for my family as our first Bluetooth headphones. Every one of us is very pleased with them. From the sound to the range to the fit, it's all good."
1,"My Beats headphones failed and I didn't want to spend $140. I chose these based on price and especially the reviews. They have been fantastic! Some people said it had to much base but I don't find that to be the case. The sound is wonderful, the battery life is great, and they come with multiple earbud replacements and sizes.  Overall I'm thrilled with my purchase!"
0,Head set is cool but none of the charging accessories work 😟
0,These died on me after about 1.5 months and with minimal use.  I was optimistic about the Amazon reviews but in the end they were just another cheap chinese product with a short shelf life.  :(  They also don't stay in your ear very well.  The sound is meh with minimal base.  The battery lasts about as long as it says it does.
1,"Bought two of these.<br /><br />One for my guy, his review: Awesome. Works great even when working out. Loves that they came with accessories for charging in the car.  The cord could be a bit shorter or longer that connects them. His shirt seems to catch it and it tugs on the ear pieces. Otherwise, no complaints.<br /><br />One for my morning babysitter, his review: Perfect. Sound great. Loves them. Perfect for working out."
1,Love these. They connected right away with my Samsung MP3. Love these.
1,Fantastic!
1,They worked perfect while doing things outside
1,"nice headphones, good price"
1,"I bought these for my dedicated running headphones, and they work well for that purpose.  Even to my uncritical ear, the sound range is a bit empty but they are powerful.  The lowest volume setting can be too loud under some circumstances.  They fit fairly well for my slightly small ears, feel lighter than they are, and stay put under moderate exercise.  Pairing etc. was no trouble with my Galaxy S10.<br /><br />Update:  Six months later headphones will inexplicably not turn on.  They show a blue charged light and beep in response to ""on"" button press when plugged in but do not make any noise/connect when not plugged in.  Happened day after run in the rain so water might have been an issue.  Honestly, par for the course for me."
1,Good but need to stay within 5 ft for optimum performance.
1,This is a great gift for my friend. Exactly what she wanted!
0,"8/2018<br />Update - a replacement pair was sent and it worked great... for a few months. Now, the new pair will not hold a charge beyond 1.5 hours...<br /><br />Although the sound, fit, and use are great... it has stopped connecting to my phone. I've had use another bluetooth headphone."
1,"Slips off my ears when running, but it’s a good product. I use it daily. it’s a good product. I use it daily."
1,"I love these headphones! For the gym, they are perfect for the price and sound and quality are great!"
1,They are wonderful
1,They were actually for my wife she loves them
1,Excellent product. The sound is a little heavy with the bass but well worth the money. They don't move much while running and the battery life is at least 6hrs. I would recommend
1,Excellent product i love them
1,"So far they work great, came with additional accessories than just the headphones. Haven't been able to try them with running yet so that will be the true test."
1,"They pair just fine with my iPhone and the sound is fine. The controls are easy to use. But they are going back because I cannot get them to stay on. I have very small ears and though the earbuds fit fine, the ear piece is too large for me and they are a struggle to keep on. Because comfort was my biggest issue they don’t work well for me at all."
1,Work great Bluetooth connection to laptop and ipad was simple. . just trying all the different earbuds to see which works best
0,Intermittently would disconnect. About 3 months after purchasing the ear buds would lose connection with my phone randomly in the middle of runs. I tried making sure it had a full charge. I made sure they were being properly cleaned. I reset their WiFi connection. Still would randomly disconnect. It didn’t happen with every use but probably 7 or 8 times out of 12 uses. Length of time into the run varied as well.<br /><br />Ear buds themselves had to be twisted n twisted again to get them to be comfortable and stay in place. Cord was long behind the neck.<br /><br />Would not recommend
1,I charged them once when I first received them and I've not charged them since so the batteries are quite impressive. Further they have excellent sound and so far have proven to be fairly durable. The microphone for making calls is somewhat weak but at headphones they excel. Would absolutely suggest them.<br /><br />(I am using them with a Motorola Moto G 3rd Gen android phone)
1,"Purchased this item just for temporary use but upon receiving and use of the item the sound quality, durabilit, and design of the item amazed me. I guess this is no longer a temporary item. I highly recommend the Senso Bluetooth headphones for every runner that doesn't want to spend so much. Let's face it! It costs too much to enjoy running."
1,Good quality
1,Bought these and a different brand of Bluetooth wireless earphones called “let’s fit”. About the same price each. There were mixed reviews for both. But I for sure love this brand. You just have to adjust the sound through your phone for your liking. You can adjust the over the ear piece as well which I like about this brand. And they’re comfortable. They’re a little heavy for my liking. But over all sound and style I love them. And they charge super fast and they stay charged. Very nice.
1,"I ordered my headphones in January and love using them to workout.  Unfortunately, a few days ago when I was working out they randomly turned off and won't turn back on.  I contacted the customer service number and they were very responsive.  They instructed me to ""reset"" them but it wasn't working.  They then offered to send me another pair free of charge.  It was really nice of them and I am glad that I can continue to use these headphones."
1,"I haven't had them long, but so far I'm happy. They are light, fit my ears good, and have a good sound."
1,"They came right on time .light weight as advertised.  They are not for noise reduction with would be a nice touch. But for the cost, you get more than you bought. One other item to note is the speaker in the headset, I have been told it is clear and easy to understand. thanks"
0,"Just bought a bunch of varied earphones. Some for myself and for Christmas gifts. I actually got one of these for myself encouraged by the reviews. The good side, nice packaging: the cables look durable and not prone to tangling unlike others that are flimsy. All the accessories that come along are impressive. Now the sad part, the sound was disappointing. I don't know if I got a defective unit, but the sound was far from good. It was just so thick that there was hardly any clarity. I can't help but compare to other earphones I bought which I tested as well. I listened to various genres of music and I like testing with some selections that have fine subtle instruments in the background. The others I tried would reveal the subtle instruments crystal clear in the background, but this one didn't. The higher frequency sounds were a bit towards a muffled sound. It's like all the sound, mostly lower frequencies, were compressed into a small space, unlike others wherein there was a sense of space between instruments. Sad because this looked like the most impressive and sturdiest earphone I got but it had the least desirable sound."
1,Great Headphones and sound quality.
1,The headphones are great. Easy to setup and work really well. The sound quality is pretty good... The only reason I am not able to give these five stars is because I purchased these specifically to listen to music while I run but they keep falling out of my ears when I use them while running.
1,"Works great, love these ear buds!"
1,they arrived on time and work very well.
1,Good product overall. GREAT customer service. Would buy again for casual - intense workout purposes.
1,Had some problems with the headphones staying charged for very long. After about 2 months they died on me.  I contacted Senso and they mailed me new ones within a couple of days. Great customer service support. Headphones work great now.
1,Mu husband loves them.. Plays music with the best quality
1,So far they are pretty good. Good sound quality and loudness.. only complaint is that even though the ear loops hold well they are still pretty flimsy.
1,"Got these for my husband who has had several.  He loves them.  I tried them because I've never found ear buds comfortable but these are wonderful! Our puppy ate his yesterday and the new set is coming today!  I'll have to wait, but going to get some for myself to replace the big ones I use traveling."
1,"I have small ears so the straps around the ears are pointless. However, they stay in my ear when I do my workouts."
1,"The sound from the right ear piece of my LG Tone Pro HBS-750's - which I LOVE - became almost inaudible recently, just a month past the warranty end date. I read LOTS of reviews of different wireless earbuds, and I finally decided to try these SENSO's, even though I'd never heard of this brand. Why? With 80% of 20,000+ reviewers giving 4 or 5 stars, & an under-$40 price, I figured I HAD to give these a try.<br />These SENSO's made a great first impression, starting with the excellently designed packaging. The box is very sturdy, and has just the right amount of graphics & pics on it; all the product info you need is on one of the 6 surfaces, with no gaudy advertising or other visual distractIons. It's also nicely compact, having just enough room for the headphones, accessories, User Guide & Product Support card - the perfect size for storing the extra ear tips (three sizes are included), the VERY nice charging cable & a dual port car charger that are included extras, & just keeping everything SENSO together. It's the best designed packaging of any electronics device or accessory I've ever owned.<br />I wasn't sure how I'd like the over-the-ear piece that holds these earbuds in place. But I've had the &#34;naked&#34; earbuds that are supposed to fit so well they'll miraculously stay in your ear no matter what you're doing - and they DON'T (another reason I thought I'd give these earbuds a try). I haven't found the ear loops themselves uncomfortable, or too loose or tight; but they do compete with the arms of my glasses where they both sit on top of my ear, and I find myself often adjusting one or the other to make them both &#34;sit right&#34;. Also, the angle of the opening to my ear canal is different in each ear; and since this angle is not adjustable on these earphones, I sometimes have difficulty getting them seated correctly so that I get them seated correctly. When I manage to get that angle exactly right, the noise cancellation is excellent; it's just not something I can achieve all the time.<br />I find the sound, & especially the volume, that comes from these little babies to be excellent. I've never worn expensive, big name earbuds, so I can't comment on how these SENSO's compare to those; but I am perfectly happy with what I hear coming from them. I thought my LG's had good sound quality, but these SENSO's deliver better sound quality: it's clearer, the bass is much better but not too much, and the volume is a LOT better.<br />These SENSO's do have several design features I like better than my LG's. One is their size & the connecting cable; having no plastic neckpiece is a definite plus. The cable connecting the earbuds is thin and flat - about 4mm wide - and it feels more substantial than the tiny round cables on the LG's. The supplied charging cable is one of the nicest I've ever seen. It also is flat and flexible - taking up less room when folded up - and it has SNUGLY FITTING, oval shaped covers on both the USB and the &#34;other end&#34;. The &#34;other end&#34; is another piece of great design, with both a micro-USB AND a lightning connector in one tip. The micro-USB fits into the bottom end of the lightning tip, but can be pulled out when needed - no extra cap or second tip to mess with. I've only seen this design one other time, and it wasn't as well done as this one is. The supplied case is well made, classy looking, and compact - about the size of a good thick donut - and has an interior mesh half-pocket on one side. It easily holds the earbuds, that very nice charging cable, and some extra ear tips if you like/need to carry more than one size. I've even gotten the car charger in there as well, although that gets a bit tight.<br />Several things keep these earbuds from completely replacing my LG's. One is the lack of adjustability of the angle of the earbuds (given that I have narrow and oddly shaped ear canals, that's a problem with earbuds for me). Another is the shorter battery life. I've tried timing how long these will go on a charge, but I'm still not sure how long they actually do go - maybe 8 hrs., maybe not. They DON'T last a full day for me, whereas my LG's seemed to go forever on a charge - multiple days for sure. I also don't like that the battery status isn't announced when these are turned on, OR that when the &#34;low battery&#34; warning sounds, it's basically a &#34;dead battery&#34; warning. There's not much more than 2-3 minutes playing time left when that warning sounds, and that's definitely the feature of these SENSO's I like least. When the LG's are turned on, &#34;Battery High (Medium) (Low)&#34; is announced, a feature that I love and find very useful. Finally, these earbuds have a multi-second delay in completing the Bluetooth connection. Even though &#34;Connected&#34; is announced when they are supposedly paired, it can be five+ seconds before I actually hear the sound through these earbuds vs. the device.<br />All in all, this is a very nice set, and a fantastic value for the price. It's a keeper, but I've decided I AM going to get another LG headset as well. The battery life of the LG's can't be beat, and the battery status announcements are a &#34;must have&#34; for me - as well as the ability to adjust the angle of the earbuds where they fit into my ear, and to not have the over-the-ear clip always competing with my glasses for that tiny space. But if you don't have the same fairly minor complaints I do, I highly recommend these SENSO's for anyone who wants great sound and great features at a fantastic price.<br /><br />Addendum 9/15/17: I began experiencing several intermittent problems with these earbuds about 2-3 weeks after I started using them: they would sometimes not pair even though the &#34;Connected&#34; status had been announced, sometimes not Skip or Go Back one track when that button was pushed, & held a charge for less & less time. I did a &#34;Factory Reset&#34; as instructed in the User Guide a couple of times. At about the six weeks point, they suddenly stopped charging fully; no matter how long I charged them, they would only charge about half way. I figured the earbuds were defective, and called SENSO's 24/7 Live Support. My excellent experience with their Customer Service sealed the SENSO deal for me. The rep I spoke to was VERY professional and efficient in handling my call. He first asked what problems I was having, then tried troubleshooting with a couple of questions (Was I trying to pair with more than one device? &#34;No.&#34; A factory reset needs to be tried. &#34;I've done that twice.&#34;) He apologized more than once for the inconvenience I was having, and with NO hesitation whatsoever immediately began asking for the info he needed - Amazon order #, name/address/etc. - to send me a replacement set. I had checked on the SENSO website, & asked if it was possible for me to pay the extra $$ and get the next better pair of SENSO's instead of a replacement for the ones I had. Although that wasn't an option, he immediately offered an alternative: &#34;What I can do is offer you a 15% discount....&#34; if I wanted to purchase a different set. He was able to answer all the questions I had about the differences between my earbuds and two other sets, and waited patiently while I viewed the currently available sets on Amazon (the set I wanted had recently been discontinued). In the end I elected just to have a replacement set sent to me. In my experience Customer Service DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER than this!! I highly recommended these earbuds before any troubles developed, but after this experience I'll probably be a SENSO customer for life. I just wish they had a broader product line so I could give them more of my business! Kudos to a great company with great products!!"
1,"I've had this headset for almost a year now, which I believe makes it the longest-lasting headset I've had. The battery lasts well. If I listen to music constantly I get 6+ hours between charges; more normal intermittent use only requires a daily charge.<br /><br />They seem very robust. Much more so than various LGs and Plantronics I've had, with audio quality as good as any. The range is better than any other headset I've owned.<br /><br />After pairing with several different devices (separately) the audio developed a stutter. I followed the instructions in one of the answered questions here for a factory reset, re-paired and it recovered perfectly. (Turn the headset off, plug into a charging source, and while it is charging, hold the power button for a couple of seconds until you see a blue flash.)<br /><br />The one feature they're missing, inexplicably to me, is voice dialing. I don't believe I've ever had another headset that doesn't interface to my Android phone's voice dialer. If it had that I'd give it five stars.<br /><br />I mostly wanted to write a review to leave a note on using this headset as multipoint. This is *not* covered in the documentation, so I assume it's not a supported feature, but I tried the instructions for a different headset (Phaiser BHS-730, which I bought because it is multipoint and which I don't like in any way as much as this headset, in particular that they lasted only a month before the right side failed) and I have the headset paired with a phone and tablet at the same time. Again, this isn't supported, so your mileage may vary:<br /><br />Pair the headset with one device. Now turn off that device's bluetooth, power off the SENSO headset, then power it back on, holding the power button until the indicator light flashes red and blue. Pair with the second device. Now turn the first device's bluetooth back on and manually connect from the bluetooth menu.<br /><br />Pairing to two devices works fine; connecting to both can be finnicky. It can help to turn the bluetooth off on the currently-connected device, connect manually to the other, then reconnect to the first, but the Phaiser (which does claim to be multipoint) had exactly the same issues, so it's no more awkward than a supported multipoint headset.<br /><br />When using two devices, you don't need to switch between them. Start an audio source on either device and you'll hear it on the headset. The multi-function button will then stop and start that device. If you listen to the other, the multi-function button will control that. If you're watching a video on the tablet, you may need to pause it and answer the phone manually, but once you've done so the headset works with the phone.<br /><br />If you move out of range of one of the devices the headset will stutter. If I know I'm moving away from one device I'll power off the headset, and power it back on when I'm out of its normal range, at which point the headset will connect only to the closer device with no stutter.<br /><br />I've been far more pleased with this headset than any other. (But why oh why no voice dialing?...)"
1,instead of a micro USB cable we got one of those apple lightning cables so it's useless and we have to go get another cable to be able to charge the headphones. also mic isn't that great and it's hard to hear boyfriend when he uses it at work. but he said the sound is good at least<br /><br />aside from that inconvenience headphones work well.
1,"I got these headphones to wear to the gym and was concerned about going with a lesser known brand bc of the sound quality.  I'm really happy with this product.  The design is super convenient and stays in my ears while working out. The sound is great for the price and they come in a really convenient little case with two charging chords.<br />When I first received them, I was concerned bc the 3 ft long cable looked like it only had a lightning chord adapter and wouldn't plug in to charge the headphones. I was debating on returning them when I got an email from the company to let them know how I liked the product. I told them my concern, and they responded right away with a video showing that the chord actually flips out to display both the lightning adapter as well as a second adapter to charge the headphones, both on the same chord. I was pleasantly surprised and happy that I could keep the product.<br />If you're looking for a good product both design wise and sound quality wise and don't want to spend one million dollars, these are great."
1,"Excellent headphones! Use them when on exercise bike. Clear music with good range of sound from high to low. I'm not sure they are great at noise cancelling. You may want to look at some others for that feature. But for price and sound, these are great pair to get."
1,"Good quality, and nice sound for the price<br /><br />//Update: These bluetooths were amazing but then one side started failing. I quickly emailed the company and they responded very quickly with support. Unfortunately i was not able to fix mine but they honored their warranty and shipped out a new one. Great product and even greater customer support. They keep the 5 stars."
1,I haven't used them much since I got them but what little I have they seem to be fine for my use. I'm sure 300 dollar headphones are better but I'll never know because I think spending that kind of money on headphones is ridiculous. So if you want a solid pair for 30 bucks these will do
1,Very pleased with these headphones. Comfortable and great sound quality. I would definitely recommend!
1,"Well first off these are described I believe as noise cancellation,  there not. Put that aside and the audio quality for this price point is very good imo. In fact I purchased 2 pair , 1st pair had intermittent connection problems but I could not tell if it was my phone or these. Now that I have 2 pair, of course I don't have connection problems anymore.<br />Anyway I give  this company and this product 2 thumbs up."
1,Not much in sound quality for the price you'd think they'd out preform a 20 dollar pair of skull candy. The other options offer a nice touch though.
1,swimming
1,"I have been using these headphones to workout for about a week and I love the so far. They sound great, comfortable to wear, and wont fall out of your ear."
1,Very impressed with the quality and the accessories that came with these headphones.  They are way better than the expensive set of Beats headphones I recently bought
1,I was pleasantly surprised with these bluetooth buds.  The sound is good (not great). They are comfortable. They hold their charge very well.  I have used them for about six hours so far and have not recharged yet.  I don't think I could have done better for under $25.
1,"Received SENSO headphones packaging was great, fit very well and sound very good,. SENCO customer service contacted me after i received the package to make sure i was satisfied with the product and to let me know the product was covered with a 1 year warranty, if i had any issues i could contact them 24/7. About 3 days later one of the owners of the company contacted me to make sure I was satisfied with the product. AWESOME customer service!"
1,Worked great! Too bad mine got crushed under my car 😔
1,"I was really impressed with the sound and fit of these headphones.  I live in a state that you can't use your cellphone unless using a hands free device, and these headphones are perfect for it as well as working out."
1,"Well packaged with a useful case and nice accessories.  A great value compared to other bluetooth headphones I have purchased.  They sound great also - At least as good as others I've used, and probably better. I've only had them a few days so I'll know for sure soon."
1,Decent sound quality but sometimes sounds scratchy. Much less than anything by plantronics which was my old go to.
1,Excellent product- very pleased -I initially had a problem connecting to my iPad after using it on my iPhone but after speaking to a representative everything went well.
1,Great quality value headphones
1,I have used them for 2 days so far and they are really good. I am happy with the sound quality.
1,"Hi I'm happy with the bass and the music has great depth.<br /><br />The buds look a little goofy having a Shrek look or so my wife says.<br /><br />The structure is soft and pliable and they stay put ,so i'm very satisfied thanks<br /><br />Best<br /><br />David"
1,Excellent headphones.  Promptly shipped.  Good experience.
0,"I wanted to like these. They fit in the ear fairly comfortably. But the connection is AWFUL. The sound was fine while watching a show at the gym, while my phone was a couple feet from my head. As soon as I put my phone in my pocket and tried to listen to music it started cutting out so bad that I just turned it off. Will be trying to return."
1,"I've had these for several weeks. I use them almost daily to listen to audio books while taking a walk outside.They're great! In fact, I ordered a second pair for my husband."
1,"What can i say ? These headphones work great. I've only had it for a few days and they have not disappoint. The sound is very high quality, they fit well and don't fall off as I run, jump, bench press, etc. I would like to use them for at least one more month before I reach final conclusion. So far these are a steal when compared to main stream brands like BEATS."
1,Love em
1,My roommate got these and I loved them so I decided to order some myself.  the connection gets bad if i put my phone in my back pocket or walk away from my phone (more than 15 feet around corners) but other than that they work perfectly!
1,works great.
0,"These worked great for a month, but started degrading quickly. First, I started noticing that any amount of movement significantly stuttered the sound. So running was out of the question. Next, the range started shrinking. I have to keep my phone as close to the right earbud (where the receiver apparently is) as possible to keep it functioning. I'm hoping this one is just a dud, and am currently going through the return/exchange process. Hopefully #2 works a bit better!"
1,Very happy with these good value for dollar
0,"Works well at the gym and around the house... there is ALOT of background noise when wearing outside and it's windy or when your running outside. You can't make a call by pressing the multi-function button. People can't hear me when trying to use the phone option unless I am indoors and in a quiet area. I wear glasses sometimes and the part that goes around your relationship isn't thin enough for the glasses and the headphones so they have to hang off the outside of my ears when wearing glasses. The good... well, the sound is decent... If you are looking for just something just to listen to music.. it might be for you... if you are looking for a product that does more, buy something else."
1,"Great product, easy to use and stays charged for hours!"
1,"was a little skeptical about these but seams to work and sound grate I hope they hold up, only thing I don't like is seri don't work with these you have to hand call..."
1,"I ordered these for swimming laps, although it says they are water proof they are not, I liked them for my day to day use of headphones and had amazing sound, only reason I didn’t keep them is because they completely lose all sound when wet but is advertised as waterproof. I know there are specific headphones for underwater but I couldn’t beat this price! Still amazing bluetooth headphones."
1,"If I could give this 4.5 stars I would.  Can't beat this item for the price.  It doesn't compare to pricey bluetooth headphones like PowerBeats or Bose, but you are paying $200+ for those.  I have the PowerBeats3 as well (my wife uses them primarily).  The sound is not as clear and crisp as the PowerBeats3, but it's not something worth the difference of $170+ between those products and SENSO.  Some people say you can't notice the difference in sound but I do, but like I said it's not a big enough of a difference for me to fork over that much more money for PowerBeats or Bose.  These headphones fit securely and provide a great barrier from outside noise.  The buttons are big enough to where you can find them while wearing them which is a big plus for me.  I only wear these during runs/workouts but if I were someone that used bluetooth headphones more regularly, I might be more inclined to purchase the premium brand."
1,They say never use something new on race day...I broke that rule and tried out these headphones! They are incredibly comfortable and have great sound! I highly recommend these  to anyone looking for comfortable headphones that can withstand the sweat of a long distance runner!!!
0,"They WERE great and now won’t stay paired. It was one day, all of a sudden. I went online and did what others suggested, hard reset, resetting pairing devices, avoidedother blutooth signals to test... nothing worked so they are now useless. Will contact the seller today."
1,"For the money the product was adequate, but do not rely on the water proof rating. My first pair lasted a couple weeks and appears to have died from sweat while working out at the gym. The replacement was hassle free and I enjoyed the 2nd pair for about 6 months until I got caught in the rain one day while running. lasted maybe 15 minutes. Once finished with the run, I was unable to power off the earphones, pause the music, change the volume or skip forward or back. In other words, the buttons quit working. Service was great and sent me a replacement pair - which I'll keep as a backup if needed."
1,"I've owned these for several months now, and I'm comfortable enough to pass judgement on them. They're good headphones for the price, but the battery life and connectivity experiences are flawed.<br /><br />Audio Quality:<br /><br />Audio is clear and crisp for both spoken audio and music, but these are pretty bass-heavy. There isn't any way to adjust the audio profile either, so if you're ok with that then these will work. Personally, I don't care that much, as these are 30 bucks.<br /><br />Connectivity:<br /><br />I have tried this on two different devices: an Android and an iPhone, as well as my MacBook Pro. Connectivity is kind of spotty overall to be honest. On Android, the headphones took anywhere from 10 - 20 seconds to connect. On iPhone, it connects quickly, but takes 20 seconds to recognize them as audio devices...if it does at all, in which case you'll have to restart the headset and try again. It will let me push the button on the side to play/pause, but will play the sound through the internal speakers until the bluetooth headset symbol appears in the corner (which has a useful battery display as well). This is pretty annoying, but once it's connected, you don't have to worry about it disconnecting.<br /><br />Battery:<br /><br />Connectivity is a minor annoyance, but the battery is a larger issue for me. It's advertised as lasting 8 hours, but in my experience the average over the several months I've had these (from full charge, mind) is about 3-4 hours. Which is really annoying because you can't charge them and listen at the same time, it disconnects you from all devices. 8 hours would be great as it will last me a full work day, but they never do. Around half way through the day it starts spamming me with 'BATTERY LOW' every minute until it shuts off after about 10 minutes...at which point I have to let it charge for an hour before I can make it through the last couple of hours in my workday. This means that if you work out in the evening, don't use this during the workday...you'll have to charge it for a while before it's useable.<br /><br />These would be perfect if the battery lasted longer and connectivity wasn't such a finicky experience. I'd say get em if you're not using them as daily headphones (i.e. just for workouts), but if you want something you can use all day, look into the JLabs Epic2 or the Jaybird X2."
0,They do not stay on while running... I tried everything. The sound quality is good.
1,Good sound quality when listening to music. Same with the battery life. Call quality is mostly great. There are some times that they just don't want to work right.
1,So far so good. Work great ato the gym. Only negative I CNN think of is that they have more bass than I expected. Great product.
1,Easy to use and sound is very good
1,I’ve tried about a half dozen brands of Bluetooth headphones and these are the only ones that continue to have no issue with connecting and the audio quality holds up with no interference. They are comfortable too! Sticking with these.
0,"I bought these to use as running headphones. I primarily run outside. Prior to buying these headphones I was using Apple ear buds with my iphone. The kind that come with your phone. I wanted to go cordless, and bought these headphones based on the excellent reviews on amazon.com. I have never been more dissappointed with a well reviewed item.<br /><br />I charged the headphones as directed in the instructions. I tried them out inside and noticed that they block out sound like you are wearing an ear plug, which I guess you are in a sense. This is less than ideal for outdoor runners as it gives poor situational awareness. I need to hear cars. I tried different ear plugs to find the best fit; the headphones come with several sizes. Ultimately I found a pair that fit my ear well.<br /><br />Listening to music indoors at rest the sound was good. However, when I took them outside running they were aweful. There was a constant whooshing noise like air being amplified by a speaker. This is on a day without wind. No noise when I would take the headphones off. No noise when I would stop running. Constant whooshing in my ears everytime I ran.<br /><br />Additionally, the sound cut out with turning my head or bending down to touch my toes and stretch my hamstrings.<br /><br />I tried to trouble shoot the sound issues. I turned the headphones off and on again, I disconnected the bluetooth and reconnected, I adjusted the fit of the headphones in my ear. I dont think it was an issue of earbud fit: because I didnt hear a car come up behind me, yet had constant whooshing noises in my ear every time I ran. If the ear bud wasnt fitting in the ear I should have been able to hear a car around it.<br /><br />I am giving these headphones a 1 star review. Not a good headphone for running due to poor situational awareness, a constant whooshing air noise while running, and sound dropping off with positional movement."
1,"Incredible headphones, incredible customer service, highly recommend!"
1,Amazing quality at a ridiculous price.  A definite must.
1,Work fine other than the fact they die at 30% every time. It'll warn you for 5 mins before it's dead &#34;battery low......battery low&#34;. Wonder if it saves battery by not reminding me every 30 secs.
1,Great headphones - wore them for an entire half marathon and they never fell out or became uncomfortable.
1,Great customer service and product
0,"These headphones connect extremely fast and have great sound quality. I was skeptical at when purchasing, but I have been very impressed with everything about them.<br /><br />I have now had these headphones for a couple months and I wish I could have left my review at five stars. Unfortunately, I have had issues with the battery keeping any charge. I have e-mailed the company twice and have not been contacted back. They have no number listed on their website. What good is a warranty if you can't contact someone to take advantage of it."
1,"Work well, clear sound, rugged, terrific battery life. Great value as the item includes a car charger, combo Lightning/mini USB cable, and multiple ear tips. The actual ear pieces are not the most aesthetic or light but cannot complain at this price point. The sound is decent to hear regular audio but certainly not anywhere near an audiophile standard. However, for the casual user, I would highly recommend these bluetooth headphones!"
1,"These are excellent for use in the gym, cycling, on the track, etc. For the price point (~$30) I don't know why anyone purchases anything else for 5-7 times more. I've paired with my iPhone 6 and iWatch series 3 to listen to iTunes workout playlists. Once I figured out pairing and how it can get corrupted (with any bluetooth product), any frustration I had with them has gone away. They come in Apple-style packaging with multiple size earbuds, carrying case and charger, plus dual car charge adapter - great standard accessories! Not only that, the company is quick to respond with tips/helps if you have any issues with connection, etc. The only other thing I've wanted changed is the ability to set EQ from the watch since it is a bit heavy on the bass side - no fault of the ear-buds as I was able to adjust EQ on the iPhone and they responded just fine. Again, great product!!"
0,"First, BUYER BEWARE --  these puppies aren't $170 bluetooth earphones. Direct from Senso's website, sensoshop.com, they're listed as $49.97. Clicking the 'Purchase On Amazon' button takes you this listing. I think a $120 discrepancy in it's product listing is almost criminal. It's makes you think 'WOW, SUCH A GOOD DEAL! 80% OFF!!' -- not so much.<br /><br />Now, for what you DO get, $37 ain't too shabby -- carrying case, 3 sets of different sized eartips, two different length charging cables (micro USB and Lightning!) and a car charing lighter plugin unit thingy which has a 2.1A and 1.0A USB slots. The headphones themselves we're SUPER easy to pair up to my iPhone and in less than 5 minutes I had music playing and the controls figured out.<br /><br />My only other complaint beyond pretending they're regularly $170, is that they don't fit quite right in my ears. When playing I can tell they should sound GREAT, but I have to shove them deep into my ear and rotate them around a bit to hear it completely. I tried all three size eartips with the small being the best fit, but, still wasn't perfect. Not the manufacturer's fault, but I've had a ton of 'in-ear' earbuds and these, so far, have been the worst fitting. Maybe it's my ears. Aside from the ear canal fit, they absolute will stay on your head. I gave them an intense shake/headbang/thrash around test and they stayed on perfectly; no slippage.<br /><br />I think they're claim of 'up to' 30 feet of bluetooth connectivity range is a wee bit inflated, however. I left my iPhone in a room and went into the next room at a distance of 20 ft and the signal started to cut out. However, I can't see where I would be listening to these and not carrying my phone with me, so it's not really an issue. Might be for some if you intend to leave your phone on a charger or something and working around the house. Not gonna happen.<br /><br />I bought them specifically for the gym, so I'll update my review after a few workouts and see how it handles the sweat and wear. Overall, PROS: they sound pretty good, every easy to use, quick to connect to my device. CONS: These aren't $170 worth of tech, eartips don't quite fit right (for me).<br /><br />UPDATE: Dropped a star from my original review. Headphones now get to 30% battery (as indicated by the battery meter on my iPhone), I get repeated warnings of low battery for a minute or two then they shut off. I power them back up, connects with the phone -- still shows 30% battery remaining; headphones shut right back off. Looks like if I'm going to use these any longer, I will have to charge them daily. Boo.<br /><br />Update 2019: 30% battery remaining REALLY means 0%. This has remained the same since day one. I’ve got burned at the gym a few times thinking I have enough to get through a one hr workout. Not the case."
1,I love my bluetooth so much that this is my fourth pair i bought for family members
0,"Yup pretty much a problem after the fifth time I used them.  Now after a full charge, headphones keep cutting in and out.  Don't waste your cash.  Save up and get something better.  It's a shame<br />though.....they did work nice the first few times."
1,I like how they fit and easy to adjust around my eara
1,"I've been very skeptical in buying the Airbuds as I could not get the wired buds to fit my ears - how was this going to happen with buds not even connected together?  With the new series IV iWatch, I needed something to use for workouts.  What a great choice I made with the Senso Headphones!  Easy setup and good sound quality for the cost!  No, there is no concert hall sound, but the bass is quite reasonable that the sound is NOT flat!!  Perfect for on the go travel and workouts.  Don't miss the beat! Thank you Senso for a sensible sound that is truly affordable!"
0,"Did not care for these. No matter what I did, I couldn't get them to feel comfortable or to even feel like they properly fit.  I took them on a run and I kept having to adjust the entire time.  Even just sitting down to listen to music was an annoyance.  I returned them."
1,I love 'em. Great price!!
0,"I don't use sports earphones a lot, only use for the run, but a few time changes the battery later and battery can't change anymore."
1,"Comfortable, light, and great sound"
1,Nice product
1,I had beats head phones and thees sound as good and have lasted me longer and they are $100 cheaper than beats
1,The sound of this headphones is good but the way they fit on/in the ears is not comfortable specially with long connecting wire between the two ear sets. Package came missing the bonus gifts and we had to ask for a return
1,So far so good! Nice headphones
1,OMG! OMG! These things are beyond! I am old school (and 53!) and continued wearing over the head 80's style head phones when everybody had turned to ear buds. My experience with then was the sound quality was garbage and they kept falling out. Finally I decided to get modern and got behind the neck ear phones on the ear. But no one wore these and the behind the neck thing was bothersome so I finally got real modern and got these.<br /><br />OMG! The bass the quality. Still cannot really believe it. And it came with nice accessories and a pouch and it just came across as a product they put real time and effort into.<br /><br />Amazing and I don't look like an idiot at the gym anymore.<br /><br />Wow. That is really all that I can say.
1,Headphones get the job done but i sweat profusely and after about mile 3 they start to fall of my ear. I though the ear hooks would be alot more stable but they aren't sturdy at all and look as though they are there just for looks and not to provide an grip or hold to my ear.
1,"This is my second pair. I thought I had lost my first pair but then found them. They both have good sound,etc. but the first pair had springy things that go around your ear to hold it in place. They worked great. The new ones had something like a stiff wire inside that I guess was meant to fold and bend around your ear for a custom fit. It doesn't work. It is difficult to make them fit, and as soon as you take them off the ""fit"" gets bent as you take them off. I think that the bendy wire will fatigue and break given time. Go back to the first version, people!"
1,Love thing earphone
1,Like them
1,It works well and I recommend it.
0,"I loved these in the beginning . The sound was great, but 4 months later they won’t charge and it will no longer pair to my phone. I guess for $30 what did I expect."
1,"Having just received them I can only say that delivery was excellant, the product was of very good quality and equipped with plenty of good accessories. Performance thus far has been very good.`"
1,Works get when exercising
1,great product
1,I found the sound quality and volume to be excellent and the fit to be very comfortable. Very good st this price point.
1,Can't beat the quality for the price.
1,My son needed new bluetooth headphones for a 1/2 marathon he was running.  They came quickly and he was very happy with them!  Have had problems with other brands when sweating...hoping that is not the case with these!  Bought a 3 year extended warranty just in case.  Very pleased with the quality for the price!
0,Purchased 11/29/17. Stopped working 2/15/18. Worked fine 2/14/18 but completely dead 2/15/18.
0,"Kinda disappointed. I like the wireless capabilities and I have friends that like these. The sound is pretty good and the microphone works well. But if you're running, you can hear the wind noise. They are boxy. If they were a little more aerodynamic, I think the wind noise would be less. They also don't fit very well. The ear loop is a little big and not adjustable  (I consider myself to have a fairly standard head-size!).  Can't really recommend."
1,"I purchased these headphones a few months back because I was looking for something that was great quality but not at an astronomically high price point. These headphones are just that. I was, however, upset when I discovered one of the earbuds going in and out, as if there was a small short in the wiring. You may ask why I give this five stars - I contacted the seller and mentioned my issue. They walked me through a reset of the headphones and then, when that did not work, shipped me a new pair free of charge. Truly wonderful customer service in my honest opinion. Great quality, great price, and even better customer service!"
1,Great product.  Goods are as advertised. I would buy again.
1,These earbuds work well for me. The shape of the earbud seems a little weird and isn't the shape of my ear but the hook helps it stay in place. I get at least 8 hours of operation on a full charge which is almost double the time of my previous set.
1,Excellent headphones work great with my phone for calls
1,Great value!
1,"Working like a charm for now, thank you.!"
1,"I wanted to be able to listen to audiobooks in the shower, so I got an IPX7 headset. Works well for what I got it for.<br />EDIT: I have been informed that IPX7 does NOT cover extended submersion or continuous water discharged under pressure. I have no problems with voiding my warranty, so I'll keep using them, and see how they hold up."
1,I was sceptical at first because other wireless headphones I looked at were at least $60 and above. I read the reviews on amazon and I can honestly say that these are well worth the money. They sound awesome. Good bass and treble. They do not hurt my ears as others have in the past. I use them while lifting weights and running they stay put the whole time. Would definitely buy again.
1,Be sure to read the instructions because it clearly says not to leave the headphones charging for too long or else the batter life will be damaged.  Ask me how I know this!  Otherwise they work fine.
1,These headphones work great. They sync perfectly with my iPod and I haven't had any issue. I love to run and these made my run a lot better because I don't have to worry about that cord getting tangled while I'm working out.
1,"They are as advertised. Very loud and clear, waterproof (I sweat a LOT), and it comes with lots of accessories.<br /><br />Just as important is the customer service. The volume toggle button on mine broke a couple weeks after arriving and they are replacing them free of charge! Thanks!"
1,Product works well and does not hurt ears.  Connection was simple.
0,"I may have gotten a bad pair but they would constantly disconnect as I rode my bike, I returned the product after two days of trying to get it to function without cutting off."
1,Great purchase!
1,Loved all the bonuses that came with the earbuds. Nice packaging. Really good for the price.
1,Product was received on time.  The headphones fit great and the sound is excellent.  They make my runs much more enjoyable.
1,"These wireless headphones are absolutely phenomenal.  You can't beat the sound for the price and they last through any activity I need them to, even when I'm dripping in sweat. This is the second pair I've gotten and make sure to tell all of my friends that the SENSO Bluetooth Headphones are where it's at."
1,Very happy with this product. They work great.
1,These are great! I have been very please with quality and sound! Delivered promptly  I would order again as a gift!
1,Love these things! Super comfy and no sound glitching. Used them for a mtb race and definitely worth it.
1,Love em. Quite comfortable and make my workouts and walks more enjoyable without being tethered to my phone.
1,Most ear buds don't fit in my small ear but these came with a few different sizes and the tiny ones are just the right size! So excited to go running with some tunes
1,I was looking for Bluetooth headphones solely for the gym and didn't want to spend a ton of $$$. These work perfectly and the price is perfect.
1,best bang for your buck out there
1,"These are remarkable ear buds. The sound quality is superb and they are the most comfortable ear buds imaginable. And, the current price is incredibly low for the quality."
1,"I purchased these as a gift and am completely impressed with not only the product quality but the packaging as well. It came with a fantastic semi-hard case that stores all accessories and headphones as well. I bought these while on a &#34;Deal of the Day&#34; and got a great price. When my beau opened his gift and tried them on, he said they were very comfortable and was excited to use them. I would totally purchase these again and hope this purchase lasts for a few years."
1,"Love these headphones, they stay charged for about 7-8 hours and fit great since they provide 3 different sized ear bud attachments. I like to watch my tablet while cleaning my house and I am able to walk away from it to mop the entire house without loosing any sound quality."
1,This is exactly what I want when I am in GYM.
1,"Amazing sound quality, good battery life, and they truly honor your 1 year warranty for any defects. Best part is that they actually stay in my ear!"
1,"I've had these headphones for about a month now and I absolutely love them. The sound quality is good for what it is, but the volume is impressive. I usually have headphones on max volume and I dont have to with these. I go to the gym and workout so they stay on great. The carrying case is an awesome addition so I can throw them in my bag on the go. There are multiple ear bud selections that are the regular plastic and foam. Battery life is pretty typical depending on how you use them."
0,Wouldn’t stay in my ears.
1,Love these headphones!! Work so good!
0,Headphones were for my daughter.  They did not fit & she sent them back.
0,"Received Bluetooth earbuds with missing parts including spare eartips and wire tie clip, clearly a returned/re-packaged item."
0,"I ordered a pair of these because my wife has a set and they’re great. However, the ones I got did NOT come with flexible silicone backings, by hard plastic. Ordered not just because of good sound but a comfortable fit, which is not the case with these.<br /><br />If you have sensitive ears, not worth your money."
1,They are everything I hoped they would be. Only had them a short time but I've really enjoying them!!!
1,"Very good quality and sound, only last for 6 months"
0,This product stopped working after 5 months!!!!!!!
1,"I was very unsure about these do to the price.  If you are in sure or debating to get these do wait.  These are great headphones.  You don't have a wire running to your device to get caught up.  These sound great with all kinds of music and stay in my ear while I'm running and working out.  They come with a few different size ear pieces so you can get the best fit for your ears.  The case that comes with these carbon fiber style crush proof case to protect your investment.  I highly recommend these to anyone that is serious about good quality headphones.  These come from a small company that takes there customer satisfaction very seriously and put their customers first, which is getting harder and harder to find companies that are like this any more.  I will be buying a spare set as well as sets for my wife and daughter.  Great product."
1,"I work as a stock clerk at a large grocery store. Before the customers arrive we can wear headphones, but working with your hands a lot and moving was a real problem for wired headphones. I had a pair of Beats, but didn't care much for the sound quality. They seem kinda designed to deliver very bassey music. I thought I would try this brand. They are much crisper and more clear. The sound is awesome and the battery life last through my eight hour shift. The price is great and the quality even better."
1,"I use it to shower and run and works fine. Ocasionally it disconnects and reconnects, but it works after a restart or two which can be annoying"
1,Very happy with these! Great sound!
1,"I don't normally use ear buds I prefer headphones, but I am very pleased with the quality and hearing it's from a smaller business and they very much care for it's customers is amazing to hear I do recommend these. The battery is very long lived the charging takes almost no time and it's compatible with almost all my devices sound is decent volume."
1,"The sound quality of these headphones is excellent given the price. Included with the headphones is a neat little pouch that holds the headphones, multiple ear plug replacements in different sizes, and a charging cord. Additionally there is an AC adapter with a 3' cable with multiple ends to charge different devices. The headphones stay in place even with vigorous activity. I have not tried them out with a lot of sweating, so we'll see how they hold up. So far, I think it was an excellent purchase!"
0,Left Channel had half of the volume the right channel did. I thought I was losing my hearing until I downloaded an app and tested them on my brother without him knowing what was wrong.
1,"Sound very good, delivered on time, they tel you the number calling. Battery life is very good. Worth every penny."
0,In less than 6 months one of the headphone stop working. that very disappointing for a product that is so expensive.
0,Great while it lasted; died after 8 months.
1,great sound
1,My wife did not like the kind that wrap around the ear but sound is nice and comfortable only returning the one
0,"When I first got the item it worked efficiently. But, over use and just 3-weeks the product then stopped connecting to my iPhone and ultimately stopped turning on all together. I took adequate care of these headphones, however, in little time, the item completely stopped working. For the time I had it working, I would give these headphones 4-stars. In terms of how long it worked for, and the other problems I had, it warranted a 2-star review.<br /><br />WOULD NEVER BUY THESE AGAIN."
0,"I bought these headphones maybe 2 weeks ago and already one of the earbuds does not sound properly anymore. I don’t even use these headphones that often, just for the gym. I bought these because the reviews said these headphones were good but only after TWO WEEKS and already it’s broken."
1,These are even better than I expected. The quality and sound  is really good.
1,Can not believe how good the sound is. Easy to use too. Can't be beat for the money that is for sure.
1,Great product and price was outstanding. Very fast delivery
0,"The item looks good, sounds good, but it only lasted a month and 21 days then it died. It is not charging anymore."
1,They broke apart. Very dissapointed. Would like a replacement.
1,"Pretty good, got them on a flash sale so they were cheap and they are perfect for when you are charging your iPhone and don’t have that earphone jack"
0,"Stopped working after a few weeks, don’t buy these."
0,"I’m sad to report that I’m extremely disappointed in this purchase. It didn’t start out that way, i was actually very pleased in the beginning. So pleased, in fact i purchased a second pair for my boyfriend. Not long after my headphones completely died on me, even when i followed instructions and did a factory reset. Luckily it was covered under a one time replacement warranty, but then this pair crapped out on me, and to top it off so did my boyfriends pair AND his replacement pair. It’s on sale now, but originally i purchased these for $36 a pair. I’m extremely disappointed and feel like i got screwed. Like how could 4 pair of headphones just stop working out of no where? And right in the middle of a workout no less. Don’t chance it. Buy another brand."
1,"Pros:  Great sound, comfortable over the ear, easy connecting to my devices, the buttons for volume and such were easy to work with.<br />Cons:  I put the smallest earbud on but it never fit in my right ear well.  Left ear was great. (apparently my ears don't match! Who knew??) , when making phone calls, the person on the other end heard an echo.<br /><br />I really liked the earbuds and contacted them when I was having issues with an echo.  They responded with a possible solution right away.  The solution didn't work.  I did try to contact them again, but no response so I have decided to return them.  The sound on my end was great! Just wish it wasn't so annoying for the friend I was talking to."
1,sound is loud and clear and they're quite comfortable.
1,Very good sound quality and price.
1,"Bought these on Prime Day for $20 and was almost sorry when the Ankers went up just after, Don't think they could be much better. Excellent sound/clarity/separation. Bass could be louder but is more than adequate. I found the earplug that came installed was very comfortable. Hardly noticed I'm wearing them. It's like the songs I hear in my head but louder!  Nice case too! Highly recommend"
1,No idea where they came from. I own several BT headphones. Senso runs circles around them. The only downside is the sometimes shaky BT connection while walking or running. But the sound is outstanding for a slim footprint very comfortable set of headphones. Only once better I own r my bose noise cancelling wired. I was wearing the senso yesterday for about 5 hrs with no pain on my ears. The battery did not drain more than 50% with music playing. Impressive job.
1,Great for listneing to podcasts. Mic picks up all surrounding sound and limits calls to quieter areas. Works fine for me at this price.
1,"Gets connected disconnected several times if I m walking and phone is on hand, range not more than 15 ft."
1,These are awesome!!!! I love how easy they are to use. It doesn't slide off your ear when your working out. And they can get pretty loud. Great to use while driving.
1,Sounds amazing
1,Good sound
1,Nice product/value.
1,"Good buy for a pair of headset. Decent sound quality. These only lastest a year to me and then the cable broke internally, so I only could hear one speaker"
1,"When I bought these, I thought it only came with the headset. Not only do I have a headset that has clear, loud sound, but I get a case, car charger, two wires, and extra ear pads. So far these headphones are working great and I am very happy with my purchase. Spreading the word about these headphones."
0,"I've owned several pair of these headphones, but they simply do not last.  After a short period they either will not charge or will not stay charged more than 10-15 minutes."
0,Too much bass
1,"I bought these to use with my new iPhone 7 Plus. The lack of a headphone jack really made going wireless a requirement for my wife and I as we use our phones for both music and Audible, quite a bit. One of the deciding factors in this headset was the battery life and price. While I can listen to Audible through my car on my way to and from work, while I am at work I need headphones and these last me all day. Having two cords means I have one at home next to my bed to charge the ear buds overnight and one at work to charge them should I know I'm going to not be using them for awhile, such as when I have meetings.<br /><br />The fidelity has been surprisingly good, given the price and I am glad I got these."
1,Not happy with these after using for a few months. Sound quality is average. Horrible wind noise when running. Problems with random disconnects with my phone.
0,"Battery life SUCKS !!!! and the fit is non adjustable most of these styles you can adjust the fit a lil. Not these,"
1,these are great for listening to music or books on tape from your phone but to hold converstions it isn't so good. to much background noise for the receiver.
1,"used them for a year in a half 5-6 days a week for 6-9 hours a day at work outside, then i put them though the wash for a hour and then the dryer for hour and half, still work."
1,"These were fine especially for the price.  The right earphone slipped out of place constantly no matter which size earpiece I used.  They stopped working on June 19, less that a year after I bought them.  Used them on the 17th and then they wouldn't charge or turn on."
1,"SO far, it has been good.  Not sure how long the battery life is, but will the group know when it dries up."
1,Head phones broke the first time I used them. They advertise that they are waterproof but as soon as I got water on them they broke and won't work anymore.
0,This item was malfunctioning just like the first one did
1,These headphones work great.
0,I bought two sets of these useless earbuds. These cutout constantly when used with my iPhone (8+); it's as if I'm listening to some radio broadcast across the ocean in 1946. What a genuine waste of my money.
1,It's just hooked me up lol. 100% recommended for this product.
0,It worked fine over a year and now it won't charge or power on. This is the 2nd replacement after the first one had the issue with bluetooth connection. Contacted the Senso support but they couldn't do anything so they offered me 5% discount coupon to purchase a new one.
1,"First and foremost, impressive product. Have never had any type of earbuds like these. The sound is impeccable. Honestly shockingly good. For the price, this product is a 5 star. Very impressed. Love them, i don't only use them for running, i also use them at work to cancel out noise. Amazing quality. Great job guys. Outstanding."
1,"These are surprisingly good and well-equipped.  Can't think of any negatives and I've been using them pretty constantly since i got them a week ago.  Great sound, charging and fitting options are great, I love that it talks to me and tells me when its on, connected, call coming in, etc. Way more quality than I expected, really really happy with this purchase.  Thank you!"
1,"I had problem with the headphone shipped initially but after a mail contact with Invoke, they promptly replied and shipped a replacement unit. The quality of the sound is very good as well as the surrounding noise isolation."
1,I purchased these 🎧 As a replacement for a more expensive brand that I lost. I am happy to report that they provide exquisite sound quality and are not a drop in the bucket.
1,very comfortable!
0,Works but sound is extremely muffled
1,"Do not waste your time looking at other Bluetooth earbuds at 2, 3 or 4 times the cost...THESE are the real deal! GREAT product, GREAT value!!!"
1,They work excellently. Nice sound and feel.
1,I bought these to listen to music & podcasts privately and occasionally for making phone calls. Listening to music (my primary reason for buying) is great. Using to replace my iPhone's ear pods...meh. The sound of my voice outgoing is hollow to both me and the person I'm talking to. It's easy to setup and use.
1,Had these for over a year and can't be more pleased. Went thru a few pairs of beats and I was always disappointed. Can't beat the price either!!
1,"I purchased these back in February, but I use them so often I felt that I should post a review for others looking for some bluetooth headphones!<br /><br />Pros-<br />-Great battery life<br />-Great at canceling most noise out<br />-Can use it as a bluetooth<br />-For the most part, stays in place, even when I go for a run<br />-Great price for what you get<br />-Comes with a case to carry the headphones<br /><br />Cons-<br />-The hooks for your ears are too big (then again I have small ears)<br /><br />Aside from the hook things, these are great and worth it!"
1,"Great product, but I am not a fan of wires dangling or swinging around behind my neck during exercise. I purchased another Bluetooth headphones product from Amazon, but with &#34;hard&#34; &#34;loop&#34; between headphones. This another product does not have swinging / dangling wires.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Bluetooth connection to iPhone.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Wires dangling behind my neck during exercise.<br /><br />Removed one star, because there is a better alternative with &#34;hard loop&#34; that does not dangle behind my neck during exercise. Search Amazon and you will find the alternative product with &#34;hard&#34; &#34;loop&#34;."
1,"Great headphones for their price. Sound quality was more than I bargained for and they fit on my ears while I lifted and played basketball. Better than any of the $10-15 headphones I've purchased at marshalls. If you're looking to save and have a quality pair of headphones, these are your guys"
0,"I like the product and after 2 months of use the right ear bud has stopped working. Besides that part, I love it. Noise canceling and sound is great."
0,"I ordered this in January 2018. It's August 2018 and they're completely dead. I've plugged them in to charge, but now it doesn't even connect to my iPhone!!! I paid $30 for this pair so I paid about $4 a month for these earphones, and they died. It's not worth it! I noticed yesterday at the gym that the left side was starting to fade in and out, but it's completely dead now."
1,"Perfect sound, easy to use, totally worth the money!!!"
1,"the SENSO bluetooth headphones are of good quality, great price and sound fantastic. I've owned more expensive bluetooth headphones and these sound as good or better for much less $$. They fit comfortably over my ears and are secure while working out. Highly recommended."
0,"These headphones were great for the first month. However, wearing them to the gym on a daily basis proved they could not hold up and were most definitely not waterproof/resistant. The speakers started making a fizzling sound that clearly was not a good sign and within a day of hearing that strange sound, they wouldn't even turn on. I tried charging them, but nothing worked. For the month that they did work, they were great, had good sound quality, and were comfortable - just wish they would have lasted longer than a month. Waste of money."
1,Awesome sound for a great price 👍🏼They feel so comfortable on my ear
1,"These are awesome, very comfortable, sound good."
0,"Overall product was fine. sound quality, comfort were all decent.  I tried these hoping they would be more durable.  However the left speaker went out after approximately 3 months.  similar to the length of time a pair of corded headphones seem to last. :("
1,"Decent sound and easy to use.  Reboot of devise, holding the power button while plugged in, resolved sound cutting in and out.  These are not great for talking on the phone due to picking up background noise.  For me, wearing for a long time will cause irritation under the ear loop."
1,Good sound and great battery life
1,Favorite headphones. Great quality. great sound.
0,"Use at the gym does not fall off. Sometimes it can take an extra step to connect to my phone, but for the price no complaints.13 months layer wire separate. Ok if want to buy new one every 13 months"
0,"I got these as a late Christmas gift and started using them a little over a month ago.  The sound was excellent, especially using it with a SanDisk SportsClip (not the best quality sounding MP3 Player).  However, last week the headphones started dying on me less than an hour into my workout.  This was after a full charge on the headphones.  They should be under warranty and I'm waiting to hear back from Senso.  I'll update once I hear more."
1,I bought this as a gift 🎁 for my husband Birthday which is Aug 3rd.....so I'm sure he'll love it!
1,"the hook is very flimsy and do not hold the headset in place for any activity.<br />This headset can be used for in place or gentle walking. Any quick movement the headset falls of from the ear.<br /><br />Other than that sound quality, ease of use was good.<br />I am returning because of the earhook"
1,Very lite great sound you forget you have them on.
1,"These are really a great deal.  The sound is so good that even my very particular wife liked it, so I bought another set for her insuring that she would not &#34;Inherit&#34; mine... Pairing was a snap, easy to use controls, comfortable ear pieces, solid carrying case, extra cable, car jack, etc etc etc. AND no more getting tangled in the dangle! Very nice in the gym."
1,I really like these.  First set of wireless buds for me.  Highly recommend wireless.  The multitude of uses without having the wire is huge.<br /><br />Good.  Comfortable.  Multiple buds to fit your ear.  Unless I'm exercising they remain where put even without the loop over the ear.<br /><br />Length of battery.  About 8 hrs.<br />Recharging.  Quick.  Not sure of time bit 30 minutes gets you plenty.<br />Sound is as good or better than other buds.<br />Water resistance has been solid.  Through rain. And lots of sweat.<br />Look - I like the fact I don't have a battery sitting on my neck.<br /><br />The less than good<br />Size is not huge bit is noticeable<br />Wind gives a ton of noise.  Would be unusable on a windy day or on a bike.  I use on a unicycle and still get noise.<br />Range .  10 ft at best.  Even at 6 I tend to get disruption<br /><br />Overall solid pair of phones for this price.
0,Stopped working after using them twice. Poor poor quality.
1,Great product!!! Cheap and affordable too!! Awesome sound quality and power usage!
1,"I absolutely love these wireless headphones.  The sound is excellent, the design and comfort is so nice.  When I opened the package, I immediately connected my music.  I danced and sang for the rest of the night!  Well worth the price, such a good buy and completely fills my need of being able to workout and get in the zone with music.  I like the carrying case and the unique technology of having two charging options connected on one cord... unique!  The ear buds fit nice and comfortable and I could not hear any outside noise.  Thank you!!!!!!  You will be my go to from now on!"
1,Evrything good so far.I am happy with this purchase.
1,Good sound just a bit bulkier than I thought.
0,"These head phones worked very well; however, they onky had a life span of about 5 months. I will not be purchasing this brand anymore."
1,"everything is good, except sometimes sound is on and off"
1,Very comfortable and secure when working out. Sound quality very good. Charge lasts a long time too.
1,"These are the best Bluetooth  headphones I've purchased. The sound is great and they keep out the outside noise. I have yet to run the battery down, so that's a major plus.  I mainly use them mowing & working in the yard & I absolutely love them.  Awesome value."
1,"This was a gift for my husband and he's very happy with it! The ear pieces are nice, it comes with foam on them, and then alternate sizes of plastic earpieces. The sound buttons are easy to find. He likes it because he can wear them at work with one side in, and he works in a clean environment, so the ear hook helps ensure they don't fall out, or dangle, and cause contamination. He also noticed that the bass is really good. Thanks for making me look like a good wife."
1,awesome earbuds don't waste your money on the more expensive brands they don't give you more
1,My BF loves them :)
1,"So far, so good! Only used them a couple of times so far. They paired easily, stayed in my ears during a workout (treadmill running, weight machines, bench press, etc.), and the sound quality is good. The ear loops are pretty floppy, so they feel like they might fall out, but that haven't yet. Sound is as good as expected. Obviously gonna be a little weak in the Bass, but no static or hissing due to the wireless.<br /><br />Will update this as I get more use out of these."
1,I love music. I love Bose products ( except the price) but these sends Bluetooth headphones are amazing.<br />The sound is wonderful and smooth without over doing it.<br />The base is solid but not overwhelming<br />They are extremely comfortable and stay on.<br />All that for $36.<br />I don't know how long the charge lasts or how durable but I am starting out with 5 stars - if they don't hold up I will update<br />Try these before you spend $150
1,"Great value. Deep bass response. Ok for music. Not so good for voice eg. Podcasts, audio books. Sounds clipped on the top end. To be fair, the manufacturer does warn about this."
1,Excellent value.  Was able to get a comfortable fit with the multiple sizes of earbuds provided.  No issue connecting to bluetooth The sound quality to my hearing was great.
1,I like the headphones. But the charger seems a little weak.
1,Loses signal from the phone anytime it is more than 5 feet away so cannot<br />be on the phone moving around the house without the phone very near.<br />Extremely disappointed as has good reviews from many people which<br />influenced my decision. Could easily have purchased another product.<br />Flexible over the ear not as convenient as firm hoop over the ear.
1,So far so good. I've only hard the earbuds a few days and I'm satisfied. I'm not a person that needs high end brand names. Sensor is doing what I need and the cost is perfect<br />Thanks
0,The parts that go over your ear are extremely floppy and serve no purpose what so ever.
1,"This is my 2nd pair - gave the first pair to my son.  They work great, sound great and what a great price.  The only thing holding me back from 5 stars is they occasionally have a hard time connecting to my iphone.  Not always, just sometimes takes a few times to connect."
0,"These headphones didn’t have a long range. The ear piece “hook” came disconnected from the larger part that says Senso. I cannot see it because of the rubber, but it moves a lot more than the other side. It also doesn’t have the same sound quality."
1,"I've been using these for about a month now, and they are perfect for my needs. They stay charged all day, I charge them about every couple of days, although I don't use them a full 8 hours typically. They stay in place well, and are comfortable to wear. I have a hard time with plain earbuds that don't have different sizes to choose from. These came with several options. They also come with a nice carry case, which fits the charger as well. I use these with my asus zenwatch 2, and they pair well. I'm  very pleased with the sound, although the noise cancelling of buds is hard to get used to in my work environment. There are light indications for when they are on/connected/battery low/ etc. As well as sound indications when booting up/battery low/turning off. You can pause/play and adjust the volume on the earpiece itself. All in all, highly recommend, good value for the money."
1,Great sound. I recommend this headphones wholeheartedly
1,"Great product for cheap money."""
0,"If your phone is as low as your pants pocket the signal does not even reach, making these headphones useless. If you plan to hold your phone above waist level the whole time, they work fine, but who on earth would do that? Gave 2 starts because they do sound alright when the signal doesn't cut in and out."
1,"The good: They sound really good and the battery life and charging speed is awesome, you can literally charge em 20 minutes before heading out to the gym and youll be good for the gym session. The ear loop holders are super flexible and mold to your ear really good. I was working the heavy bag for 8 rnds after running 3 miles on the treadmill and they would stay in place!<br /><br />The bad: After using them for about  4 months the left ear bud stopped working all of a sudden, I contacted the manufacturer and they told me that this shoudn't happen because their quality control is second to non. They offered me a refund or a replacement since I am currently stationed in Afghanistan I opted for the refund. I will buy this headphones again with the refund."
1,Awesome! I've been using these for am n pm cardio for most of my bodybuilding contest prep and they work great!
1,I was skeptic of these earbuds but they are amazing! The sound quality is great and I listen to everything from Latin jazz to hip hop during my workouts. The quality is just as good and arguably better than my apple wires ear buds. My 75 year old mother says she can hear me better than any other way I have used to talk to her on my cell phone also. As everyone says all the bonus bells and whistles are just a huge added bonus to the already amazing headphones. The company also sent a great welcome email after I purchased them that made me feel even better about my purchase. I will be purchasing another pair for my husband for Fathers Day and mowing the lawn. These earbuds and a waist belt have made my workouts so much better. Cordless is the way to go if you are weight lifting or running anywhere other than on a treadmill!
0,"These headphones are CRAP!!! 😡 They only have one button for all functions. When you try to turn them off they pause, then you have to try to turn them off again. When you do this you get a message in your ear saying ""dialing last phone number called,"" and And you have to scramble to get your phone and cancel the phone call. Then you have to try to turn the headphones off again...and it STILL will not work. It takes on average three tries to turn the headphones off when you’re done with them and on average at least two tries or more to turn them on when you want to use them. Sometimes when the headphones say they’re connected to your phone they’re actually not and music will still play out of your phone."
1,Short-term user. So far so good. Good quality sound.
1,"For the price it was a good buy. When the headphones arrived, it came with additional items such as a carrying case, a mount for the car.. The sound is good. Definitely recommend  product"
1,"Audio quality is pretty good, comfort is ok, it does not cancel much noise out at all. And battery is about 7-8 hours"
1,I had a pair Of these for a couple of years that were great! But they wore out so ordered another. These don’t seem to have the same sound quality as the others I had. I’m hoping that after I change out the ear pieces and have a better fit in the ear that they’ll sound better. Crossing fingers..
1,"What a great product, great sound, awesome bass. The price for it is perfect, it fits great. Will buy two more for my brother and my son."
1,"These were really decent for the price, however the quality isn't as good as some other brands that are equally priced. Do your research before purchasing"
1,These are AMAZING headphones for the price.  My first pair crackled a bit during low bass sounds and I decided to give a 2nd pair a try after reading some of the comments.  Glad I did.  Sound WAY better than Powerbeats 3!
1,"If there was a 4.5 star option I would give it that. I love these headphones but the cord is too long for me and it always gets caught in my hair. However, I love the power on and off, pause, and volume buttons. I like that when you turn it off using the button on the earbud, it also disconnects from your phone at the same time. The quality is great!"
1,Great products
1,"The sound quality of these headphones is great. Using with the Fire phone @ gym. Comfortable, secure fit. Also a great experience with the seller, Senso."
1,"I bought these headphones in April, 2017. They worked fine. I'm not picky when it comes to sound quality. But I noticed recently that the thin wire that goes into the right ear plug is fraying; the black plastic covering is ripped and you can see the small metallic wires. After 4+ years of minimal use, I guess I can't complain. I'll duct tape the wire and hope that will solve the problem.<br /><br />Sept. 2022: Since my 2021 purchase update, I've rarely used these headphones. In the last week or so, I've tried to use them and they're basically dead. I've charged them all day via the USB port and they barely hold a charge. Got what I paid for, I guess. Can't recommend these for the long term."
1,For the money these are great for music HOWEVER I've had comments that when I'm using them for calls that because the mic is so sensitive the background noise is too distracting. So if you're using them to do both music and calls I would look for something else.
1,This is my second pair I've purchased for my fiancé.  We moved and I lost his. He loves them. They are comfortable and keep a good charge.
1,Love it
1,They are working great. I wear them everyday during my workouts.
1,"They are cheap wireless headphones, but I frequently find myself reaching for them instead of by Jaybirds. They aren't perfect, but they stay in, there's a bit of wind noise when I run and the mic is not great. However, if all you want to do is listen to music while working out, they are solid.<br /><br />The main things I like about them are how well they stay on, and how comfortable they are. In both cases, superior to my Jaybird X3s. Sound quality, mic, charge, is another story. But they are a decent headphone for a great price!"
1,"Great headphones! I had purchased another pair of headphones and the sound quality was average. They also started to bother my ear. The Sensos had a great sound, even when I listen to podcasts. Definitely would recommend these and will probably get another pair."
0,"Purchased a pair of these head phones last August.  The headphones completely stopped charging/ turning on after several months.  The company replaced the headphones which was great except the replacement pair ALSO stopped working.  I have literally owned two pairs of these headphones, both with light use and no excessive wear and tear and both times have failed under 6 months.  The company did not agree to replace the second pair which shows that they do not stand by their product.  It is safe to say this product is a piece of junk that will most likely fail after several months as I have experienced.  If you like the price, remember this is more of a rental price than a purchase because you WILL be buying a new pair.  I highly recommend shelling out a few more bucks for a more reputable product.  I'm skeptical of the highly regarded views on here.  Seems like a case of paid reviews to bump a product up the Amazon list..."
0,"They had 5 stars from me, but now 1 because I reported an issue with one of the headphones I purchased and they said they'd handle it. The headphones were under warranty, but it's been like 2 months and they haven't honored my warranty.  In fact they haven't done anything!<br /><br />So don't buy!"
1,"My daughter loves them.  Uses them schoolwork, soccer on bus etc..  Very happy with purchase and charge lasts a long time.  Delivered as expected."
1,Sounded great but over-earpiece is a little flimsy for me
1,"Great volume, lighter than expected. Great Value."
1,Great product at a great price. Comfortable to wear. Shipping was timely.
1,Perfect for watching TV. Just love these headphones !!
1,I'm very had happy with quality of the product and how it performs. Very clear.
1,"I like these headphones, about the only thing that i dislike about them are the ear clips, They are extremely flimsy and I have to keep adjusting them when I'm working out. I wish they were just a little more sturdy."
1,Great sound. I wish the clips were not as flexible!
0,This is for a man because it''s big for a big ears.
1,Good quality oor low price. They fit in my ear great and did not hurt at all.
1,"I have run for years. These ear buds are so worth the bang for their buck. Good sound, stay charged for long periods of time, fit well... and so reasonable. My first pair finally petered out after 5 years of using them consistently. So happy to see they were still available! They lasted through 22 miles of my marathon... and that was my old pair. I have to think a fresh battery would last even longer!"
1,"They feel very comfortable and the sound is REALLY clear and crisp..  I haven't had the opportunity to try running with them yet, but I am excited to be able to run without getting tangled up with the wires.  Very good value for money."
1,"Very comfortable.  Forgot I was wearing them.  Sounds good and stays connected,  even when moving around or outside away from the source."
0,"They don't stay around your ears! They are way too loose, and didn't work for men OR women!  Too bad, because the sound is really good."
1,These headphones are easy to use and deliver good quality sound. I've used them only a few times so far but have really enjoyed them.
1,Love these headphones!! Easy to sync and wear!! A must need for runners!!
1,"I received and have used them at work. They really work great, easy to pair with my phone, and do seem to last 8 hours, which is fantastic!"
0,Hi  I buy one the Bluetooth the disconnect automatically I lose my money I don’t recommend
1,"I don't like earphones that go to the ear hole because they would fall off when I would work out. These ones stay in place with the hook that goes over the  ear. The first time I used them they were not staying in my ear but it was all due to me sweating. I just wiped my ears and the earphones off and put them on and after that they were not a problem. The sound quality is really good. I am actually impress with the sound quality. The sync in is really simple. For the price I payed for this Bluetooth earphones, I am very satisfied."
0,Unit only works when the signal to the MP3 player (FM radio mode) is very strong.  Inside a building only static is heard.  Wired headphones work very well.  I'll do some more testing and possibly modify this review.
1,They have a Great sound!  They connect easily!  I recommend them to others!
1,"Headphones not only produce quality sound, but come with accessories including:  various sizes of replacement ear buds (which I've had to order separately in the past).  A great deal for less than $30!"
0,"The rating of one star is based on the fact that the headphones kept unpairing with my iPhone.  Sometimes I couldn't get it to pair at all. Sometimes it would pair at home, but when I got to the gym it was unpaired. Wouldn't pair up again. Tried everything.  Never could tell when it was going to work. When it did,  the sound was great. Wish it was more dependable."
1,"I gave these headphones a three star rating because from the moment I received them there seem to be a shortage.  I have to keep moving the cord. Around before it starts playing.  Once it starts working the sound is awsome.  In fact, had it not been for the shortage problem I would have given five stars. Theses are my second purchase of Senso Bluetooth Headphones.  I purchased one last year in May.  After a few months I got the same shortage issue.  I purchased a new set this year because I love the sound.  Will not be purchasing again."
1,I love these headphones but so much ! They truly are noise cancelling and the battery lasts 8 hours with a full charge. Best purchase I made so far in 2019!
1,"I'm really pleased with my purchase, thank you for the service and the concern."
1,"Fantastic!  I can't stand paying for perceived value... ie. Beats.  I also don't like buying garbage.  These are my 3rd pair of bt earbuds.  They have spectacular sound and are comfortable, but stay in my ears."
1,Nice set of earbuds.  Well made.  Excellent accessories.  So far great purchase.
1,Thanks a lot !!
1,I got it for my son and he thinks they are great.
0,SOUND IS NOT HD!.. more like tin can technology..
1,Work perfectly and have great sound
0,"Nice earbuds but the Bluetooth reception is really horrible when I used it for running. My phone was located on my arm, so it was not the distance or other interference.<br />Having said that, if you don't use it for running it works really well."
1,"The product worked just fine with the level of sound quality that I expected. I did not care for the fit (tried all of the sizes) and returned them. Good product, just not a good fit."
0,"This is my second pair to purchase, the first lasted right over a year which I was happy with, and I used them almost daily. BUT this new pair I got has problems. They don’t fit near as well, (strange because they look identical) but the biggest problem is connecting to blue tooth. It will say, power on, connected, but not be connected. Sometimes I have to turn them off and on several times before they finally connect, which is very frustrating. I’m disappointed because I loved the first pair so much, and these are so much more inferior. Looks like I’ll have to go back to my never ending quest to find headphones I like and can afford..."
1,This is great set of headset and I love them.
1,These earphones are great. Couldn't believe they came with so much extras .
1,"I am pleasantly surprised how great these headphones are working for me. I have weirdly shaped ears an most earbuds won't stay in place, especially when I am working out. I was even able to have a conversation on the phone while on the treadmill during the busiest time of the day at the gym and the other party on the phone was able to hear and understand me, which is a definite plus!<br /> The only con is the audio quality but that can be expected for the price so I'm okay with that!"
1,"They great, and arrived before the time!"
0,Updated- These were my favorite headphones. Others that I've purchased over the last few years don't match these in comfort. I like how they don't push so hard into my ear canals like many others do. These hang off your ears but stay in well. The BIG downside in connectivity. The sound drops in and out when I'm outside even when fully charged and the connected device is in my front pocket. Fine for indoors while exercising though. Not sure what the problem is.
0,earpiece around ear is to flimsy wont stay on ear
0,No bass. Left ear has half the volume of the right ear. Music sounds better just played out of my phone speakers than through these headphones.<br /><br />Syncing it to my phone was easy.<br /><br />I guess I got what I paid for.
1,"Headphones are nice and light and sound good.  Trying to find a combination of the earpieces that will keep the wind from affecting the sound of windy days, but other than that these are awesome."
1,"Very comfortable and convenient, sound is excellent, good base quality"
1,I like it
1,Greatest pair I've ever bought
1,I buy this for my friend
1,I love the comfort and close fit that these headphones provide. The sound is clear and more than loud enough for a great workout. I also LOVED the additional surprises in m package :)
1,There are literally hundreds of choices in light weight blu-tooth headphones.  The Senso model is a good overall choice.  The sound is EXCELLENT and they pair up with both IPhone and Kindle quickly and easily.  My only complaint is that I cannot keep them in my ears when I bend down to do things.  This is especially annoying when walking our Chihuahuas.
1,Great Headphones!  Easy to use and sound great!
1,Great for running. Service and delivery was perfect.
1,"These headphones are the best. I can walk around my entire house except for one bathroom in the corner and still listen with these. They have great clarity and very long battery life, I listen to YouTube on and of all day, take phone calls and only charge them each night. This is the second pair I have purchased from this company. Sadly I lost the first pair working in the yard (I had taken them off and they were mowed over) I bought another pair because they work so well. I have tried several others and haven't had such good results."
0,"The state of the battery charge seems to have a big effect on how well they receive the bluetooth signal. The bluetooth signal is prone to interference from other radio signals, and that's VERY annoying at best. I'm an old(er) guy and have hairy ears. They don't stay in well, as I expected . They do sound fine when they're working well and fitting well. I don't expect good bass response from earbuds under any circumstances. These don't exceed that expectation, and when they fail to stick in my hairy ears it's even worse."
0,"The connection is horrible I am unsure if it is because of my cellular service, but the music doesn't play consistently without interruptions.  They are not comfortable at all, just my personal opinion.  The round ear part is just too big."
0,"I have been told that when on a phone call I sound like I am in an echo chamber, and nearly impossible to hear.  I have small ears and it makes them sore after about a half an hour.  The sound quality is fine, but again, not call quality.  They also look pretty giant on your head."
1,"I purchased these so I could listen to classical music at the gym. So far I've just used them at home; the gym test comes tomorrow AM.  So far they pair well with my iPhone and the audio quality is the same as or better than the hardwire headphones.  I have one suggestion.  The R and L indications are so small that many may miss them.  I would suggest taking a clue from the hearing aid manufacturers and coloring the right earpiece red and the left one blue (like the political parties).<br />(added).  After a week, I really like the headphones.  There is a problem at the gym in that their wi-fi cuts in and out so I don't get the music streaming that I want.  I now use them at home to watch TV.<br />After using them for a few months, the on/off switch broke. Not having read the warranty, I purchased a new pair. I read the warranty that came with the new pair and contacted the vendor.  After asking me to perform a quick test (which failed) they sent me a new pair of headphones.  The customer service is terrific"
1,Perfect for working out with! Stay in ears well enough. Sound quality is surprising great.
1,Good product! Reasonable price
1,"I do not like earbuds, and I actually like these.  Impressed with sound quality.<br /><br />This is my first Bluetooth wireless headphones, so it took a few attempts to figure out how to set up and use - like 10 minutes.  Used the small tips - default tips were way to big for me.  With the small tips these are very comfortable.<br /><br />Never falls out of my ears, and I use these for jogging outside, as well as working out in a gym.<br /><br />No chafing, so no chafing either from the loops over the ears.<br /><br />Controls are excellent. Easy to use while running.<br /><br />Con - increases the sound of Wind blowing over my ears. I do mean increases, taking the earbuds out and the noise dies away. So running outside can sometimes be annoying.  Any strong wind and I cannot hear anything but the roar of the wind."
0,very poor sound quality. returned it.
0,"These headphones are pretty much unusable outdoors as even the lightest breeze will get picked up and come through the earbuds louder than the music you're listening to. If you only plan to use them indoors, then they're probably alright."
1,great headphones
1,They work great<br />Easy to pair with my iPhone<br />I bought the extended warranty<br /> Bought on amazon<br />Arrived on time and came as described<br />I liked the package the earphones came in. The headphones come iwith a neat little case that keeps them protected when not in use.
1,"I got these because my last Bluetooth earbuds weren't terribly loud, and, well, these definitely solved the problem! Also, my last set would fall out of my ears toward the end of my runs when I'm all sweaty, and these haven't yet. They're very comfy and they stay on. If you have longish hair, they're a fun combination between too discrete to actually use as a headset (I mean, you could if you don't mind strangers assuming you're talking to them), and too bulky to discretely listen to music at work. Not a problem for me, but I've definitely scared a couple strangers! They're significantly bigger than what I'm used to (I'm also used to much lower volume and shorter battery life), but they're not too heavy at all, and there is a blue light that flashes at some long interval that makes it less than discrete. Definitely the best experience I've had with bluetooth headphones."
1,"Very nice product. Very comfortable, excellent sound and easy to use.  I would highly recommend this product."
0,I returned these because the audio stream would cut out intermittently.
1,"Decent base when fully pushed into your ears, but mids and highs are muddy at best. My clients couldn't hear me when using microphone, so it's essentially worthless to me. Build quality is high, packaging is great. Wish they were just a little better where it counts."
1,"In terms of general use, these get the job done. The battery lasts long, they don't take long to charge, they're comfortable to wear, pair with my phone easily, and have a good sound quality.<br /><br />However, After owning them for only a few months, it has some severe issues with connectivity. Sometimes if I move my head too fast or sometimes when I'm walking, the sound starts cutting out like crazy. This used to be infrequent, but now it's almost a daily occurrence that has me back in the market for more reliable headphones. The sound has been cutting out even when I'm just standing at my desk, and it drives me crazy.<br /><br />I suppose you could do worse for what you pay for, but I was hoping for more longevity."
1,"Impressed with these wireless headphones. Had them for over 6 months and still working fine, I use them most of the time when I’m at the gym."
1,Worked amazing for the 4 months i have had them . However they wont charge now. I have tried different cords and let it sit as well as wiggle it and it just won't change. These have been my favorite purchase. Just sad they died so soon.
0,I'm very disappointed with this purchase. These are not high quality ear buds. They do not stay implanted in the ear and the sound quality is terrible. The sound is distorted. I have stopped using them.
1,There is only two cons to these headphones. One is that they aren't super easy to put on. I never really had wrap around head phones like these so I'm sure I'll get better at putting them on. Secondly I found it weird that you can't really see the battery percentage but once your headphones are low on battery it makes an annoying beeping noise.<br /><br />But other than that I really am enjoying these headphones a lot! Sound quality is great and I can walk away from my phone a good distance before it starts cutting out.
1,"Earphones are great so far! Only issue is the earbuds are a little uncomfortable and don’t completelt fit my ear, but they get the job done. For the price, I’d purchase again!"
1,great value
1,So far so good this is after having it a few day<br />I run this a lot<br />Time will tell but so far great sound and works even with a lot a sweating<br /><br />I like these so much I got a second set for when one is charging<br />Use them a lot now<br /><br />Update and this is a big problem returns require a printer like ever one owns a return printer<br />and also have been having problems on this on and newest one that the right ear keep cutting out random no reset or anything fixes it
1,"Pretty good. I'm not a high end user of headphones, so they pass muster for me. I do get occasional gap in the Bluetooth, and I suspect a better (more expensive) wireless headset wouldn't have that as much. I use them mostly for running and working out and they do a fine job for what I'm looking for. They have no problem staying in my ears. For the price they are more than good enough for me."
1,Very impressive sound awesome for the price can't believe the nice case and wires that come with it very pleased with the whole package and again for the price awesome
1,These are great for my workouts because I like to listen to my lectures and podcasts for my college classes while I'm exercising. They work good at canceling out other noise. The battery life is good but it does take a while for them to get a full charge. The bluetooth does have good range as well.
0,"the ear loops are not comfortable, and cannot be removed. It also takes 10-20 seconds to be connected to a device."
1,These headphone are very comfortable. Both my husband and I use them on our stationary bike. My husband has also run on the treadmill with them on and it's the first time he's found headphones that work well to run with. They connect easily to multiple things (bike & TV). Would recommend them to anyone who wants a nice light weight headset that is comfortable on the ears.
1,Excellent product and service. Came with all attachments necessary and simple instructions. Quality of earphones is outstanding. Very impressed with range of sound / clarity / bass and treble. Very satisfied.
1,Very happy with my senso headset!!
1,I ordered these earbuds in January and they just started malfunctioning. They had a long battery life and best of all never struggled with tangling . I messaged the company yesterday about the now faulty headphones and they immediately responded and assisted me. I was very happy to see such a fast turn around and that I was actually speaking to humans. Great job Senso!
1,"Delivered as expected.<br />I have only used these headphones once. Paired to my device easily. Sound was good. My only negative was one of the ear hooks is too bendy, i'm constantly re adjusting it. Not a big concern. Overall very happy."
0,I loved these headphones but after 5 months they broke.  The right ear thats turns them off/on broke and no longer works.  I took very good care of them kept them in the case all the time when not in use.  I was on stair stepper and loss connection - took them out of my nears and the right earbud  was disconnected and could not be fixed - very disappointed.
1,"I just got these a couple days ago.  They sync up very fast to my iPhone 7.  Sound is great, especially for the price point.  I got them so I could charge my phone and also listen to music via Bluetooth.  I haven't tried using them for working out yet, so I can't say how secure they would be while running.  They do a good job cancelling outside noise as well and will run all day at work on one charge."
1,"I bought these along with the similarly priced #1 bestseller TaoTronics headphones (link below) that are the simple earbud design (not over-the-ear like these ones) to compare and choose which one I liked best for the gym (without realizing I would have to pay return shipping...). I was fed up with wired headphones always getting tangled and now I don't need to keep my phone in my pocket when I'm doing squats and such, which is GREAT!<br /><br />After brief comparison the Senso was the clear choice for me. I chose these because they came with a nice case I can throw in my backpack, a car charger and have a couple hours of extra battery life in comparison (which I have yet to test). They also have A LOT of bass...so much that I have to turn it down in my sound EQ on my phone even though most of my music is hip-hop and EDM. The TaoTronics seemed lacking in that area, so I preferred more over less. Also I like how the buttons are placed on the actual headphones. The TaoTronics have a bulky and long remote attached to the cord (pics don't do it justice) dangling from your ear that looks like a long ear ring (think Prince). Another thing is the pairing to my phone and other phones is QUICK AF! (To be fair, they both were quick)<br /><br />Minor Dislikes:<br />1. A bit bulky...but that's what you get for less than $40. For sizing reference go back to 2008 when everyone was wearing the single bluetooth headphone for phone calls (cheers to you if you still are) and imagine one of those in each ear connected by a wire. In my opinion they are still better than the TaoTronics because those look like extended earbuds coming out of your ear and reminds me of those metal bolts on Frankenstein.<br /><br />2. I also find myself adjusting these in my ear more often then I'd like because they bow out and look even bulkier and the sound is affected.<br /><br />In summary, I think these are great with respect to the price and my use of them.  If I were to use these more frequently than just my hour or so in the gym every other day I would definitely consider testing out the Beats ones or Bose for sound quality and comfort/fitment.<br /><br />PS You CANNOT wear these under a full-faced motorcycle helmet. I look forward to when these things are cheap and tiny so that I can do that.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B01GNYFT8E TaoTronics Bluetooth Headphones, Wireless 4.1 Magnetic Earbuds Stereo Earphones, Secure Fit for Sports with Built-in Mic [Upgraded Version]]]"
1,"Sound quality is decent and the battery lasts quite a while.  The Bluetooth range seems to be fairly short, more than a few feet and you will get stuttering"
1,"So far, so good!"
1,"Great product, great price; loving my new earbuds. Only problem is the short charging cord but my cell charger works w/ them."
1,Bought a set for me and my girlfriend. We BOTH want a second set. These were purchased for our gym workouts and have been perfect for the active movements. Great sound quality and the mic was a plus!
1,Good sound. Easy to use. Love it
0,I have had several of these in the past.  The last pair came and the volume on one side was significantly louder than the other side.  No matter what I did I could not get it to work properly.  I had a lot of things going on at the time and I missed the deadline to return them.
1,"I like it easy to use,good quality,so far so good,hopefully will last longer,I like the 1 year warranty"
0,They are ok. Bluetooth is a little weak. One ear hook is larger than the other.<br />Major issue is that they don’t charge well. Not sure if it is a headphones issue or a charging cord issue. I asked the seller for a new cord - will have to see what they say.
1,"There a few nice features to these headphone, and a few compromises I've had to make to use them. The sound is really good, bold and loud! They charge really fast compared to the other three bluetooth headphones I've owned, and that has made them super convenient to use often. There are no doubts when they are charged, when they are connected to a device, and when they're powered off. However, they struggle to connect with devices, meaning the sound is really choppy at the beginning when they are supposed to be connected, and then it kicks in after about a minute, even when fully charged. Also, it has been difficult keeping a steady connection when my iPhone is in my pocket, and haven't had this problem before with other headphones. The biggest issue for me is the headphones pop out of my ears constantly when I am doing something active, although I've tried two different sized ear buds that came with the headphones. I haven't experienced that before with similar earbuds. Could be the weight of the earbuds is causing them to pop out. The ear supports really do not do much because they are flimsy if you are doing something active while wearing the headphones."
1,Works great.
1,"Don’t buy those if you care about the water resistant IPX rating.  Mine got wet and failed. Looking at them more closely it’s easy to see why, as a gap in the plastic headphone housing lets light and water through.  It easily pops off and you can see how all the electronics are right there exposed to water.  If you just want Bluetooth headphones under $20 that stay on snugly, with thin sound and no water proof expectations, these will be good for you."
0,The headphones stopped working after wearing them only 3 times. There is no place on Amazon to allow for a return. Is this possible to return as they do not work.
1,Our son has gone through quite a few &#34;cheap&#34; sets of earbuds. He researched and decided on these himself.  The SENSOs are by far the best quality and are holding up well - a great deal in our opinion.
1,Good quality and great customer service from senso. They stay in my ear (no ear buds ever do) and they feel good and are well made.<br /><br />I had an issue with my first pair and got an exchange with a discount. Phenomenal customer service.
1,These headphones have superior sound and they stay put while I am exercising.  I have had more expensive brands before and these are the best I have used.
1,"ugh... have to change my review... they were great for about 9 months, then right just stopped working. It was never dropped, no water got in it, nothing - no damage except for the right earbud just stopped working after going in and out for a week...<br /><br />Re-ordered a second one... for the discounted price of $29.99 and boy are these not the same... why say they are discounted when the product is just a cheaper version, and I'm praying they last longer, but not feeling great about being duped. I don't feel like returning because they still work, hopefully longer than 9 months... say a few years?? The new ones do not have smooth, flexible silicone hooks like the original (they are just plastic), battery life is not 8 hours like the previous ones (more like 4 to 5 hours) and they do not charge as fast as the previous ones. the wireless cord is also stiffer... sound quality noticeably different - first ones had amazing sound quality.<br /><br />I don't hate them, but for $29 bucks... they feel cheap, especially compared to the short-lived first ones."
1,It was a very good buy..I love it
1,love
1,"Great product. I was skeptical about buying wireless headphones, but it has been the best purchase I have made in a while. The sound quality is excellent, and the headphones definitely cancel noise. The only negative I have come across so far is the range for Bluetooth connection. For example, If connected to my laptop in my bedroom, I would disconnect when I am in my kitchen. That said, I automatically reconnect when I get within range, so it is not a big problem at all. Overall, this product has been excellent, and I would recommend it to anyone."
1,Great sound quality for the price! Stays in place during my runs!!!
1,"I got these in Feb 2018 and I am still using them almost daily at the gym. These are amazing quality headphones. Don't be fooled by the price I was surprised by the sound quality. I only used Bose products before I got these but these are better than Bose. They hold the charge for almost an entire week. I am surprised with the negative comments about these products. Pairing is easy and range is good. I am not paid to write these reviews these are honest and genuine review, I waited an entire year to write this, buy with full confidence, won't regret it."
0,"The sound is awful. These are possibly the most muted-sounding earbuds I've ever tried, and that's saying something. Between whatever they do electronically and the molded earbuds themselves (think ear plugs), they do a decent job at noise cancelling. But if you don't have it cranked real loud, the sound quality is so poor your experience will not be good."
0,No sure why the reviews are high? Sound quality is bad. Like even for 30$... theyre built horribly! Every time I repositioned the right one in my ear I would ALWAYS accidentally crank up the volume absurdly high or I would turn it off. This is due to the fact that the buttons are VERY poorly placed.
0,Bought two of these both worked for about 30 hours usage then the bluetooth is unable to connect to any devices and the lights remain constantly flashing.
0,"I have owned the product for a month and it has already stopped working.  Connection and sound is constantly going in and out (and product has been kept in the case and used sparingly).  Didn't realize you only have 30 days to return, so future purchasers should take note of that time limit."
1,Great sound & price👌🏽
1,"Great sound quality, super comfortable,  and long battery life! If you are looking for bluetooth headphones I would highly recommend these!"
1,Very good
0,These stopped working after 35 days. Just after I am able to return them! Don't waste your money.
1,"Great headphones, clear sound nice bass, just what I needed"
1,"Sound is great, easy sync with phone, price is right"
1,You really can’t get much better for this price. I’m an audiophile but these are just my workout headphones.<br /><br />The headphone stay in no problem. They have a slightly boosted low end which could make it sound a bit muffled but most people wouldn’t noticed.<br /><br />Phone calls do work seamlessly by the quality is muffled and it doesn’t sound the best.<br /><br />DOES last 8-10 hours.<br /><br />Other wireless headphones I’ve tried:<br />I tried the Powerbeats 3. Trash. JBL reflect mini beats are also good and those are my other pair I go to. Much cleaner sound and better with phone calls.
0,Worked great for two weeks after first charge it stopped connecting with my cell phone:(
0,I really liked these while they worked. Both pairs i bought broke after a good months use. Bummer.
1,"I LOVE these headphones!!! I have to use the smallest size buds, and these are perfect! They are easy to use, and pair QUICKLY with my iPhone! Once I put them on, I didn't have to fidgit with them at all on my 5.5 mile run! The quality of sound is amazing!!! I highly recommend them to everyone who is looking for a great product at a very reasonable price!!"
1,A very nice product. I have owned hundreds of headsets over the years .  These are definitely on the high end of the market in reguards to over product quality and performance
1,"These bluetooth headphones are amazing for the price. They are almost as good as my powerbeats for a much higher price point. They are not quite as sexy as the beats but they do have 1/2 of the sound quality for 1/4 of the price. Which means it is a great value. I also like that it includes the latest version of bluetooth 4.1. Also, it includes lots of nice extras like a car charger and carrying case which are unbelievable at this price point. Not the best on the market but for a sub-$40 price it cannot be beat. Good job Senso!"
1,Great for the price. The base was a little overbearing at first. But after a few uses they settle down.
1,Product has started to cut out when connected. Did the factory reset and this hasn’t solved the problem.
1,"Never leave reviews but don't waste money on major brands. Support the small guys and get a superior product. Great sound, loud base and noise cancelling..."
0,Finally got to use these and was super excited when I opened it only to be 100% disappointed in the sound quality. I have $10 headphones that sound better. Of course I missed the return window by 5 days...sigh.
0,They wouldn't stay on my ears. The overall design is not great. There is a part that bends behind your ear that is adjustable but I would have to keep adjusting it every song or so because they just wouldn't stay put. They turned out to be a big hassle which defeated the purpose of having wireless ear buds. I do not recommend this product personally.
1,"The headphones themselves are great, great sound, great accessories for the cost.  Also fantastic customer service, my earbuds had broke due to my own doing and they had replaced them no problem.  They fell within the warranty time but still by the time I reached out less then 24hrs they were already shipped."
1,Great & affordable headphone.  Excellent qualilty without having to deal with a cable.  Love handsfree!!  Had to order a 2nd one because lost my last one on a trip.
1,thank you
1,"Great headphones, nice and compact. Good sound quality. The phonecall/mic quality is not as good, but who cares I primarily bought these for listening to music"
0,Couldn't get them to connect.
1,"Great sound. Easy to pair. However, I did not get the car mount or the wallet. I did get the storage case and a nifty white iPhone cord plus a black micro USB and a car charger. I didn't need the car mount or the wallet but the product description includes them so...where are they?"
1,"They arrived on time, came in a nice package with extras (dual usb car charger, usb charging cord, adaptable charging cord for android and iphones, extra ear tips). Great price for the value and all that you get!"
0,"Didn't last two months. Easy to use, acceptable battery life. When they worked, the sound was decent, but not great. Not terrible headphones for the price if they lasted longer, but they stopped working completely on their own. The right speaker stopped working and I thought they just needed a charge, so I charged them, not even a light. They came with a nice case, charging cable, and 3 different size ear bud sets, but none of them would actually stay in my ear while doing simple exercises, which drove me nuts. The behind-the-ear piece is so floppy it serves no purpose. Looks like I'll be trying a different pair."
1,the best
0,"Great earphones for the price but not what expected when riding on my bike past 10mph. The headwind made it seem like the earphones were really cheap with the wind cutting off the signal from my phone that was in my pocket, phone conversations were difficult to understand. Only reason why I gave 2 stars was the extras that it came with and comfort. Other than that, unless they come up with a solid casing I will choose other brand"
1,Love them!
0,"Decent headphones with good sound quality. But, if you wear them in a windy situation or in an open field, all you will hear is wind. Super annoying"
1,"Excellent headphones.  They fit well, they're comfortable, sound great, synch well with my pixel and the battery life is good enough that I can use if for a couple hours at a time over a couple of days without recharging them.  Highly recommended."
1,"I like these headphones from what they are. The only thing I really don't care for is the sound of the bass in them. I listen to a lot of dubstep at the gym and I don't expect good bass out of little headphones, but the bass sounds inflated and artificial. Other than that, for the price, they are great bluetooth headphones. They come with two charging cables, a carrying case, and a 12v car adapter for charging which was surprising for as inexpensive as they are. I've tried other Bluetooth headphones for cheaper that ended up being garbage, but I really like these ones."
1,"Very great sound, last 8 hours +. I have owned alot of head phone and this one is my favorite."
1,"I bought these during a deal day and really really like them a lot. Had them on when visiting my parents and my mom borrowed them. Then she wanted her own and asked me to get them. Then my dad borrowed hers and insisted he get his own pair too! Also purchased them for a friend as a gift for a friend who and he wears them every day at his new job. Really good battery life, great sound, fit comfortably."
0,"I started using it many months after buying them....Ok, silly me, but it shouldn't matter. Just couple months into using them , left one is not working most of the time... I was expecting way longer life from something that supposed to be used for running"
1,"Love these!  I was looking for something I can use at the gym.  They stay in your ears, sound great and super easy to use with my Samsung."
1,Sound quality is good. The ear piece is a little too big so after prolonged use they start getting uncomfortable.
1,I love these they are very comfortable and swear proof. I love the sound it is just right for my needs. Overall I use them to play music while I do my basketball workout drills. They are awesome cuz they stay on when I run or jump.
1,"Packaging was great but my ears do not mold well to ear buds period. I prefer the head set even if u have to clean them, the quality sound and bass is not enough for my music."
1,Love them but they stopped working just past the 1 yr warranty
1,"Amazing sound, very user friendly and comfortable. I would highly recommend them to my friends and family."
1,These headphones are great and the sound quality is impressive for a relatively inexpensive pair. The fact that they're cordless is a plus.
1,"For the first few months these headphones worked flawlessly, truly waterproof, great sound quality, and comfort. I have used these headphones everyday since I purchased them. That has caused some technical issues. Every now and then they would start not working right, first they would not sound right. Since these headphones didn't work properly, I contacted their customer service and they would tell me to do a factory reset.(hold down multi function button for 7 secs while they were being charged) That worked for a while, but my recent issue (which happened months later). Just the headphones not sounding how they used too. They weren't as loud as they used to be and one side played next to no sound. This is an issue for me so when I contacted their customer service, they are apparently sending me a new pair to replace the old one. (Since their go to problem solver factory reset didn't work) For those of you who are on the fence to buy these, buy them. They have a 1 year factory warranty and great customer service. I highly recommend them."
1,"These are excellent headphones. I consistently have trouble with headphones falling out of my ears, especially during exercise. These stay put and are very comfortable. The sound quality has been great as well.<br />They come with a nice carrying and case and multiple chargers, including a car charger. I like that they also come with cord management so you can tighten up an extra slack. I wish I had gotten these sooner!"
1,I am blown away by the quality and performance of these headphones. They have great sound and battery life. I had a charging issue probably due to the socket and they shipped out a replacement within 1 day! Definitely recommend!
1,These headphones have great sound quality and hold up well when I work out.
1,Didn't like that the play and pause button was in your ear basically
1,"only used them two days but so far i love them, they connect very easy and sound great, the reason i only gave 4 stars is i dont know how they will hold up . i use them all my work shift and so far they have been great<br />."
1,"I got these for my boyfriend. He loved them but had a bit of difficulty connecting them to bluetooth. However, a few days later, our dog got to them ..quick little bugger chewed them up and destroyed them. SO here I am , getting new ones. Pretty good sound quality for the price though, if I have to get some for myself I will definitely come back. Thank you!"
1,"Good sound, not great but good. Battery lasts a long time. Reasonably comfy, comes with different size tips along with some soft, isolation type tips. These may not be studio monitors, but if you're bee boppin' with your phone running Pandora or similar, they're perfect for the price.<br />You can talk through them to answer phone calls too. Not stealthy, by any means, but I really like 'em.<br />If they last a reasonable amount of time and then die, I would not hesitate to buy them again."
1,"Worked fairly well until about 14 months after purchase (2 months after 1 year warranty expired) - decent sound, fairly easy/consistent pairing, fairly comfortable.  No real complaints until the left ear bud stopped working.  Decent for the price but not good for the long haul."
1,Great bluetooth headphones!!! Very loud with amazing sound for the price. Buy these.
0,"I bought this for my daughter as a birthday gift as she wanted a wireless ear bug for a long time for running.  We are both very disappointed as the left hanging loop is made bigger than the right loop, they are not symmetrically made and we just don't understand the reason.  One side fits fine but the other side is too large and just can hang on the ear.  I am returning it and need to find a different brand."
1,These headphones are perfect and not as annoying to charge as I anticipated.
1,Great product while at the gym or at home on the couch. Great sound and holds up to a sweaty gym sesh. Look like beats but without the cost.
0,Got it to pair on one device. Could not get it to pair on a second device as there were no longer any pair recordings on headphones. Good Luck!
1,Excellent product and excellent service. One of the best products and services I used.
1,"I have had these headphones for about a week and worn them several times. They are super comfortable and have really great sound. For the price, they are a steal. I bought a pair made by TaoTronics a few weeks earlier thinking they would fit me well, but they didn't work out like I thought they would and the battery life was only about 4 hours. The Senso has a much longer battery life, they fit comfortably while I am working out or running on the treadmill, and they come with a nice case, extra charging cord and one for the car. Cool extras! Also, I like where the controls are. On the other brand they were on the cord and with the extra weight the cord kept moving to that side while I was running and I kept trying to straighten it out. With the Senso, it is on the right ear piece and they have a little thing to slide on the cord so you can tighten it up in the back and it doesn't move around while running. Bottom line... these are a terrific price, they have awesome sound and base, they fit and I don't think you can go wrong with them."
1,"I am so very happy with my purchase, other ear buds fall out of my ears, the audio is so very clear, must buy if your shopping around!"
1,"So just received my headphone would like to say from the start handsdown the best ines I have ever had, I like the fact that you get a power cord and car charger include and the nice carrying case in it self is so nice, so sound quality perfect I only have to use level 3 to stop all the outside chatter. The tips that it came with fit bit only down fall that I already knew was the ear pience that loop around your ear they are not able to be fitted to your ear no deal breaker since they stay in place pretty well, but like I said just got them out the box oh yeah the outside box preset cool also."
1,"These DO NOT fall out of your ears, I've gone through 4 pairs of earbuds trying to find a pair that stayed in my ears. Sound quality is superb for only $30"
1,"i liked the product. sometime it takes time to connect again, but when connected works great"
0,The hooks are too soft and they keep falling down while running. Returning them.
1,"Wore them to the gym the other day. Sound was great, no issues with sweat. So far so good. Thank you!!!"
1,I tried two additional headphones that were more expensive before purchasing these. The sound quality is amazing. The fit is very good. Excellent for running and lifting weights. Easy access of controls. Overall performance is awesome!
1,These work great.  I have a hard time wearing anything on or in my ears for a long period of time. After a bit my ears hurt.  I am able to wear these longer than most.  The only thing I wish is if they had a bud that was a bit smaller than the small ones that came with it.  I have small canals and a slightly smaller bud would be more comfortable I think.  The packaging was nice and the extra charger is nice.
0,Did not have them long before the left speaker completely quit.<br /><br />Bluetooth connectivity is spotty at best. Was forced to forget device then resync nearly every time. The speaker for phone conversations is worthless.<br /><br />Look for better options on here with flawless reviews and don't waste your time or money on these.
1,these are the best!
1,Great headphone and great shipping!!
0,broke within a couple of months
1,These are great! Easy to pair with iPhone. I wish they had an actual on and off switch rather than having to hold the button down and wait for the voice to tell you it's turned off . Trying them out on my run today to see if they stay on better than my old Lg wireless headphones
1,So far the best wireless headphones I've purchased.
1,These are awesome... i love them.
1,These ActiveBuds Bluetooth headset are wonderful.  The description of the product is all correct.  They are easy to pair up. They are very comfortable long lasting. Great price for these. They don't hurt yours ears. They come with a case. Charging cables. I will be buying this product again. The sound is all clear . When you talk you can hear them.
1,"Just received them so I can't commit on long term physical sturdiness. First impression, was impressed with the quality of the packaging and the extra items (charger and cords) that came with the headphones. I don't consider myself an audiophile so I was confused when I saw some reviews complaining about the sound quality, was surprised after pairing with my iphone SE and placing them in my ears, the sound quality to me was much better that expected and I didn't have to turned them up loud at all. I found that during my walk the headphones had no issues with staying put and were very comfortable. I'm glad I bought two pair grey/black for me and red/black for my wife which she loves. For less than $37.00 a piece, the ability to skip/repeat recorded music and take/make phone calls, I'd say these are a slam dunk."
1,Sound is worth the price! I like how the over ear piece is flexible and goes to your ear type and every accessory it comes with is awesome definitely worth what I paid can’t believe it was worth more!
1,"This is my first pair of bluetooth headphones, and I'm no expert, but they are certainly just fine so far. Had them a couple weeks now, I use them a handful of times a week for an hour or two at a time and they haven't died yet. Seems to stay put but I haven't done anything super vigorous. Comfy. Feel like I'm part of a cool club now with the wireless headphones."
1,Incredible service. 2 day shipping ended up being 1 day. Headphones are perfect. Even come with a case and are comfortable.
0,"These work well enough, but why must there be a flashing blue light from the right earbud every five seconds when you're using them, after they've already paired with the device? If you wear glasses --or use them with sunglasses-- this will drive you crazy."
1,Awesome
1,"These headphone's were purchased in April and sounded great but now won't charge in the dog days of August.  Bummer, I have purchased at least three pairs and recommended that they be purchased by others who followed through in the last two years.  I think I am going to check to determine if they have a wired offering.  This would have been a five star purchase otherwise."
1,"The sound is good in my opinion, you can really feel the bass with these headphones while there's enough clarity with the mid-highs as well."
1,"I ordered these for my husband.  He likes to take his music with him when he goes hiking and the headphones he was using just didn't have any staying power.  I bought these based on the long review done by Cubichi on January 8, 2017.  Cubichi mentioned that the headphones were sweat proof which was an important consideration as my husband runs much of his hike.  My husband says these work very well and the sound is great. The price is reasonable and I signed up for the 30 day free trial of Prime so that the headphones would arrive in time for my husband's birthday."
1,These headphones are so good and durable that they have been in my Washer and Dryer and still worked surprisingly fine after.
1,"Awesome, thank you! My first pair of wireless ear buds and they are awesome!"
1,Very happy with the headphones. My wife has also ordered some.
1,"This is a tough review to write, because the headphones may well be everything they were designed to be, but my wife nevertheless asked me to return them. We bought them to supplement, and hopefully upgrade, a less expensive pair of SoundBEATS headphones that she uses to watch shows on her iPad around the house and in bed. The battery wasn't lasting very long, so these should have provided a longer battery life - with the others as backup - and probably better sound. Unfortunately, she didn't find them comfortable. The over-the-ear loops didn't fit quite right and the bulkier earpiece (which probably supported a larger battery and better acoustics) was also uncomfortable, especially lying on her side in bed. So, without even having a chance to verify whether these offered far superior battery life or sound, these went back to Amazon."
1,"I'm incredibly impressed by these, I was wary because I don't normally spend $30 on items like this. However, the call quality was great and the bass is amazing! I had zero issues connecting my bluetooth, and the battery life is really good as well. It came with 2 usb cables (3ft and a few inches) and a usb connector for the car, and a cool little zip up case to keep it all together. Well worth the purchase!"
1,"Overall it works, not stable, reconnect is very slow after power on and with noise during the switch to the headset. Repair has trouble after lost pair not sure how it lost the pair, and have to switch off and on the Bluetooth on the phone to repair. For $39.99, it may worth the value, definitely not $199."
1,"These are the best headphones you can get for a good price. The battery lasts for longer than I need it, they are very durable and I've recommended them many times."
0,Didn’t like them at all
1,don’t waste money on the BOSE or other expensive headplugs. these work just as GREAT. love them..
0,The product did not come with everything the listing shows..Missing bonus items..
1,Excellent sound and noise cancelling. Very easy to set up and pair.<br />The set even comes with 3 different charging cables including one for the car cig lighter and additional ear buds in different sizes. Also a convenient zippered case to store the ear buds is included. Very satisfied with this purchase. So far a very good value for the money.
1,As described
1,The over-the-ear support is excellent for exercising. And I can certainly vouch for the sweat proof claim as I swear profusely when working out - hiking or biking. Excellent audio quality. Much better than others I’ve used.
1,They were for my grandson and he uses them all the time. They work well.
1,"Just got and used at the gym this morning, they help in place better than I thought, sound is good, and for my personal needs they are great.<br />As of yet, not sure on battery life as of yet, as I just got and only have one day of use. But for the price these are doing everything I was wanting. they are light so they don't weight down on the ear, and fix nicely."
1,"I purchased 2, one for my daughter and one for myself.  I use mine while at the gym, they are super comfortable to wear and have very good sound.  I was concerned a little bit about the ear pieces because my daughter wears glasses, but the ear piece is so soft and flexible that she hardly notices it, she enjoys running and they fit well and stay in place."
1,The earpieces are made of a super soft silicone & I don't feel them at all. They are very clear and loud. Comes with all kinds of cool little accessories & a nice caring case. Well worth the money.<br />I wear one almost all day at work with the other in a shirt pocket to listen to podcasts & I burn through earbuds pretty quickly. I'll most likely be picking up another pair of these for backup or replacement pretty soon.
1,"I ordered the SENSO Bluetooth Headphones in preparation for my Pixel 2 XL phone which has no headphone jack (sad). I did not want to spend more than 50$ on earphones, and these ones seemed to be the top rated on amazon. I've been using them for a few days now and they have exceeded my expectations. The headphones come in a nice case, with a charger and extra earbuds. They also seem to have an iphone charger adaptor fitted on top of a standard USB charger which feels very premium. The sound from these is much better than the Beats earphones that I've used in the past. I don't like the placement of the button on the side, but I think that's the only con with these. The battery life has not been disappointing - Lasted a good 2 hours before I stopped using them. The wire connecting the earbuds is a tad too long in my opinion and could have been shorter, but it's nothing major to stop anyone from buying these. I'd definitely recommend going ahead with buying them!"
1,"I wear these headphones when running and am very pleased.  Sound quality is great, noise canceling is good, pleased with the battery life.  They stay in your ears when running, if you are on the treadmill you can hardly hear the belt.  I use them with a 7th gen iPod nano and they sync quickly.  Ive tried them with other devices and they have no problem syncing.  Had them on the other day and left our workout room in the basement and went upstairs and noticed they started to cut out when I was on the patio, then I realized I left the nano downstairs: These things are awesome for the price!  I can't understand why anyone would buy one of the high priced sets like beats, other then they want to show off."
1,"I've really liked these headphone so far! Great for running, they don't fall out of your ears!"
1,These earbuds are great!  They came with extra charging cables and a two port car charger along with a carrying case.  I was concerned with whether or not they would have good sound quality but they sound as good as my bose speaker.
1,"so far,they are performing great.ihaven't worn them long enough to test the battery life.sound quality is pretty good for the price!"
1,"I was surprised how good these ear buds sound, couldn't be happier with the purchase."
1,I was looking for a bluetooth headphones that I can use during my workouts and so far very comfortable and the sounds is very good.
0,stopped working after only a month use.
1,Easy set up. Stay on your ears. Comfortable. Look bulky but don’t feel bulky. Great price.
1,"I bought this product initially and I was very impressed with audio quality and battery. I had recommended this to be purchased for my department's staff and they all were impressed as well. Recently, I contacted the company for warranty coverage and to my pleasant surprise, after a couple of emails exchanges which happened within half an hour, company sent a replacement headset. I can't be any more happy with the product as well as the support they have provided. I believe for the price you get an excellent product and support."
1,"I liked these earphones, they are cute, easy to use and the sound is good. I bought them because I go to a loud gym and I wanted to dim the noise and listen to my podcasts. They didn't do much for the din with the regular ear tips but the foam ones helped alot. The cord that connects the earphones is annoying because it pulled whenever I turned my head. The big problem is the earphones are too big for my ear canals, I was unable to wear them for more than ten minutes or so before my ears began to hurt and I had to remove the earphones. I am returning them and will look for something for smaller ears."
1,Does not have the volume I'm accustomed to! Not loud enough for my taste
1,Your headphones are great  i have no problem with them so far
1,"I have had these for about a week, and I'm liking them so far. They don't work for phone calls for me, I have a Nexus 6p. I have tried it multiple times and every time, the caller says they can't hear me. I was hoping that this feature would work for me, but I bought them for listening to music while I work."
1,"Great full range sound and comfort (especially with the squishy earbud options).<br />Easy, intuitive interface and great included accessories."
1,Awesome headphones good quality
1,"These earbuds actually worked really well for a while.  I bought them March 2018, good sound quality and they actually stay in your ear.  But all of a sudden the Bluetooth won't work.  I've tested other Bluetooth devices and they connect quickly to my phone, but the earbuds won't.  So they're basically useless now.  They were nice while they lasted, but I guess you get what you pay for."
0,Please don’t waste your money on this product
1,"By far the BEST headphones I have owned!! For me, I think these are better than the 🍎. Js! 5 ⭐️ Now if y’all would make them completely wireless I would be in heaven!"
1,"I am not an audiophile. These sound really good. My only qualm is that the part that goes in your ear that it came with, while pretty comfy, reminded me of earplugs. They had visible ear wax on them after about a week of use. I make a normal amount of ear wax, in case you're curious :) The ones I replaced them with really are not as comfortable. After about an hour my ears a sore."
1,"These worked great for a while but now, less than a year after buying, there’s been sound quality issues with skipping or crackling sound in the left earbud and I’ll definitely need to replace soon."
1,"Extremely impressed with this product. Great bass fantastic sound, I couldn't be happier."
1,"So after my last pair of bluetooth headphones went belly up, I went and purchased this set as a replacement.<br /><br />Pro's:<br />Huge amount of base.  Seriously, these are great for listening to music with as they really do pack a punch.<br />Very nice carry case, my last ones came with a faux leather bag, these ones come in a zipper clam shell case that's a good fit.<br />Two nice accessories came with this, a charge cable for the headphones that's also some sort of apple connector too (I don't know which type, I don't have any apple devices) and a double 12V power adapter for the car.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The sound may have a huge amount of base, but this makes the sound itself very murky.  You'll really want to have a good equalizer to get the sound somewhat normal sounding.  So good for music maybe, but terrible for watching movies or tv while working out (the bass just drowns out the dialogue).<br />The lowest volume setting is actually a bit loud, you try to go lower and it just mutes the headphones.<br />The pairing feature doesn't work.  Seriously, you're supposed to be able to hold the power button down when powering it on and have it pair (as standard with bluetooth headphones), but the only way I can get this to pair is by doing a factory reset each time.<br /><br />So thoughts?  I'll probably use these until the day they go belly up, but honestly, I wouldn't make a repeat buy due to the pairing issues and murky sound."
1,These are waterproof and packs a great clear sound. The ear loops fit perfect (I tried 4 different kinds without success).
1,"Sound quality is great and controls are nice, one in a while they will start hurting my ears, which usually means I gotta pull them out of my canals a little bit"
1,"These work well- pair easily, sound good, etc.  My only complaint is that I can't get them to stay in my ears while I run.  I have tried switching the eartips but to no avail.  The hooks over the ears don't help because they not rigid.  I had a pair of Beats wireless before these and never had a problem with them staying in my ears."
1,thanks so much! they work great! will buy a second pair.
1,These are wonderful. Comfortable and the sound quality is excellent. Can't wait to keep using these.
0,"don't waste time and money, big, bulky, doesn't sync."
1,"Nice Headphones, thanks"
1,"These headphones do their advertised job but not much more, which for the price, is totally fair. My biggest gripe is that all three sizes of rubber tips did not fit my ear and I frequently found myself re-adjusting the headphones mid-workout. A minor nuisance sure, but when you're running at more than a jog it can become annoying. Other than that, great sound and a sturdy earbud. If you want wireless headphones but don't want to pay over $100 for Bose or Apple, this should work for you."
1,"My SENSO Bluetooth headphones arrived when scheduled and packed very nicely. After reading the instructions, I charged them and paired with my phone. Everything went just as explained. I was surprised at the sound and product quality. The only problem I had was turning them off and going to bed.<br /><br />If you're looking around for wireless ear buds keep in mind that these come with everything you need and then some. I noticed that similar products didn't include the case, charger and spare ear pieces. purchasing all the extras separately would make the others much more expensive.<br /><br />The company emailed me to check on my satisfaction. I was very impressed with their customer service. I would not hesitate to recommend them to everyone. I'm looking forward to using them often."
1,"This is my first pair of wireless Bluetooth buds, so after much research, I chose the SENSO ActivBuds Bluetooth Headphones for price and features.  I use them at the gym where they have the low bass frequencies I like for motivating me on the treadmill, the comfort and fit for a two hour workout, and the style which means they don’t fall off.  Thanks!"
1,"I have been using various styles of headphones for years - on-the-ear, over-the-ear, and in-the ear.  I finally narrowed my preference to in-the-ear earbuds, but could not find a pair that were comfortable, would stay put and loud enough.  I bout the SENSO Bluetooth Headphones three months ago and couldn't be happier.  The stay in my ear without constant adjusting and fidgeting with them.  The ear pieces are very comfortable.  The best features are the long battery life - a whole week at the gym without having to recharge, and the volume control.  Highly recommended."
1,"These headphones are a great value and as the other reviews talk about, for earbuds, they stay in great! I can do whatever...twist, turn, pick up laundry, cook all without these budging. I haven't given them a good workout yet, but the audio quality on them seems great. The only thing I am having a little bit of trouble with is people complaining they are having a hard time hearing me. The mic is built into one of the earbuds and that seems to be a slight disadvantage over other types of headsets. But the good far outweighs the ever so slight negative. Everything as described in the package and the communication with the seller has been great."
1,I bought these earphones for my mom as a gift and she loves them! Not only can she hear the music clearly she can also talk on phone hands free! I'd say you should give it a shot. The quality is great and they resist sweat since I have my own and have wear them to workout. This is a perfect inexpensive alternative to the wireless Beats.
1,"The best Bluetooth headphones I have tried.  I was totally surprised by the quality of the sound, especially at the price it was offered.  I have not tried using the headphones for listening to movies yet and cannot testify to its dynamic range for soundtracks."
1,"The sound of these headphones are great, but if you have little ears small head the loop over-the-ear is too large but they do fit in your ears well. I contacted the company as soon as I tried them on and tried to wear them the next day, and the customer service that was given was an outstanding 5 if not a 10 they immediately took  care of the problem with a quick solution. I do recommend this company."
1,This reviewer' first stab at using bluetooth--and this product is great.  Am listening to a podcast (just discovered that bluetooth goes in and out when the microwave is on; interesting); excellent range of distance from audio source; they feel quite comfortable; easy to use.  Just walked dog while listening..hey! there's the phone ringing--just did call by bluetooth.  Definitely works for me!
0,The charging port collapsed inside the device
0,"I just took these wireless Bluetooth headphones on their maiden voyage. The good news is they are very light weight, have three sizes of eartips (medium comes on them and fit just fine), and when they work, they work very well and are easy to charge and set up. The bad news is that they do not work consistently at ALL. Maybe I just have a bad pair? I am walking along, listening to Pandora from my phone with these, and the sound kept cutting out--on, off, on, off. It was very annoying. I will give them another try tomorrow when there's no construction going on in my neighborhood (although I doubt the machines were interfering), but I'll probably be returning these as defective."
0,I bought these specifically for swimming but they do not work in the pool.  The are labeled as waterproof for up to 3 feet but this is not accurate as the sound cut off after only a few inches.
1,"Have had these for a few days. I am an engineer and own an extensive collection of electronics for music reproduction. I bought these for use when I mow my property. I was using a pair of wired earbuds but since I put my phone in a compartment on my tractor fender I had to remove it every time I got on or off. These eliminate the needs for wires. Also they are affordable enough that I am not concerned about using them to do lawn work in.<br /><br />Now for how do they fit. They come with 3 ear bud options to fit your ears. I find them to be comfortable and I am not a big earbud fan and prefer over the ear headphones. But for working on my property these are awesome.<br /><br />How do they sound. Very good. I am loudspeaker designer (hobby) and have extensive experience with inexpensive and very expensive sound systems. These sound very good and will satisfy 95% of folks. I have learned over the years some folks aren't happy with sound equipment unless they have to take out a second mortgage to purchase it. Either way these are very pleasant to listen to, sound is balanced not overly bassy or overly bright."
0,Quit working after having around 6-7 months!
1,"Good: they work, low cost, not poorly made<br />Bad: weak highs, too much bass, not very ergonomic, lots of wind noise when riding a bicycle."
1,Like it.
0,"These are listed as IPX7 which supposedly means that they will continue to function in up to 3 feet of water.They do not. What they do do is _recover_ after being placed in water.<br /><br />I purchased these earbuds so I could listen to audio books in the tub. I did some research figured out the limitations of what IPX7 supposedly means, then figured I would give it a try. Ok, I admit I am a quality assurance tester for a living so I had to test it. I figured, seeing as they were good up to 3 feet, they aught to be fine if I laid back in my tub (max depth 1foot). The second they were fully submerged under an inch of water, they ceased functioning.<br /><br />Now, to their credit, when I pulled them back out they resumed functioning. Which is why this is not a 1 star review and I didn't immediately return them. That said, even when they are not submerged but are simply under the shower spray they will intermittently cut out. If left too long they will start to misbehave, triggering random buttons etc... So effectively, they can get wet, you can shake them off and they will probably be fine, but don't expect them to actually work while wet."
0,"I bought 2 pairs of these about 3 years ago, I loved them my daughter just had to stop using one pair just last month they are great but I bought this new pair & theyr not the same, theyr plastic, they start to get hard to hear & full of static when I walk 5 ft away from my phone it takes 2 tries to turn them on or off. I'm so disappointed I won't be buying that brand again"
1,Awesome! Great sound! Good bass! Wearing them outside all day for work and love how they stay in place!!
0,Sound quality isn’t good
0,"They worked great for 3 months then broken down. Then with warranty they gave me new ones. Those stopped working for no apparent reason and then offered me to BUY new ones despite me having warranty. Terrible service thus and no point in buying ""cheap"" headphones if in the end they are going to charge you 3 times for them and end up paying for the equivalent of a bose or beats one. Don't buy them."
1,They are great. Very worth the money spent. The sound is so rich and warm. Very impressed with these wireless buds. And waterproof!
0,"Not worth it. I purchased 3 of them and they all lasted about 3 weeks. One of the buds would stop working. But even before then, they would cut out and keep trying to connect. When they reach about 30% it will say battery low non stop. The battery life is way too short, and they would constantly fall out."
1,"Honestly, I'm not normally one to put much effort into rating an amazon item unless it is truly spectacular. I have been happy with these headphones since I purchased them 2 years ago. I haven't written my review until now because about 3 weeks ago I accidentally left them in a pair of shorts that got washed in my washing machine. Thinking I was definitely going to have buy a new pair, I still gave it a long shot chance to dry before purchasing a new pair. Sure enough after 2 days of drying I charged them and they started right up with zero defect. Truly the best purchase I have made on amazon for the little money I had to invest."
0,"I don't care for these headphones at all. First of all, when I use them during a call, the person I'm talking to can't hear me. Also, when I listen to music while working out, they quit working either during a song or in between songs. I'm also disappointed because the volume is very low at maximum level."
0,"This product works for about 4-6 weeks, starts making a loud humming noise, then dies.<br />My first pair broke within 6 weeks of purchase. I asked for a replacement because the product was under warranty. The replacement headphones arrived, and broke within a few weeks. I wish I could just get a refund.<br />I have since bought other headphones - I recommend you do the same."
1,"I just started running at 55, gearing up for my first 5K, I ordered these from Amazon, and was hoping they would drown out the birds, dog, other runners wheezing, my wheezing, and make my run more enjoyable. I tried them just this morning, and listened to i-Heart radio, my run was so much more enjoyable. They work as designed, my music was clear, the earpieces worked flawlessly, I bought two of them, as the price was good, and my wife needed a pair. 5 stars from me!"
1,"Bought these for the gym. LOVE how it came in the mail, packaged and it looked neat and the ear phones were charged when I got them! I recommended these to a friend and she loves them!"
0,"I did not like the way they fit in my ear and whenever I moved around the music quality changed. Also, the right earbud broke (it came out of the earpiece) with no cause from my action and the company would not replace them."
1,Great sound and battery life! I love these ear buds!
1,"I really really love these headphones, only complaint is I wish the battery lasted longer. I can get 2 busy days out of them at max which isn’t the worst but isn’t the best either. Sync up with my iPhone with ease, and they come with a carrying case and some other neat gadgets. Bought some for my whole family!"
1,These headphones are awesome
1,"Hello,<br />I like the Bluetooth headphones and what I like about it is it has smaller sizes ear buds to place in your ears.  I think this is a great product and  I am please with how quickly it was shipped.  Thanks."
1,Very good
1,"I love them, clear voice and good battery life."
1,"Outstanding sound... !!<br /><br />I've owned several pair of ear buds, but these keep getting better and better."
1,Invotek not only contacted me to make sure I was happy with the product but also was able to resolve an issue with the previous pair I had getting them going again. Very happy with the product. They fit well and don't fall off during workouts
1,"had these for over a month now and so far, we love them!  Ordered two pairs - one for me and one for my husband.  Sound is great!! Definitely not noise cancelling but the sound can crank up to a point where they can be.  :)"
1,"Love them.  Great price. They connect to phone Bluetooth almost instantly...better than any others I have used.  Comfortable.  Had a warranty issue, and customer service replied within a few hours with a suggestion to solve the problem.  When that did not work, in less than 12 hours a replacement was sent. Excellent everything."
1,like them!
1,"Great product, I recommend this."
1,Fast shipping and the Ear Buds are great.  Thanks
1,Everything I wanted and more. Thank you
1,I dont care for them.. fall out of my ears and are uncomfortable.
1,Nice fit. Great sound. Just when I turn my head sound drops micro second
1,Charge doesn't last as long as I would like
1,Don't waste your money. These headphones are pretty terrible. They're uncomfortable and do not fit well.<br />Just some rebranded versions of the other heavy as heck and clunky wireless headphones.<br />However they did arrive in a timely fashion and were exactly as advertised so I rated them a little higher than I wanted to.
1,"These are great!! They stay in place, have clear sound and are sweat proof. I like that they are cordless and don’t get knocked off by me accidentally pulling the wire. Looking forward to enjoying these for a long time to come!"
1,"The headphones worked but reception was spotty, I did a factory reset and they worked fine. I liked the headphones. The problem I had was that they would not stay on my ears when I was out for a run."
1,"I bought these over two years ago and they have held up with no issues yet.  The sounds quality for me is fine.  If you're expecting audiophile SQ, these aren't for you but if you want to enjoy your music while on a run and still be cognizant of your surroundings these are great.  I am a heavy sweater when I exercise and have never had an issue with these crapping out due to moisture.  As a comparison in the past I had two pairs of Sport? Power? (can't recall exact name) Beats that broke from sweat/moisture.  The earbuds still charge quickly and hold a charge for a long time.  I had a pair of Jaybirds that suddenly would not charge or even turn on after less than a year.  One thing that I did notice with these, the Bluetooth sensor must be on the right side and you will want to run or carry your phone on your right arm or side.  Otherwise you do get some cutting out of the music.  It took me a couple of runs to figure this out.  And the more stationary (use an arm band vs keep in pocket) the better.  But overall these earbuds work like champs at a fraction of the price of the other big names out there."
1,My husband loves the headphones!  The sound is great!
0,"Sound is great. Solid bass. Great features...redial, answering, song change but...they will not stay in my ears. Maybe it's just me but I'm gonna have to return them unless I can figure out how to keep them in my ears. They are constantly slipping out during my 3 mile jogs.  Useless product so far. I'm going to try different ear buds tomorrow. Fingers crossed because they sound great when I'm sitting still but the mos t annoying headphones I've ever worn while jogging."
1,"I love these headphones! I'm using them when I walk the resistance pool at the YMCA, and couldn't be any happier with the comfort, the sound, and the value!"
1,"My first bluetooth headphones so I don't have much to compare to. As a first time purchase I do recommend these especially for the guilt free price. I got these for about $35, but for the price the sound quality is great, the bass is deep and the sound is clear. I have a set of Audio technica mtx50's and I enjoy the flat tone to them and comparing these to the technica's, the Senso has some bass to them."
1,"At last!!! Bluetooth earbuds that stay in place. They sound, feel, and look great! Aside from the S, M, and L buds my favorite are the memory foam. Hope I can find them on the website. Looking forward to seeing what's next."
1,Love my ear phones. Run with them 3 times a week. Super comfortable.
1,"This has helped me work out longer and harder - mainly because before I would get super frustrated from accidentally ripping out the buds from my ears from the average earbud headphones during a workout. Super glad I made this purchase, definitely one of the top purchases I've made this year."
1,These are bomb
0,"I bought these headphones for biking.  When I wear them listening to music while biking, I can hear the microphone blowing in the sound.  I can't figure out how to stop that, I want to disable the microphone when its not in use... product is flawed."
1,Great sound and funtions. Excellent value!
0,Didn't even last a year. Fail.
1,They have to be charged just about every day and they aren't being used more than 4 hours
0,Bought 2 pair of these headphones. The first pair is dead and will not take a charge. This was unfortunately just outside the warranty period. Let's hop the second pair hold up better.
0,The ear-hooks are just floppy nonsense. These wouldn't stay in my ears and are useless to me. I lift and run in the gym and the slightest tug on the cord yanks them out of my ears because the ear-hooks are USELESS!  The Sound is nice and loud. The controls are NOT to my liking. The side mounted pause and play button is badly placed. The volume up button is on the back and the volume down is the forward button ( seems counter intuitive).  With all of the high reviews (14k at this time) I recklessly purchased these without thorough research and now I sorely regret it.<br />I am going to just buy another pair of Photive  wireless because I liked those but I thought I was going to upgrade since the Photive are 2 years old now......I was wrong!  oy vey!
1,"They work well! The sound is good & they don't shut off frequently like some. I have been told that I am sometimes difficult to hear on calls, but not sure that this is the headset or the other person's reception."
1,"They are super comfortable to wear! Cancels out all the other sounds so of the gym. They do not hurt my ears which is a huge plus!! I have small ears so earbuds tend to make them super sore. They connect through Bluetooth really, easy volume controls, and easy to switch songs of the needs arise. I have not used the microphone portion of it yet since the need hasn't arises just yet. But I am certain with the quality of these headphones they will perform wonderfully. Thank you for reading my review."
0,"ive called 3x to get replacement headphones for my broken pair still under warranty . they put you through alot of attempts to reset headphones, i mean alot, that didnt solve problem so they tell you they will send your info to warranty dept which obviously never happens. ive called 3 times over 2 months and went through their crazy process 3x and nothing was ever done . never heard from them again.  the headphones aren't bad just know that if they fail before your 1 yr warranty is up they arent going to honor that warranty.  buy from different company"
1,I really enjoy the sound. It's high quality despite the low price you pay for the product. The only complaint I have is that the ear loop is a bit too big. I can't do high intensity cardio without the earbuds falling out of my ear but they stay in place during strength training.
1,Great sound. Comfortable.
1,"Very good sound, long lasting battery"
1,Bought these as a Christmas gift for my husband and he really likes them a lot. He said the sound quality is very good and they are comfortable to wear.
1,Great sound!!!!!!
0,"I purchased your headphones February 12, 2018 and used them the last 4 months. THESE HEADPHONES DO NOT PERFORM WELL. This is the 3rd set of Bluetooth headphones I've had and they are the only set I haven’t been completely satisfied with. There are two issues with the connectivity.<br /><br />First, when I connect them to my phone, Galaxy s6, I usually need to go into my Bluetooth settings after they finish pairing in order to have my media sound play through the headphones (it only connects the call volume on its own). I didn't need to do that with previous sets (same phone).<br /><br />Second, the connection to the phone appears to be extremely weak. When I run, hold the phone while walking, or even set it down next to me while I lift the headphones cut out. I know this isn't a phone reception/download issue because I have the same problem with downloaded content (audio books). This wasn't an issue with other Bluetooth headphones and I still have the same phone, so I do not believe the phone is the issue. It appears that the Bluetooth connection is so weak that you arms swinging at your side or moving your head can interfere with the signal. That is FAR too weak.<br /><br />Lastly, other Bluetooth headphones I have notified me of the charge level (High, medium, low) every time I turned them on. This was a convenient feature because your product has run out of battery on me during workouts, because there is only a 5 minute warning.<br /><br />In conclusion, I am frustrated enough with this product that I am replacing them even though they still &#34;work.&#34; I'm not usually the complaining type of consumer, but I have been growing more and more frustrated as I use them."
1,Awesome Bluetooth headphones for a great price. I use these for running and they stay on fairly good. It will come loose once in a while. Sound quality is great. I would recommend these.
0,These seem to have an issue disconnection with both my phone and my laptop. They work fine when they are connected. My laptop seems to get lost when this disconnects.
1,Not Bad for the price
1,"Very good battery life, good sound and no disconnection problems with blue tooth.  My favorite headphones I've gotten"
1,Bought these for my husband on Father's Day and he loves them
1,"I’ve only had these a week, but have been very impressed, especially with the number of accessories, including the carrying case and all at a reasonable price."
1,"Bought these for my wife.  She LOVES them.  Very easy to use and very lightweight and stay in place. She's happy, I'm happy!"
1,"I am a 70 year old who has never used bluetooth before but I am glad to dispense with all the wires while listening to audiobooks and music  on my computer and other devices such as my cd player and iPod.  It took me a bit of time to figure out how to put it on, but the sound is good as long as I don't get too far away from my device.  The sound seems very clear and the assorted ear pieces are very handy.  I used the smallest and it fits fine."
1,At first I thought the quality of the sound was bad. But as I switched songs I was blown away by the sound quality. For the price you can't go wrong with these. I've only had them for about two weeks so I'll continue on an update in the future.
1,"Great product! Premium look and feel. My dad works under the sun and needed comfortable earphones that didnt tangle, this product exceeds so far! Sounds bassy and one charge lasts him as promised."
1,"I love these. They even come with a carry case and several sizes of ear bud inserts. Thank heaven!  I get ear pain from most, but the smallest buds fit great.  They also have a charger and all of it fits in the carry case. I just wish they came in more colors preferably something bright!  When I leave them on my nightstand it takes a while to figure out which of half a dozen black cables are the right ones. Even white would be ok as only my iPhone has a white cord."
1,too much static
0,"Works well.  Only one small issue, sometimes while using them they will randomly disconnect from my phone and I have to power them off wait a few seconds and turn them back one.  It's only happened a few times out of the dozens of times I have used them.<br /><br />Update Aug 3, 2018<br />The connectivity issues I was having have worsened, It happened again while I was out and I thought that it might have been due to a low battery so I charged them overnight, and then after about 15 minutes of use they disconnected again.  I turned the headphones off and on, turned the Bluetooth on my phone on and off but could not get them to connect."
1,"Good quality and very affordable price, so far I've purchased them three times onefor my mom, boyfriend and myself, we all love them. My boyfriend and I used them for working out and they are easy to use and the sound is great, they are very light and they stay put. I absolutely love them."
1,"Love these! I got these as a gift for my husband is a dj/producer and he loves them. The quality is so crisp and clear and sounds really good. Plus it has a  cool design aesthetic with the cords behind the head, especially for men. Packaging is really good too..easy to carry and store hard case. Great buy!"
0,"I purchased this product back in August, 2017. They've were great for about a month and randomly started having problems maintaining connection with my phone while playing music. It wouldn't disconnect from bluetooth, but I would get consistent skipping and connection ""buffering"" while walking downtown Chicago as well as in the burbs. I ignored this  awesome new feature as I figured out how to stabilize the connection by placing my phone in a different pocket. No biggie, right? 3 more months go by in this manner. A week ago, the left earbud stopped working entirely.<br />I immediately remembered this product had a year long warranty and reached out to the company to see what they could do for me.....Still no response."
1,Great buy for the money. Sound is good but could probably be a little better however they are excellent for the price. I wear them mostly for running and I’m very pleased.
1,"I bought two of these units, one for my wive and the other one for me. I have only had the head phones for a week but they sound great and preform great - I used them in the gym. I want to add that this company gives phone support which is very impressive......"
1,"These headphones have been everything that I've wanted, and more. I don't normally post reviews, but after searching for a nice pair of wireless headphones, these turned out to be not only an amazing value, but as good as my much more expensive Beats. I've had them for a week, and don't have a complaint. They are clear, have decent base, and have lasted the advertised 6-8 hours on every charge. I still can't believe the price-point. You not only get the headphones, but you get a car charger, as well as a lightning cable, that is also a charger for the headphones, as well as a nice case, and another charger. Don't waste your time with any other headphones. These are not only worth your time, but your money."
0,Not sweat proof!!
0,"This comment is off the top, so to speak. Well here we go. I must first state my ear's (where the buds are placed (ear canals) are small & I wear glasses. Maybe even my ear lobs are unusual shape, I'll not of aware of this aspect though. First the positive! I find charging, connection to bluetooth easy and works  well. I do find the control mechanism on the right ear bud to be challenging. In all fairness I must state I am 75 yo and the movement of the fingers are certainly not like my younger years. Still working, but just not quite in the same way with complete flexibility. I find that if I put the left ear bud in first and then use the control buttons while in the palm of my hand, the setup process works better.<br /><br />On the negative side (for me) is that my ear buds just do not fit my ears, even the smallest buds, and the loops on the individual buds do not stay on my ears unless I am setting still and not moving very much. (I wear glasses and the frames are very small).<br /><br />Again, on the positive side I do enjoy using this headphone and having mu hands free while I am on the phone. I've used these headphone for approximately 1 month and they serve my purpose; however, if you wear glasses & have small ear canals, consider this a caution for you. I definitely could not use on a treadmill nor extensive walking.<br /><br />To the Manufacture: Perhaps in the future you could make the fixed part of the ear piece smaller and compensate with a few enlarged rubber ear pieces? If this is workable Manufacturing solution take a stab at adjusting the ear loop so that it adheres to all glasses, just not resting on top/side of the glasses ear piece.<br /><br />The two star rating is to my individual case ( and your if you have issues like mine): so if your normal (haha) these headphone's will work well and you should enjoy. Not a perfect world, but still quite the experience."
0,"These are horrible for running. No matter which earbud size I used, the right side (with all the controls) would fall out 10+ times on a 20 min run. The piece that goes over the ear is way too tall and not adjustable. It just bounced against my head constantly. And if you go to adjust the earbuds as they are constantly falling out, it was impossible to do so without pausing/adjusting the sound. Don’t buy this if you are looking for something for running."
1,Stay put very well
0,"The product is well made. The issue is distance . I use for swimming, and will only connect 1/2 length of the pool. Disappointing."
1,"Good sound, and charge lasts"
1,"While they don't sound as good as JBL wired units, they are FAR better than the typical cheap wired and every other wireless headphones I have Used.<br />Battery​ life​ is better than most and they are comfortable and secure."
0,"The sound quality was sub-par to begin with. Muffled with muddy highs and very little bass response. From the beginning these would cut out periodically, but after a couple months they won't go more than 15 seconds without cutting out. I know these are cheap, but they're not worth anywhere near the $20-something they sell for. Absolutely terrible."
1,"I've had this for less than a year and it's already broken. Sound is no longer stable across both buds. However, I realized that I had a years warranty with Senso and within a few hours, they processed a replacement for me."
1,These are great for running.
1,Exactly what I expected.  This was my second pair I ordered.  Very happy with the purchase and the company.
0,Died after only a few months.
0,These horrible earbuds stopped working within several days of delivery. Literally just went dead. I spent 30 mins on the phone w tech support and didn’t find a solution.<br />Strong recommendation to avoid purchasing this product.
1,"These headphones are a very good product, and at a great price. The sound quality is good and the battery life is great. Great for work or working out."
1,Great headphones!!!
1,"I commute to work on my bicycle every day and go to the gym every day. So, I listen to these a lot.<br /><br />Pros:<br />No annoying parts that go around your neck<br />Light weight<br />I like the part that wraps around my ears. Makes it so they don't fall off when doing bench press or crunches.<br />Good quality sound.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Poor battery life. I guess that is to be expected with the size of these.<br />Having to hold down the button for 2 seconds to change the song. When I'm riding my bike I don't want to have to hold it down for that long. Also, I listen to a lot of podcasts. The app I use allows me to skip 30 seconds ahead by hitting the next song button. In other words, you can skip through the ads. Super pain in the butt to hold it for 2 seconds. I just want to hit the button once. It is this way because the button is shared between the volume and song change. Resolution: put the next song button on the left side.<br />When pausing songs it takes a good 1 - 2 seconds to pause. So, if someone tries to talk to me they see me hit the button and then start talking. I have to stop them and tell them I didn't hear them or just take off the earbuds.<br />Earbud tips don't make the best seal in my ear. So, when riding my bike I get a lot of wind noise. I will be buying third party tips to help resolve that.<br /><br />Overall, I really like these. My cons list my look lengthy, but I would still buy these again."
1,Works awesome for the price. Good bass and sound quality. Fits well in the ears and comes with a few sizes of buds. Battery life works well and bluetooth has been great so far. I can keep phone in pocket or on a shelf and be 10+ ft away and still works.
1,"These earbuds are great... except they have broken twice. The multifunction button on the right earbud that controls everything has gotten stuck in two times, making them totally useless (can't turn on or off). After it happened to the first pair (about a week after purchase), I contacted the company and they graciously replaced them. Unfortunately, the replacement ones ended up having the same problem after a few weeks. I should mention though, that I bought a second pair right after I bought the first pair, and so far that pair has had no issues at all. The headphones are great when they are not broken... fit nicely in my ear, don't fall out, blocks outside noise, mic works great."
1,"Great headphones, I am pleased that they sent along spare, and different size replacement ear buds.<br />I purchased these headphones to see if I could use them in and near water.  I tried them in the shower to test them out.<br />I am  Very happy to say that the sound quality was excellant.  The volumn control worked well.  Although they got wet, inside and out of my ear, they continued to work and stayed on/in my ears very well.  I read that ""direct spray"" might be a problem, so i kept them out of direct spray as much as possible.  All in all, I am extremely pleased with the Senso Bluetooth WATERPROFF headphones.  Buy them, You will love them too."
1,Good product for the money. They don't fall off
0,"I Was So Happy When I First Got It. The Sound Quality Was Superb, Then 2 Weeks Later My Bubble Burst. It Constantly Beeps As If To Remind You Of a Low Charge, Even When Freshly Fully Charged. It’s So Annoying. Hefty Price For 2 Week Usage."
1,"The earphones have a good sound and the battery lasts longer than others I have tried.  A bit difficult for me to get on, but once they are on they do not fall off even when I am exercising."
1,"Been using these at home and work for six months now and they are still going strong! Bluetooth connects quickly and easily, battery life of several hours, comfortable and they stay in place. Fantastic for the price. Only complaint is that sometimes the audio is choppy when my phone is in my pocket, so I can't necessarily recommend these for running/working out."
1,Great value for the money.  I use them every day during workouts at the gym and so far no issues.  Easy to connect to the iPad and very decent sound.
1,Great sound and pairs quickly.
1,They are very good headphones just what I was looking for
1,I am using it for over year now without any issue - worth for price. Charging retention is great for this product.
1,Pleasantly surprised with these Bluetooth headphones.  I use them when doing housework and the sound is surprisingly good for both music and podcasts.  Agree with other reviewer that said red memory foam ear pieces are great!
1,"great sound, comfortable fit, easy controls.  The case and multi-source charging cable were a bonus."
1,"I'm still trying to figure out how I feel about these. I've run with them a few times and each time had a different thing I don't love. First of all, I can't get any of the plugs to stay in my ears right. I sweat a lot and they just slip out. I've tried all 3 sizes. Also, sometimes the Bluetooth is spotty even though my device is only 3-4 feet away at the most. Hopefully I can find a way to at least keep them in my ears while I run."
1,"Good sound , great price !"
1,"Great product, good price!"
1,"nice headphone.a bit smaller than thought they were. sound great, very comfortable"
1,"Quick delivery, easy to use and great sound!"
1,"These little phones have great sound and range. I can walk all around my house (1,700 sq. ft.) and not lose my connection. The ear straps are soft and flexible. I am so glad I purchased these."
1,Work better than expected. I use them mostly for podcasts while working outside or light exercise. They do seem sensitive to more than light wind.
1,For the price these are awesome headphones!  They work as expected and have good range.  They came fully charged which was very nice and have nice extras with them like a car charger.
1,"SENSO Bluetooth Headphones are a very good buy. The quality and design point to something much more expensive, and the sound is excellent...surprising in fact. I have a pair of HIFI MAN planar headphones and have had many other full size headphones so I care about sound. These are quite enjoyable and fit my need for gym, convenient uses."
1,Great headphones! Would purchase again.
1,"I was told of these ear buds by a good friend who was raving about them.  I figured if they lived up to half of his praises..I'd be a happy customer.  Imagine my delight to have my own expectations blown away!  I've had dozens of Bluetooth headsets and earphones over the years many at more than double the cost of these ear buds!  These &quot;ActivBuds&quot; deliver the best quality sound, least interruption and are the most comfortable unit I have ever had!  I am most impressed with &quot;Activbuds&quot;  and will be purchasing more as perfect birthday and holiday gifts!"
1,"I have had these for 2 months now and still love them.  Took a little getting used to in getting them on/in place, but now I pop them on/in my ears and take off for my run.  Great sound.  Easy to use.  I would recommend them."
1,"Really, really pleased with these headphones. I've only had them for a few days, but they're exactly what I was hoping for. Super comfortable to wear (the over-ear hooks feel like they're not there). They're great at blocking outside noise (they make a good seal in your ear). They're a little heavy on the bass/low frequencies, but that doesn't bother me. I'd prefer it to the tinny sound you often get with more inexpensive headphones.<br /><br />The packaging is nice. It's a superficial thing, but I feel like it shows more care for the product and customer if packaging is more than an afterthought.<br /><br />I really like that they came with a carrying case. My last set of headphones went through the wash because I had kept them in a cargo pocket and forgot about them. That won't happen now."
0,I would not recommend these headphones to others despite the relatively cheaper price compared to other wireless headphones.  The signal keeps on cutting in and out of the left speaker after just two uses.  I am getting a refund.  This is the last time I get Senso speakers as I have issues with them in the past.
1,Great sound quality and battery life seems very good.
1,"These little guys are awesome.  Admittedly,  I haven't bought in to the noise canceling craze,  but just being Bluetooth is awesome.  I get so irritated with the cords,  that at this price,  I couldn't pass these by.  Only reason that I gave it 4 stars is some of the echo/ feedback that callers have reported that makes me have to switch to wired.<br />The real test will be when I mow the lawn this summer.  I know these won't drown out that mower,  but as long as they don't snag on tree branches,  I'm good!"
1,Unbelievable sound and quality construction. Great value!
1,"The wires between the ear buds wore out after 3 years, the black plastic shredded and does not flex well, exposing the red wire inside which eventually broke."
1,"This is an instance where $10-15 more gives you a product of a completely different class. These feel pretty high quality, the packaging and accessories are top notch. I've worn them in the rain and showered with them in and they work fine. Battery life is probably 6-8 hours at a reasonable volume.<br /><br />Only con is the audio quality is just a lil bit lacking, but at least they stay in no matter what, which is more than i can say for any other cheap set that I've tried out."
1,"Really like these.  They function as describe,  The noise cancellation was a huge bonus, compared to my ear buds, there is a world of difference."
1,I got these Bluetooth Headphones for my husband as a birthday gift and he loves them.  The sound quality is amazing and you can be a good distances from your phone and you will not lose connection.  I would have given it 5 stars but the delivery time was slow.  His birthday had passed so I was disappointed about that.
1,Nice I love it guys thank y
0,The battery just straight went to hell on mine wont hold a charge gos form red to blue right as i go to charge.
1,I love these headphones! They work great super comfortable and don’t fall out even while doing CrossFit style work outs from burpees to handstand holds and walks. The sound is awesome and you get so much more than what you pay for the price I will prob buy a few more pairs just to keep on hand! I found that if you like something and use it a lot get a couple while you can!
0,The battery died and stopped working after using several months.<br /><br />It is disappointing.
1,"Great product, fast shipping"
0,"Useless for outdoors, wind noise is absolutely horrible."
1,I really like that they are water proof. I work outside so that's great. I can hear clearly to everyone I talk to as they can too. The case is an awesome extra as well.
1,"FINALLY. I found a set of earbuds that stay in my ears while exercising. The sound quality is good, and I am so pleased with this purchase."
1,Great sound for the price. I cut the over ear plastic off because it wasn't the right shape for my ears. They stay in great now!
0,"I was super excited to receive this item in September 2017, however it has already gone bad. It’s not pairing to my iphone 7. Very very disappointed consumer. Would like to return. I would have rated a ‘0’ if this was possible."
1,Best headphones I've owned for the price.  I've owned everything from generic apple headphones to Beats.  I use for running and lifting weights 5-6 times per week with no issues whatsoever.
1,"I like the headphones themselves. They're what I wanted structurally, fit well and everything. This review is just to mention that if you have an iPhone (at least that's what I have), the volume on these headphones is WAY too loud and will mute when you try to lower it more. I have it on its lowest possible volume, and my ears absolutely feel muffled from listening to music at excessive volume.<br /><br />This is probably a combo iPhone/headphones problem. Tried looking for fixes, and have been told it's not possible to fix using iPhone.<br /><br />Up to you whether you care about how damaging the volume will be on your ears over time. Like I said, haven't even used them for an extended period and already feels like  after leaving a loud concert. Not sure who's to blame with this issue, makes rating product difficult, but I for one can't use headphones like this since I like hearing and all."
1,"Much better than the first MPOW earbuds i bought. They're a bit more expensive, but they stay in my ear, louder than my last pair and they stay charged with regular use for a day and a half in my experience."
1,I am amazed at the quality of these headphones. They have such good clarity and I love the bass. I highly recommend them and should I ever need another set I definitely will use them again.
1,"The SENSO Bluetooth Headphones have extremely good clarity and noise reduction.  I have to wear only one earbud when driving or if I am somewhere I need to hear whats going one around mean because the noise cancellation is just that good.  However, when I am exercising I can get in my zone because the quality of the music I here is super fantastic."
1,AHHHHH!!! I just lost my first pair!! My 2nd is arriving tomorrow with another pair for my wife. Seriously stop everything and order these! I'll never workout without bluetooth earphones again. I use these all day. They're loud enough to easily hear podcast audio over my rowing machine! I'll never go back to conventional head/earphones.
1,Very good
1,I was skeptical because of the low price but they're actually very good!
1,Great sound and very comfortable.
1,"I wanted to (at least) have either 1 year of regular use, or the product breaking down, before posting a review of it.  I purchased these headphones in late October to replace a pair of Soundpeats headphones that only lasted me 6 months.  These SENSO headphones lasted only a month longer (7 months).  They stopped working on me mid-workout today and no longer charges when its cord is plugged into a USB port.  I use them about 4 times/week for about 1.5 hours/use while working out in the gym.  My workout consists of using the elliptical trainer and stretching afterwards.  After using the unit, I wipe them down with a soft towel and them stow them away in the soft case included.  I have limited experience with owning &#34;gym type&#34; (as advertised) bluetooth headphones, but given that designation, I assumed that they have some sort of water resistant/repellant/protection capability and that given some TLC, they would last (at least) a year.  This one almost made it.  I guess it's time to shop for some new bluetooth headphones."
1,"Dual plug cord broke within the forest few days, told seller and they took care of it right away."
0,When it worked it was awesome than after 40 days it stopped working and now will not even take a charge.
1,I use the headphones when I am jogging in the morning.  Being able to listen to my music without tangling the cord up is fantastic.
1,Sound great good battery fit good great price
1,"The range on these is pretty bad, but the sound quality and ease of use is great"
0,Broken after two months. Poir quality and Faulty product.
0,"The headphones were a good idea, then just broke, the battery is great and the charging time excelent, not that confortable but the quality isnt the best, broke in 2 months as the pictures shows.<br />Came with three adapters that are very usefull for any ear size.<br />The case is great and good quality material, and the car charger started to not work after 3 months.<br />Hope it helps you!"
1,"These work great.  I've never needed expensive headphones - I don't really understand the concept since these are clear and do the trick, and listening any louder would be asking for hearing damage.  But, for what I needed, these are great, and keep their charge well."
1,"They work for what I need. Sometimes have issues with people not hearing, but I mostly use them to listen to music/movies."
1,"Lost my $200 apple beats. Decided to go for this one online. I couldn't be happier. The sound quality is really great. This headphones actually have a better bass than the beats. The only thing I regret is not buying this in the first place, it would have saved me a lot of money."
1,"Great value. My wife uses them to run. Don't pay big bucks if it's not necessary to, these are great all around."
1,"Ok, so this is my fourth pair of Bluetooth ear buds that I have bought over the last several years to wear at the gym and this will be my last. These things are amazing. The problems I've encountered with BT ear buds range from sound quality, to battery life, fit and volume. They either fit good and are comfortable but sound like crap, or they sound ok but are dead after 2 trips to the gym.<br /><br />Senso has addressed every one of these issues. These things are amazing, I've never had BT ear buds this good. The sound quality is amazing, I've never gotten this much bass out of ear buds, not even out of my beats wired ear buds that cost $100. And the volume is crazy, these things are loud! They are extremely comfortable and stay in place, and I can get 6 to 8 hrs on a single charge. I can't believe you can get these at this price point with all the accessories included, and a 1 year manufacturer warranty...... what an awesome find. I would buy them again, let me rephrase that, I will buy these again. I'm thinking of buying a second pair for work. The reviews on these ear buds are accurate, I usually won't do reviews until less an item is really great or really horrible. Senso deserves this review, they are just simply that great."
1,"Why you should buy these?<br />I bought 7 of them in total! For me , friends and family. Used them for 2 years. Pretty rough usage. In the bag. In the helmet. In the gym and where not! Still survived for a good two years before one year stopped working. I mean, what more can one expect! Absolutely amazing earphones and even better service! They quickly and promptly respond and resolve anything which they can ASAP! They sent me a replacement the moment I informed them that one ear had stopped working for a 6 month old earphone! I'm a senso guy now! I just keep buying and will keep buying these!"
1,"Not actually waterproof, they just submerge it for a second and test them afterward. They do this super super annoying thing if you have charged them and like every thirty seconds it'll stop the song and say &#34;Battery Low&#34; it got so annoying that I came to right this review."
1,I love these. I seem to need to replace them once a year. This is my 3rd set. I use them almost daily.
1,I do commercial HVAC so I generally work alone. I listen to music most of my day on my iPhone. I go through over the ear headphones some make the grade while some get thrown away. Wow right out of the box these headphones are great ! Buy them you won’t be disappointed.
1,"Sound is good, not great.  A little light on the low end, but these are earbuds after all.  For me, slightly uncomfortable after two hours of use.<br /><br />For phone calls these are the best.  Great audio, great mic.<br /><br />Don't think I'm being harsh.  I ended up buying two more sets for other members of the family.  For the price, they're great."
1,I didn't want to buy those top brand super expensive headphones so decided to go with these and they're great. They last a long time. I was listening to the music for 8 hours straight and the battery still didn't run out. They're pretty loud even on the smallest volume setting and sound quality is good. I'm happy that I don't get strangled with wires anymore
1,"I Tried thm on and I had a Problem with a secure fit maybe if the piece behind the ear had some stabilty it would help, with that being said no matter what I did they would not stay and the reason I got them was for working out, other than that the sound was pleasing battery good, a nice package that it comes in, but being unable to work out in them is why I'm giving them 3 stars"
1,"I was in need of wireless headphones to use when completing my jogs. They have good audio, don't slip when you get sweaty, and do a good job of tuning your surroundings out. I most like that the earbuds come in three sizes so you can adjust as needed. The headphones also come with a dual charger, car port, and carrying case. It's definitely worth the buy. I haven't had any issues after a month so hopefully won't have to use the 1 year warranty."
1,"Very comfortable, and long lasting battery!"
1,This is my second senso ...it is excellent...my senso is much better that the ones I paid 60..80 and 100 dollars for
1,After reading all the reviews I decided to purchase these headphones . All I can say is WOW! They sound better than by beats headphones . The sound is amazing and what a great price !
1,Crystal clear sound priced right.
1,I like these because they have good sound quality and that they stay in my ears while I am working. They paired with my iphone 6 with no issues and are comfortable enough to wear all day long.
0,"I only got a few months out of them before they stopped holding charge. As in, I charge them fully (blue LED) and go for a 20 min run. The next day, completely drained with no sign of life. And yes, I made sure to turn them off.<br />Edit: The replacement they sent stopped working also. I'm done, these things suck."
1,"i bought this Bluetooth headphones for my husband who has used them once so far and has been complete satisfied with the sound quality, not to mention the ease of setup."
1,"Thank, fast shipping, good condition, working well."
1,vv comfortable
1,"I love this headphones, works great and the Bluetooth is so fast as soon as I switched on it connected to my phone. I never seen so fast<br /><br />overall I love this product and I would recommencement to everyone."
1,"Great value,quality and technology this headphone are amazing. I will recommend this headphone"
1,"So far these headphones are amazing! Nothing was wrong with them they give you an iphone charger, and two android chargers, also a car charger piece! I got them because I go to highschool and these children are so loud on the bus and these headphones fixed my problems, the charge last! Sometimes, I don't charge it up all the way and it still lasts. Worth the money! Every penny. Highly recommend!"
1,"These were great to run in.  They connected easily to my ipod, ipad, and android. They stay put, have great sound quality, and hold a charge through my 15 mile runs."
1,I received them in a timely manner. They seem to be high grade quality. What little I have used them so far they have worked great.
0,head set works fine.The wire tie was missing and after several emails to seller no reply.<br />Very poor customer service
1,Happily surprised at the sound quality. I use these at the gym with no issues running and sweating. The bass is really good.
1,Great head phones. Went for a run in the rain with no issue.
1,These headphones were recommended by a friend.  I’m glad I listened to him.  They were easy to set up and work great. I can use them with my phone or watch.  Shipping was really fast too.
1,"I admit I have tried these for only five minutes but oh my. So so comfortable. I thought they didn’t fit, because I couldn’t feel them."
1,"Great Bluetooth headphones. I’m 65 and found these very useful and comfortable. Its hard to see the plug to initiate a charge, and in low light trying to open the charge port the up/down volume switch feels like the charge port cover. I will buy a second pair soon and try to forget I’m getting older."
0,I got a lemon. I’ve had 5 pairs of these and all 4 of the others worked fine. This pair does not keep a charge and keeps getting disconnected from Blue Tooth.
1,worked fine for a year. but its button jammed up and it does not charge anymore
0,"Would not sync up with either my iPhone or iPad after a month of purchase.  Piece of Crap! Now only good for hanging tensil from on the Xmas tree, as it only gives off an alternating red and blue light.  Would not recommend."
0,"Initially out of the box everything was perfect.  I bought them to run with.  On my first run, I noticed I could hear the wind passing over the earpieces and it over took the sound of the speakers.  I tried ever set of ear pieces they provided and there was no improvement.  If you want them for the gym, they are perfect.  If you expect to run with them outside and there is even the slightest breeze you will be very disappointed in them.  I am returning them.  Honestly it sounded the same as when you are on the interstate and you roll your windows down.  That's how much the wind affects these speakers."
1,They worked great until the sound stopped coming out of the right bud a month after I bought them. They are comfortable and the sound quality is really good. The charge lasted a long time.
1,Please consider changing the location of the notification light as it is very distracting at night. When the earphones are on the blue light is bothering.
1,"SENSO Bluetooth Headphones, Best Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7 Waterproof HD Stereo Sweatproof Earbuds for Gym Running Workout 8 Hour Battery Noise Cancelling Headsets<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Insanely good value: comes with car charger, a nice case, different sized earbuds, a dual lighting/micro USB cable, another (shorter) micro USB cable, a coupon and a one year warranty.<br />- These sound great, the volume is one of the highest I've heard on bluetooth, and the sound is clear and responsive.<br />- Perfect for what I use it for. I really do not like handling cellular calls when I am driving . I use as hand-free answer kit, also I paired to my laptop to listen music. Battery performs exceptionally good<br />Cons:<br />NONE<br /><br />Final Remarks:<br />This is a good buy.<br /> These are great sounding headphones, probably one of the best sounding bluetooth devices I have used. I'm very impressed with these headphones, and you will be too if you decide to buy this headphones."
1,Great headphones for a great price
1,"I’ve had these for 2 years now purchased on nov 21,2016 and they still work amazing and battery life is around 7 hrs still even 2 years later of almost daily use. Including the gym and regular use for music and videos and tv shows. Most headphones battery life diminish to really low after a while. I highly recommend this headphones"
1,"PROS: lightweight, good sound reproduction<br /><br />CONS: getting the charging port uncovered felt a bit difficult, sound cancelling of outside noises not the best I've ever had in small headphones<br /><br />Overall I am very satisfied with my purchase so far.  I have been using it for a couple of weeks."
1,"This is my first headset ever, and I got it about a week ago to use on phone calls mainly, as my Lifeproof iPhone case makes it really a pain to be heard.  I love not having to pay a huge amount to have them.  I love the soft, flexible parts that go over my ears (silicon ear hooks according to the colorful user guide). I have a really small head, so hats, glasses, and earbuds never fit.  So far, I am able to use the medium eartips that came on the unit.  I will try the smaller ones soon, as the right one tends to come out.  But it's huge that it comes with a small set! I love how the status of the set is indicated audibly through the earbuds.  So, when I turn them off/on, it says in my ear, &#34;Power off, disconnected&#34;, etc.  That way if my phone or glasses are not handy, I know what's going on.  I love that the written instructions are clear, and each indicator light color/pattern is explained so I know when the unit is charging, fully charged, etc. I had no trouble whatsoever in connecting it to my iPhone 6s plus. I pretty much like everything about it, just trying to be specific for the review.  I've only found 2 negatives: the soft ear hooks are big on me, so I have to push them down to stay on.  But once I do, I can use my reading glasses as usual, taking them off and on all the time. I have used the Senso for a few phone calls indoors, and the callers say the sound is really good.  I did have to get my daughter to spell an unfamiliar city name for me - couldn't tell if she was saying Tasco or Pasco.  Maybe the smaller eartips will help me hear more clearly.<br />The service, which I haven't needed, seems like it will be great since I got an email from the company saying to contact them first with any issues, so they can try to make it right.  That's encouraging!"
0,"I've had these for a few weeks and used them quite a bit.  They are light, comfortable and easy to use.  I've gotten them wet (I'm sweaty) and dirty and they function fine.  The microphone feature is great for making phone calls.  Great product, particularly for the price.<br /><br />Well, after several months of use, I need to come back and adjust my review.  The won't charge anymore.  At first, if I toggled them around a bit and played with the buttons I could get them to recharge, but now they won't charge at all, so they are useless to me.  Perhaps it's not realistic to expect reliable headphones for 30 bucks. I am going to invest more money and hopefully get something that will last."
0,Used it once and would never hold a charge again!
1,Great headphones!<br />They held up for me for about a year then broke (sadly)! So I went to redeem the warranty expecting grief but was pleasantly surprised with a quick and polite response and new pair of headphones!
0,Pretty bad sound quality. Bad fit. There are better options out there for this price.
1,Not bad for price but definitely not even close to beats. And they dont secure very well around the ears either.
1,Love these ! Work great for the gym. Durable & affordable.
1,"This was a gift, but it seems to be an excellent product with many features."
1,"I've tried many blue tooth earphones look fro a good set. I found them.<br /><br />Update...<br />Lost the first pair, bought another and will probably get one for the computer"
1,"Bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday last year. He absolutely loved it and used it at work (he’s a drywaller). He was impressed with how long the battery lasted, usually for most of his work days or a few days in a row. He eventually lost them at a job so I bought him a second pair for Christmas this year. I had to spoil the surprise to prevent him from buying a new pair himself.<br />Would definitely recommend!"
1,"Let's point out the elephant in the room and acknowledge that not all humans are the skinny and/or athletic build type. Those solid, behind the head wireless headphones can't reach both ears without ripping one off.  As for the collars that sit around your neck? I dont need to look like I work at a call center, thank you.<br /><br />These headphones are the bomb!  The two buds are on a long coated wire that can easily reach around the big jellyroll on the back of my head.  Or if I keep the connector in front, it doesn't irritate any of my chins.  I highly recommend these headphones to anyone of a &#34;big-ish&#34; size."
1,I'm shocked at the way these sound for the price..they sound great
1,Good headphones! Only problem is that the bass is a little muffled but its not bad for the price I paid for.
1,My favorite pair of headphones. Have lasted a long time
1,Great sound! Love the mobility and how convienent they are. I made a great choice.
1,"Definitely not the best like they say. You get what you pay for, but for that low price they are ok. Mine didn’t last very long but I got my money worth out of them. Spend more money and get a better set of headphones."
1,a little bulky around the ear but fantastic for the price.
1,These are great for working out. I’ve had mine for 3 years and they still work great.
1,I bought it for my soon (11 years old) and he has been enjoying the freedom of this wireless Bluetooth earphones and has told me and I confirmed the sound is very nice and stay in place.Thanks to a friend who has a pair of this who recommended it!
1,Thanks for you
1,"Muddy sound, compared to standard apple earbuds. Works as advertised."
1,"These headphones work really well. Good enough for working out / commuting entertainment. Not the BEST quality sound or volume but hey, they are 30 bucks. Sometimes slow to connect with Bluetooth. Biggest issue is that I was running and it started raining pretty hard and now they don't work. So there are limitations to how water resistant they are. But for $30 I'm here to buy another pair. Just don't wear in the rain."
1,Like how they fit and feel in ear. Like how you can control everything from the earbuds. The sound is good except for a rattling sound when there is bass in the music.
1,"Great performance, great price"
1,I've had them for a while and haven't found anything better yet.  I used them this very morning to walk a few miles.
0,"going on my 2ND set of ear buds because they will not hold a charge, will not stay connected to Bluetooth and I cannot turn my volume up or down because the buttons do not work. Would recommend if you use headphones a lot do not get these. Not worth the struggle"
1,"These are made for huge ears. I think they will still hang on, but they are REALLY big. Still, they aren't uncomfortable so not bad!<br /><br />EDIT: I realized that it comes with a magnet that holds your phone into your car vent AND a credit card holder that sticks on the back. Even if these headphones suck, that is pretty damn cool."
0,Hurts your ears for days after wearing for 4 hours. Haven't used them in 3 days and still sore. Wouldn't recommend
1,"Awesome purchase I must say.  I wear them around the house everyday to listen to MY music.  Great item.  They stay in place, comfortable and charge fast and stay charged about 4hrs.  Definitely a must for this music lover"
1,"Completely satisfied! Totally love them. Lightweight,  keeps nearly all noise out!  Very happy with purchase.2nd pair...love them!"
1,Well above the beats from apple.
1,Connects to Bluetooth well. Comfortable. Easy to use.
1,Nice Sound -- buds fit in ear nicely & do not budge when running.  Great Value.  I would highly recommend this product.
1,They work as intended. Haven't had any issues. I enjoy them so much i bougt a back up pair and my wife a pair.
1,This product is a one of a kind and if I had to choose as a first time buyer I would choose it again excellent quality and the bonus item is worth the buy
1,Only used then one or twice so far but they seem good for the 30 ish bucks or whatever I paid. The design is a little bulky but I guess that extends the battery life
1,Great headphones
1,"These headphones are seriously fantastic! The sound quality is great and they look sleek. I use them on runs and they stay in place. I’ve found the battery life to last 3 hours, which is fine for me but definitely less time than advertised."
1,So they are great. I will try them out fully next week at work.
1,Sound is great and plenty of volume. Only use like 1/6 of volume. Doesn't seem like I get 8 hrs of play even with the volume down so low.
1,"Great sound quality, comfortable fit, Bluetooth range of 20ish feet."
1,MY husband loves loves loves these
1,I’m so happy to finally find a pair of headphones that don’t fall out of my ears when I’m working out and start to get sweaty (sorry tmi). It did take a while and a lot of trial and error to figure out how to properly “install” them in my ears for the first few times but once you get the hang out it they are awesome! My one complaint is that after wearing them for a few hours (which doesn’t happen too often) my ears have started to get a little sore holding them in. I was worried they would be too bulky but it hasn’t seemed to be an issue! Love the easy commands and phone control through the earbuds.
1,"I have to say for the price these are great. I run short distances 1-2 miles on a treadmill, and lift weights, these earphones don’t budge. Battery lasts a while too, and charges back up quickly."
1,"Very pleased with these headphones.  I’ve also own the powerbeats 2 and these are comparable to those, however I could never run with the powerbeats as they would keep popping out and I ran with these on for close to 40 minutes with no problem.  They sound good and are perfect for weight lifting. Really happy with this purchase!"
1,Great product. Sounds great.
1,So far so good.  I got across my house and these were still working.  I usually get about 10 feet away from my phone with other headphones and it starts chopping out.  I am very happy with these headphones for the price. :)
1,"This is my first pair of bluetooth headphones and I love them so much. I recommend them to anyone who is looking for a pair of bluetooth headphones for the gym--I admittedly do not do highly vigorous workouts, but for a light jogging, weight training, or cardio machine workout they are great! See below a list of pros/cons as well as a more in depth review<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Comfortable!!<br />- Easy to pair with phone<br />- Long battery life<br />- Noise cancelling is top notch<br />- Easily packed up for traveling<br />- Stay put in your ear<br /><br />CONS:<br />- The volume/skip buttons can be a little confusing at first (back button turns up the volume/skips the song, front button turns it down/goes to previous song)<br />- The &#34;low battery&#34; alert can get annoying during a workout<br /><br />FULL REVIEW:<br />These headphones are amazing! They are so comfortable and TRULY noise cancelling (though you can still tell if someone is talking to you--just not what they are saying) I wore them for an at home workout while my roommate was watching TV in the same room and couldn't hear a thing other than my music. I wear them to the gym and can go 8hrs+ without having to charge them (so 8+ workouts, depending on how long my workouts last) The wire connecting the ear buds at the back of the head doesn't bounce at the nape of the neck, so you never have that thumping noise from the wire banging against things, and the ear buds themselves stay put and are comfortable. They are really simple to pair up with an iPhone (and I assume any smart phone), and now that I've paired it once, all I have to do is press the on button and they automatically sync. The only complaints I have are (1) the buttons on the side (for volume and skipping songs) took a bit of time to get used to, they felt &#34;backwards&#34; to me--the button in back (closest to the back of your head) is used for turning the volume up and skipping a song, and the button in the front (closest to your eye) is used for turning the volume down and going back to the beginning/a previous song (2) the low battery alert is frequent enough to be annoying during a workout, but happens so infrequently (because the battery life is so good) that it doesn't merit losing a star.<br /><br />Overall--I would definitely recommend these!"
1,"Have been using it for over a month now. Generally very happy with it. I like the materials and the case. Two areas would recommended improving. I have small ears so the hook does come off slightly when I run ... think either make the hook adjustable or provide another smaller hook. Secondly, there is no early indication of battery running low (I mean few hours early, not 10min prior which is the current case) and I can’t tell from the light that it will be running out of battery soon.  There are few times my earphone battery was out and completely shut down during my run which is  bit annoying. Had I known few hours before, I would have charged it prior to going for a run.<br /><br />Other than these two points, would recommend it. Price is very reasonable and is very light with good quality materials. I do like this pair of earphones!"
1,"The delivery was right on time. I absolutely hate ear buds. The only reason I bought these is because I was tired of wearing and breaking the beats audio larger type headphones. So I took a chance. Let me tell you...These earphones are the stuffff!!! Im big on bass, comfort, clarity and loudness. This has it all trust me. They are so comfortable you dont even notice them. Just order them period!!!"
0,"Not what I expected. They work, but we're not comfortable for me."
1,Pros: Good sound. Easy to use button. Stays in while exercising.<br /><br />Cons: nothing so far
1,So nice they were stolen within a few days. I will order more just to not be without them!!!!  They don't slip when I sweat it out with H.I.I.T.
1,Quite a value.  Works surprisingly well for phone calls.  Paired with my iPhone 7.
0,"After getting these I initially thought they were great.  These earphones do exactly as advertised.<br /><br />However, now I have tinnitus (ringing in ears).  Never had any hearing problems until this purchase so I can only attribute to them.  If you like your hearing don't purchase!"
1,Very satisfied
1,Really like these headphones so far. They stay in place quite well even during running.
0,"Headphones will not charge, got as few. Hours out off them. I attempted to charge them after the battery was low and they will not charge."
1,"Beautiful design, good sound, excellent presentation. Highly recommended. Good sound quality. I'm very happy with my purchase"
1,"Very comfortable, easy to set up, and looking forward to my walks with the headphones."
0,I wish in the description they would note that the hooks are not for small ears. I tried to put them on several times and it was frustrating because I couldn't get the earbuds to stay in my ears. I Don't RECOMMEND these for people with small ears. I can't even comment on sound since I couldn't keep them on.
1,"Love the long battery life! The fit had to be played with, but finally got them to stay in my ears"
1,Loving it so far
1,Battery lasts a good amount of time! Works great for exercise! Especially cardio. Nothing loose that can jump around while moving. Would recommend to anyone.
1,I wear them jogging. Comfortable.
0,I used these for three months and then the buttons stopped working.  I think they're garbage.
1,Good
1,"These headphones met my need for wireless listening while I ride my bike or work around the house or in the yard. They come well equipped with charging cords (even a car adapter and a lightening connector), different size ear inserts, and a sturdy storage container. They charge quickly and the instructions for set-up and use are easy to follow. Bluetooth connectivity is seamless! The ear pieces are comfortable on and in my ears and the sound is great - just as comfortable and just as good a sound as the more expensive ear buds I've purchased previously. I haven't made a phone call, but I have woken up Siri with the microphone and it worked perfectly. The biggest problem I've encountered is that I push the pause/on/off button when I'm just trying to adjust the ear piece - a problem that will go away with use."
1,"I used to have the beats Bluetooth headphones, but honestly these are better and for only a fraction of the price. They are plenty likely us enough in the gym at only half volume. They keep their battery life for a long time and they are very comfortable! I'm so happy with this purchase."
1,"I've used them all weekend and I've enjoyed them.<br />If you're riding your bike, you'll hear a lot of wind resistance through them though. Just a heads up!"
1,i wasnt sure what to expect after using wired for the last 7 yrs after loosing my 1st gen 100 $$ blue tooth in 3 days . these things are nice . i like they are wired together so you can hang them around your neck . they have to have a 60 - 80 ft range from the phone . i have not tested how long they work on a charge but they charge fast . i think they say 2 hrs or less but  its  under an hour .
1,Works great.
1,"I've had these Senso headphones earbuds for almost two weeks. They are the greatest! Easy to charge and the battery lasts quite awhile. These are my first wireless headphones so I can't compare them with others. I decided to take a chance and I'm glad I did. They are comfortable and the ear buds fit my ears well. I have small ears so I was worried about the fit but they not only stay in but they're comfortable enough to wear for hours. Listening to music is a pleasure because I can hear all the instruments so the arrangements really come alive. The volume buttons are easy to learn to manipulate as is the fit of the earbuds in my ears. This weekend we drove round trip from New Jersey to Ohio, a 7 and 1/2 hour trip (actually a little longer with stops). With the earbuds I could listen to my music while my granddaughter who was driving could take phone calls on the car Bluetooth and talk to her 2 year old in the back. Best of all, when the 3 year old was cranky I could tune her out. Taking out the left ear bud to talk while listening was easy. Another thing I like is the cord is not long so it's not dangling all over the place. And the black color makes them blend in well with my clothes.<br /><br />The earbuds and extra buds come in a great zippered case that is very attractive, small and easily fits in most purses or pockets. I should mention that I'm a very active 78 year old great grandmother whose kids, grands and greats keep me up on the latest technology. I am very happy with these Senso headphones and I recommend them to anyone."
0,Hurt my ears
1,Really nice sound
1,excellent product
1,"The earbuds are decent. I am a rather heavy user and after a very short time the audio level adjustment buttons failed and after a few more months the second earbud stopped receiving audio unless the cable was in a very specific position, which is simply not acceptable for work out earbuds. I am currently trying to get them exchanged for a new pair now."
1,"I have been a Beats fan for a very long time. I have to admit these wireless Senso headphones are AMAZING. I was skeptical because of the low price about the quality of the sound, well that is out the window they sound great. I like to work with my tunes on so the fact that these last up to 8 hours is great. The complete package is outstanding."
0,Sound quality is great. Range is horrible.  I bought these to wear while mowing. You cannot put your phone in your pocket. It keeps loosing signal and the music gets choppy
1,"I researched a number of different headphones and did not want to pay the high cost for a pair of Beats, Bose or Jaybirds. I was pleasantly surprised with these. They sound great and they're very comfortable."
1,"Good earbuds on design, quality and sound considering the price. If you love deep bass like the one comes from Bose or Beats, these are not the ones. I also appreciate the bonus little other things it comes with like car vent magnetic holder and nice earbuds case. Even packaging is dope. Also very easy to pair, no hassle at all."
1,"For this price, you cannot go wrong. Worked great, easy sync, really great product."
0,"Big disappointment.  Stopped working after a year and ten days.  Because it was narrowly outside the warranty window, they wouldn't replace it.  They offered 10% off a replacement pair, but that's worthless if you wind up having to replace the equipment every year.  Don't expect it to last, spend a little more for something that's not made so cheaply."
1,I was happy that they stood behind the product and am waiting for a replacement
1,Sound is very good..connects very fast...but these buds are getting off from ears when you move your head or doing in workout.
1,"Good product, fast shipping."
1,"Excellent earbud for the price! Even better than some of pricier options.. just buy it, you won’t regret. Well done senso!!"
1,Love these headphones.  Very good quality for the price paid.
1,"Great ear buds! They sound great and are really comfortable. If you are looking for some workout style ear buds, you can't go wrong with these. I also really like all of the accessories these came with. They even came with a 2 port usb car charger and phone charger."
1,"Very easy  to connect. Nice sound, but lacks bass. Good adjustment. And the price is very fair for this product. More bass please and that's it."
0,These headphones do not work at all with my iPhone 6. They pair.  But I have to hold the phone within an inch of the headphones. I like to keep phone in my back pocket when walking or working out. If I do that I lose contact with the headphones.  I will get music for one second and then static for two.  They are really irritating.
0,"Unfortunately, I've had two pair of these, and they were great at first but didn't last more than a year before just suddenly stopping to work properly. The first pair I had only lasted a few months before the button stopped working. The second pair just quit one day without reason while I was using them and will no longer work."
1,"Review from my girlfriend:  &#34;Ordered these on Thursday, got them on Friday, used them on Saturday for a 5k.  They worked great!! I traded out the ear pieces to the smallest size, and they fit very snug and didn't move while I was running.  Sound quality was perfect, and button's worked well.&#34;"
1,"Best wireless headphones I've ever purchased for running.  They stay in my ears the whole time, I've never had to push them back in or adjust."
1,They arrived on time - like them very much - worth the money-
0,"These were great for the first few months of use. After that I began having connection issues. The headphones would sync up and play for a little while then it would drop the signal reconnect, then drop signal again until I turn off head phones and re-pair again... lame."
1,I love my purchase. the sound of Senso headphones is better than I expected!!
1,"SENSO Bluetooth Headphones, Best Wireless..."
1,Great product for the price point. Still using these Bluetooth headphones a couple years after purchase
1,Love the sound. Wish the piece around the ear was stiffer. Great sound!!!
1,"The earbuds are easy to control while on a run.  The controls are easy to get used to.  One of the buds didn't stay in as well as the other, so I tried the memory foam cushions and that worked well.  Now I use memory foam cushions on both buds."
0,The one ear bud started cutting in and out. There was no stress in the wires or anything. Today it jus stopped working.<br /><br />Was a great headphone till now. I would give 2.5 if I could.
1,"Both the product and the customer support are 5 star!  I purchased two of the Senso Blue Tooth earbuds over Christmas.  One for my girlfriend and one for myself.  The sound is impressive and the fit was better than any earbuds I've used in the past.  They actually stayed put during my runs and were comfortable too.  About a month after use, the small light that indicates the pairing mode, charging status, etc stopped working on mine.  The earbuds still functioned fine...just no light.  The support team was quick to reply with suggestions to do a factory reset.  When that didn't help, they shipped me a brand new replacement pair.  I would definitely buy from them again.<br />Also, you can't beat the price on these.  Before selecting this pair, I tried a few others at the same time.  I normally assume that a more expensive item is better quality.  In this case, I tried a pair that looked, felt, and sounded identical by TreLab.  Not to say anything negative about them or their product, but the Senso version again appears to be identical but cost less and includes more accessories."
1,These headphones are so awesome! My husband uses his at work everyday. He loves the fact that he has finally cut the cord (headphones that came with his phone) I only wish I had known about them when you offered the car charger. Is it possible to buy it separate?
0,Literally broke 1 day after the return policy window.<br /><br />Will not buy again.
1,My favorite pair of headphones! Great company and great product. Highly recommend!
1,I love the way they fit and they are light.
1,These were a gift to my wife.  So far we have no complaints.  The sound is good and easy to pair!
1,"The earphones are great! I finally have something that stays in my ears while moving around. The sound is very good, too. Also, the little carrying case comes in real handy!"
1,"I like over the ear type buds. My power beats ""ear form"" broke and I needed a new pair. Senso is perfect for me. They fit well and the sound is great! Well worth the money."
1,I am very please thank you for asking.
1,Sound is very good and I like the soft material on the ear hooks.  Very comfortable.
1,"Sound great, even better than my first pair.  The ear piece is comfortable and stays in place.  Great product."
1,Sound is good but mic reception for calling is not good. Everyone complains that they cant hear me. Sounds muffled.
1,"They look, feel and sound great.  Easily pairs to multiple devices."
1,"Work great, look a little big"
1,I really enjoy my SENSO Bluetooth Headphones.  They perform well and very comfortable to wear.  Not getting tangled in with my phone while lying in bed is a real perk as well.
1,Great product. Reasons noted above
1,Unbelievable sound at an unbelievable price!!
1,"These headphones are amazing! They sound so good,  almost too good. Music on my Ipod is very loud and I have to keep it at the lowest level and even then some songs are too loud. On my Samsung phone though, sound is good and I can keep the level at a normal range.  They fit well on my earsite and are very comfortable."
1,"So far so great. they're light weight. I barely feel them while running. They don't move around or slip out. Battery life is as advertised if not better. Sound is great, although don't get much low end, but I didn't get these to sit and listen to music critically."
1,"Beautiful clarity, light weight and durable. thank you!"
1,"I took a chance on these after trying out the Powerbeats2 since I was a bit disappointed with the latter's performance for the price.  I haven't used bluetooth headphones in a while and I was disappointed with how often the Powerbeats2 were cutting out.  And I'm not talking about situations where I move away from the source, I'm talking about when I have my phone in my pocket.  I also didn't think they stayed in my ear as well as regular earbuds (the hooked part actually kind of prevented the bud from staying deep in my ear, which is how I prefer it so as to isolate outside sound better).<br /><br />I've had the SENSO model for a few months now and have decided to keep them because they don't cut out as often or enough to bother me.  As for the sound, they're not as good as the beats especially in the bass department, but they're decent enough.  After all I'm mostly using these on the go or in the gym so with other background noises/distractions I'm not expecting a perfect audio experience.  I find they also sometimes don't stay fully deep in my ear.  I may be able to find a better bud for this however, as I know this can play a factor.<br /><br />The biggest actual issues that bring this down besides the sound quality especially compared to Powerbeats are the ear hooks and cable.  While the Powerbeats hooks are somewhat firm the SENSO hooks are extremely floppy.  The former were easy to hook on and stay there while the latter requires finagling to get them in place and they don't always stay there.  Also with Powerbeats you get a clasp to adjust the cable length but there is none of that with SENSO so the extra slack moves all over the place.<br /><br />Ultimately for the price these have been getting the job done for me.  I would be willing to pay a bit more for Powerbeats with the better sound and fitting aspects, but you must decide for yourself if the huge price difference is justifiable, especially at risk of connectivity issues.  Also since I use these in the gym a lot I didn't want to spend a lot on something that I might break/get wet."
0,hurts my ears. keep losing connection and its fairly new only a few months old. i gave it away to a friend and bought something else. oh well. you get what you pay for.
0,"I don't write many negative reviews - since I am fairly forgiving of product and performance issues. I bought these headphones based on 16K+ positive reviews averaging 4 stars+.  They worked great for about two weeks. They had excellent connectivity, great sound, a little bit of noise cancelling, were wireless and best of all, held their charge reasonably well. Then suddenly, after two weeks, the bluetooth connectivity starting dropping in and out while at the gym.  It was really frustrating since it was happening, like 4 times a minute. I tried everything, charged them fully, switched them off, switched off the bluetooth on my phone. Did a hard reboot on my phone....alas to no avail. So I am saddened but wanted to post my experience. This product does have a tremendous amount of positive reviews. Didn't work for me :( Hopefully you will have better luck than I did."
1,Great earbuds. Great at blocking out the sound.  Good quality of sound produced.
1,"The sound reporduction is great.  I have never liked ear buds, but the over-the-ear retainers help."
1,"Amazing product and amazing price!  I like to run outside, and I've owned several wireless and wired headphones over the years.  These headphones are by far the best headphones I've ever bought.  The sound is better than some very expensive Sennheiser ear buds that I purchased a few years ago.  To make it even better the carrying case includes a car charger and a lightning plug.  For the money, these Bluetooth headphones and the additional stuff that comes with it can't be beat.  In fact, I liked them so much that I bought a second pair."
1,Love these - they stay securely placed even during vigorous workouts. The sound quality is extremely good and surpassed my expectations. The Bluetooth range is excellent as is the battery life after a full charge. The ontrols are intuitive.
1,They work great!  Easy for my walks!  I actually baught my husband a pair!
1,I had these for about a week and must say that they perform as advertised.  The bass is solid and the battery lasts ~8 hours.  They sound great once the buds are sealed in the ear.  I'll update later if anything changes.
1,My only complaint is you cant use them while charging. Otherwise good product.
1,Arrived quickly.  Perfect for the gym with multiple size ear buds for easy fitting.  Thank you!!!
0,"Sounded great, for a month. Now they will take a charge but will not turn on.<br /><br />*Update* SENSO stood by their product, or slightly to the side like.  They let Amazon's own 30 day return policy take care of the issue and offered a 10% discount on my next order.  The power button appears to have broken so anecdotal evidence has me looking for another brand."
1,Work super good. Couldn’t be happier
1,"I don't spend time on writing reviews for headphones, but after buying multiple cheap sets. It's time to tell you to save your money and just go for the set that is over $50. You pay for what you get. I initially bought this to train with during my runs, they won't stay in your ear. I bought Beats Pro and will never go back.<br /><br />Save your money."
1,"These are wonderful! Arrived very quickly, super easy to connect via Bluetooth to my iPhone. I wore them for the entire 13km Bloomsday run Sunday May 6th, 2018 in Spokane, WA. They worked like a charm. I love that they come with different ear piece sizes. The small ones fit perfectly and canceled out a lot of external noise."
1,works great
1,"I usually run the battery down on headphones in a day or two between running, walking and yard work.  I have gone through a dozen headsets in the past couple of years and these are the best I have found for my needs at any price (the Plantronics Backbeat Fit is close, but 2x the price).  First, they are comfortable and stay on while running.  They are as loud as I would want them.  I run them until I get the battery warning and it usually takes 7-8 hours, excellent for the size/weight.  Support is excellent too (see below).<br />If you start having trouble connecting or holding a connection to your phone, reset the headset.  Here are the instructions from Senso:<br />1. Reset the Senso headphone to factory settings (while plugged into a power source, press/hold the power button for 7 seconds).<br />2. Unplug the headphone from charging cable and power them on.<br />3. Enter the earbuds into the pairing mode and follow instructions for connecting.<br /><br />Also, the headphones may not connect to your devices after you perform the reset. The previous connections that you had established between the headphones and your devices become &#34;obsolete&#34; after the reset and needs to be re-configured. In order to do that, please `Forget the Device` on your mobile phone for the Senso headphones and try pairing again. In your Bluetooth settings on your phone, you will see all detected Bluetooth devices. Click on the Senso ActivBuds option and click on Forget this Device. Next pair your headphones to your mobile device once again as shown in the instructions manual.<br /><br />This has fixed the two connection issues I have had with the headset, which occurred after about 100 hours of use."
1,Love them.
1,Great wireless headphones! Love the sound quality and the noise cancellation.
1,I've had a chance to use these during workouts and for just listening. They have good sound and I like that the controls are easily accessible and intuitive. They stay in place while running. They're not audiophile quality but that shouldn't be expected at this price. They work well and I'm happy with them. It would be nice if they had some kind of power indicator but there's no display.
1,"These headphones are actually pretty good. The sound is good. I can take calls. The only reason this didn't get 5 stars was the volume control and answering a call can be tricky. Not impossible, just needs getting used to. It is similar to powerbeats by Dre, just a little more bulky, but not bad and not as many ear piece choices, but again not bad. Comfortable and totally worth the money"
1,"I'm comparing these to another Bluetooth set of headsets I bought in 2014.  These appear to have quicker connection, longer range and longer battery life.  I'm very very satisfied with my purchase."
1,Great product so far.  No complaints...!
1,Got them for a Christmas gift so cannot rate yet. I have bought another set of Bluetooth headphones from same manufacturer that are great so I expect the recipient of this gift to love these too.
1,Nice set of earbuds at a good price.  Purchased them for my 16-year old son and he really likes them.
1,"Very happy with this purchase.  Sound quality is good, the battery has lasted 4 days and it still shows full on my iPhone, and they are very easy to use.  Very surprised how much I can walk around the gym and still be connected!"
1,Great working product right out of the box. The charger and the accessories feel of quality material.  The sound is incredible at a fraction of the price compared to those expensive ones out there.
1,perfect price for wireless and work well.
1,"These are pretty nice ear buds, but not so much for exercising. They have tons of wind noise, I think from overactive noise cancellation, even when moving at running at low speed, and gets really annoying on a bike.  A much more minor issue is that the notifications are way too frequent when the battery is low."
1,"I am an experienced OEM which means that I am certified by Microsoft as an &#34;Original Equipment Manufacturer&#34; which means I build custom gaming systems. But I am an individual who has prejudice against, at the time, unproven technology. However I was diagnosed with a disease that doesn't allow me to pursue my career and I spend almost all my time listening to audio books, my sight is also affected badly. I tired quickly of spending a fortune on expensive earbuds and I purchased &#34;wireless' aka Bluetooth earbuds. I couldn't have been more thrilled. The sound is comparable to more expensive earbuds but I have found that the quality of the materials used to produce them were infiery by far. I love the moisture resistant feature the extras like the care charger and the new Apple compatible charger and adaptive cord. I would love to purchase a cordless charger for the home use. Can anyone recommend a quality product worthy of the price and compatible with the Alcatel Fierce XL. Please contact me using the info in my profile. Thanks again. Debbie"
1,Excellant headphones! The customer service team is extraordinary! Can't wait to order anonther pair soon!
1,"Product exceeded my expectations.  Comfortable fit, easy to pair with my iPhone, and excellent sound quality Service was exceptional."
0,"As soon as I got the product I saw white streaks on it where it seems like some white paint was accidentally dripped onto the headphones. That wasn't the dealbreaker however, the device won't even turn on after many hours of charging. It just doesn't work. This company is scamming consumers. Do not waste your money."
1,Would buy again.
1,Great sound quality for the price.  Loaded with accessories.  Great look.  I highly recommend for those who cannot afford the Apple or Beats level options.
0,"Still searching for bluetooth head phones that don't disconnect during use, these Senso S-250's can be added to the list of no's. Tried them with phone in my pocket, without a case in open moving hand, and an arm band... (with iPhone 6), no luck music is broken up with every movement. returning at end of this review."
1,"I like the sound quality, but the headphones seem to lose connection with my iPhone and the sound regularly cuts in and out."
1,I purchase a set of these Bluetooth headphones back in August 2017.  I absolutely love them. I recently had some issues with them and contacted senso.  They responded quickly to my concerns and are shipping me a replacement pair as we speak since they were still under warranty. Great product. Great customer care.
1,I love them they fit my style
1,GREAT ITEM!
1,"Just bought this and the reviews made of it is true.<br />Sounds is good and the product is easy to use and the Bluetooth is very good, only had one incidence were I was more than 30 feet away, then the connection started to fail, however if you will use this for workout or similar I can only recommend the product."
1,"These have lasted for a year now. They’re great and they actually stay in place regardless of what activity you’re doing. The sound quality is good, too."
0,"Loved them but they broke about a month after purchase. One side stopped working, now they just cut off every 5 seconds. Loved them at first but cheap wires are junk."
1,"I’m one week into using this wireless headphone, and I’m enjoying it!"
1,Low in treble
1,Good product for a good price!
0,Terrible noise quality. Also does not hold well with the rubber support.
1,The ear buds work great. They stay in place during my workout and they sound good. I would like the ear hook to be stiffer. It's very pliable and that makes it a little cumbersome to place over your ear and does not feel as secure as I would prefer.
1,"Excellent device, sound is incredible with them, they are what I was expecting, even more."
1,Awesome headphones!! And good price
1,Super lightweight do not irritate the ears
0,Stopped working within a month of using it. Wasn't able to connect it to any of my devices.
1,This is by far the best bang for your buck. Don't waste your money in buying name brands. You won't be dissappointed with this product.
1,I have had these for 2 years they still work great hold charge I use them regularly. Im glad I stumbled across them years ago! The quality for the price is amazing! (I did get some silicone tips to clean easier)
1,I was skeptical since I had used another popular brand of ear buds before.  But these are easy to use and better sound quality than others I have used before.  Worth purchasing!
1,"I bought two sets of these headphones, one for my wife and one for me.  They fit me pretty well but my wife has small ears and the ear loop is much too big for her.  She has to tuck the ear loop between her head and her glasses.  Adding the ability to adjust the position of the ear loop by just sliding it up or down to the ear bud would be a great improvement.  Sound is pretty good.  They occasionally pick up wind noise and transmit it through.  I haven't had them long enough to evaluate battery life, etc."
1,good quality
0,"I really liked these headphones and used them for just over a year. I work from home and enjoyed using these to listen to music and seamlessly answer calls as well. The range was great, I could leave my phone in the office and walk at least 30-40 ft away without losing signal. I had switched the ear pieces to the foam pieces that came with it and after a month or so they were hurting my ears so I wanted to switch them. One ear piece came off fine, the other actually broke the headphone instead of coming off. You can see in the picture that it broke at the seem. I owned these approximately 15 months when this happen and since they didn't break from my own abuse, I sent Senso an email. They responded with a mere 5% discount code and advised it was out of the 1 year warranty. Had this been my fault I would understand not wanting to offer further assistance, but this appears to be a weakness in the product. While I enjoyed these headphones I will not be purchasing another pair."
1,Great customer service and very comfortable to wear.
1,Very clean sound from these headphones. I love them. Look cool too!!
1,I am blown away by the quality.  For the price I cant believe how good they sound.
1,"Very good head phones.  They work well in the gym, easy to charge and use.  My wife bought a pair and was happy with them.  Now I am too."
1,"They stay charged for a long time, comfortable around the ear and look just like advertised. They do not have a &#34;skip&#34; button, you can only adjust the volume on the ear piece. I do wish they gave you an update on the battery level when you turn them on but overall love them!"
0,"Worked great for 2 months, then the ear piece broke off now it's useless."
1,Very reasonably priced and solid quality. These are a good alternative before spending big $ on Bose or Beats.
0,Not a true sports ear piece...too big for bicycle rides...catches wind noise.  Too big to fit under snow ski helmet.  AND THEN YESTERDAY...sound was distorted and volume failed.
1,Absolutely love this brand! The sound is perfect for me!
1,Better then $99 name brand product.<br />Has full range sound quality and the microphone is super clear<br />I accidentally put it in a washer and still work.
1,"Great product. I used many headsets, wasted lot of money. Finally a good one that brings satisfaction. Sound quality is good. Setup is very easy, Bluetooth connection stays solid, Battery life is great. Ear hooks are customizable and fits its to my ears perfectly as i liked.<br /><br />Can't expect anything else. I returned the expensive headsets that i bought for this thanksgiving. I would definitely recommend to try these.<br />Thanks to the team who developed it."
1,"These headphone have been great. They arrived quickly, are very comfortable, and sound great. Be careful they are very loud so make sure the volume is down before you turn your music on. I am probably going to buy another pair for my son so he can't steal mine!"
1,Surprisingly works really well.  The Bluetooth did not lose connection until I was at least 3 rooms away from my phone.  They also provided multiple ear buds for your better fitting.
1,"These are easily the best Bluetooth earbuds I've encountered for the price. The quality is obvious right out of the box. They're comfortable, lightweight, and well made. The sound quality — for Bluetooth buds under $40 — is pretty darned solid. For instance, did you know that most musical recordings have bass in them? I didn't, until now. Highly recommended!"
1,Fast delivery. It also gave me a good and sturdy feeling when I am holding the product. It is still new for me and just used a few days with no issues during my exercise.
1,"Click buy now! Couldn’t be happier with quality and price. Also received an email from one of the owners making sure I was satisfied with my purchase. Quality, price, service....A+"
1,Haven't used the noise cancellation feature yet.  Battery lasted at least 24 hours with all day use.  Sound quality is exceptional!
1,"Bought 3 pairs (one for myself, sister, and my mother). Great audio quality, noise cancellation, and overall design. Easy to use and they stay in my ear when running."
1,These have lasted me almost 3 years now and decided I’d write a review to show some appreciation. I can’t believe the value I’ve gotten out of them. I’ve used these countless times in the shower and for construction work and the battery still gets me through the day.
1,"Its pretty windy where I live so when I use these on runs, it can get pretty difficult to hear my music. As long as the wind isn’t blowing too strongly and blocking out all sound, they work really well! They also work really well for working in the kitchen since Im constantly moving and dont have to worry about getting tangled."
1,Absolutely love these headsets.  The bass is lacking a little bit.
1,Gracias
1,"Just got my headphones yesterday. They came with a charge so I could try them out right away. How cool and thoughtful is that! The package is impressive. Everything you need plus more is included. The case is great. Hard shell yet soft to the touch. Stylish as well. Has a net pocket inside.<br />You can easily tell someone(s) asked themselves, &#34;how can I make this product an even better value to beat the competition?&#34;.<br /><br />A brief history of my headphones from Amazon; These headphones are replacements for the Senbowe bluetooth headphones I bought here in 2015. The Senbowe still work but they fall out of my ear and the cord on the back is tacky and snags my skin which pulls the plugs out of my ear when I turn my head (big design flaw). They are also not very loud. Otherwise they work very similar to these. The Senso is also replacing another pair I tried about 6 months ago which I feel are total garbage: Beyution V4.1 Bluetooth headphones. Those are 'on the ear' style and were cheap plastic garbage which broke. Seller offered to replace them but I didnt want another pair.<br /><br />So with that said, these headphones are made well. They are slightly large looking in my ears but not so goofy that I look like a robot. It's not an issue. The cord on the back of my neck does not snag on my skin and is not tacky. 2 cord clips are included as a bonus. They just keep things tidy and pick up the slack. Nice touch! The headphones are super light and the around ear part is very comfy. Love it. I have large ears and the default plugs worked great for me but they come with other sizes as well included. The box includes a couple USB cords and a card charging port (how thoughtful and great!).<br /><br />The sound I feel is only slightly bass heavy but I need more time to determine how I like that. It sounded great when I tried them for 5 minutes.<br />I was very impressed by how loud they are! I was also very impressed with the outside sound suppression. I listened to music near my AC window unit and I couldn't hear it! It was on high. This is getting close to my higher end Bose 25 headphones with active noise reduction (requires a battery for those headphones). Super impressive! That was a big surprise. I honestly didn't think it would be as good as it is. I use headphones in the gym and I don't want to listen to the loud pop music they play at all.<br /><br />The controls work fine. I haven't tried the phone feature yet. Hooking up to a wireless Bluetooth connection was breeze. The instructions included are simple and easy to follow. The case also included a pamphlet on how to get support which I hear is excellent but hope to never use.<br /><br />Bottom line. Best value headphone set/package I have every found and at a price point which is great! Win/Win. Rock on!"
1,"Not sure how to rate noise canceling, I can hear approaching cars when I walk the streets. That is good for my safety"
1,These headphones are comfortable and easy to work with.  The sound is clear and crisp.  This was well worth evey penny spent.  I'd be confident to buy from this company again.
1,"Great!! sound is incredible, I haad the Beats, garbage and expensive.<br />I recomend the senso."
1,I really love these headphones! I use them at the gym all the time and they work great. The sound quality is pretty good. I usually go a couple days on a full charge. I don’t have problems with them falling out of my ears. The only problem I really have with them is when I try to skip a song.
1,"I LOVED these headphones, used them about 5-6 times a week. I bought them in August 2017. In January 2018 they completed died. Not the battery, the whole device. I can't get it to work again. I guess I will go back to my Beat by Dre."
1,Head phones arrived earlier than expected and are as good as I was led to believe. Very happy with my purchase. Don't hesitate to get a pair of these amazing buds.
1,My husband love it
1,"***EDIT AND CHANGED RATING*** Got in contact with company through email. They responded within a hour of the email was sent. They told me to do a factory reset on the headphones. They had clear instructions. After going though the easy process they suggested, the phone calls were much better, Not 100%, but much much better. Callers on the other end said they could tell I was talking with something, but they said there were no real issues. Since I got the help needed from the company support team, and the headphones are working as they should, I've decided to keep the headphones. Back to being a happy customer.<br /><br /> When using these for phone calls, I was told I sounded like I was in a tunnel and they could here themselves echoing as they talked. But, for the music side, nice sound and nice fit. Will be sending them back. No point in having a product that can't do what they are intended for. Music and phone calls."
1,"I bought these to run with but found them way too bulky and uncomfortable.  However, I'm giving them a good rating because they survived a journey through both the washer and drier and seem none the worse for the wear.  They're perfectly serviceable for chores around the house, going on walks, etc."
0,Worked great for my first run but when I went out for my 2nd run the signal was as constantly breaking up even though my phone was in my pocket and fully charged. Such a waste of money.
1,"Not as much bass as I like, but they sound good."
1,"It usually takes me about a month before I break any type of headphones. I workout hard and I am rough with them. I am also a runner in hot Florida, and sweat a lot. However, I have had these headphones for almost a year now and they work perfectly, even when I drench them with sweat. They hook up easily on my ears and stay put. They are comfortable, lightweight, and I forget they are even there. It syncs really well with my iPhone / iTunes and my Sandisk Sport Clip. The music quality is great. I have owned super expensive headphones, and these still hold up the best. I would totally recommend them."
1,"The sound that comes from these earbuds are fantastic.  They have been one of the more comfortable pair of earbuds that I have owned.  The battery life is great and I can get a couple of days worth of listening to them before I have to recharge them.<br /><br />I did have a problem with my first pair, where one earbud stopped working.  Senso was quick to respond with assistance and then ultimately replacing them under warranty.  Beyond making a great pair of earbuds, the companies willingness to work with me, and so quickly will keep me as a customer."
1,Work great and easy to use!
1,"Loves them so much won't take them to school so they won't get stolen, lost, it broken.  They fit well, loves sound quality.  Battery life is great."
1,These are everything the product information said they were.  But the thing that I love most is that you can put them down and then later when you open your iPad and want to listen to something you can push the multi-task button and it tells you that they are on and connected.  No need to go into systems and turn them on.<br />Donna Gordon
1,These work great I use them around the shop and when I go for a jog. They charge quickly for me less then an hour and I’ll get about 6 hours of great use out of them. After that it matters how close my phone is to the headphones. It will be spotty in my pocket but fine if I wear it on my arm.
1,Way better than what you get for Beats headphones for a fifth of the cost.
1,If you're on a budget like me and wants a quality Bluetooth earphones buy this! You want regret it!
1,"Delivered in a timely manner.  Easy to pair to my phone, and the sound quality sends excellent!"
1,"The bass is a little heavy, but if you have an app/phone that can adjust it, it's great! It has great noise isolation, and includes memory foam tips, which are absolutely great. I hope they last!"
0,No siri integration with iphone!<br />You can not make outgoing calls (using iphone Siri to look up the number) like almost any other bluetooth headphone!<br /><br />This is a waste of a product for iphone users who want to make phone calls.
0,"Pros:<br />- Good range<br />- Good design, with good placement of buttons and over-ear hooks<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Sound.  Just *awful*.  The EQ on these headphones are just *terrible*.  Everything is boomy and hollow and requires you to adjust the EQ on your phone in order to get something even close to passable sound.  It's like someone put a rattly subwoofer into a cardboard box and closed the lid.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />- Don't bother if you value sound quality in your music, even a little."
1,"The fit was great, and the connection was easy to make. But, the sound quality was disappointing. I like to listen to bass filled music when I work out, but the bass sound blared, no matter how much I turned the music down. I sent it back because it was disappointing to listen to."
1,I like this set it's comfortable and works great but it keeps breaking. I wish these were more durable but I'll try to be nicer to them. These are comfortable with decent range(unlike some that are easily interfered with by common radiation) these are easy to use and second nature to put on.
1,Work great on my pc but has issues with my iPhone . i bought it for my pc so this doesn't bother me enough to send it back
1,I like  them  I really enjoyed them
0,When I received the headphones I noticed that the ear pieces were angled slightly different from each other. I didn’t seem like it would make a big difference but I was never able to get one of them in my ear fully no matter which size I used over it. I also found that the Bluetooth range was only about 10 feet.
1,These worked great for a couple of months but then wouldn’t charge. I emailed the seller and they immediately shipped another pair out. I’ll absolutely give 5 stars for great customer service and comfortable headphones!
0,"I had this product since May '17 and I am a adventure racer.  I sweat a lot and these did well with that.  I was disappointed with the product for a few reasons, 1. the battery life did not last as long as what I would like,  2. they cut out a lot throughout the time I had them especially when the battery was running low, and 3. This past weekend I went to pull them from the factory charger and the charger end along with the mini-usb slot on the earbud was melted.  I do not feel safe using this device any longer so now I am on the hunt for a new set."
1,"Nice headphones for the price. Lasted a week, stopped charging, sent them back and they said I would have to wait two weeks to get another set. Can't do that when I workout every day and have a show coming up"
1,"Really enjoy these headphones.  The sound is really good, and fit is perfect.  I switched from an over the ear style, which had a lot of bass and sound, but were just getting worn out over the past 4 years of service.  I decided to switch to an in-ear style.<br />Overall, a really good purchase and I highly recommend them.<br /><br />If alone, the customer service folks really care about their product being quality.  You can tell they all put a lot of time into a fine product!"
0,"Arrived unable to charge, so D.O.A. and this is the second pair I've received that won't charge"
0,"When I first received the headphones they worked great.  After about 3 uses they quit working.  My experience with this product was less than satisfactory.  When I looked for return information I discovered that my return window closed 1 day before the headphones quit working.  Huge bummer!  HOWEVER.....AMAZON IS AMAZING!!!! I was able to live-chat and within 5 minutes they made an exception and sent me a return label. One of the many reasons I LOVE Amazon.  So, although the product was defective, Amazon customer service was not.<br /><br /> [[ASIN:B01G8JO5F2 SENSO Bluetooth Headphones, Best Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7 Waterproof HD Stereo Sweatproof Earbuds for Gym Running Workout 8 Hour Battery Noise Cancelling Headsets]]"
1,Great little headset very comfortable.
1,This headphones are awesome I can basically fully charge it over night and use it for almost the whole day and the sound quality is really good for headphones that are not that expensive it’s worth buying.
1,"Only had a few days, but like them."
1,These headphones work great. They stay on your ears without having to adjust them even when running. I can hear clearly during phone calls. The sound is impressively loud.
1,So far so good!  Looking for something easy to use; Sound is good
1,"Worn them for only a week but pleased so far. Comfortable fit, they stay in place well. Good sound quality."
0,"i bought this because it was marked as best selling, however, i can't really use them because the left earpiece falls every time bcz the rubber is not fitting right exactly on my ear which is frustrating. sound quality is very good. only in terms of usability, it sucks... the attached picture is for my left ear as you can see, it is barely attached. i do cycling a lot + slight workout... this one disappointed me despite being awesome sound quality"
1,Great headphones!!! Recommended!
1,I have  been using them for 2 days and I am very impress with the sound quality and how easy is to connect them to my iPod touch 5th Gen. I used them when I go to workout at the Gym.
1,"Great ear buds. charge quickly, have good sound quality and are comfortable. Great purchase."
1,Work great so far.
1,I only tried them once so far and they worked great!!!
1,"Definitely worth it for the sound quality and the battery life,why spend more on known brands,when you can get same quality for a cheaper price."
1,These things are amazing!!! I can clean/cook and listen to the music or downloaded apps while my kids watch tv. I also have them on at the pool and my son's baseball games. Love! Love! Love!!
0,Within the first couples hours of using these the sounds started cutting out and hasn't stopped! Clearly they sent me broken headphones. Really sucks because I was looking forward to these because of the reviews. But I can't even determine if they would have been good.
1,regret buying this brand  doesn't stay charge for long didn't get  anywhere close to 8hrs on a full charge .<br />when the Bluetooth source is moving for example me running with my phone the music keeps skipping<br />and stopping but it plays well when i stop so i'm only using it on the now gym where i can leave my phone one place smh
1,"These work really well, as long as your phone is in your right pocket (the right ear bud has the Bluetooth).<br />When I was doing yard work and put my phone in my left pocket since I'm a lefty, the connection became very inconsistent and jumpy.<br />Otherwise I have been very happy with them."
0,They're super uncomfortable they keep falling off my ears.<br />It was missing a part and you havr to have the phone really close or it will disconnect.
1,"Great packaging, accessories and great quality headphones. Bluetooth syncs with ease."
1,Great for the price. I really just don’t like how they fit my ears. They fall out sometimes when I run.
1,"I absolutely LOVE the headphones.  They are perfect for working out and can stand up to sweat without falling out my ears.  I was laying on my back lifting free weights and would always have to adjust and readjust my headphones.  Well not this time, these are the most comfortable and great sounding headphones I've owned and I've owned the best.  But for the price, value, quality and can stand up to a tough sweaty work out get these headphones...trust me you will not be disappointed.  Oh did I mention if you get a call you can take call through the headset...don't know the technology behind that but it is great.  I am going to get another pair just cause.  I highly recommend these headphones.  I love them."
0,"Okay, so 2 stars may seem a bit harsh, but I promise you the reasons are valid when judged from a trail runner's perspective.<br /><br />First- some credit where credit is due-<br />1.  These headphones have a nice strong connection and I never had the Bluetooth drop.<br />2.  The sound quality was actually quite good.<br />3.  Came with a nice carrying case and charge cords.<br /><br />Now for the critiques-<br />1.  The biggest and most glaring flaw was the static from wind blowing into the mic.  It was so loud that I could barely even hear the music at times and their was only a slight breeze.  I'd love to say I was running so fast that I was creating a ton of wind, but alas- any mic should be able to stand up to a 9 minute mile and this one failed miserably.<br />2.  The over the ear clips are way too flimsy and as a result, the right earbud continuously fell out through out the run and no, I'm not a super bouncy runner.<br />3.  Then because it kept falling out, I had to keep pushing it back in.  The only problem is that the mute button is right on the side of the main piece so pushing it back in on the move almost always muted it.  Poor design if it won't stay securely in the ear.<br /><br />Long Story short- if you're going to be doing fairly low motion, indoor type activities with these- these will be great as I had no complaints with the sound quality.  However, if you're going to be outside biking, running, skiing or skydiving- you might want to consider something else."
0,"Updated from my last review. I've had them since June, and they already broke. Boo."
1,"Good product. However, the cord that hangs at the back of the neck is way too long....does not look like it does in the picture."
1,I haven't yet been able to use the headphones extensively but what I have experienced thus far they are great. they will be put to the test tonight when I go to the gym.
1,Have used them twice. They sound good and don’t hurt my ears.
0,"These stopped working after 2-3 weeks. I sweat a lot when I run, I live in the South. SENSO was responsive to my email and tried to troubleshoot the issue, and the return was easy. However, I do not trust the water resistance rating on this product."
1,Love these!  Excellent sound.
1,"nice product!  great sound, comfortable ear buds.  Shipped as promised, arrived packaged well.  Definitely will buy again if needed!"
1,Nice!
1,There exactly like my treblab ear buds but cheaper. I would like to see all the controls on the top of device instead of having the power buttonn the side. It can be a awkward at times.  Adding foam ear tips would be very nice.
0,"Overrated. I was so bummed because these had such great reviews, but the Bluetooth range was so weak. At the gym when I had my phone at my feet and laid down to do a sit up, my connection would get super spotty and sometimes just blank out all together! I’m sorry but 5’9” of range is definitely not enough."
1,Excellent Bluetooth headphones. Love how easy they are to connect. I used them at the gym and not once did they fall off.
1,"i have a problem losing head phones so i buy a pair of they every couple years. they work great, charge fast and are decently comfortable! defiantly worth the price."
1,"Great range, great sound. They don't fall out, I quickly learned the locations of all the buttons by feel. If there's something negative about these headphones, I haven't found it. Highly recommend."
1,"I have tried many brands of wireless earbuds.  Of the three or so brands I've tried, there is always one earbud that stops working no matter how you try to correct it.  What's impressive about these earbuds is that they are a fraction of the cost of wireless, both earbuds always work and it's easy to operate.  I can pause a podcast by touching the earbud on the right even through a heavy beanie.  The volume controls are also easy to operate.  I inherited these, but will definitely purchase a set when and if the current ones I have wear out."
1,"I have had these for 3 yrs.  They sound and work great. They charge up within a couple, plus they hold their charge for days depending on use.  So glad I got these."
1,"I've had issues getting them to pair to my iPhone or they suddenly disconnect.  Also, the minimum volume is louder than I want when running outside.  I can't hear anything around me.  I've tried adjusting the iPhone settings but nothing works.  The sound is very good though."
0,"Has a loud, obnoxious buzzing static sound whenever playing sound."
1,"I think these are fantastic and have been working well for the weeks I've had them. They stay put in your ears thank goodness, and I don't have wire all over the place to be yanked out (which immediately irritates me haha)"
1,"Good quality and great value. The quality of sound is not as good as the Beats I have tried -but for the price I don't think you can beat these.<br /><br />However I was not impressed when I received my package. The box was partly smashed and had clearly been opened and then taped shut. I was worried they had been used. After looking at them everything looked clean, unused and everything was included. Not sure why my box was opened.. ?<br />Tried posting pics but it's not working for some reason."
1,Work and sound great
1,"For the price you cannot beat the sound and bass you get from these!  They are not a name brands, but remember most of the same parts that are in BEATS AUDIO are also in here.  You are paying for a NAME ONLY!"
1,"Has great sound, at least for me.  I can keep my phone media volumn at halfway or sometimes lower and hear the music very well.  Previous buds (Bluetooth and wired) didn't do that so well.<br /><br />I had one problem where I was getting skips in the music, a millisecond of dead air.  Tested it on a different phone and found no problems.  Found that I needed to un-pair the headphones (deleting from your bluetooth settings), restart the phone and re-pair them.  This was a suggestion for my Samsung GS5.<br /><br />Works great now."
1,"This is my second pair because when they work, they are nice. The issue is the cord connecting the 2 buds is somewhat fragile ( not good for a device expected to be used for running). My first pair is sitting on my dresser not working (cutting in and out) after owning them one month past warranty. I bought another pair hoping that was a fluke, but we shall see."
1,"Great bang for the buck, superior performance."
0,"I bought these headphones a few months ago, but only started using them within the last week. The bluetooth connection is very unreliable. They disconnect without warning 2-3 times per hour, which is extremely irritating."
0,I bought it on October. Every thing is ok but right side works only now. Worthless! thank
1,"A little too much Base, sound decent, but overall great product, great price<br />They haven't given up on me, and I work them pretty hard at the gym"
1,"I love these headphones! They last through my work day and sound great, while blocking out the noise around me! I bought two more for my wife and brother and they both love and use theirs daily. If I had a reason, I'd buy another :)"
0,"These were actually great! for about a day. . . To get them to stay on my ears took some effort and constant adjusting while jogging. The bluetooth connection kept faltering randomly and wouldn't let me disconnect nor reconnect. Weird. When they didn't have those problems, the music would skip sometimes. Too many problems. Gave them a month and finally returned them."
1,Little sketchy along my jogging route. Get interference from other sources once in awhile but overall pretty good!
1,Everything has been as advertised so far. I have found it easy to pair to multiple devices. Good sound with plenty of bass. Also the range is very good when walking away from the source.
0,Is very &#34;meh&#34;.
1,"So happy I got these as I'd just purchased some others and was disappointed. These arrived quickly with many extras. Several sizes to find perfect fit in my ear, carrying case and a couple charging wires with car charger. The longest cord has the ability to charge 2 ways a very cool design. I didn't think I'd like the loop over the ear but I don't notice either side once they on.  They arrived charged and I listened to music all day, outside hand thatching the lawn AND trimming under the Arborvitae's. I was so happy to hear such clear versions of every song I purchased an Apple Music deal. These are evenly balanced with nothing on the cord to weigh it down. The previous pair had the controls on the cord and surprisingly that made a huge difference. They were always moving towards the control which is more weight than I'd have thought. These have all controls in the right side. Very comfortable!"
1,"Very nice sound, incredible battery life . I love the Bluetoothability of these earphones."
1,Oh my goodness. The craziest thing just happened to me. I had my headphones in my work bag and my grandfather had put my pay in a bucket of water to soak over night and didn’t know my headphones were in there and so I just got them out after atleast 3 hours submerged in water and I just turned them on thinking they were going to work but they still work fine they just sound a little quieter than before!😱😱😱
1,"I recently purchased the SENSO headphones to use in the gym. Turns out I enjoy having wireless I have been wearing them outside of working out as well. After two weeks, they are wonderful. The battery life is solid, they automatically shutdown when they're left unconnected. They do create a bit of a wind foil when running, but the speakers drown that out. Great value."
0,"Bulky, heavy, and the sound is just okay. Also, they look ridiculous when worn. They fall out every 10th step without fail and I have tried all the rubber sizing options.  The flimsy band that goes over the ear does absolutely nothing, does not hold the earbuds in place when I run, or even when I WALK. And the wind noise from these is God- Awful. Not a fan of these at all. Always remember folks, You get what you pay for!"
0,"This SENSO working fine initially, however as of lately I am unable to power it on even after it is fully charged"
1,These are comfortable and pair easily. Audio quality is pretty terrible though -- bass is boosted to almost comical levels. Wish there was a way to switch that off.
1,"Good sound, good battery life, decent comfort.  Awkwardly high-profile, and LOTS of wind noise outside."
1,"Wow man, i wasn't expecting such awesomeness, but behold, the value and package exceed expectations."
1,Easy to set up and great sound. My first pair of wireless headphones and I love them.
1,"Been using these for almost a month now.  I don't know if i have a bad pair or there is some bug in IOS 11 on my iphone but i  get disconnected every so often, audio will cut in and out, have to tell my iphone to forget and re-find.  Sometimes when i get disconnected i'm less than 3 feet away from my phone....  When they do work they are great.  Hopefully there's a firmware update that i can get to fix these issues."
1,Love these headphones - the sound is amazing!
1,"I ordered the TaoTronic headphones before the Senso and I can confirm that the Seno headphones are much better. They fit comfortably while I do my workouts, even while I'm doing sprints. With the TaoTronic, I constantly found myself having to push them back into my ear since they slipped out so easily from jogging. The TaoTronic began to hurt after wearing them for a half hour or so. The sound quality is also better than the TaoTronic as well. They pair quickly to my cell phone. The bluetooth radius isn't far though and I do wish the battery life was much better. But honestly for the price, it's a good headphone. I also appreciate the accessories that come with it such as the case. I recently had an incident with my headphones where the back came off. I contacted Senso about it and got a reply within 5 mins! They provided such friendly customer service and are sending me a replacement within a few days! You're not only getting decent pair of headphones but a great group of people working to improve your customer experience."
1,I tried a couple of Bluetooth Headphones and the first (Plantronics) weren't loud enough and the 2nd (1MORE) wouldn't stay in my ears.  I had almost given up but thought I'd try one more.  These were the SENSO's.  And they fit perfectly and were much louder than I actually needed.  I'm delighted with my new SENSO's.  Thanks Invotek.
1,"Actually, bought these for my wife to use while we work out. At first she was skeptical but really grew to love them. Just shy of 3 months they malfunctioned and would not charge or power up. After notifying the manufacturer and trying the fixes they suggested, which did not work, they immediately sent a replacement pair. We are extremely happy with this product and very grateful to the company for being so helpful and quick to resolve the issue. 5 stars!!!!!"
1,Best headphones I've owned.
1,Charge holds longer than expected and very clear audio.
1,"Great for it's price, my only gripe and this applies to all wireless earbuds, there is no clip to catch the buds so you don't accidentally lose them. Whenever I am busy or tires from the gym I forget them and misplace them. If you are using one ear to listen to music the weight of the earpiece will drop and slowly slide off your ear so be careful. Otherwise it's good, especially for it's price."
1,"Compact, comfortable, recharge well, nice carrying case, seem to be durable. Not the best sound quality, but I’m liking these Bluetooth headphones at their price point. Gym once a day for 2 or so hours and they stay charged for about 3-4 days.<br /><br />Two issues:<br /><br />The small flap that covers the USB plug can pop open when working out.<br /><br />Bluetooth can disconnect at the gym sometimes - I think this is occurring due to another Bluetooth headset out there conflicting with this one."
0,They were garbage.  I threw them away.
1,"Because I wasn't home to sign for them, didn't know about needing signature, had to redirect to ups center to pick up on monday."
1,"I liked almost everything about these headphones: design, fit, sound quality, battery life, user interface (audio feedback for on/off and buttons). But when I was on conference calls, people always told me that my voice was faint and they had a hard time understanding me. So I had to return them."
1,"Its just okay product, no need to make hype"
1,These headphones were inexpensive and work great! Clear sound. Blue tooth connection is good. Would like to see an app to be able to track misplaced headphones without driving up the cost too much. I really like them!
1,"Great sound, great price and great customer service. I even received a follow up email from the owner checking in to see if I was satisfied. I have recommended these to all of my gym friends!"
1,All the other five stars reviews are accurate for 30 bucks these are very good quality Bluetooth headphones
1,Little sketchy along my jogging route. Get interference from other sources once in awhile but overall pretty good!
1,"I had a previous pair of these which I loved  that finally died after 2 years of daily use. I ordered these assuming they were the same; however, the earhooks are different now with an internal bendable material. I don’t like them as much anymore because of this. They’re not as comfortable or as easy to put on and keep on. The sound quality is still great though."
1,So far so good. These headphones sound amazing and are well worth the price. I use them in the gym and they work very well.
1,Great sound and fit for the price.
1,"As far as I know this product blocks the outside sound / noise, it does not actively cancel it like a Bose Noise Cancellation headphone or their like.<br /><br />This requires a very tight fit of the ear buds, otherwise noise will leak in. I had to experiment with the various sizes of ear buds to get a fit that blocked most of the sound.<br /><br />Perhaps interestingly; I am ~90% deaf with tinnitus. My expensive hearing aids can receive my iPhone's Bluetooth so that I can listen to music, but it sounds terrible, with a annoying tinny quality. However, phone calls' voices are excellent. The SENSO Bluetooth headphones music sounds great, but their iPhone call quality is worse than my hearing aids; too much bass and not enough treble (the exact opposite of the hearing aids).<br /><br />For a normal hearing person, I think you will find the cell phone quality very good.<br /><br />For their price, I doubt they have much competition! Highly recommended!"
1,I bought these in June and they no longer work.
1,"Work well, got it quick. can't beat water proof"
0,"These headphones are horrible.  The quality is definitely suspect.  A few months after I bought them they barely even hold a charge.  I cannot recommend them at all.  If you are looking for quality headphones, I would look elsewhere."
1,Good Product
0,They sound fine and work ok. I HATE the fit. They fall out and don't actually hook on my ear. I do have small ears though. They fall out so much when I run.<br />The zippered case is nice....
1,"I got a great deal on these headphones, and they are worth every penny.  Clear sound, easy to use, and comes with every accessory you will need.  Great product overall."
1,AMAZING !!!! Sounds like Bose ! Charge time lasts forever !!!! Answer calls effortlessly!!! Eliminates most external noise!!! No cords ! Replacing husbands Bose ear buds now NO CORDS !!!!
0,"Just a one year after prety use, the earpods died, doesn't turn on after full charging. Perhaps I was a programming obsolescence victim."
1,Using hosen Hooker is it communicate with my phone works were while in a James
1,"I used these for 1.5 years as my go-to workout headphones. They have good sound quality and battery life. I appreciated the strong water resistance.<br /><br />However, the cable in back of the headphones would get lodged behind me when I set up for a bench exercise (glute bridge or bench press). So I am back in the market for another true wireless model."
1,"I hardly ever leave reviews but these headphones are awesome. They're reasonably priced and I'm very impressed by the quality. Plus it comes with a case which is convenient. Haven't been able to test the battery life, but as far as sound goes, they sound great. Great value and I'd definitely recommend to friends."
0,"they were cheap headphones, they lasted for a year until the left speaker stopped working. Won’t purchase again from them."
1,"Worked fine, now can’t get Bluetooth to connect. Had to reset."
1,These already broke after 6 months.
1,I was a little skeptical that these headphones were actually worth buying simply because the price is so reasonable. I've had bluetooth headphones in the past and they were at least double the price. The reviews on Amazon helped me decide and I am very happy thus far.<br /><br />Packaging is great.<br />Instructions adequate.<br />Sounds quality more than meets my expectations<br />They are comfortable and stay on my ears (within reason)<br />Battery life has been great so far.<br /><br />Would definitely recommend!
1,Love these )]headphones. They have avery clear rich sound. Also come a very nice case. I have  headphones 5x the price and these are as good or better. The bass is good but if you want head pounding bass  these are not for you.
1,Great bass and call are clear.
0,These do not fit around the ears. I am always adjusting them. When I run they fall out. Terrible product.
1,"These head phones appear to be good quality after a months use. Sound is great/sufficient, functions are great too... The reason I gave it a 4 Star vs. 5 is the windy-dingy wraps that are supposed to go around your ears... flaps are too big! I am 5’3, so not huge & have normal sized ears. Dang they almost had it & with the price it could’ve been perfect! All in all these are better than my last set. No issues connecting to blue tooth just READ the directions....which I didn’t at first! They work for me... I walk-run 2-3 miles at a time and lift some weights. That’s the extent of my use per workout."
0,The headphone to play music broke on the second time I used the headphones.  The bud came out and I can see the wire holding it together. The sound quality is pretty good and you can adjust the ear too bad I got a defective pair.
1,"Great fit! Easy controls! Fantastic SOUND!<br /><br />SENSO ActivBuds S250 -- ASIN B01G8JO5F2<br /><br />These perform well beyond my expectations.<br /><br />Arrived in great shape, and with all the accessories I need, as described.<br /><br />Thanks, Invotek!"
1,"I like the easy on/off, however, the volume controls seems backwards to me.  They do work...I just have to remind myself that the controls are counter-intuitive.  They're much lighter than I thought they'd be, which is a good thing.  They stay in place when running and are very comfortable on longer runs."
1,Great sound and quality.
1,Lemme tell you something!! These mfs right here are lit asfuq for the price it's def a WIN. IF you looking for a set of ear buds that sounds extra right with allot of bass these are def the way to go. I bought some for $20 last week from a store those sucked ass took them back and ordered these senso's I'm def satisfied. Came with a badas carrying case extra rubber ear inserts and a little magnetic thing to set up on your ac vent in the vehicle. 5 thumbs up!!!!
1,Great headphones and great sound my only complaint would be the ear catchers are a little too flimsy but it's only a pet peeve. It also comes with a bonus charger and car port! The price is also amazing. I would definitely recommend these...
1,Headphones are very corfortable and the sound quality is very good.  Extremely happy with these Bluetooth headphones.
1,"I'm giving 4 stars because you cant beat the price for what you get. Some people said these sound as good as Beats.  I beg to differ, I don't own any beats but I used to sell them when i was at best buy.  The reason I didn't give a 5 is because, 2 issues, 1 pretty annoying, when I have my phone and apple watch, it always wants to connect to both.  So i have to disconnect from the phone but if the watch doesn't sinc with it and I try to pair again, it will pair with the phone again, so then i have to turn blue tooth off on my phone and turn it back on once it connects to the watch.  The second happened today.  B4 leaving for the gym I check the battery life, it showed 65%, so about 45 min into the workout I get &#34;battery low&#34;, i check the status on my watch and it showing 30% and 5 min after, it cut off.  I turned it back on checked the battery lvl... 30%... then it cut off again.<br /><br />In addition yes these bad boys sound great!  As good as beats I don’t know but they sound better than the $60 blue tooth phone I have.  One other issue is that it will try to connect to a previously paired device even when u are paired to another device.  Its paired to my iPhone and listening to music, my Apple Watch is charging, when I get into connecting distance it tries to connect and stops playing"
1,Received these the NEXT day!!! My husband loves them and says that they are better than the Beats!! Will be purchasing some for myself too!!!
0,"Good sound quality, wish it lasted more than a year."
1,First of all Great customer service you guys responded 1 hour later after i sent a email of my problem with my headphones and resolved it. Second of all the Headphones themselves are amazing. Great sound quality and very good bass and for the price nothing can Beat this product
1,"So far, so good! I think they work really well. I do run, sprint, run workouts, and they stay in place comfortably."
1,I highly recommend this product. It has great sound and easy setup and for the money it's a no brainer.
1,Like em a lot so far. Good battery. Easy to use. Don't fall out of ears at all.
1,"Sound quality was excellent, and pairing was hassle free. These headphones worked great with Apple devices like my iPhone. They did fall out and off of my ears a lot when I jogged. I am African descent, so I have smaller ear canals. Sadly the plugs were just a bit big for me. I can't remember if there were smaller pieces because I overzealously threw away the packaging. I am not sure if I am wearing these right either since they just pop off over the top of my ear and need to be readjusted."
1,I am  really satisfies with my senso  I really love it and I will recommend it to all my family and friends
1,Fantastic headphones at an unbeatable price!  Great job. I will spread the word.
1,Great product.  Excellent tone and comfortable fit.
1,Have these for a year and half and still works and I use it a lot for running. Used to have a Dre beat and I had to call apple to replace it for me almost 5 times. This one blow dre beats out of the water. The price is already a must buy you can't really lose. Tried airpods as well they keep falling off when I run. These ear clip headphones are best for running.
1,Great product at an even better price. I was looking at much more expensive sets when I came across these. Decided to try them based on the high rating and I'm very happy I did.  I can't think of anything the expensive ones could offer that these earbuds don't.
1,"They worked well with my phone and ipod. Unfortunately, barely made it a year before it stopped charging or working completely."
1,Wife says they work great so I have ordered another set.
1,So i had some issues with my first pair so i emailed Senso and let them know it wasnt holding up a charge. They emailed me back within hrs.  And instruced me step by step on how to refresh it.  It worked for a week.  Then still wouldn't hold a charge.  So i emailed them again.  And in two days had a new pair.  Soon ill buy another for my wife.  Thank you Senso!!!!
1,Headphones are easy to use and of the exact quality expected. Great value and sure to be an up trending brand. A value brand making quality headphones could hold a substantial market share if they maintain this in the future.
1,my son loves these! he claims the base and sound are awesome and the best ones I have purchased for his so far
0,"The plastic that goes behind the ear bends way too easily and won't stay curled up for even 1 minute. Very cheap material, not even worth $1. I don't know how this would stay in your ear while working out if it doesn't even stay on while sitting. Really heavy too. If the plastic would stay on, it would be too heavy to wear for even 5 minutes. Worst design and material I have ever seen on earbuds."
1,"I've only had these for a few days, but they are perfect for my uses.  I use them in the gym or on my bicycle and the sound is clean and clear.  There is a bit of wind noise on the bicycle, but that is the same with other headsets that I have used.  I haven't had the opportunity to take many calls so I will update when I've had these a bit longer and used them more fully.  No complaints at this point."
1,"My husband bought these for me for Mother's Day because the ones I had were falling apart. These are convenient, especially when I'm going to the gym or for a run and they're super easy to use. I'd recommend them to anyone. I love them and I'm so glad I got them!"
0,"I don't write a lot of reviews. I really expected a lot more from these earphones because of high ratings on Amazon. It's obvious that $29 earphones can't deliver audio quality as good as a set of $300 from Sony.  Unfortunately I can only compare SENSO's audio quality to earphones sold at a Dollar Store or the earphones given away for free to airline passengers. Senso's mid-range is muffled, high range is almost non-existent and bass is very muddy. I've had much cheaper, Bluetooth earphones with a MUCH better sound quality.<br />Audio quality gets ONE STAR! Overall rating deserves 2 stars because they included a free cellphone mount with the earphones (wonder why?).<br />I wouldn't recommend this product if you expect a half-decent audio quality."
1,I have never found headphones I like so much! All other ones fall out when I am jogging or the sound isn't good- these are just right! They stay in my ears and I love the clear sound! Makes jogging a lot nicer when I am not struggling with wires and headphones falling out! Plus it comes with so many great accessories I am very impressed with this product<br />Well worth it !
1,Ear piece seemed floppy at first but fits VERY comfortable and sound quality is fantastic.
1,"You get what you pay for. Button functionality is terrible. Loud when used, double tapping the main button calls last person. Terrible idea. Sound is a little muffled, other than that decent product. Feels solid in your hands. Battery is great"
1,Headsets work great and stayed put during my run.
1,"Had them about 4 months, had an issue with them. Up until then the headphones are amazing, can handle getting wet from sweat, and give a crisp sound. I work out 7 days a week in them for about an hour to 1.5 hours daily. I only charge about 1-2 times per week. They hold their charge. The issue of them not powering on was resolved by customer service on 12 hours, and I was emailed and kept in the loop about the replacement. They honored the 1 year warranty and within 12 hours of my complaint and provided prompt and courteous service. The replacement was in the mailbox within a day. The best customer service I have received in a long while compared to my other experiences. Their customer service and quality product, I would buy another pair.  They are awesome at Senso,and put the customer first."
1,"Love these! They are very lightweight and have GREAT sound!<br />I was given a pair of another brand for bike riding with and they were so heavy & bulky my ears couldn't hold them. I had to try to hold them on with my helmet straps...very frustrating to say the least.<br />I haven't tried these bike riding yet, but I have used them at the gym...so far so good! Looking forward to taking them for a spin on my first bike ride of the season!"
0,Good while they lasted...
1,"Noise cancelling, great bass, and easy to set up and use, is there anything else required for Bluetooth headphone? A resounding NO!!! Awesome sound, comfortable to wear the whole day, and I can shut the world out if I want so I can focus on my work. I love SENSO's Bluetooth headphones. I will be getting an additional pair to leave at work while I groove on the original pair at home. LOVE 'EM!!!"
1,"I first purchased the black headphones and they worked perfectly till my dog chewed them to pieces. I then purchased the red one's but they're not of the same quality. Firstly, it takes FOREVER to turn them on/off. Even the voice that says ""power on/off"" is different. I have to press down for over 10 seconds before they turn on/off (with my already paired devices) which was not the case with the blk headphones. The sound is more static than the black ones, and this is using the same devices and same music tracks. They do take over an hour to fully charge but do Not last 8 hours. I fully charge headphones and use them for about  3-4 hours but have a low battery at around 5 hours, and I Always turn them Off when not in use! They are comfortable and had no problems pairing with multiple devices, but I wish I bought the black ones again. For now, these will do until my dog chews them up again, lol!"
1,Great
0,Perfectly adequate BT headphones.  Paired to my iPhone 7 with no issues.  Works well.  The only complaint is that they are too loud.  I can't turn the volume down low enough to listen at my desk.  I work in a fairly noisy open environment and I wanted these to block out the background.  At the lowest volume setting they are still uncomfortably loud.
0,Easily the worst headphones I’ve had.  They will say connected but won’t connect fully that I can play music on my iPhone. I have to turn them off and on again. And worst part is the constant skipping like it’s buffering or like old CD players used to be.
1,"I've used these a few times since I got them and so far, so good. I guess I have abnormally small ears as normal earbuds will not stay in which is why I need the arms that wrap over the top. These could fit more snuggly but so far I haven't had any issue with them falling off when I walk or jog.<br />The sound is great and they were super easy to pair.<br />They shipped and arrived in 2 days from the time I placed my order."
1,"These are great.  I listen to audio books while cleaning the house, working in the yard, and driving long distances.  The sound is perfect and they are comfortable to wear."
1,Great quality.
1,I have had these for three months and have never had a problem. Great sound long lasting battery power.
1,These aren't noise cancelling. They have great sound quality for the money though.
1,Works great!
1,"Clear listening, good product"
1,"Good sound quality, long battery life and they stay in my ear. Works well for me so far."
1,"Excellent sound, quality and value. Very pleased to have found these headphones."
0,Headphones worked one time for 30 mins. Will charge and light shows that it charges and receives full charge. However they will not turn on. Disappointing waste of money.
1,Great item! Fast shipping!!
1,"This are high quality, not the internet junk I often accidentally order.  Quality packaging, comes with a case, a car mount, a cell phone mount, extra earpieces of different sizes.  They have a nice, high-quality feel, and most importantly, they work well."
1,"Noise cancelation is great, quality, is great. The battery lasts ALL DAY. The only complaint is that the sound cuts out and I have to turn them off and on to reconnect. This is is a hassle especially when I am on important calls."
0,A lot of the five star reviews here have got to be fake....<br /><br />These bluetooth connection on the SENSO headphones are terrible. Throughout last summer I used them while mowing my grass and they constantly cut in and out. I thought it might have been because the lawnmower might be causing interference so I stopped using them and forgot about the headphones since that was the reason why I purchased them. I never tried them since until now...<br /><br />I am sitting at my desk at work with the headphones fully charged and right next to the laptop they are connected to and they are doing the same thing that happened while mowing my grass.<br /><br />Does SENSO even have a QC department? How could something like this get past quality control?
1,Good product for the price! I would buy again.
0,This earphone is bad. When I put my iphone into pocket I can't hear the voice. I can't believe there are so many high rate review. Don't buy it. The only reason why I didn't return it is there are too much work to do.
1,My son uses while golfing and says the sound quality is great.
0,"It's OK by the price, when compared with similar products.<br />But the product is not comfortable on ear.<br />I would not recommend it."
1,"Good sound for the price.  Battery is decent, as is the range."
1,"Every now & then, we purchase something that, for one reason or another, doesn't work right.  But when Customer Service steps up and responds- it makes ALL THE DIFFERENCE in the WORLD!  My wonderful wife bought me a pair of ActivBuds as she was super happy with the pair that she bought for herself.  She's in the water all summer and hers have worked flawlessly!  Unfortunately, I had trouble with mine.<br /><br />Senso customer service folk were extremely responsive, quick with assistance and clear guidance.  When we couldn't fix it- they asked for our order information and a replacement is on the way!<br /><br />THAT is HOW ALL COMPANIES should be!  mahalo ladies for your super fast help!"
1,By far the best set of headphones I have ever owed. Use them at the gym Mowning the lawn around the house not a problem at all. Really good sound got enough bass to get you into the songs. Love them would buy another pair of these for sure
1,"The headset is clear, comfortable and easy to connect to phone. Battery talk time is good. Mainly impressed with their customer services, I had an issue with charging port, and company sent me a replace within days."
1,"I love these headphones. They sound great. The different ear cones ensure they will fit. The included case ensures they don't break in my gym bag.<br />I know some suggested the volume is too high but I use these for running so the volume level doesn't bother me.  Additionally it appears to automatically turn down the volume when connected, so there's no issue with the volume being too high when first turned on.<br />Great buy for the price."
1,Love these headphones. Good sound. Great battery life. Lots of extras in the box to charge your devices including a nice little carrying case to keep everything together. Have ordered these 4 times as I’ve accidently broken two pairs.
1,"Solid sound quality and features for the money. Useful accessories and nice carry case. Battery life suspect.  About  3 to 4 weeks ago, the SENSO unit would no longer take a charge.  Very disappointed.  Manufacture support is expired, so these will be discarded.  Will not buy again. Hope your experience is better. Really wish the SENSO earbuds still worked."
1,Best headphones I have owned for running! Great fit and battery life!
0,I purchased the headphones based on the ratings and unfortunately it was a bad idea! The headphones are definitely not Waterproof! I purchased them for this reason!  My first pair stopped working when I went through the airport TSA. The company finally send me a new pair which has only worked for a few months. I am beginning to think they may last longer if you don't workout in them . Then again... Nope!  It's junk!
1,Just received these.  They are really comfortable and were easy to pair with my phone and ipad.  The sound was also much better than I was expecting for a $34 pair of headphones.  Hopefully they last for a long time.
1,Oregionally bought for my teenager. Husband liked it so much he kept these and bought our teenager a different pair. Great sound
1,"Great sound quality at an affordable price, it even beats my I-monster wireless headset in all categories. Love this thing!"
1,"These headphones work great. The speakers are easy to hear, the microphone picks up clearly.  The range is about 25 feet with no obstructions. My only complaint is that the battery runs out rather quickly.  I've found they have about 45 minutes to an hour of talk time and a day or two of stand by time. If I forget to charge them overnight, I'm back to using the wired ear buds."
0,"I have been using my set for about 2-3 weeks and they were fine at first, but they suddenly stopped working. It keeps ringing really loudly when I try to turn it on and neither my iPhone nor laptop will connect to it..."
1,"I did have an issue with these hadphones, the right cover came off exposing the inter works of the right headphone. This was seven months into use. I was still covered under my one year warranty, all I had to do was provide my Amazon order number and a picture of the broken headphone. The email response time was incredible within two emails hassle free I have a new pair being shipped to the house!"
0,I ordered these this summer to give as a Christmas gift. Only one earphone works 😯I'm not sure if I just got a dud because they had such good reviews.
1,So far so good!!
1,These bluetooth headphones are a comfortable fit and stay put when I go out jogging. The have good sound quality and were easy to pair with my cell phone.
1,"Great Headphones, great price.  Work Perfectly, easy to use."
1,The headphones have a great sound. Even on low volume settings it’s blocking out most of the surrounding sound. They feel comfortable and look good too. Definitely happy with these.
1,Love them best headphones I've had in a long time. Nice bass very clear and price was great
1,2 years on and the headphones are still going strong.  Last upto 4 days; my gym sessions can be long and the sound quality is still good.  Love love them.....
1,"I'm obsessed with these headphones! Literally a perfect product. Exactly as described - batteries last for 8 - 9 hours, which for me is like 4.8 week days of gym sessions. Sound is excellent. Fits snugly and comfortably when you choose your correct bud size (comes with two additional options).  I lost my first pair and almost immediately purchased two more - one for a jealous family member and one to replace these. Buy them! Its worth it."
0,Quit working after about 1 week. Seemed decent until they quit working.
1,Earphones are very good but their customer service is excellent. Thank you
0,The charge is terrible and the headphones are uncomfortable to wear but block noise effectively
1,No problems. I think they were designed well. They work well with my Samsung Galaxy S8+
1,"for 30 bucks, you cant really give it a yay or nay. i bought them for work. I work on a boat so i like the water resistant aspect.The sound is kinda muffled due to it though."
1,"I can't say enough about this product. The quality is great at a fraction of the price of the competitors. It's clear for both music and phone calls and is extremely comfortable when working out. In addition, their customer service is amazing! I had a problem with a set and at first they gave me a solution (and responded immediately), which worked for a while, but then the issue came back. They immediately sent me out a completely new one, no questions asked, no shipping charge, no requirement to send the old one back. Can't ask for more than that!"
1,The loops are too big and squeeze oddly. My ears are sore after use. Great sound though! Just wish they were more comfortable.
1,I bought these as a replacement for a previous pair of wireless earbuds I purchased over a year ago.  I use them primarily when I go running or to the gym.  The sound quality is pretty good.  I am having a slight problem with occasional 1/4 second sound cut out.  I am not sure if this is a problem with the earbuds or the Bluetooth connection with my phone.  My phone is a three year old iPhone 6s and maybe it is just old.
1,Sound quality. Perfect. Fit. Perfect. Buttons. Perfect. For working out. Perfect. Design. Perfect. Its just worth the mons.
1,"It does good job, I use it in gym and like it a lot."
0,"total crap dont buy if your not in the US to return. after first recharge stop working , though good feedback and support from seller however cant return item as shipping cost will require buying a new item and certainly another brand"
0,"Bought this device 2 years ago. Used it for a couple of months. Then I forgot about it. I was just going to use it again. Fully charged it, buy the power button no longer works and it doesnt turn it on"
1,"These headphones are wonderful! They sound great and stay well on my head as I jog. Two pretty neat features: 1) The headphones tell you if their power is going low; 2) If you get a phone call, the headphones read the phone number to you."
1,"Pleased with the fit, weight and comfort of these headphones."
1,People cannot hear me well
0,DO NOT PURCHASE Item does not last long
1,"These are great headphones. A little bass heavy for certain types of music, but thats an easy fix for most devices in the eq. Great value"
1,"So, I bought these earbuds about a week ago and they are amazing. I put them through the wringer to see if they were what I was looking for and I have been extremely impressed. They stay in no matter how much you move your head around and you can crank the volume without worry. For a set like this I would think I'd be paying a lot more."
0,Gettin returned because the port that accepts the USB cord was broken on arrival.
1,Good quality and very comfortable for the money.  I've been enjoying them at the gym.  No more wires!
1,"So, my brain just exploded. How could anybody pull this off for 30 bucks?  Come on.  Insane.  Really, very solid sound, thick bass, lovely quality design, intuitive controls, phone calls sound great, mic is clear, in-box accessories are very nicely done.  Senso, kudos.  Are you my mommy?"
0,"The design on these are pretty good. They stay in my ears because the ear hooks are easy to bend and manipulate so they stay in place.<br />The sound is OK.  A little bass heavy, which I like. Kind of average over all.<br />The biggest flaw is connectivity. I have a Samsung Note 8 and unless I'm sitting still not moving, they cut out constantly. If I put them in my pocket they cut out every time I move. I can't jog or work out with them at all. Best case scenario if I hold my phone in my hand and don't move much they don't cut out. It's a shame because otherwise they aren't bad headphones."
1,Excellent bang for your buck. Great for exercising or working in or around the house or in your yard. great battery life and comfortable. Highly recommend these.
1,"Great product. Love the headphones. Super easy to install and connect. I use them everyday on my bike commute to work and home about a 8 mile ride (on bumpy roads and smooth roads) and they still sound great and remain secure. Definitely a great product for a great price. I've gotten tired of wired headphones and cordless is amazing. Super leightwieght also and came fully charged when arrived. Looking forward on using these bad boys for a long time!<br /><br />UPDATE**** 5/31/17<br />Accidentally left my headphones at an outdoor restaurant and it poured down raining that same night. Luckily the owners friend found them and told me they were soaked and hopefully they still worked. Fast forward, I picked them back up the next day, and they turned back on with no problem. Sound quality is still great as well. Super great investment! Would pick these over any other option on the market."
1,"The sound quality is good, but the ear piece is a little flimsy. They just don't fit to your ear very well."
1,"Truly the best quality for the price you can get. These headphones have a great battery life, fantastic sound and bass, block outside noise extremely well and are sufficiently sweat resistant. I probably wouldn't expose them to actual water but for my work outs they perform admirably. I know 4 other people just at my small town gym that have the same pair. I would prefer these over any high priced pair. I highly recommend to anyone needing wire free head phones on a budget!"
1,Love these. They have great battery life and make life so much easier when I'm running!
1,"Had them since April 2017 it’s April 2018 and here are the issues. In the last month they have had issues with connection via Bluetooth and while this is my fault because I use them daily, I have to buy a new set because there is a short in the left ear from them getting stuck in my clothes or in my bag when I pull them out. I also somehow lost an earbud."
0,"These did not stay in or on my ear. The rubber ear wrap parts are flimsy and stretched out, did not keep the headphones on my ear"
1,My son seemed to like these. The sound quality was decent for the price paid.
1,Fast shipping. Great set of headphones
1,These have louder sound and better reception than my sons over $100. pair. I can walk all over the house and vacuum and still listen the Ipod or tv or mac. I love them and would buy them again. (I live in small condo) Probably lose reception in larger house If I wonder to far.
1,"I rarely write reviews, so it says something that I'm taking the time to tell you how fantastic these earbuds are!  I purchased 2 pair, for my husband and I.  They are truly noise cancelling, comfortable to wear and lightweight.  We both love them!"
1,"I have been looking for a really good Bluetooth, but one that would not cost me an arm and a leg. Senso has delivered. They arrived quickly. Pairing with my Edge 7 was both fast and easy. I was surprised that they paired so easily with my laptop as well. Battery life has been great. They are lightweight. And as they are in ear as well as with the ear hook they do not fall off. I have been singing the praises of these to my friends, family and co-workers."
1,"Have had them for a few days now. They have good sound, and the buttons are easy to use. I like I can skip songs without opening up my phone during a workout. They fall out when I run on the treadmill, but I may just have to change the ear bud size. Either way, pretty happy with this product for not being a &#34;well known&#34; brand. The price is unbeatable too (I bought $50 wireless JVC headphones from target and they had terrible sound, and were lightweight and cheaply made). For under $50, these are a great buy in my opinion."
1,Holds a charge and has a wide range. It's great for having while exercising.
1,My husband and I were looking for a pair of comfortable earbuds for our workouts. We had bought several cheap pairs only to be very disappointed with their level of comfort. Our ears would hurt after just a few minutes of exercise. SENSO eatbuds are extremely comfortable! We have both worn them for a long jogs and have had no discomfort! I would highly recommend these earbuds for comfort and excellent sound! We will be purchasing another pair soon!
1,These are the second ones we have purchased to use kayaking or paddle boarding mostly.  The sound quality is (surprisingly)  good for what you pay for the budd.
1,Easy to connect.  Although the speakers crackle when up at a certain volume. But non the less great pair.
1,These are the best hands free headphones with amazing sound and battery life. It’s like they aren’t there as far as feel goes they aren’t in the way.
1,"Omg I love them, so I have bad hearing and a lot of headphones don't work for me unless I have my cell volume max,... this pair let's me listen to it on a low setting on the cell and it's comfortable 2 hrs so far and it's not hurting or bothering, got to get use to how it feels since it's still new but he'll yeah I would buy another pair or get one for a family member"
1,"easy to pair with devices, slight background noise in the left bud.  Haven't tried it during workouts yet."
1,Good product !!!
0,"I've never had to work so hard to make sure my headphones were charged in addition to making sure my phone/iPod was also charged. It always seems like when I'm ready to use them, they need to be charged"
1,"Reviewing on the feedback from my girlfriend. I bought two pairs. One for my GF and one for me. Awaiting shipment of my &#34;Care&#34; package to Afghanistan, then I can review them for myself. Based on my GF's comments, these sound much better than the LG neck phones she owns. Comfortable and much less cumbersome."
1,These wireless headphones are definitely the bang for the buck! Extremely user friendly and sound is great!
1,Great earphones for the money
1,Great for the price. Good sound quality.
0,I bought some and they skip really bad when playing music. The sound is interrupted every couple of seconds. None of my other bluetooth devices do it.
0,"I spent 36 dollars on this headphone. I used it occasionally each week. In 6 months, it is dead now. It is NOT worth it."
1,"Packaging was excellent. The little extras are nice with the usb cables and the cigarette charger. Sound is great. Battery lasts a good while. Only had a few days. The microphone was not great when tested, will need to it out under different environments."
1,Comfortable and large range for volume.  One of the loudest in ear headphones I have owned and audio quality is very good.  Stays in ears when exercising is also a big plus
1,"Upon opening the package, I was pleased with the design and the extra charging cable, car charger, and a &#34;wire tie,&#34; which is a small plastic &#34;clamp: that allows you to adjust the length of the cord that is up against your neck. Pairing the headset to two bluetooth devices was simple and worked just as described in the User Guide. I like that are volume controls on one of the earpieces, as well as a multi-function button that allows you to answer incoming calls, redial the latest number called, etc. I've had the headset for only a few days, but, so far, I am very pleased with the product."
1,"Good stuff, carries sound about 35' from my laptop.  Love the dual charger (mini USB and Lightning) concept.<br /><br />-1 star because the &#34;low battery&#34; warning gives you about 5 minutes notice.  Not sure how long a full charge lasts... if I had to guess it's about 5-6 hours."
1,"I LOVE these headphones. I was wearing them when my granddaughter saw them. Boom, gave them to her and ordered again. I wear them all the time and lost order #2, hopefully they’ll turn up somewhere in the house!  I am now on order #3 and truly can’t say enough about them. You don’t order 3 times unless you LOVE them. Great sound, long lasting, perfect fit."
0,Sounds is very good but buds are staying in my ears. The looks seems to be way too big and don't help.
1,Bought these so I can follow Google Maps direction when riding my Harley. Will let youknow how they work when the weather warms up...
1,great value / works and sounds great.
1,Pretty good sound. Wish had more bass.
1,Excellent headphones- worked as expected!!
1,"Sound quality is little deep for my taste. But good for the price. Has a little fuzziness but they work for working out and casual listening. Would not recommend if you're a headphone snob, music junkie or DJ. But it works for me and my boyfriend."
1,I have bought these headphones three times because they are amazing.  I frequently break earbuds like every other month I needed a new pair and these were the first headphones that lasted me for almost a year. They also work very well the sound quality is probably the best i've had from earbuds. On top of that they are pretty decent at noise canceling .To sum it up id recommend these earbuds to anyone.
1,Had to cut the rubber ear piece hooks off as they were too small.  Howerver they stay in pretty well without them. Excellent sound. You won't be disappointed.
1,"These things are awesome. I sweat like crazy when i working out... i'm always used to having to deal with cheapy headphones going out after a few uses with them.<br /><br />When i first ordered these, I thought they did not come with a wire tie. I let the company know and they let me know it was inside the same back with ear buds (they're tiny) my fault for being in ID10T. great product and great service i would recommend these to anyone needing a good set of workout Earbuds<br />This has been a good experience"
0,"The sound quality of these headphones is pretty good for the price, but from the very beginning it seemed that the connection in the headset had a short. This would happen when I turned my head from side to side. I only use the headphones about twice a month so they haven't been abused. With each use the disconnect got worse. Now its to the point that the headphones disconnect 5-6 times per song. Not good. Hopefully this is just a bad set. If it weren't for the shorting/disconnecting I would recommend these headphones and give it four plus stars, but the quality of this particular pair is disappointing."
1,"if you are looking for headphones for the gym and you don't want to spend crazy money on Bose, this is a perfect choice for you. Sound quality is decently good. it stays in your ears while running. Bluetooth range is okay."
1,"These headphones have everything I want:  stereo for music, mic for phone calls, wireless for the gym, etc., and hooks over the ears so they don't fall off.  Now that I have them, add that they have great sound and were very reasonably priced.  Winning!"
1,They are a lot more &#34;boomy&#34; (not in a  good way) than I expected. The highs seem to not be present. They fit great and using them is easy. I just crave a lot more definition from the top end of the spectrum and less mid-range distortion and bass boom.<br /><br />Up to 5 stars: See updated comment... the trick for me was to not press the headphones in too tightly into the ear. I still have to experiment with other size plugs that it came with.
1,"If you have smaller ears like me, I would consider making sure to try out the different sizes of ear-buds to make sure they fit. I am very active when I workout and the size of the rectangular piece that sticks out of the ear can be a little heavy, mainly because I think the size of the buds in my ears are too small. But the volume and bass of my music is very nice! Highly recommend."
1,My earbuds stopped working after 3 months for no known reason and the company replaced them as per one year warranty. Very happy with the customer service I received.
0,"Update:<br />Had these for a year, took really good care of them, and they busted just like any cheap headphones I've bought. The sound goes in and out on the left side and makes them unwearable.<br />Pretty good when they lasted, but they didn't last long. And the bass was always weak."
0,"threw these in the garbage can i passed while running. Battery life was literally 20 minutes.....One ear would consistently fall out and to add to the frustration, after about a month, they wouldn't stay paired. I guess you get what you pay for."
1,These are rven better than the ones i paid 199.00 for.  So even though you pay more money it does not necessarily mean they are better.
0,This product was great 3 years ago when I purchased it last. The first pair died so I purchased another. Sadly the quality went really down hill. It has trouble connecting and randomly shuts off. Extremely frustrating.
1,sound quality is pretty good.
1,"Lasted me over a year, but the left side gave out with ut any sign of damage to the cord."
1,My husband absolutely loves these. He runs about 5 miles a day and they stay put comfortably. Sound is excellent! Also impressed with how long they hold a charge. Great item!
0,"Cuts out after only using a few times, especially when holding my iPhone X and walking. They are comfortable but connected cable between ear pieces is annoying sometimes."
0,"Comfortable, easy to pair, horrible sound quality. If you like a good balance of deep base, mid rang, and crisp highs these are not for you. The sound quality is very muffled and very base forward. I will be returning and searching for something else."
1,"I really like these! Had a pair of beats wireless that broke within a year, so decided to get these and spend less money on a pair. These are pretty comparable to the beats ones. The sound is loud and the bass is heavy, which I love. It fits snuggly in my ears too. Really good purchase! Thanks!"
0,MAN ARE THESE UNCOMFORTABLE AND ANNOYING TO WEAR
0,These head phones do Not work when stepping away from the playing music off my phone. I would not recommend this product.
1,"Headphones are pretty good quality, connect easily, and work as intended. Only minus is that the rubber behind ear piece is not rigid enough to help much. Luckily they fit well enough and are not too heavy that they fall out easily. But I do have to adjust them occasionally during a workout. Great deal for the price overall."
1,Such a great product at &#60;$40. My housemate asked me to order one for him as well.
1,"Excellent quality earbuds, great sound.<br />The company actually sent me an email to make sure I was happy with my purchase, how awesome is that?!"
0,"I bought these to use while gardening because my wires use to get caught on the plants. These cut out ever time I bent down even though the phone was in my pocket. I tried them for about 1/2 hr and ever time I stood up, they worked and ever time I bent over, they stopped working. I returned them the same day."
1,Work great!
1,My husband asked for these. He said they work just okay.
1,"Bluetooth has nice range. Bass is incredible if I firmly hold pressure on them into my ears. Bass is okay once I let go. I can't tell any difference as far as noise cancelling. Of course I hear less noise because something is pressed into my ears, but I can't tell that they are actually suppressing additional noise. I have not used them for any phone conversations yet, but all other features seem to work good. Battery life is good. So far I am on approx 5 hours since charging. (approx 45 mins a day at gym). For the money they are awesome"
0,"Good bass, overall sound quality good. Dealbreaker is the over the ear wet noodle. You might as well buy in the ear than these."
0,"The good:  Sound quality is fine (not great) when used as headphones.  It's comes with a dual USB Car charger and many accessories.  The battery seems to work as they describe.<br /><br />The bad:  Very uncomfortable with how they fit in the ear and the over the ear part doesn't have any functionality at all.  Also they look and feel very cheap.<br /><br />The ugly:  When I use these as a headset for my phone (my primary intended use) everyone I speak with say that they can hear an echo, especially when they are also on a headset."
1,"They work well but, the volume buttons fell off (I am not sure where) the second week I had them. I didn't have time to send them back for an exchange and now I am not sure what will happen since yesterday was day 30. Will update soon<br />It's January 20, 2018 and the pannel that I need to connect to Wi-Fi is nowhere to be found. I am ordering another pair."
1,Works great!
0,Too big to fit ears so had to return them
1,I purchased these headphones almost two years ago and they still work just fine. Sometimes they'll disconnect for no reason but it's very infrequent for me. I've used these nearly everyday for work (I work in a loud shop). These headphones have been washed at least twice and chewed on by my 1 year old and have stood up to rigorous use.
1,They are the nicest earbuds ever great sound and can hear perfectly fine on my scooter too!
1,Great for morning workouts
1,Clear loud and don't have to charge often perfect set of headphones for the gym
0,I need to be contacted by the seller. I have already started looking for new ear buds.
1,"These are the best wireless headphones I've ever purchased. These are top quality for the price! They fit perfectly in your ear, limiting background noise. The sound is crisp and clear.  The best thing about these are, my girlfriend complains while we talk when I have my wireless headset (other brand) on but not with these! Thank you Senso for these amazing headphones!"
0,"So much bass these are unlistenable. If you can only turn &#34;Meet the Beatles&#34; (an album with almost no bass) up to 3/10 because your ears are taking a beating from the bass, there's a problem with the headphones."
0,"Could not get them to fit my ears snugly, so sound quality and noise cancellation would have been horrible.  BUT, I never got the chance to find out.  Right out of the box, they appeared to charge properly (red LED lit at start, blue LED lit at end), but they would not power up.  After that, they completely died.  No LEDs light when trying to power up, nor when attempting to charge them.  Too bad.  With all the great reviews...."
1,"Excellent quality, comfortable and great little pouch to store them in. Comes with 2 cables and a double car charger! bargain."
1,I really appreciate the reliability of this product..<br />I have purchased this product multiple times because I have them in when I sleep.<br />I easily and quickly switch them out without hiccups.<br />The only reason I didn't give them a 5 star rating is that if I have them synched to more than one device I have to go into blue tooth settings to select them...<br />When they are synched up to only one device the automatic connection is very quick.
1,I have not had any problems so far with these headphones.  The sound is very clear and they fit beautifully.
1,These headphones are a great bang for your buck! Great quality sound and easy to charge. I accidentally ran mine through the laundry though 😔
0,I bought these for use during some of the OCT races I run because they are water resistant.  The sound quality is very quite
1,The sound quality is very good battery life is excellent and its also sturdy .
1,They sound good and have good battery life but hurt my ears after continuous wear with all three sizes.  My Samsung ones never did.  I'll eventually have to get a different brand as I wear them all day while working for music and phone calls
0,Was very sastisfied until last week when it stopped working.
1,Very good headphones for the price!
1,"I'm way behind the times.... And these are my first pair of Bluetooth earbuds.<br />All I knew was that I wanted to vac the house and listen to music without having to carry my phone/with old school audio jack earbuds plugged in... Lol.<br />I figured sports style ones would be hassle free (not fall out easily, have the cord to prevent falling to ground).<br />I couldn't be more impressed. The countless positive reviews about this item are accurate (and certainly more detailed about the tech aspects than I know about)... Lol.<br />I'd highly recommend! Either for yourself or to gift. The box they came in was high end, packaging was stellar. The storage case is well made and really set this product apart from other similar earbuds. A small mesh pocket within case securely holds all the additional earbuds included. They included bonus gifts like a cellphone mount (magnet) and a cellphone pocket (to attach to cellphone to hold money or credit card). As for comfort/sound... I'm no expert. But they are quite secure and have excellent sound quality...even over the sound of my vacuum! Lol..."
1,"The headphones sound okay for the price, the ear buds that came with mine were a really hard rubber that felt weird to start and after a hour or so started to make my ears sore. Also the clip thing for the ears isn't adjustable so it doesn't really sit right. Other than  weird fitting issues though they seem well built and they don't have as much interruption as even some more expensive buds that I have bought in the past."
1,Great music sound and easy to use.
1,"This are really nice bluetooth headphones, not only the sound quality is good but they can reduce noise very well, I will definitely use them on my next flight :)"
0,Less then a week and one side already doesn't work. I wasn't even able to do what I was supposed to do with them. This really sucks
1,"I haven't had a chance to work out using these yet, but setup was easy and they stay in while I actively cleaned my house. They fit well, despite having a tragus piercing (a main concern when buying earbuds) and the smallest size bud fit perfectly.<br /><br />Update: I've worked out with these often and they work great! They stay in despite me moving around and sweating."
1,"This may be sweatproof, but failed after a few swims in pool. This occurred on two different headsets. Swims were on kickboard, not submersing headsets more than a foot on occasion.<br /><br />Mini-USB charging connection is very annoying due to its location by the ear hook and the rubber flat, which combine to make plugging in the charger frustrating."
1,Great sound
1,"These work great. I didn't buy them for myself, but my dad says the sound quality is good and the battery life is too"
1,"Love them, very comfortable and amazing sound."
1,bought specifically to wear at football games
0,Stopped working a little over a month after buying.
0,"Will be returning these. Just got them today, nothing wrong with them. But the fit is just TERRIBLE.<br />If you're someone with smaller ears like myself, do not waste your time.<br />They did not stay on for the life of me.<br />The hook that goes over your ear is VERY flimsy, almost making there no point for them unless you have dumbo ears. Also the ear piece itself buldged out way too much for my liking.<br />Stayed in OKAY for a bit, but once I started to sweat, they kept slipping off.<br />Thoroughly dissatisfied."
1,Excellent sound and functionality for the price:  it's a value buy that you will not be disappointed with.
1,My order said you get a free cell phone car mount... you don't<br /><br />But as far as the headphone go.. they are ok.. they are fine for the gym as long as you do not get 3 feet from your phone.. but for $30 what can you expect<br /><br />No problems connecting 2 phones. Volume is loud not a bad sound quality.. I was hopeful these would be my all day headphones but looks like for the gym only
1,They are perfect.
1,"They fit nicely, have good battery duration (7 hours for music) and the sound quality is much better than expected."
1,Better then i expited
1,Good headphones. Sound good and connect easily. Drops one star since the boxes on the earpieces are so bulky and I can't actually control my volume with the controls on the connecting wire.
1,"Got these as a present, must say I was taken by surprise. I've had them for almost a year now and been using them heavily since without any problems. The features for such an unknown and inexpensive brand is what struck me the most. They contain just about all the features you'd expect from a high $$ ones. They pair with phones, tablets, TVs, Firestick, and much more. They can also be paired with 2 devices at once. The description says that they are some sort of a waterproof but I have not tested this feature (no desire to either). The charging time is quick and they work a good while on each charge. The only thing this pair is missing is a noise cancellation feature, but for the price and the durability, I can't be complaining. Overall, great Bluetooth headphones and I'm truly impressed!"
0,"Actually decent earphones HOWEVER they are supposed to be ""waterproof"" and to come with 1yr warranty. I purchased them 2.5 months ago, dropped them in the pool literally for a few seconds and they stopped working. I called manufacturer Tekatron customer service 3x and each time I was told I would hear back from their warranty dept. 9 days after my first call I'm still waiting."
1,"Sound good, comfortable and they stay put.  Great bargain."
1,"These headphones are very comfortable and the cable fits perfectly around the neck, even for a big headed guy like me!<br /><br />The sound is crisp and the signal is solid. I honestly have to give extra points for the packaging, it brought so much stuff, a charging cable that switches from lightning to android, a car charger, a case... All the works! Thanks guys, I hope you keep up the good stuff."
1,"I was skeptical at buying them at first but I am so glad that I purchased them. it's the best $20 I have spent, especially on headphones. Great Sound and great quality, especially for the price."
1,Overall I like this product and would refer it to friends. Below are some pros and cons (that's why it's only 4 stars)<br /><br />Pros:<br />Delivered promptly<br />Packaging is well thought out (very sleek)<br />The extra goodies are a nice touch!<br />Like that it specs and step up included pictures<br />Easy set up and was ready to go in 30 sec<br />I've charged it fully once and have used it for about 2.5hrs with no issues.<br />Sound didn't cut out when I was walking around the house without my paired device (15ft)<br />Fits well and I don't feel like it was going to fall off<br />Powerful sound and clear (haven't tried to make calls with it)<br /><br />Cons:<br />Feels slightly bigger than other Bluetooth ear buds but that could be because of the quality of components used since the sound is good.<br /><br />The lowest sound setting can be better. I personally feel there should be two more levels before going to no sound. I had to use the base reducer feature on my phone to lower the sound to a more comfortable level for me. My thought is that the lowest setting should still allow me to hear the surrounding ambient noises (faintly) like cars people talking<br /><br />When I run around or walk fast the wind noise is quite loud that it impacts the music I'm listening too. I haven't tried the other size earbuds so maybe that would solve the issue.
1,I wear these bad boys running and I have gotten rained on several times. They still work great!!! My only complaint is that you can't use them while they are charging. I have had mine for about a year and they usually last about 8 hours after a full charge.
1,"I like the wrap around retainers keep the buds in place.  I also like that can be used on more than one device, the TV and the phone."
1,Bought as a Christmas gift for my adult niece.  She loves it.....so i bought another for myself.  I like it too.  Do u really need to buy Beats?  Dont wast ur money....just buy this.
1,They sound great - however I often have trouble connecting.  When I first turn them on they connect fast - but if I shut them off and try to connect again it takes a while.  It's rather frustrating.
1,"Good sound quality, very comfortable.  Comes in a nice package as well as a nice carry case and assorted ear bud sizes.  Great value for the price."
1,"I ordered these for my husband and he loves them! He is able to listen to music while he works out, and has worn them while doing yard work, etc. Wireless is great."
1,"The order was delivered on-time and in good condition.<br /> Perfect quality. Perfect sound. Perfect fit both to my ears and style. This kit includes 3 spare ear tip pairs, manual, warranty card, nice carrying case, USB charging  cord, plus 2 bonus things: magnetic car phone holder and cellphone card stick-on  wallet. Plus everything is packaged in gift- quality box.<br />After reading the reviews I've bought 3 sets for my family.<br />Easy, fast setup with both a phone  and a tablet. Much more convininient than one- ear headsets."
1,I have tried a handful of Bluetooth headphones escpecially to wear in gym. My biggest problem was that I have small ear openings and none of them stayed put while I ran. They kept popping out. My only option for a long time was over the ear headphones which were annoying. Finally ordered these and I love the cushiony ear plug. They stay put and don't move even with running. Love it !!!
1,"Actually it's pretty good ,<br />It's very loud too which I like"
1,These headphones are great. The volume seems to be separate from the phones allowing more volume in crowded/loud areas when needed. The headphones are better than i expected.
1,"The SENSO Bluetooth headphones are good for their price. As a cheaper option for wireless earbuds, the sound quality isn't as good as other earbuds I have used during voice calls, although it works fine for music. Occasionally, the connection will bug out and disconnect, but it happens rather infrequently. Overall, for the price range of the item, it's quite good, but don't expect anything amazing from these earbuds."
1,"I really like this Bluetooth, it came in a nice package with a cinch bag for your accessories,you have two batteries to fit either right or left ear It fits snugly into your ear and the sound is very vibrant!"
1,The sound is very clear.  I have to get used to the cord having to go behind the neck but overall a very good product.  Received my order quickly as well.
1,Had these headphones  for over 4 months and they worked great. Recently the left earbud started to have issues. Contacted Senso support and their rep was fantastic. She only had me try one reset of the device and when it did not work a new set was sent. Very unusual to get great customer support these days. Thank you
1,This bluetooth headset is outstanding. The sound quality is phenomenal. I am impressed.
1,I loved my Senso wireless headphones so much that I decided to get another pair for a friend for Christmas!  I love them.
1,Very good quality and sounds great!
0,"After 3 weeks of Use, they stop working😞😞 I just returned them for a full refund....IM SO DISAPPOINTED!"
1,Works fantastic
1,"good quality sound, comfortable fit , A+"
1,"Bought these for my nephew and he loved them. Great sound, comfortable and very easy to use."
1,Some of the cheapest best I’ve ever had. After 3 years it’s time to retire them.
1,"I've only used your product once so far and am pleased with the sound... however I do have several early concerns.  Neither your enclosed paperwork, nor does your website contain the following important information:<br /><br />The dual port car charger unit has two female outlets, 2.1A  &  1.0A.  Which one should be used with this product & why are there two?<br /><br />The 3' white charging cord has different connector ends than the short black one that fits Android phones. The enclosed paper folder describes the 3' white one as being compatible with Mini USB and Apple lightening ports.  What USB ports is it compatible with?  Any Android?  A more comprehensive description would be appreciated.<br /><br />What is the two little &#34;wire tie&#34; rubber buttons for?  How are they used?<br /><br />There is no phone number given in the enclosed paperwork for customer questions nor needed assistance.<br />Comprehensive detailed information about this product and it's components would certainly be welcomed in the enclosed paperwork, or at least on your website."
1,"Checked out a lot of different headphones, then decided on this one. Glad I did. They have excellent sound, are comfortable to wear, and very easy to connect and use. I would recommend these to anyone looking for Bluetooth headphones."
1,So far so good! I ll recommended to buy
1,They work well.  Pretty reliable and sound nice.
1,"Great headphones and accessories that came with it. They stay on while sprinting and jogging. They have survived my sweaty workouts and did not come off even once. Sound quality is superb and is worth the price. The rubber ear hook attachments are very flexible and do not hurt my ears. I had these on for four hours until I had to take them off because of slight discomfort, but that's a lot longer than my regular earphones.<br /><br />All in all, I love these headphones and would buy them again if I ever lose them."
1,I've been using these for about a week now.  The sound quality is good and they connect immediately to my phone.  Both factors are vary important to me.  The noise cancelling effect is okay too.
0,Stopped working after 4 months of infrequent use.
1,"My first day using these headphones so I can't speak to how they will stand the test of time, but these are by far the best headphones I have ever used. The sound is simply incredible. I have owned LG Bluetooth headphones before, but these are way better with regard to sound quality. Hard to believe BT headphones can sound this good. Stop researching ....buy them. You will thank me later for saving you from wasting a few more hours of your life :-)"
1,great item
1,as expected
1,"These headphones are value priced, were easy to pair with my devices, and provide very good sound. Exceeded my expectations."
1,"These are good sounding earbuds for the price.  Plenty of different sized tips for ear canal sizes, has a car charger, and nice cable that works for android or apple lightning connector.  I have used these buds since May of 2017 pretty much every day, 8 hours a day listening to podcasts or music.  You can take calls, ignore calls, etc.  Only thing I don't like is the flimsy wire that connects the two buds together.  I have one side that is shorting out, but the company is honoring their 1 year warranty, and sending me out a new pair.  Are they Beats?  No, but they are darn close, and for the person who is just using these to work out or go for a bike ride, etc. they would be fine.  As a mechanic, I am constantly in different positions, and the wire sometimes gets in the way.  Those are minor issues though.  For the money, you can buy 3 pairs of these, and still wouldn't be as pricey as a set of Beats."
1,"The ease of operating, along with great sound quality. Works great for me when I am on the treadmill or on walks."
1,"I was sceptical at first because I've had Sony MDR, Beats etc. You name it and I've had them. These earbuds are solid in every way. They paired quickly, they sound great. They have a clear sound. Easy to operate! They even come with a car charger, as well as a house charger. Really can't go wrong with these!"
1,I am VERY impressed. I purchased these to replace the &#34; more expensive &#34; brand and I have to say the sound is comparable if not better! In addition they come with useful accessories!
1,"These heaphones work very well and work very smoothly. They're also stable for running, and jumprope. Highly recommend"
1,Mic didn't pick up well.
0,These headphones died after just a few times of use. Don't buy these if you  sweat a lot as they will break.
1,"What a great deal on great earbuds. Sound awesome and nice price. I have had many earbuds, but these are great sound. Solid bass, easy buttons, great charge - have been running several days without charge. So much better than the 10 other pairs of earbuds I have purchased and returned. I write few reviews, but had to for these - nice buy."
1,I have purchased 4 SENSO wireless Bluetooth headphones and have been very satisfied with this product. They are very easy to use and comfortable to wear. I had no trouble hearing my cell phone on a plane even with the engine noise. The price is super reasonable and the company stands behind its 1 year warranty. I know this from personal experience because I had a defective pair and SENSO replaced them promptly with a new set.
1,"These headphones are great in the 3 days I've been using them.  Easy charge, connect, control and sound. Stay on ears without discomfort because the ear wrap is soft.  Highly recommend for music and phone use."
1,"These are NOT noise cancelling. Very hard to hear, even at Max volume, on plane."
1,"I'm very happy with these headphones.  They are simple to use, light, comfortable and provide high quality sound -- I listen to classical and pop, vocal and instrumental music.  The accompanying charger (12V auto) and charge/USB cable are above average quality.  I had a minor problem (my problem) when I received the unit and their tech-support was very prompt and very helpful in helping through the problem."
0,My ears are small so they fall off easy
1,Exactly what I was looking for
1,Just taken them out for the first time while cycling for 30 miles.  Sound is awesome! Way better than the beats I had previously.  .  After 2 hours of continuous use I've only used 10% of the battery.
0,Headphones worked great for about a month and then one day they just stopped working. I thought that they just needed to be charged but I charged them for hours and they still won't work. I am going to contact Senso to see if they will honor any kind of warranty but I don't know if it is even worth the trouble.<br /><br />I contacted customer service and they are supposed to be sending me a new pair of headphones. I will give a better rating if I get the new pair and they last for more than a month.
1,good product but range is not optimal
1,I was really impressed with this headset.  The sound is very clear and I love the way they fit.  Very comfortable.  I use them for watching TV in bed so I don’t disturb my husband.
0,"Headphones fit in ear okay and sound is okay if you are just using inside but if you want to use them outside and there is even a hint of wind where you live beware. I ended my run early and went home because all I could hear in these headphones was constant whooshing sound in my ears, not music, and there was barely any wind out."
1,"Great sound quality for the price and great battery life, but they are very hard to get to stay in your ears and don't block any sound from coming in, so they aren't the best for ""getting in the zone"" so to speak. Also, they don't get very loud."
1,"After two and a half years of constant use in my jogging and exercise routines, the plastic has degraded and still works. It was my longest-lasting headset in terms of battery life, sound quality, and button conditions. Recommended."
1,"Sometimes difficult connecting, but great overall for the price."
1,"Surprising sound, clear with good bass and loudness. Definitely recommended. Easy set up and use. Comfortable. Lightweight.  They aren't Bose or Beats, but for forty bucks, you won't find anything close to these earphones.  Easy buy decision, in my opinion.  Only had these for a few hours,  so durability is an unknown."
1,"These are lightweight, comfortable, pair seamlessly, have great battery life, and offer very decent audio quality. I really have no complaints after one week of heavy use. They've been perfect for me at the gym and during my commute. The water resistance is great (I've showered with them, no problem) and they stay put when I'm working out. I was concerned they looked bulky in the photos, but they're really very light and comfortable when in my ears. As far as audio goes, to my ears, all earphones tend to fall into 2 categories of audio quality: on the tinny side or the bassy side. These have a slightly bassy quality, but it's not obnoxious. I find it pretty pleasant for my wide ranging tastes (mostly podcasts, jazz, rock, classical, and occasional hip-hop during workouts). They arrived packaged very nicely and, as noted by other reviewers, come with a host of accessories that really make the value unbeatable: a car charger, 2 usb cable (long and short), a zip case, multiple cup sizes, and a lightning cable. I am very happy with the purchase. Will post an update if anything fails, but I don't anticipate it."
1,As the stars say.... Its okay... if you are looking for the cheapest set of bluetooth headphones... this is a contender... Im not fond of them. i went back to the headphones that come with the iphone until i can save up and buy some nicer brand ones
1,"the product was easy to use and in good quality. but what impressed me the most is Senso's  support center: friendly, prompt, and professional.  It's a great experience."
1,"These are really great headphones. The sound with music is really nice. The only problem I've had is that once when talking on the phone I got an echo, but I spoke to the owner of the company and he told me how to fix it.<br />Great headphones especially for the price."
1,Great product for the money. Power on/off and connectivity process is better than much higher priced units.
1,Wow! What a set of headphones! They are better quality and sound better than Power Beats. They fit great and are easy to use. Why pay $180 for headphones when you can get these for $30.<br />So glad I got them.I know now why they are a best seller on Amazon.
1,"Product itself seemed great. I'm a female and my ears are small. These fit inside my ear but were really uncomfortable. Also, as a runner I don't want to block out all noise for safety reasons and since these suction into your ear it's hard to hear anything but the music (which would normally be good). I like that it came with all these other pieces and accessories. The packaging was nice and the value was great - my ears are too small and I don't want to lose all sound so these weren't for me."
0,Dead after two months of light use. Now I'm trying to get the warranty to work.
1,Great product.<br />As advertised.
1,Husband loves these earphones. Thinking about getting myself and the kids some too.
1,"I just received the warranty replacement headphones, and I am thrilled with not only the customer service I received but also the headphones themselves.  Thank you so much!"
1,"GREAT sound, easy pairing, good fit, good range.  Overall wonderful with my iPhone 7+"
1,"Love it! Fits and works well! I like the fact that it comes with extra items (two chargers, car charger and ear buds). Works well with my iPhone as well."
1,Fantastic sound. Quality construction. Very comfortable fit/wear.
1,It is good Bluetooth for the cell phone.
1,This was my husband birthday gift and he love it.
0,Stopped working within 6 months of purchase.
1,"I've used these for a couple of months now. Almost everyday I wear them for an hour and a half in the gym. I haven't had any major issues. Just recently actually I've noticed that the Bluetooth connection maybe gets choppy and the music starts and stops, but considering how cheap they were, I think I got them for 35$, they are fine."
0,My wife has bought two of these headphones for me.  The first one a few years ago and used them religiously mowing grass and while working at my full time job.  The amount of battery life was good wished it was longer but they were good.  However the second set she bought me were horrible quality.  I think dollar tree has better wireless headphones.  First thing that happened when trying to switch the different ear bud size I popped the speaker off the headphone figured it was designed to do this to clean it better.  Should of been my first warning.  So I grab the included charger wire and plug it in no issue the light turns red.  However I noticed the light went out completely.  Checked the charger and it had completely broke inside the headphones making it now useless as it wouldn't even charge.  And to finish the icing the other ear piece came out completely to the point the wire stripped lose.  Absolutely garbage quality control.  She is sending it back for full refund and I supplied the 1 star review.  Guess it's time to find a better product.
1,After checking out other people's comments on how good these headphones were I decided to take the plunge. These are my first BT headphones. I just started hitting the gym again and I was  for something that didn't tie my cord to my phone.  I also didn't want to spend 100 bucks.  These headphones are everything everyone says they are at a great price.  I charged them when I got them and I've worked out for a whole week without recharging them so the battery life is great.  Only time will tell if they hold up but so far so good.  I loved the little extras like the Cigarette charger and the extra tips it makes the package well worth the cost.  I would recommend this product for somebody looking for a Bluetooth headset that's not gonna break the bank.
1,"I've only had these headphones for a couple of days, but I loved them the instant I tried them. They fit well on my ears (try a different earbud size if you have trouble, they send different sizes with the product), the audio quality is AMAZING (I've used them to listen to music and to make phone calls), and they're so out of the way I almost forget I'm wearing them. And it comes with so many great accessories (I especially love the case for the headphones that fits easily in my small purse). It's such a great product for such a great price (I paid $36). It's rare that you actually get something of excellent quality without having to pay an arm and a leg for it (other headphones I looked at were between $50 and $200). I'm glad I didn't waste the extra dollars because these headphones are wonderful. I plan to get my husband a pair."
1,Great product!  Easy setup simple to use. Excellent sound
1,"Worked great out of the box, like the combo charging cable. Would buy again for sure"
1,Excellent product
1,Honestly just received today but wow. Obviously a high quality product exactly as described. Great sound and well built and packaged. Will update if my opinion changes but for now this is a steal.
1,Great headphones has quality sound no slip during exercise but could you a clip to keep cord in place from falling off onto ground!
1,"These are must buy headphones! Straight Out of the Box everything was so well organized and easy to understand to get it connected to my Samsung Note 5. One of the first things I noticed was how even well-designed the cigarette portable charger was along with the USB cable itself was so Innovative that they combined both the iPhone charging cable along with the micro USB cable together. Once my new headphones we're synced up with my phone the first thing I had to do was test the quality of audio, why was I Blown Away with how great the audio sounded. They produce Dynamic audio quality such as the highs and the lows we're on point not to mention the sound isolation drownded out all of the background noise at the soccer fields so I could enjoy my music. I took a brief run and noticed that the headphones did not slipper slide around on my ears they stayed perfectly fit and it was like not having anything on at all. I would highly recommend not spending a bunch of money for headphones that can produce the same quality and fit such as these ones. I am starting to fall in love with my new Bluetooth headphones, not to mention they actually look pretty cool."
1,A1 love this bluetooth best price!!!
1,"These are great for the price , lightweight , easy to use and connect , comes with a charge so it's ready out the box. Flexible , so fear buds and also very comfortable around the ears. The sound is a bit over bass but what do you expect ? I love them for what I paid , I would recommend them as a good buy , great for gift giving too . Loved the case it came in and also the accessories  that came with it , like the dual plug car charger and iPhone wires. Get it !!!!"
0,"I loved the headphones at first, but after 4 months they broke.  The button to turn them on seems to be physically damaged.  Senso replaced them, but the replacement headphones stutter constantly -- they're unusable. Terrible quality control;"
0,"What piece of junk! It's good when it works - sounds great during my workouts and long runs. BUT the headphones completely died after only like 10 uses. They no longer power on. Even tried charging them thinking they ran out of battery but nope... DEAD. If you want cheap short lived headphones that only last after a few uses, then these are for you. You really do get what you pay for with these."
1,Great product so far but they are a little goofy trying to put them on.
1,Excellent product and service!!!
0,Came open and used
0,I don't like it. The battery last only 2 hours in a day.
1,Bought these for a side by side with Bluesonic. These came with a free cell phone holder that I use all the time!
1,"Best headphones I've owned, awesome for running."
1,Love the long-lasting charge and clear sound.
1,Great earphones with wonderful and clear sound quality. It is extremely well designed and aesthetically pleasing. Excellent accessories including an I-phone dual access portable car charger and a small case to carry both headphone and chargers. Wonderful product!
1,"This is a great product, especially for the price. It came with a couple surprise extras, including a magnetic vent mount for your cell phone. The sound quality is pretty decent and they come a nice case. The synced up quickly with both phone and tablet. They stayed on at the gym and have decent battery life."
1,"Very good sound, comfortable,"
1,I love these headphones. This is the first earbud headphones I owned that stays where it is supposed to stay. Sound quality and bluetooth connection is also highly impressive. I'd recommend it to any one.
1,"So far, have been delighted with the sound quality, packaging, functioning, instructions, price, and essentially everything about these headphones.  Only time will tell if they are durable since I run with them 2-3 times per week, but so far, this has been a great purchase that I would highly recommend!"
1,So far so good. Much better audio quality than other brands.
0,They don't connect to alexa.
1,"These work great for the gym! Perfect for the treadmill or any machine/weight exercises. Every so often it'll cut out for a second. Also, I've found the microphone doesn't work great for phone calls."
1,"They work great I love them they last long and are great for a workout, it's a good thing I didn't go buy the beats instead I saved lots 😅 thanks"
1,I'm very happy with my purchase of Sensor Bluetooth Headphones.
1,"These things are awesome. A little bulky compared to other Bluetooth headphones but they have good sound quality, comparable to Skullcandy headphones, and they fit nicely around the ear. There are times that they cut out while I work out but overall I'm satisfied with them."
1,They're exactly what I was expecting. Feels like a great set of headphones for an awesome price
1,These earbuds work really well. The pieces that go over your ears are a little big but I haven't had any problems with them falling off. Overall happy with the product.
1,Love the earbuds...sound is exceptional thanks
0,"i just bought it last week(8/4/17). I am quiet disappointed with the sound quality. or may be i just bought this looking at the  number of reviews.<br />I have beats 2 head phones and i wanted something wireless inexpensive earphones for workout.<br />I am returning it. Also, mic is at the ear piece, which if you want to make use off, you would probably be roaming around screaming so your voice reaches the caller.<br />Don't fall for the number of reviews, and if you still want to give it a shot, order it and check yourself. I love Bang & Olufsen in my car, probably thats why i cannot survive a bad quality music.<br />I may end up buying  Bose wireless.but i am not going to waste my $37 on these and regret everyday when i listen to them.<br />For further info: gagranikaran@gmail.com"
1,Love these!
0,These do not stay in.  They constantly fall out on my runs so now I can only wear them to lift weights.
1,"Right when I opened the Amazon brown box and saw the packaging I new these were going to be a quality set of earphones. Opening up the sturdy packaging presents you with yet another well designed carrying case that contains the earphones and all of the extra bits for swapping the ear tips and cable management. To top it all off, they've included what seems to be a really quality cable that can be switched between micro USB and thunderbolt for Android or iPhone users.<br /><br />Now on to the quality of the headphones themselves: the construction is very nice. I wasn't sure of the ear loops (?) because they looked a bit floppy at first look but they perform their function very well while maintaining comfort. The button operation is very straightforward and easy once you go through the initial reading for it. And finally, the sound quality is pretty amazing. The bass can seem a tiny bit muddy at times but at this price point the sound could be considered excellent. My girlfriend has the Jaybird Bluetooth headphones which are much more expensive and there really isn't much of a difference in the sound quality. The button operation is also better on these Senso phones, in my opinion."
1,"Really nice great sound great microphone, everything is good but couple things it falls of the ear easily and it's kinda big"
1,It is ridiculous how good these are! I can't believe I got them for this price. If you want good headphones for a resonable price. This is what you should buy.
1,I use them for running and when I ride my bicycle and the only complain is that they don't suppes the wind noise. I think this is not a big issue for the price that you paid.
0,very fragile ear piece in my estimation.  very poor design that way.  barely got to use it. If I had bought it at a store I would have returned it but amazon will not allow.
1,"Sweat proof, sound is amazing what more do I need."
1,"I bought these headphones in May and have loved them.  They sound, feel, and look great!  The only thing I wished was better is the Bluetooth range but for the price these are a great deal.  Sadly this week one side became much quieter than the other.  I emailed the seller and they responded very quickly and were able to answer some questions that I had.  They promptly sent me a new pair, no questions asked.  Killer customer service.  Would definitely buy from them again."
1,Put haded for my husband. He’s usually really bad with head phones but this one is still around he loves it sounds good
1,These are great for exercise - sound is very clear both in listening to music and for talking on phone. I am thrilled to not have to &#34;plug in&#34; anymore. I highly recommend!
1,Absolutely amazing product for the price. My powerbeats 2 wireless finally broke after 2 years of use. I bought these because I didn't want to spend 200$ on the powerbeats 3.im so glad I didn't. These are actually louder and the flexible ear hook fits over my ear better. I will never buy a beats product again after receiving these.
0,Sound quality was fine then it stopped working all together. It's a shame for having to spend over $70 for this.
0,"Where should I start. THESE CAUGHT ON FIRE WHILE CHARGING IN MY CAR. I was driving while charging these - they'd been plugged in for about half an hour. I smelt something like burning plastic and thought something was wrong with my car. A few minutes later I see smoke coming out from below. I didn't know what it was so I pulled over immediately and saw these burning up. I was using the charger that came with these headphones. This could have caused a major accident, caught my entire car on fire, etc. DO NOT BUY THESE HEADPHONES."
1,I've had several Bluetooth headphones before and these are the most versatile. I'm usually carrying my purse and laptop bag so other headphones that hang around my neck can get tangled. With the Senso headphones there's nothing to get tangled. The sound quality is perfect whether I'm on the phone or listening to a book.
1,"I've only used this a few times since it's fairly new but so far, it's great !! I have friends who have purchased similar products that were much more expensive and I honestly can't tell a big difference. I think this is a great product at a GREAT price !!"
1,Great product. Great battery life. Fits well in and over the ear. Would buy again
0,"i'm not at all happy with this product. it does not keep a good connection with my phone, and does not have good noise cancelation. i find myself having to disconnect calls often because i can't hear or be heard. i'm a dog walker and often need to talk to my clients and my staff while my hands are otherwise occupied. i was hoping this device would be great but it has been very frustrating and disappointing."
1,"Good sound quality and adjustable ear clips make sure they don't fall off when exercising.  However they tend to disconnect right after initial pairing, then will re-connect.  Once re-connected they work fine."
0,Horrible stopped working in less than a month.
1,"Good battery life, excellent sound"
0,"The sound quality is OK and you get a lot of stuff in the little package at a decent price.<br /><br />I was a little let down though. It's really heavy for this particular type of sport headphones.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is that if you push on the unit to firmly set it in your ears so it doesn't fall out, you push the power button. The button is right on the side and is easy to depress so you always accidentally push it when you adjust the headphones when they inevitably come loose.<br /><br />The ear loops are so flimsy that they don't support any of the weight of the ear piece.<br /><br />With a little weight reduction, slightly firmer ear loops, and the power button relocated so you don't push it when you go to push your headphones back in, these would be hard to beat for the price.<br /><br />Just not for me, I prefer Jaybirds in every way... except the price."
0,Charging flap was hard to open now will not close and I never had it with any other brands . I’m sure it will fall off with use and dirt or sweat will clog the opening and make charging difficult and finally fell off
0,The last several I have purchased has been defective. Not turning on at all or not holding a charge. Something has changed with this manufacturer
1,"I bought this several months ago and I must say that I am most pleased with it's performance. BOSE maniacs will hate me for saying this but I also own a wireless bluetooth BOSE headphones( I use this at my home and the SENSO in my car) and quite frankly they're both compatible. In fact although the BOSE has a built in protection factor does not allow you to max out the volume to possibly be a hazard while driving, the SENSO does nto have this built-in so it;s an advantage for me but at the same time I don't overdo it as I tend to be a defensive driver and keep the volume not loud enough to be a hazard factor. I LOVE my SENSO!"
1,Great headphones. Bluetooth works great. Sounds is much better than I'd expect from a wireless earbud. Invotek delivered quickly as promised!
1,"Ordered these to replace my wired earbuds that I was using for running. I would describe the sound quality as pretty decent, but sometimes the device has a LOT of stuttering when listing to music. At least a couple times a song, it will &#34;buffer&#34; for half a second. This seems to improve the longer the connection has been established, and does not appear to be related to the location of the phone - for example, I get the stutter whether the phone is in my pocket, my hand, in the case or out of the case, or 15 feet away.<br /><br />The other negative aspect of these headphones is the wind noise. It's AWFUL. I have to wear a beanie when I run outside or the noise gets too annoying. These are loud headphones with decent music clarity, so you can usually turn up the volume in order to compensate, but you'll still here the wind noise no matter what you do.<br /><br />Overall, these are decent quality with good sound and stay on the ears well, but the stuttering (&#34;buffering&#34;) along with the wind noise knocks these down to a 3/5 star review. Decent purchase for the low price point, and work well in the gym, just not outside."
1,"This will be my 4th purchase of the Senso Bluetooth Headphones.  This is a good thing because now every member of my family has a pair of their own.  They will no longer need to borrow my set.<br />The headphones are well made and they have a long lasting battery life.  We use them hiking, working out, running and working around the house.<br />I am an avid audio book listener and use the headphones while listening.  I can only hear the audio book and nothing else around me while listening.<br />The quality and price point are well worth the purchase."
0,The call quality is horrible
0,"I had a previous pair that lasted a couple years and through alot of runs. When they quit, I bought a second pair which turned out to be not so good. Sound and all was good, however after a short while the button to push to pair up with my music stopped working. Since I can't turn them on, I can't use them. They are of no use to me now"
1,I love it.
1,I like the feel of your headphones. They are comfortable and they sound great. So far the battery life is holding up and they haven't failed under sweat. 
0,"I bought these two days ago and just received them. I received the defective piece. I hate the fact they sent me the defective piece. And sound isn’t even that good. However, they are going to send me a new set, but still I had to go through this hassle."
0,"I've owned these headphones for several months now, bought a pair for myself and the wife.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Cheap<br />Durable (didn't seem to have any trouble with water; it took going through a washer/dryer cycle to kill them, whoops)<br />Decent sound quality (esp. given the price)<br /><br />Cons:<br />The headphones give you about a 5 minute warning when the battery is about to die; countless times I'd be mid-run and they'd start dying, giving me an annoying reminder every 30 seconds that the battery was low before shutting off<br />Connection can be weak; when first connecting these via bluetooth each time, it typically takes about 10-15 seconds to get a solid connection/sound output.<br /><br />I'll be honest, my biggest issue is the stupid battery warning. That may not be as big of a thing to some people, so if it doesn't matter to you, it's a good buy."
1,I got this for my daughter she likes them but wish you could adjust then size of the ear piece.  She stated it seems a little big for her ears but she does like the quality of sound and that it comes with a case.
0,These have a nice chunky battery and the water resistance is appreciated but the sound quality is among some of the worst earphones I have tried throughout my life. The whole point of the earphones is for quality sound. Even Amazon basics' earphones have a better sound signature than these.
1,"So far so good. Looks good, sounds great and I am happy."
1,Don;t know how I got along for so long without these. They stay secure even when I ride my motorcycle and can listen to music with no problem. Easy to operate.
1,"I'm really surprised with how good these headphones are. I've already run, work out, answered calls and until now everything is perfect. They're comfortable and don't bother you during the use."
1,It is shockingly realistic when you were using it on your phone. Many people cannot tell that you are using the secondary Mike.  I bought them as a throwaway Bluetooth device. I have since ordered three more. I guess that makes them short of throw away but loved.
1,Just bought third pair two as gift's they love the headphones. As do I
1,I bike everywhere as well as workout and needed something other than earbuds as they don’t work for me but this just doesn’t cut it. The sound quality is terrible and the earpieces don’t stay in my ear even with the hooks. If you have more money and time invest in something more.
1,These  have been the best earplugs that I have owned .... they stay in place great sound quality at a great price
1,"These ear buds are nice and light and I found the sound quality good.  They stay put and are very easy to operate.  The ear hooks are very pliable so they don't take any &#34;break in&#34; period.  I would not hesitate to order these again, but with how robust they seem, I doubt I'll need to.  They also come with a compact hard sided case to protect them in your bag.  Buy 'em and enjoy!"
1,Mic quality is not up to the mark
1,"I bought these as a back up set.  I have used them four times and really like the sound quality.  However, I received a phone call and answered it, but the reception wasn't good at all.  My iphone was two feet away, so it wasn't that.  The headphones had a fresh charge, so it wasn't that.  My assessment isn't complete, and will update my assessment after a few more weeks."
1,"So far, so good. I like them, and they are easy to use. I've only used them one time so I can't comment about battery life or other issues that may crop up. The buttons are easy to use and understand. I just have to get used to how to adjust it in my ear without touching the buttons, but that will come with a little more use. I did have a problem with set up using the supplied 3 foot charging cord, but a quick call to customer service solved the issue. The first connector is for the phone. You have to slide the unit apart to reveal the connector for the headphones. A more technical person probably would have realized that. But I am very happy with the wireless set up and the comfort of the ear pieces. No more cord getting in the way of my workouts."
1,"These sound so so much better than my Bose. I love them. If you like bass, get these."
1,"These are great, I use them in the gym and I have no complaints . They sound good and stay on my head"
0,"I was so excited about these headphones! There were working great for all of 5 weeks. On Saturday, May 13, 2017 the button on the right ear that turns it off and on broke. They are charged, but I cannot turn them on. I've barely had these for 1 month and they already fell apart. Very disappointed in these. I don't usually spend this much money on headphones and now I know I was right to keep that rule for myself."
0,"Headphone pop a lot which is very annoying and the hooks are way too big, headphones can fall out but not too often"
1,"We've only had these headphones for a few days, but so far, we are very impressed. We own two pair & we are waiting for the third to be shipped (since selling out on Prime Day)"
1,use every day
1,"Solid headphones with powerful HD sound, I like these!! for a great price. I had a small issue with my original pair but they were replaced super flashed by the company directly. Thanks!!"
0,"These used to work great until the left ear stopped working and then the right stopped working after only a few months. Contacted the seller Tekatron and they wouldn't send me a working pair, or even offer for me to send in my defective pair and repair them. Don't waste your money to only have to throw these away. Seller is not willing to even help you out."
0,And before buying something different
1,Nice fit and sound. connect very easily and are easy to operate. The only shortcoming seems to be the charge port cover which doesn't flip out of the way very well when trying to plug charge cable into headset.<br /><br />Just had a warrantee issue and the service and reissue of replace headphones was outstanding
0,"The materials felt good and the battery life was better than expected.  The sound quality was ok.  The volume jumped in large increments.  At low volume you could hear a low feedback noise.  They stopped working just outside the warranty period which was disappointing.  I know these are not expensive, but I don't like products that break just outside the warranty period.  Going to try another cheap Amazon exclusive brand before I fork up more money from a more reputable manufacturer."
1,"Overall I'm super pleased with these headphones. The battery lasted longer than I expected, and I had no issues with connectivity. Sound quality is good, for the price, but that is to be expected. Solid headphones for working out with, I'm glad I got them!"
1,Open the package and it didnt disapoint me. I like how convinient it is when I have to walk and drive. Love it!!!
1,The headphones were brought for my son and so far he is very pleased with them.
0,Stopped pairing with my phone for unknown reasons.
0,"Where's the zero stars.  This is a piece of junk.  It's uncomfortable on the ears and the controls don't respond well when you push the buttons, and the volume control doesn't adjust the volume on the iPhone.  I keep tapping away on the volume control and it advances to the next track or goes back to the previous one.  The controls are just plain lousy.  30 minutes into using this and I've already had enough and put it back in the box and am returning it for a refund.  Don't buy this product.  Spend the extra money for a superior product."
0,"I like this headset, generally speaking.<br />The sound quality is good. It is easy to operate, and fairly comfortable when in place in the ears.<br />However, when used while riding a bicycle, the wind noise is increased so much that it is difficult to hear the sound from the headphones. This is the biggest con for me as I use them bike commuting daily.<br />Also, as I use this with my iPhone, I would like to be able to access Siri from the headset. However, the side button that plays and stops music, will not activate Siri.<br />The battery charge doesn't last very long and there is no warning until the battery is almost dead.<br />I also find the wire tends to gather at one side of my neck and when I turn my head the ear piece gets pulled out. I don't know how this can be improved, but this is my experience."
1,"I've had these for almost 2 weeks now.  I have to say they are better than I thought they would be for the price.<br />Pros...<br />The piece over the ear is bendable.  Took a bit but now they are extremely comfortable.<br />I mainly use them to talk to family on the phone and audio books and the sound is very clear.  You can adjust volume by your phone or on the ear piece.<br />Now, I thought the mic would be a problem, just the opposite, I come thru crystal clear on the phone.  WoW.<br /><br />Cons<br />The battery doesn't seem to last long, for me anyway,  but 4 to 6 hours of constant use might be good for others.<br />But then again it takes about a hour to recharge and I'm back to using them again.<br /><br />I'll definitely be buying these again as gifts for my family."
1,Great headphones for the price!!!
1,"These are the first wireless earbuds I've owned. I was looking for good earbuds that would stay in my ears while running or biking trails. They come with lots of extra accessories which you may find useful but the most important parts for me are the ear hooks and foam tips. The hooks are comfortable and keep your headphones where you put them, and the foam tips will prevent the muffled &#34;wire bouncing&#34; sound that you get with properly sealed silicone tips while running. The unfortunate thing is they don't sound good. It's as if everything you play through them is a YouTube video on the &#34;240&#34; setting. My daily earbuds are Skullcandy Titans which I've had for over 5 years and the sound quality on the these earbuds doesn't come close to those. SENSO got everything I wanted into these headphones except for good sound quality, which ultimately leaves me where I started: searching for good sounding workout headphones. Verdict: If all you're looking for are headphones that will stay put through a &#34;high impact&#34; workout, these are great for the price. However, if a noticeable lack of sound quality will distract you (like it does for me) I'd suggest looking elsewhere."
1,Love these Senso wireless earphones! I have bought so many cheap ones that did not last long. Great quality and sound! Will be buying these for my daughter for Christmas.
1,"Great sound,easy to sync to your phone,I bought me a pair and I love them she much I bought my wife a pair now she loves them,great price"
0,"I like that it came with charging cord, lighter attachment extra ear buds but people still have trouble hearing me talking. The clarity is not good for phone conversations but fine for listening to music."
0,"They worked great at first but started having issues connecting to Bluetooth.  Now every 3-5 minutes the sound stops, there is a 5-10 second pause, the eapbuds say connected and then I have to hit play again to start music or audio play.  Working with vendor on another warranty pair or refund."
1,Fantastic.  Love them.  Fits great and sounds wonderful.  Easy to use and fun.  Thanks
1,"Purchase these headphones for my wife as a gift, and she loves every minute of them. She uses them to do landscape, exercise, and just normal every day use, and she can’t stop raving about them."
1,"I was hoping for better sound quality like with the Blayz earbuds which look very similar to these.  Apparently Blayz has higher quality so I'll stick to that brand.  I just broke my Blayz earbuds when these finally die.  They are okay for talking on the phone though, don't get me wrong."
0,"Got these after a lot of research, I was impressed with the online reviews, however I used them less than 4 days! The wire on the headphones twisted and broke ! Maybe I got a defected piece.. all in all such a disappointment!"
1,"great ,clear loud sound. easy to pair"
1,sound quality is ok. they fit my ears weird and can get uncomfortable since they're a bit bulky
1,Amazing
0,"I've had these for 5 months already. Reading the &#34;promoted&#34; reviews on this product page i believed that these would be good. Well... you get way you pay. For the price, $30, these wireless earphones i would say are decent enough. Sound quality is not great (as opposed to those claiming it on the main reviews), sub par compared to stock Iphone/Apple earbuds.<br />My major beef is that the bluetooth reception on these are crap. If i have my phone in my pocket, depending on how i move my head, the reception gets crappy."
1,Great quality for price. Great sound. Great charge over five days with two hour workouts daily. Only compliant is I had to get flanged ends for my ears because they wouldn't stay in during CrossFit workouts with jumping.
1,"I bought these two years ago and they worked very well until a couple weeks when they started disconnecting from my phone whenever I would try to adjust the volume on the earpiece. It's too bad as these were really great for the price and somewhat comfortable. I guess for $20, 2 years of usage is fine"
1,After about a week or two of using them and must say that These are pretty good. Really loud and comfortable like you barely know you're wearing them. I used the mic without any issues so far. Easy to charge and easy to connect to your phone
1,I really like the sound sound quality on these.
1,Received the product quickly. It was easy to pair and start using. I listen mostly to books so I don't focus on sound quality but for my purpose the sound was clear and clean. I expect music would be too.  The only comment is that the piece that fits over the ear is too flexible to really stay in place and stiffing it up would be an improvement.
0,"I bought the Senso earbud to replace the one i bought last year on prime day thinking it would be as good  as the one from last year. It was a total disapointment., quality has reduced drastically . It is a shame that the manufacturer will mess up a great product.<br /><br />I had high hopes for this earbud because the one that i lost was very good, so i assume the replacement would be good as well.<br /><br />Firstly, the connection breaks constantly even with earbud in line of sight of my phone or any device connected to the earbud .  The sound quality is terrible, bass is long gone,i can go on and on.<br /><br />I will be returning this item.  It's a shame that a quality product has been compromised."
1,Best decision ever to buy this headphones. Great sound!
1,I don't see what others see in this item.  The audio quality is awful.  Muffled and misequalized.  Try another direction for much better audio.
1,Beats who!? Awesome product! Comfortable and excellent sound quality definitely recommending!!!! For sure buy!!!!
1,This is the second set of senso ear buds I ordered (this ones for my husband) both of us love our senso ear buds. I had been searching for a earphones in my budget but won't fall apart in a second. These headset fit that perfectly.  Their customer service is great and you get a year warranty.. what more can one ask for!
1,Simple yet effective
1,I use these for my bike rides...much better sound than my current pair..
1,Great
1,Sound quality is better than I expected. Good bass and phone clarity is good also.
1,Great HEADPHONES I bought one pair for my Boyfriend and we both can't stop using them. Quick charge and great for the gym.
1,Sounds good
1,"Really surprised at the quality I got for the price. Very clear audio, and fit nicely on my ears while jogging."
1,"I absolutely love these headphones! I've been using these headphones nearly every other day for work, commute, working. The headphones stopped working one day and I reached out to Tekatron's customer support for assistance. After a few emails back and forth trying to troubleshoot the issue, Tekatron warrantied my headphones! Customer service made the process very easy and straight forward. The headphones are great for what I use them for and knowing that customer service stands behind their product makes me feel confident about the products and the company behind them."
1,Love it. Great product.
1,I got this for running in a pool and love the quality of sound.  The battery life is great too.  I only charge it one every few weeks.
1,These are nice. They are a bit on the big side and make me feel like a receptionist but the sound is great. The mic has a bit of an eco.
1,"These earbuds are fantastic! They don't slip out of my ears in the least, the sound quality is great, and all of the accessories are such a huge bonus. My favorite part is how compact they are and how easy it is to slip the earbuds and their charging cable into the case that comes with them.<br /><br />I am partially deaf, and these earbuds go plenty loud enough for me. I can run, kayak, and even scrub down dorm bathrooms while carrying a ton of equipment with me, and I'm not worried about these slipping out.<br /><br />My only couple complaints are the following: first, sometimes they just get really iffy about connecting to my devices. They'll cut in and out. It doesn't happen often at all, but it does at times. Second: they definitely don't have a huge range. Although it advertises that they work from 30 ft away, sometimes mine work worse even from just a few feet away."
1,These headphones are OK.  I have not had any wireless one before so I can't compare.  What I don't like is the wind noise when running.
1,"Just got him yesterday, so far so good. They sound great, and work is a hands-free headset. They hooked right up to my Droid Moto Z. Very well pleased."
1,Bought these for my husband to take to the gym.  He loves them and thinks they sound great!
1,"Got a set for my wife for Christmas.  She liked them a lot...and then I tried them.  Two weeks later, I had my own pair...  That should give you a clue what a good buy these are and how nice they are.  Comfortable...good sound...works well...easy to use.  That pretty much covers it."
1,"Great sound when not in a nozzle environment, background noises overrides"
0,"I have only used them four times. I tried to charge them, but they don't seem to charge. They don't even turn on after trying to charge them. Many usar with the same problem"
1,"I wear these at the gym 4 days a week and I feel like I never have to charge them. They stay secure, sound great, look great and last a while in between charges. I couldn't imagine spending 2-300 on headphones, these things work just fine, and for a good price."
1,"-These sound good, the bass is okay.<br />-I like that there are no controls on the connecting cord ...which apparently causes the need for the ear prices to be a slight bit bulkier when compared to the $130 brand that we are all trying to avoid.<br />-The sound quality on these don't exactly match up the the other brand, but it's still good (may just be the slight lack of fullness ...or bass).<br />-For me, these don't fit around the ear as well as the other brand either. These feel a little loose, as if they might fall off during a run, but so far have not fallen off or really been a problem."
1,Superb sound
0,Broke right after return policy ende. Waste of money
1,I brought two for my wife and myself.  They are simple to setup and good sound quality.  I plan on running with them this summer and so I did a good  head banging test session and they did not fall off. Soo.. that looks like a good sign.
1,Not good long term investment
1,"Convenient, valuable,and sounds great. The fit and staying in place is a challenge for my ears. The piece that goes around the ear keeps slipping off during moderate activity of walking. It is not firm enough to stay in place. Which can be frustrating. I do like the convenience of the wireless, the value for all you get, and the sound for calls."
1,"Im just going to leave a quick review since there are so many reviews already.<br /><br />These headphones are more than worth the money. They have really good sound for the price. Buy them.<br /><br />Ive been using flat response earbuds for years so im not as big a fan of alot of bass as other people might be. That being said im much less a fan of very harsh high frequencies. These have a crisp and enjoyable high end. The low end and low mids were a little much for me. I find myself using an eq on my phone for most headphones anyway, and id much rather do a slight cut in the low end than have to do surgical eq in the highs and high mids.<br /><br />I did a 6-8 dB cut at 60hz and around 200 hz. I left the rest of the frequencies alone. After doing that i was very suprised with how it opened not only cleaned up the low mids but also cleaned up the overall clarity of these buds.<br /><br />That being said i cant suggest these enough for people. They are a little muddy but if you like more bass you can leave to lows alone and do a slight cut around 200 and you will not be disappointed. If you dont like using an eq, you really dont have to they sound fine without it.<br /><br />Thanks Senso! Dont understand why the big companies like sony cant seem to get this right on any of their bluetooth earbuds under 200 dollars. These buds sound better than all the non studio headphones i own. Even wired ones.<br /><br />Updated: i uploaded a picture of the eq settings of my specific set. This puts them pretty close to flat if anyone is interested."
1,"This headphone set was easy to pair with the my phone and simple to operate. Handling the few buttons seemed confusing at first, but once long-press for on and off was established, taking calls, muting/pausing, and volume control was intuitive. The built-in voice that indicates on, off, etc., is appreciated. Seems to have a range of 15 to 20 from its source before losing contact.<br /><br />After switching the ear pieces to one of the supplied pair that fits me, the SENSO had no problem staying ""plugged into"" my head.<br /><br />Reviewing before a mirror, the SENSO looks chunky/blocky on my head. Most certainly not elegant compared to higher-end models. Nonetheless, works and performs well."
1,I'm very happy with my purchase. They work perfectly. Have a great sound and very easy to setup. I love all the accessories that come with it. I would most certainly recommend these head phones to anyone who asks. Thank you.
0,"After using this product for 6 months, one day the battery overheated when charging and melted the plastic around the charging port. Now they don't work anymore. I cannot recommend buying headphones that only last 6 months."
1,"I’ve been using this brand of headphones for the last six years. They are awesome and durable. My last pair lasted for 3 years and I use them every single day for mountain biking. There was one time when the mic wasn’t working on a new pair that I bought. Customer service was easy to reach, quick to replace it, no questions asked."
1,Not bad headphones for the price but the sound quality is what you would expect for headphones under $40. They haven't given out on me yet but I do have to charge often if I use them every day for a little while at a time. Don't know if I would buy again but not too bad of a buy.
1,"I didn't expect that this headphone have a good bass and it's so easy to connect to any device that has bluetooth. I have it for more than a year now, never failed and still sounds good."
1,"very good quality for the price. my husband has the dr dre beats and they are definitely the same quality. only issue is that the volume button is on the actual earpiece instead of the wire, so its not very convenient. also. the distance from phone to headphones until is disconnects is VERY short, about 5 ft.<br /><br />overall good for the price"
1,"Love these! Very easy to set up, comfortable to wear and great connection range"
1,"Surprisingly adequate!  Solid low end, great sound quality for phone calls.  I was hesitant at first, but two thumbs up!"
1,Their above my expectations  ☺
1,I bought these to wear while working out and shooting baskets at the gym. The earpiece material is flexible and does not slip off the ears. The earbuds need to be adjusted but fit into ears for the most part. Sound quality is not the best compared to what I have had but it does effectively block out sounds. The battery life is better than similar types of headphones I've had. Overall 3.75-4 stars.
1,The best!
1,So far so good! Comfortable and great sound!!
1,"These were my first pair of wireless ear buds, I've waited and waited to spend extra money on new headphones and definitely made a great choice. There light weight and i can barely feel them while wearing them. The sound quality, connection and build of the earbuds are great. The best part was the price. These are the only pair you'll find that will work this well for this price."
1,"Really happy with these headphones overall. They fit great, have excellent sound quality for the price and are very ergonomic to use while working on equipment. Very happy with its sounds quality for phone calls and all of the accessories included were a nice bonus. Overall really happy with the product."
1,Great
1,"The earplugs bring a case, car conector, two cables and extra cushion for the ears. I like them so far and I hope to enjoy them for a long time."
1,Great product! It is as described and the battery life is awesome I love the sound quality when you speak on the phone and listen to music. I would definitely recommend buying. I workout with it and it stays in place even while running.
1,I bought specifically for my Peloton bike it is a perfect match. Sound and connection doesn’t diminish when sweat gets into it like more expensive alternatives. Would recommend for any type of workout!
1,"I love it!!!!, the presentation of the product is great,I try other headphones and this is the best."
1,"Great sound! Comfortable! Easy to use! I liked the first pair so well I bought a second.<br /><br />I am adding to my review to say superb customer support as well. The on/off button stopped working on one set, and I contacted Senso. Within hours (at night) they responded and immediately said they would send a replacement pair. Amazon just notified me that they have been shipped and will arrive in two days. Thank you, Senso!"
0,you can only use these if your phone/iPod is in your right pocket. The Bluetooth signal is just not strong enough to work from the left haha
0,Internal battery died after a few months of use
0,Sound quality is good but I tried every size earbud and they would not stay in my ears during a workout.  The hook around the ear is weak and useless.
1,"comfortable and light weight.<br />These work well, sound is pretty good.<br />And for the price, I understand why so many ppl like these ear buds.<br />Don't spend more for the bigger name brands get these instead."
1,Really happy with this product.<br />Connects instantly with my iphone when I turn on Bluetooth.
0,"Worked great for 10 days, then slowly faded into oblivion. After ten days, they would disconnect from my phone randomly, then they started making weird noises. After about a month, they just died. A waste of $40. Granted, I wore them every day in the gym during circuit training, so they got plenty of sweat on them. Still, they are advertised as sweat proof, but only made it 30 days. I'm back on the market for wireless ear buds. Whomp, whomp."
1,I thought they were high quality- but be careful when ordering if you have smaller ears.<br />They will fall.
1,These headphones help me work out by staying in place.  The bluetooth connection setup was very easy.  Sound quality is good.  The packaging is great and includes a circular storage case for the earbuds
1,Love this product.  Battery and sound quality are amazing. Would definitely recommend it. I run a lot (Marathons) and long runs and so far they have not failed me.
1,"I am hearing impaired so it is hard to find headphones that sounds good and have enough volume for me to hear. In fact, I returned a pair of another brand because of poor sound quality and very little volume. I paid about the same price as the SENSO Bluetooth Headphones for the pair I returned. The SENSO headphones have superior HD sound and enough volume for me to hear every sound. Full volume is too loud for me with these headphones. If you do not have impaired hearing these headphones are going sound even better to you. I have always difficulties with headphone that insert in the ear. They always fall out. The SENSO headphones stay firmly in the ear and are comfortable. Easy to operate and to pair with any device. You can even pair two devices with these headphones which I really like because I can switch between my iPhone and iPad easily. I spend many hours listening to music so quality HD sound is important to me. For $36, these headphones are a great value. I highly recommend these headphones."
0,"Every time I buy a new pair, the quality of these get worse and worse.<br /><br />These used to be the best headphones, but now they're crap"
1,"Love them.  Can run, walk, and talk on the phone with no interference.  The charge lasts several days. And it comes with charge wire and various sizes of earbuds in a case.  I'm glad I made this purchase."
1,"I was looking for a pair of bluetooth headphones to use while walking. I've used them twice so far, and am happy with my purchase. They fit well in the ear, and the sound quality is good. I was also happy with the price."
1,I think they work better than my then my Beats 3 a lot louder just don't hold charge very well after like 6 hours
1,All ok. Thank you.
1,"Great set of head phones. The sound is amazing for the price of these. My only missing star is due to the battery life. It could be just a bit better, but with the warranty of these well worth the purchase."
1,Worked ok as bluetooth headphones. I've been using them exclusively for workouts for the past 5 months and this past week one of the two headphones became very low compared to the other one. I didn't bother contacting the manufacturer because I think the issue is due to my perspiration being extremely profuse and it's probably a simple issue of dry sweat on the speaker driver. They're good value for the money especially if you want something you won't cry over if it stops working. Update: Most recent pair lasted almost 6 months.
1,Much better than the older pair I had. 8 hour battery life now vs. 1 hour before. Connects easy and flexibility of ear hooks is amazing.
1,"Been very happy with this. The only reason it doesn't have 5 stars is the buttons don't match my iPhone functions. For example, with Apple headphones, if you press the button once, it advances to the next song. With this, if you press the button twice, it redials the last number. Not what I was trying to do. With you could change or sync up the buttons. Not a big deal after you realize the diff functions though."
1,"The sound is okay. Doesn't have much bass. If you have small ears, this won't fit. The ear strap doesn't even go over my ears. It just hovers over it and doesn't stay secure on my ears. I'll have to give these to my husband."
1,"Sound quality is very good. Charges from 0-100% in little over an hour. Battery life is somewhat inconsistent... Can listen to a playlist for an entire 8hr work day Monday,  but only 2-3hrs Tuesday, 5 Wednesday etc. Same settings, same playlist.. Otherwise they are great"
0,Got mine 8/10 used 5 days a week for 1-2 hours.  Completely dead and won’t take a charge already. Low price but no longevity
0,horrible don’t stay on your ears the plastic too light
0,"One of the worst headphones I have used. Poor sound quality while listening to music, Calls were not clear, I kept hearing the choppy sound and same goes for what the other person heard. Connectivity was poor,"
0,"Update: Two pairs of these failed within a week of each other. Same  issue both times, mailed to Bluetooth pair and then  completely failed power on after charge.  These are not suitable for any kind of running or working out. Stay AWAY."
1,"Huge fan of the sound quality, especially for the price, and they don't fall out of my ears when I run!"
1,"I feel like I still spend too much time adjusting these while running, but they have not fallen completely out yet. They are also not very comfortable, so I will not buy again when these wear out."
0,"Kinda disappointed. I like the wireless capabilities and I have friends that like these. The sound is pretty good and the microphone works well. But if you're running, you can hear the wind noise. They are boxy. If they were a little more aerodynamic, I think the wind noise would be less. They also don't fit very well. The ear loop is a little big and not adjustable  (I consider myself to have a fairly standard head-size!).  Can't really recommend."
1,I had these headphones for years when I was making less money. They were a great value for the same sound quality as any other high brand headphones. I would recommend if you don’t want to spend big money. They sound quality is just as good!
1,They are still working but the cord is cracking I can see the interior wires.
1,"The sound quality was really good but the usb cover was a bit challenging to open.  Had to basically tear it off so I could get easy access to it.  That worked fine but then it became finicky on what usb charger I could use (I always kept it clean and in a case).  I no longer could charge it.  Too bad, I really liked it."
0,Does not pair well with any Apple products. Tried for 2 hours to get this to pair with an IPod and IPad but it just was not connecting. A little disappointed with this.
1,"I bought these headphones 2 years ago and they were great.  I accidentally broke them and had to buy a new pair.  Unfortunately the pair, even though they work just as good, the ear piece that goes around the ear to hold on is uncomfortable.  I bend them but they still fall off and they are just simply uncomfortable."
1,Use them at the office and they are great. At times I can barely tell they are on my ears. Sometimes the Bluetooth pairing can state it is connected and you have to unpair and re-pair the device but overall very satisfied
1,Beautiful sound. Sets up easy and looks great! Love it!
1,"These headphones are fantastic. Both battery life and range are remarkable and the fit is both comfortable and functional for workouts. I  ended some minor assistance and their customer service department was amazing. Prompt, professional and incredibly helpful. I highly recommend this product."
1,Good price and Very good quality &  light.
0,"They worked great for 2 months, then randomly died on me. I tried charging it and turning it on and off again but there's no power coming from the headphones anymore. I really wish I can get them replaced because I believe in the product and I'm hopeful it's just a bad pair."
1,"Wow - these have been amazing!  When I first put them on they had a good bit too much base. I use Spotify on my iPhone, so I found, purchased and installed for 3 bucks an equalizer app called Qu.  I then adjusted base down and treble up a bit and compared these to my wife's VERY expensive Beats. These are as good if not better for a 3rd the price.  Comfortable to wear, holds on tight when I exercise - I'm a BIG BIG fan...<br /><br />So I lost my first pair and got a second pair - updated version - it's even better sound - love these!"
0,"Product worked fine for 3 months.  They are not great headphones but they worked for what I needed.  After 3 months they stopped taking a full charge.  They will charge just enough to use and then within minutes I receive a repeated ""battery low"" message."
0,"Good sound quality for the price although fake waterproof, took one shower with it and that is it, not working. Pretty disappointed."
1,"I'm a fan.  I've used them for work and I use them to run.  It blocks out the rest of the world and lets me focus at my task or mile in front of me.  1-2 months in, I had an issue with the left ear.  The sound quality was lower than the other.  I emailed Invotek, they responded immediately to my questions and no issues, fixed the issue at hand.  I've recommended this to others and would buy from again.  It's a great product and excellent customer service."
1,"Great bluetooth headphones for the price.  My second pair of theses.  The first ones were misplaced, but still working well when lost."
1,"Great sound out of these, was a bit skeptical at first, but love them. All the extras it came with were nice, but the charger cable wouldnt work with my iphone, but that really has no effect on the product itself. Would recommend to a friend for sure."
1,working fine
1,These wouldn't stay connected to my iphone. Had to return. They sounded great but it was super frustrating that they kept disconnecting.
0,"it worked pretty good until 3 months,  after that Bluetooth wont get paired(bought 2 of them and it happened same) . don't waste your money, you get what you pay for."
0,"Loud hiss in left ear when playing anything. I have large ears, yet these hooks are way too large for me and I suspect anyone other than an elephant. They wont stay on during a run. The reviews must be fake or paid"
1,Perfect for what I needed
1,So far so good. Great battery life. Good value.
1,"Worked great for a few months but now will not turn on,  even after a full charge."
1,Loved
0,"I purchased this pair of headphones twice. I loved them so much for long runs. Unfortunately the first pair stopped working after 6 months and the 2nd pair after 2 weeks. I might have left them on the charger for too long, like 5 hours but that should not have ruined them. I am so disappointed by these headphones that I loved. Just not long term quality."
1,I am using my headphone during my work hours when my hands are busy.  I am enjoying its clear voice and convenience of multi-tasking.
1,"Best buy for the money, a little light on bass, but great for work out sessions. Paired up with android phone in a snap"
1,"The best headphones I ever had. Using them while I am running, they fit perfectly and do not bother me during the run. Sound quality is good."
1,Overall great value. They are easy to use and work well with my iphone. The sound isn't terrific .... just ok. I also go a lot of interference when I was running in high wind areas.
1,Bought a total 3 pairs because the earpieces fit my ears.  It comes in different sizes.  First one went bad and the company was nice to replace it for me.  So that’s 5 stars for customer service.  Bought 2 more pairs and lost both.  Headphones hang around my neck but they keep falling off.
1,Easy to set up with great sound
1,"I use these as my gym headphones, and sometimes in the bath.  I've had them for about a year, and they've held up pretty well.  They do seem like they may be nearing the end of their useful life though.  The left ear seems to have gotten quieter than the right recently, but I may just need to clean them."
1,This are not noise cancelling earphones. One cannot notice the difference between having them turned off and turned on. Street noise or any other kind of noise is the same.
1,Loud and last long
1,Gift for my daughter-in-laws Birthday Birthday shelved it
1,Left earpiece fit but right would not fit properly no matter what ear piece size I used. Sound was very decent just won't use because it wouldn't stay close to my ear.
1,I like it
1,Found them very easy to use. Love the sound. COMFORTABLE TOO
1,"I bought this product again because it is amazing.<br />Battery life is long, sound quality is impressive, and they are really comfortable on the ears. I particularly loved the noise cancellation buds that came with in the package, an upgrade from the first time I bought them.<br />I have tried numerous bluetooth headphones but these are by far the best for their price range!"
1,Bought this headphone in February 2018 and the headphone work great sound quality excellent. Now we're in November 2018 and the headphone kept shouting off.
1,as good as the Bose headphones i bought my wife. 1/4 of the price. buy two and keep at home and in your work bag
1,"I’ve bought this headphones a couple times now for family and friends and they’ve always served well but this last one bought was waste of money, it hardly charges and it dies quickly, it’s like they gave a bad headphones hoping I won’t notice"
1,"Use these everyday at the gym. It's only been 2 weeks but so far they been great. No problem connecting, and audio quality is good."
1,Great Headphones at an awesome price
0,"Don't waste your money. These are Chinese made, cheap quality headsets. And they won't work with you until its fixed either. They just keep sending you head sets that don't work according to the description then quit. Terrible experience and product.. F-"
1,"This is an excellent product! I couldn't be happier with the price and quality of these headphones. I ordered these with the Taotronics 4.1 Bluetooth transmitter to use these headphones to listen to my TV and they are amazing. I also use them at the gym, great sound, clear, and don't fall out. Excellent product highly recommended!"
1,"Great for phone conversation. Sound is clear for me and the person at the other side of the line. Playing music, it makes the job, not an amazing sound, bur good enough for training time. Actually a good product with a low price.<br /><br />Today i’ve changed the eartips, and sound is awesome, deep and clear bass, mid and high frequencies are crystal clear. I rated this product with 4 stars, now I think it deserves 5.<br /><br />Now I have a problem with the microphone, the sound at the other side of the line is not clear and with a lot of noise.<br /><br />I need to contact the seller, by email or something like that"
1,"love, love, love.  just make sure you charge before every run!"
0,Another waste of money on headphones...skips all the time and the sound quality is horrible. Piece of junk
1,"The earbuds are exactly as advertised.  We bought 2.  Both were easy to charge, and the sound is very good.  There's no reason to spend a ridiculous amount on good sounding wireless earbuds."
1,love the sound.  great product
1,Arrived super quick. They fit my tiny ears and great sound
1,"This product exceeded my expectations, not only is the product of great quality it is also packed with quality goodies and is very modestly priced for bluetooth and mic for voice calls. Like a car charger, cables, carrying case all in a neat little box (I've kept the box for storage).  I'll cut to the point, how's the sound quality?! I LOVE these Senso headphones!!! If you like your music loud it'll definitely supply you with very adequate levels of volume and bass. The sound keeps clean even when I just blasted Slipknot. I'd give these headphones 10 stars if I could. Quality, price, goodies, case, sound is more than enough for bluetooth headphones!!!! 💯👌"
1,I use this product for my daily running routine and it feels great. This is my second time purchasing the same item and I super love it! Defitinaly would keep buying it. Keep it up!
1,"Update: I contacted the seller about their warranty on these earbuds and they promptly replaced them. Very satisfied with the product and customer service.<br /><br />These Bluetooth headphones are easy to use, have long lasting battery life, short charge time, and very good sound. However, the cable connecting the two can be annoying when they get stuck on your neck or when trying to listen with only one earbud in. Also, the connection on the left earbud has started to go in and out with the slightest movement of the right earbud after about 6 months. These still lasted longer than most of my wired headphones but at $30+ dollars I would have liked them to last longer. Still a good value and do what they say they will. I recommend using the provided case as it is very easy to lose the earbud tips if you keep them in your pocket."
1,I bought these headphones back in February and they were great. They stay on the ear well. So it's been almost 6 months and one of the earpieces is going out. So you can only hear out of 1 ear. The annoying part is that the faulty one keeps going in and out so it can't chose a side. I guess if you don't mind replacing them in a few months they're good.
1,"Just used it for my gym time and it was exactly as advertised. Great volume, pretty good sound quality. Better than the pair of Skullcandy ones I got for twice the price. Stayed in my ears for my entire run, even at a sprint. Lifted afterward and barely noticed them, and the one button touch to pause the music is such a bonus. Definitely recommend."
1,"The earphones work great! They're noise-cancelling and look and feel great. I've bought wireless, Bluetooth earphones before and they pale in comparison to these! HIGHLY recommend!"
1,I love the quick response to the buttons and easy pairing. The sound is fantastic and clear also has base which is a plus.
1,I was really worried about this product and I thought it was not going to last very long but it has been used consistantly for a year and it is still going strong! I have over charged it many of times (leaving it in the fast charger over night or the entire day on accident) and it still keeps a charge for multiple days of working out. It fits comfortably on my ears. My only complaint would be... I find the noise canceling benefit of putting the earbuds completely in your ear completely uncomfortable when you run or work out so I usually leave some room in my ear for circulation. Overall would recommend this product for quality and durability and price.
1,"These are everything I'd hoped for in headphones and more. Just follow the directions to become familiar and to set up, and it's smooth sailing from there."
0,Was too big for my ears.
0,"Way cheaper than similar Powerbeats.  I like the earbuds, they fit really well into the ear and work great for running to keep out the wind noise that I have had problems with on other headphones.  Great sound.  The only problem is the audio breaks in and out now...almost like there is a short.  Only had them for 3 months. Seems to happen after I have them on for maybe 30 minutes.  They are cheap enough that I will probably buy another pair vs going with something more expensive.  I would hope to have gotten more useage out of them."
1,I usually don’t write reviews but this headphone Worked extremely well almost close to a year... sound effects were good and excellent noise cancellation ... When it stopped working I still had the warranty when I contacted the customer service they provided exceptional service.... Will order again in the future...Highly recommended... 5 stars for the quality and to the Service...
1,"Great having this for workouts,"
1,Wanted something loud so I could hear my YouTube videos over the gym's music and these work great. They have never fallen off and as long as you read the manual you should be fine. Hopefully these will last for some time!
0,Second time purchasing these and both pair have stopped working after a couple of months.  I at least expected a year but I didn't even get to 6 months.
1,Great headphones. Great packaging. Long battery life. Never had any problems connecting via bluetooth. Exceeded my expectations !
0,"Bought these January 5th, it stopped charging in less than 3 months and now it doesn’t even work. Poor quality."
1,"Arrived on time, nicely packaged, great sound. Only first day using it, batteries lasted well over 8 hours. If one negative comment, after a couple of hours, they could feel a little &#34;heavy&#34; on the ears."
1,"I love the way these headphones fit and sound, and you can't beat the price.  I've been through a ton of sport headphones.  I'm an avid runner that sweats a lot and all the headphones/buds that I've tried over the years either slide out of my ears or short out due to the sweat.  I've mainly used these SENSO headphones running on a treadmill while I binge watching shows on my iPad, and they are pleasantly holding up."
1,"Amazing, affordable headphones which absolutely destroy the competition. Not only is the product amazing, the customer support team at Senso is the best support team I have ever dealt with. If you are looking for any type of headphones, I would 100% recommend these SENSO's. I like them way better than my wireless Beats by Dre."
1,Have only used a couple of times so far but they sound really good. And stay in my ears good too.
0,These are junk. I liked them at first but now 5 weeks after getting them they just stopped working. They will not turn on.<br /><br />UPDATE: The Replacement pair I was provided has now stopped working as well. These are garbage.
1,Lightweight and easy to pair and use. Comfortable. Sounds amazing as well. I love that the battery level is displayed on my device.
1,Awesome product with many extras! Worth every penny! 👍
1,"Excellent product! Perfect for the gym, easy to use, quick to connect to blue tooth device, adjust sound, advance song...all a snap!"
1,"Really good fit, and even better sound quality!  They haven't come out once jogging."
0,"These headphones have similar sound imaging as the Beats wireless version of a similar form factor.  Maybe a little less bass response but otherwise very good sound quality.  The ear loops are a more malable wire that is good for ear fit but less durable since they bend in the case. The accessories are nice and plentiful.  My headphones stopped taking a full charge after 6 months.  I ran with them for the last time this evening since they only lasted about 10 minutes with a full charge before shutting themselves off.  The charging chord is a nice design but stopped working after 5 months.  This kit includes a lot for the price.  Compared to the Beats, they cost less per month of use but I had hoped to get at least a year.  I only got 13 months out of the Beats so maybe I’m rough on headphones."
1,"Solid fit, lightweight, great for working out.  But best of all was the quality of the support I received when I had a question about how to pair it with another product."
1,"For the price and very good bass response, I would have given 5 stars except I wanted them for road cycling and the wind noise caused by the design is too high.  A clip for attaching the cord to the shirt would have been helpful."
1,Love the earbuds fit perfect and sound quality is great.
1,"Perfect headphones for running, jogging, biking etc.  Also, works well at home when you want to listen to music or stream movies when the family wants quiet.  Never had a problem.  Charges fine and long battery life if you turn off the power when not in use.  But if you keep it on for the whole entire day without without much use, you can get a good 7 hours.  I once had it on for 5 hrs accidentally and towards the end (at night) streamed videos on Netflix and got a good extra 3 hrs.  Total of 8 hrs."
0,Sound quality is great. Only had it a month and headphone on one side keeps going in and out
1,"Had these actually been $37 headphones I probably would have given them a 4 star rating, but they're not. They're billed as $170 headphones that are on sale, so that's how I'll rate them.<br /><br />When I use them at the office, the sound quality is stellar. Feedback on the controls is almost instantaneous. It's when I use them to workout (you know, what they're advertised for?) is when I start to have problems. Even just a light walk with the dogs is enough for the connection to crap out. I've turned the phone on airplane mode with just Bluetooth, same issue. I've tried it on my ipod that's just WiFi enabled, same issue. I can only catch about every 3rd word of a spng before the connection cuts out. Worthless and annoying. As soon as the device that these headphones are trying to connect to is on the move, they can't keep up. And this is when it's in my pocket! 30 foot radius doesn't help when it can't stay connected 3 feet away.<br /><br />$170 headphones should be miles better than this, I'm just lucky I got them on sale and didn't pay full price."
1,Absolutely love these for running.
1,"The volume and range while listening to music is great. Strong signal and comfortable in the ear during activity. Unfortunately, I use headphones for hands free calling more than music and those I called couldn't hear me clearly. The signal also got really choppy during phone calls. I will try another model of Senso if they make one that has a microphone in the cable."
1,I've only used them for a few days and the sound and product quality are exceptional.
0,"Quit working. Had it 4 months, used if for running and at the gym. Just didn't turn on one day."
1,Work really well not really that durible though so take good care of them. Long battery life
1,I love these headphones. They are exactly what I was looking for. The three different size earbud covers are great. I have small ear canals and most in ear headphones do not work for me. The sound is amazingly crisp and clear. I would highly recommend these earphones.
1,"Have just had them for a week but WOW! Great sound, comfortable fit. I purchased these because of all the great reviews and was so glad I did."
0,This product only lasted about 6 months before they died. Used them to work out at the gym and yard work.
1,"i use these while i do projects at work like cabling or installing things, and even when i use my drill i can still hear my music great."
0,dont stay in ear well. dont stay around ear well. I have to take them off when I do my crunches/sit ups which completely defeats the purpose. You get what you pay for but I suggest getting another brand.
1,"Haven’t used these in the gym yet, the reason I purchased them.  I have talked on the phone using them and was told audio was very clear.  I’ll be checking out the different size ear pieces as One ear got a bit sore while talking on the phone (about an hour)."
1,Excellent sound! Fast shipping! Very pleased!
1,"These headphones are by far the best set of Bluetooth headphones that I own. I have several well known brand Bluetooth (LG, Jarbra, BBD) and these headphones are far more superior. The sound is great, including a more than decent bass tone. They connected easily right out of the box, additionally, the comfort level is excellent. I usually wear them for at least an hour at a time and I didn't experience any discomfort. I am not being paid for this review and trust me, I am a very picky shopper. The quality far outweighs the price that I paid for these headphones."
0,Decent for short workouts and runs but not great for anything over an hour. It seems like they aren't sweatproof at all and power off when they do get sweat on them. Was hoping for a better product for long runs
1,Good song quality
0,"Love, love, loved them until they quit working? I think they should last longer than 3 months ...not sure if there is manufacturer's warranty or not?"
1,Very well made I love them an sounds great
1,Great quality for the price. Easy to sync with phone. Comfortable fit.
1,"Use these headphones for long conference calls.  Excellent sound, comfortable over the ear and inner ear earpieces. Just bought another set as a Christmas gift for someone who has trouble keeping earbuds in their ears while exercising. The over the ear earbuds will help."
1,These headphones work great. The sound quality is honestly amazing. And they are so unbelievably comfortable and easy to use! I have recommended these to couple of friends and they are in the process of ordering them also.
1,"My son is running track again this year and he asked for a new set of earbuds. He picked the SENSO Bluetooth headphones out. With the price, quality and the shipping time, I went ahead and purchased them. He has been happy so far. He is very hard on his electronics but he works hard so I had no problems getting them for him. We had the headphones the very next day when he got home. Talk about a happy Son.......... LOL.<br /><br />Thanks, I wish customer service, quality, price and shipping where always this way. It was a very well executed purchase."
0,"It only worked for a week or two, then one side of speaker failed to work anymore. I returned the product to Amazon with full return labels according to instruction,but never acknowledge, but then said return period expired."
1,"Even the smallest silicone plugs were to big and the plastic ""ring"" to put over the ear is not flexible enough. They keep coming off during normal movement and especially during excercise. This is of course very annoying. Otherwise the sound is good and I am happy with the battery life. I have also had no connectivity issues on Android 7.0."
0,"The sound and the fit were great but, the noise canceling feature,didn't seem to work at all."
1,Sound is great nad the wireless function works well.  The headphones are wireless however you cannot receive a wireless signal while submerged.
1,I recently purchased Senso Bluetooth headphones to replace an older pair of wireless headphones.  So far I am extremely happy with this purchase.
1,Wish they could fit better for the e at. When running they slip a little and after awhile they start hurting my inside of the ears.
1,Wonderful sound I am very pleased with my headphones
1,"Great sound and fit, they are perfect for running or working out in the gym."
0,Takes FOREVER for the Bluetooth to connect. Frustrating when you want to begin your workout and you spend the first 10 minutes diddling with your phone.  I have a new iPhone too.
1,"I bought these in September of last year. I wear them everyday, I've really enjoyed them. the right side started shorting out, so I sent the manufacturer an email, and after a couple of informational emails they sent me a new pair. I'm glad that the warranty is so good. this was the first set of Bluetooth earbuds and I've been really pleased."
1,Like them a lot. Very handy!!
1,They work great! Easy to connect to my phone and they stay in my ears while I work out. No issues so far!
1,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G8JO5F2/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0<br />Excellent service, excellent product what to expect more..."
1,The sound is amazing and super comfortable!
1,Great headphones.  I'm beyond pleased.

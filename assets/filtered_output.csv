"I love these. They even come with a carry case and several sizes of ear bud inserts. Thank heaven!  I get ear pain from most, but the smallest buds fit great.  They also have a charger and all of it fits in the carry case. I just wish they came in more colors preferably something bright!  When I leave them on my nightstand it takes a while to figure out which of half a dozen black cables are the right ones. Even white would be ok as only my iPhone has a white cord.",B01G8JO5F2
Good Product,B01G8JO5F2
"Forget any of the less than 5 star reviews. The sound is amazing, with a wide range. Excellent bass and mid-range. I bought these for use at the gym and walking to replace 2 different headsets that never stayed put, and honestly sound like crap.<br /><br />I bought a 2nd pair for work.<br /><br />BUY THESE AND TRY THEM, you won't be disappointed.",B01G8JO5F2
"I am so happy with these!! I have a lot of ear piercings all throughout my ear and so I never know if ear phones will work with that. Especially since these have the clips I was unsure. It doesn’t irritate any of them, not even my daith or conch. If you’re pierced, these are awesome! Highly recommend.",B01G8JO5F2
"These are great for around the house and casual uses but when I wear them running there's a lot of wind noise. Not good for running, for me. Wind noise is annoying & distracting.",B01G8JO5F2
"I had a hard time with these at first until I figured out that you have to hold down the multi-purpose button until a woman's voice says that it is now on, and same thing to turn it off. But they fit well and nothing's fallen off yet. Lightweight and flexible, decent sound quality.<br /><br />12/21/2020: I dropped these - not from a great height - but the volume control pad on top and the on/off pad on the side both popped off, about a month ago. I managed to get them on again but not sure how long they will stay in. I've not been running since. I don't want to use glue in case it gunks up the works. Shall update after I take them back for a run. Wanted to post this for a sense of how robust/long weariing they might be.",B01G8JO5F2
"DONT waste your money.. Battery time sucks, sound quality is great first day and sucks the next and than on.<br />there is no noise cancellation what so ever.",B01G8JO5F2
"Loves these headphones.  The sound was great, they didn't fall out of my ears, and they were comfortable. Now after a month they won't charge.  Very disappointed 😔",B01G8JO5F2
"Update:<br />They only lasted a few months. They simply just don't work now. Wasted my money. Look elsewhere. It's a bit expensive, but Swimbuds have 3 different types of waterproof head phones for the type of water activity you are involved with. I am still happy with my Swimbuds.<br /><br />Original Review:<br />I did really well with this. I kept accidentally going underwater with it during deep water exercise. Just below the surface, but the first time, the USB jack was not closed up and nothing went wrong. I should mention that I wasn't swimming laps with it. It did come off a few times, but not to the level of being annoying. Unfortunately, I've lost it. I now have to figure out if I am going to buy that waterproof MP3 watch for a few hundred bucks or buy another one of these.<br /><br />One thing to note: I did use this outside and the range is limited to 15ft if the mp3 player is not with you. I used my phone which I kept on the side of the pool. If you do use a phone to stream music, attach the phone to a portable battery charger or your phone will start skipping the stream in about 10-15 minutes. It's just trying to conserve battery for all the tasks it's performing. This is an argument for getting the mp3 waterproof watch, btw.",B01G8JO5F2
This is the second pair that I've had.  These things are workhorses.  The pair I'm listening to right know are 4 years old!  Insane!,B01G8JO5F2
The sound quality is very good and they easily fit my ears my only problem is the button to turn on and off is so easily accessible that I find myself accidentally shutting them off when I adjust the fit around my ears,B01G8JO5F2
"Great headphones! They are easy to use, hold a lasting charge, and block out all outside noise. Wish I would have bought these sooner",B01G8JO5F2
I returned these because they hurt my ear canals after a while. They were heavy and just didn't sit right on my ears.,B01G8JO5F2
These headphones are way better than I expected. The sound is amazing! Also they’re super secure. I like boxing (hitting mitts/heavy bag) and I didn’t have to adjust them at all. Oh the memory earbuds are an amazing touch! Complete cancel out noise and I hardly know I’m wearing them.,B01G8JO5F2
Very comfortable to wear for running. Sometimes it doesn't sync right away with my cell but it is okay.,B01G8JO5F2
They are just good,B01G8JO5F2
I wear these bad boys running and I have gotten rained on several times. They still work great!!! My only complaint is that you can't use them while they are charging. I have had mine for about a year and they usually last about 8 hours after a full charge.,B01G8JO5F2
This is a generic product sold under a few different brand names. The fit of these buds in my ear canal is poor for my ears - they will not stay in place no matter which ear tip I use. The sound quality is muddy base that washes out the entire sound. I will return these and continue my search.,B01G8JO5F2
"They work pretty we.. Have been using them when I am shoveling snow and they are very nice. Sound quality is on par with my corded skullcandy. Have plenty of bass. Battery life seems to be good as well. Also have worn them for several hours and they do not become uncomfortable after longer periods like some of the other headphones I have owned. The over the ear piece is a floppy piece of silicone, but it seems to be enough resistance to keep them in place. I will be buying them again if I need replacements.",B01G8JO5F2
Good quality headphones. Very good sound and bass. Very easy to pair. Connects when turned on faster than any Bluetooth headphones I have used.,B01G8JO5F2
"These make exercise bearable!  Comfortable and easy to use, w/ a compact yet sturdy case.  Came w/ 3 different sizes of ear plugs.  I would STRONGLY recommend these.",B01G8JO5F2
Good sound just a bit bulkier than I thought.,B01G8JO5F2
"Easy to connect and the sound is fantastic. Much better than the apple ear buds I'm used to using.  I'll have to play with the different sized earbuds to see which one fits my ear better, but otherwise is a very good buy.",B01G8JO5F2
Stopped charging after 2 months,B01G8JO5F2
Great stuff,B01G8JO5F2
"I have purchased these for my husband and my father. They both rave about how loud, comfortable and long lasting they are, and they both wear them to run and mow grass.  My stepmother bought a pair for herself after trying them, and I’m just waiting for price to go back down to get them for myself. I just wish they care in different colors.",B01G8JO5F2
Fast delivery. It also gave me a good and sturdy feeling when I am holding the product. It is still new for me and just used a few days with no issues during my exercise.,B01G8JO5F2
"These are the best I have tried,  after trying many different brands to find some that we're good,  the sound is amazing,  the fit is amazing and you can tell it is a quality made product.  They are very comfortable.  Just to add I have never left a review before on my Amazon purchases and this one I had to because these headphones are impressive!",B01G8JO5F2
"Very lightweight, good balance, great sound!",B01G8JO5F2
"I purchased mine based on the Amazon reviews. Everything looked good.<br /><br />However the one I received had an issue. I sent the seller an email and  I got a reply back in less than an hour. They certainly wanted to help and provided a suggestion on how to resolve the problem. The next day I tried, and it didn't work.<br /><br />Sent another email, and again, less than an hour for a reply. They let me know another was on its way.  In a few days I had a new working unit.<br /><br />So it's great when the product works, but I think it says a lot more when the seller is so invested in making things right. 6 Stars.",B01G8JO5F2
Nice unit,B01G8JO5F2
Good product,B01G8JO5F2
"This review is for the ActivBuds S-250. I like these earbuds very much. They have a long playing time and have a pleasing sound quality. I use them with Comply foam tips which greatly improve the comfort and sound. Comply tips come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and sound isolation and are a positive addition to any buds. One improvement I would  like to see would be cloth braided connecting cable between the two buds. The rubber cable sticks to the back of my neck sometimes and it will dislodge the buds from one or both ears. I usually wear them with the cable in front of my neck and flip it to the back if I am going to take them out. I like these earbuds because the controls are easy to use and are ergonomically designed. The charge plug is easy to put in and the buds hold a charge for a long time. The playing time is quite good and is at least equal to the time claimed by the vendor. All in all a comfortable set of buds with sweet sound. (I also have a set of the S-255 buds and am not happy with the flimsy ear hooks. Fortunately, the Comply foam tips keep them in my ears as the hooks are quite useless.) I have several pair of these buds because I have a number of Bluetooth sources and the buds, like most Bluetooth devices will only pair to two at a time. Bluetooth 5, which will be released any day now, is claimed to allow several devices to pair.",B01G8JO5F2
"Looks like it is a defective piece, the person on the other side cannot hear me and it happen every time I use it. Returning it !",B01G8JO5F2
Best headphones I've used @ 100$ or less,B01G8JO5F2
"Can't get the volume low enough to be comfortable in quiet environments or in bed--with both phone and headset controls on lowest without actual muting, they're stll not quiet.  Otherwise they're quite nice.",B01G8JO5F2
"For the price, great headphones!!",B01G8JO5F2
these headphones really are great.  they synced up with no problem and were really comfy.  I havnt not taken them on a run or done any crazy outdoor stuff yet but they feel good in my ear and they sound good.  good battery life too,B01G8JO5F2
"Pair easily, sound quality is good.  Can use as wireless headset to talk on the phone.  Holds charge for long period of time.",B01G8JO5F2
"Works well as described, used in the hot tub this evening! Joys of Bluetooth and waterproofing! Made a call as well and heard/spoke fine.  Great value for the price!",B01G8JO5F2
"Great! Ran with them to day, had a problem with my old ones falling out. Highly recommend these so far.",B01G8JO5F2
"My primary use for these headphones is for meetings using Skype for Business. I've had these headphones for a week now and have used them for over 15 hours of meetings in that time, paired with my laptop. The most important thing for me was whether my audio was good enough according to the other persons on our group calls, and they agreed that the sound coming through was very clear. I also could hear very well, so I am pleased with the end result and the quality overall.<br /><br />Pairing with the iPhone was a snap; the Kindle Fire HDX was not as cooperative, but eventually it paired well and the sound is very good. My Windows 10 laptop is a bit more challenging to pair and manage, BUT that's not the fault of the headphones, it's just a bit tricky to figure out which setting controls the levels for my audio. Once I found that among the Windows settings, it was fine. As soon as I turn on the headphones, The ActiveBuds connect promptly to the laptop.<br /><br />As noted by another reviewer, the placement of the On/Off button is a little awkward; you do feel like you're pushing the right earbud further into your ear canal. But with a lighter touch and a slightly different angle, you can power on and off without difficulty. I found the volume up/down tricky because you press the front of the toggle switch to turn it down rather than the back end. But both of these are minor, and once you get the hang of it, they're not an issue.<br /><br />I have watched and listened to TV and movies on my Kindle and my iPhone, and the overall sound quality is quite good. I'm not listening to music with a great bass beat, so I can't comment on that, but I am an audiophile. For the price and ease of use, these headphones are everything I need. When I want to listen to classical music, I put on my big headphones anyway. These SENSO headphones fit neatly in my purse, and I'm very pleased with them.",B01G8JO5F2
"I'm still getting used to how the ear pieces work, and the need to charge them after every gym session, but otherwise they are comfortable, have great sound, and are easy to use.",B01G8JO5F2
use this all the time and great,B01G8JO5F2
"Didnt work well for me.  Everytime I tried to sync it to my bluetooth, it would take about 30 minutes.  Def not worth it.  When it did work, it was a great  sound.  I found another for 10$ cheaper and it works everytime.  Not sure what the hoopla is on this...but it didnt work well for me.",B01G8JO5F2
"Sounds good.  Very easy to program.  Not as low-profile as I would have liked, but they get the job done.",B01G8JO5F2
Good sound ...,B01G8JO5F2
Bought three pair of these for myself and my two sons to use while biking and working out. They were great for a few months then ALL THREE PAIRS STOPPED CHARGING.  Now they are useless. We followed the directions and didn't overcharge them - but no matter - they all stopped working. WASTE OF MONEY.,B01G8JO5F2
"I was a bit skeptical that these would work very well for being so affordable, but I have been extremely impressed by the rich sound, comfortable fit, and easy controls.  I got them for working out and they stay on very well when jogging.  You can't tell from the pictures but the ear pieces are soft flexible rubber that fit comfortably over the ear. It is very lightweight too.  I highly recommend for the price and quality.",B01G8JO5F2
Light weight n easy to use!,B01G8JO5F2
"Very good sound, long lasting battery",B01G8JO5F2
"Great sound quality and I enjoyed them until a week ago when they stopped charging. It doesn't matter which charger I use, they charge all night and notify me of &#34;low battery&#34; as soon as I wear them. They lasted almost 3 months :/<br /><br />*** UPDATE: The customer service from Invotek is prompt and outstanding. They were willing to do a full refund if a reset didn't work, but gave me instructions on how to do it, and the issue has resolved. In case you have the same issue or any other malfunction, here's the snippet from the email with instructions on how to do resolve it:<br /><br />&#34;Let's try a factory reset for your Senso headphones which usually fixes most similar issues related to the issue you are facing with your headphones.<br /><br />1. Reset the Senso headphone to factory settings (while plugged into a power source, press/hold the power button for 7 seconds).<br />2. Unplug the headphone from charging cable and power them on.<br />3. Enter the earbuds into the pairing mode and follow instructions for connecting.<br /><br />Also, the issue you have described is common all Bluetooth devices as the connection between the two devices gets &#34;corrupted&#34; and needs to be re-configured.  In order to do that, please `Forget the Device` on your mobile phone for the Senso headphones and try pairing again.  In your Bluetooth settings on your phone, you will see all detected Bluetooth devices.  Click on the Senso ActivBuds option and click on Forget this Device.  Next pair your headphones to your mobile device once again as shown in the instructions manual.<br />I am confident that this will fix your issue.<br /><br />Also, you are covered by our 1 Year Warranty, so you have nothing to worry about in case these don't work.&#34;<br /><br />I have many pairs of Bluetooth headphones and these are my favourite due to comfort and sound quality. So happy they are working perfectly again!",B01G8JO5F2
"Great quality product. I love the noise canceling quality. It will tell you when you turn them on, connect to your device, and power off.",B01G8JO5F2
Early review and I'd give everything a 4 star based on 3 days of ownership.,B01G8JO5F2
"Tienen muy buen sonido, excelente calidad y tiempo se batería",B01G8JO5F2
"I waited before reviewing these! I have to say for the price they are really good..I had a really expensive pair that died on me after minimal use, these are comparable.",B01G8JO5F2
I usually don’t write reviews but this headphone Worked extremely well almost close to a year... sound effects were good and excellent noise cancellation ... When it stopped working I still had the warranty when I contacted the customer service they provided exceptional service.... Will order again in the future...Highly recommended... 5 stars for the quality and to the Service...,B01G8JO5F2
Great for the price. Always works well. Fit great.,B01G8JO5F2
spectacular the best I recommend,B01G8JO5F2
"I’ve had these since 2017. I’ve wore them running, weight training, mountain biking, rain/sweat.  These have lasted! I’m writing a review three years later because I accidentally left these in my hoodie pocket and they went through a washer and a dryer.  Guess what? Listening to music with them as I write this review! I’ve used beats, jaybirds, and skullcandy. These are the best I’ve owned because of price and their integrity.",B01G8JO5F2
"My wife got these for me for Christmas because my old, $16 (like 25 year old) Sony ear hook buds finally fell apart. I've been writing a book and using Speechify for editing, using these earbuds. Initially, I liked that there were different sized silicone pieces to fit different size ear-holes. The sound quality seemed fine, and they were a bit bulky, a bit loose, but seemed not bad for $20. So now (1/10/21, or 17 days later) the charging port broke loose from the solder joints which affixed it to the little printed circuit board inside. Anyone who knows anything about wiring and electronics can tell you that a solder joint on a circuit board is inadequate to secure something that is going to have pressure put on it repeatedly due to plugging and unplugging. Obviously no one at Senso thought of this, or cared enough to put it into practice.<br /><br />This is all part of a larger problem which is what is known as 'planned obsolescence' or put simply 'making things cheap so they break quickly (usually just after warranty expires) and you have to buy another one'. It's happened to phones (buy a new iPhone every 2 years), audio equipment, cars, televisions, and computers (don't get me started on the crap Dell sells, and forget getting any support from them).<br /><br />AMAZON, if you're LISTENING, stop selling CRAP from SHADY SELLERS!  Stop allowing companies to bribe customers for 5-star reviews.  It makes reviews worthless and untrustworthy. Also, your buyers are obviously getting kickbacks, or if not they are terrible at judging quality. Either way, I cannot find good Bluetooth earbuds anywhere on the site.  Even the Beats audio ones you sell for $110 are lousy with quality issues.<br /><br />Disappointed, AMAZON. You own the internet but you can't sell quality electronics to save your lives.",B01G8JO5F2
I bought this headphone for a second time since I have lost my first one recently.  The quality of this product is degraded comparing to the first one.  The very short charging cable came with the box has a wrong connector type but luckily I still have to first charging cable so it not an issue but it would be for you if you did not have the correct charging cable.  The blue LED light on the headphone to indicate the full charged battery is not working.  The LED turn from Red (charging) to no light indicator.  Luckily I have sync the headphone to my phone so I can see the headphone battery full on my phone.  I will try a different product the next time.,B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these to run with but found them way too bulky and uncomfortable.  However, I'm giving them a good rating because they survived a journey through both the washer and drier and seem none the worse for the wear.  They're perfectly serviceable for chores around the house, going on walks, etc.",B01G8JO5F2
Works very well. Second pair bought as a gift. Long lasting.,B01G8JO5F2
"Great sound, functionality ++, good battery life, great price and value. Wide variety of ear size adapters. This is the 2nd pair that I have owned. 1st set stopped functioning after about 2 1/2 months. Senso immediately sent me a replacement with no hassle. New set is going on 2 months old now and still love them.",B01G8JO5F2
These were alright. I did not like the hooks over the  ears. Static did occasionally occur while playing music.,B01G8JO5F2
Overall great set of headphones,B01G8JO5F2
Works great! Came in excellent condition and all the pieces.,B01G8JO5F2
"Awesome sound, super fast delivery!",B01G8JO5F2
The design is good. Sound quality is awesome.,B01G8JO5F2
"I like that it has the same components as AirPods which is why I bought them. I dislike that it sometimes cuts off out of nowhere or I hear a weird beeping noise sometimes while listening to music, but it is not a big deal, especially for the price. I like the bass and how loud and clear the volume is.",B01G8JO5F2
Best tou will find for the price,B01G8JO5F2
For this amount of money is fair enough..not the best sound but still acceptable.,B01G8JO5F2
Greatttttt,B01G8JO5F2
Like nice simple headphones,B01G8JO5F2
So far so good.,B01G8JO5F2
So far so good. Have used it a handful of times and it’s seems to be working great so far. Loud enough & it does cancel out noise.,B01G8JO5F2
I love these ear buds. Very comfortable and the sound is great. I bought one for my daughter too.,B01G8JO5F2
"I’ve had these for years but like many others they randomly disconnect and beeps. You have to turn off the earphone and turn off Bluetooth on your phone. Then you have to then on blue tooth, ear phones and pair again to get it to work. It’s really annoying. Other than that, the sound quality is good and it stays in the ear.",B01G8JO5F2
"I LOVE these headphones. I was wearing them when my granddaughter saw them. Boom, gave them to her and ordered again. I wear them all the time and lost order #2, hopefully they’ll turn up somewhere in the house!  I am now on order #3 and truly can’t say enough about them. You don’t order 3 times unless you LOVE them. Great sound, long lasting, perfect fit.",B01G8JO5F2
They worked well for about six months until they lost capability to connect to my desktop. They pair but they cannot connect. Everything I’ve tried didn’t work. I tried to get in touch with the manufacturer but it is impossible to contact them and/or to download a new driver!!! Their website is a dead end! There is absolutely no support! Very frustrating!,B01G8JO5F2
Couldnt stay connected. Static-y when it was. Returned pretty quickly.,B01G8JO5F2
To listen to my music,B01G8JO5F2
"After several times of using this in the pool, briefly submerged , the volume controls stopped working then one side is louder than the other.",B01G8JO5F2
"Really nice great sound great microphone, everything is good but couple things it falls of the ear easily and it's kinda big",B01G8JO5F2
Perfect headphones for working out!,B01G8JO5F2
Worth the money!,B01G8JO5F2
Love the bass and clarity of both bass and treble. If you don't like too much bass. You can just switch out the ear gel size for a smaller one and the bass will lessen. The great thing is this is already provided. I personally like alot of bass and I'm a super happy customer. It also fits comfortably. Also pretty cool that it comes with its own case and a key chain. 😊,B01G8JO5F2
Works great,B01G8JO5F2
"it was perfect, good sound, good everything. I charged it and it didn't take the charge.  i got them exchanged and after a month of use the same issue...  I wouldn't recommend this product.  I want my money back",B01G8JO5F2
"This is my second pair I have purchased. I have one for work and for home. I use them both for daily workouts and to listen to audio books, pod casts, news and music .",B01G8JO5F2
These headphones died during their warranty period.  Manufacturer will not stand behind their product.  Don't waste your money.,B01G8JO5F2
"I was really exited about these..I'm an audiophile..love my music<br />I listen to music in the shower but live in an apartment complex so I worry bout bothering my neighbors...<br />if you want these for listening in the shower you better have your blue tooth source about 3 feet away<br />as soon as it gets wet...PPPPPPPPPPPP<br />constant disconnections and blips<br />just to let you know..I have a top of the line blue tooth extender too<br />and a set of Tranya bt ear buds that ABSOLUTELY ROCK!!!!<br />sound great and I can go across the hall and do my laundry and go completely out of the building to get my mail and they still stay 90% connected<br />don't get me wrong...for workin out,maybe rain...ok<br />but takin a shower with em,,,,not so much<br />I'm hopin Tranya will come out with a ""shower""set<br />P.S.<br />the whole ""shower"" thing isn't advanced enough yet so beware<br />I bought a set of<br />True Wireless Earbuds xFyro xS2 Bluetooth Headphones Microphone IPX7 Waterproof<br />they were even worse<br />so the both of them will sit up in the top of my closet doin nothin<br />just beware and give the shower thing a little more time to tweak<br />good luck<br />good life",B01G8JO5F2
"What i really like the most is how part that goes over the ears is bendable to fit your own ear. I had a pair the didnt have anything and they kept falling out of my ears and it was annoying. As far as music, it does have more bass then i would have expected and you cant adjust it, so it your dont like a lot of bass then this isnt for you. Over all i am satisfied with these head sets.",B01G8JO5F2
"This is my 4th set of these earbuds.  The sound and battery life are good as expected.<br /><br />Each time the content and quality seems to be slipping.  Gone are the foam inserts and the extra magnetic phone holder pieces.  I can accept this - I understand that companies need to be profitable and optimize the product content for things the customer is willing to pay but I do expect basic things like minimal build quality and some form of customer service when things don't go well. .<br /><br />I really wanted to like these earbuds but unfortunately, there is an annoying rattle coming from the right side earbud.  The rattle drowns out the music while running/jogging.  I have attempted to contact the company via their website but no response as of 2 weeks.  I'm a bit concerned they will not stand behind their product.  Just disappointing.  Buyer beware...",B01G8JO5F2
The only complaint I have is that connecting two devices doesn't work very well.,B01G8JO5F2
"I got these in August and after having them for only a little more than a month connecting them has become impossible. Just have to keep trying over and over - takes at least 5 minutes to connect every time. This pair has a super loud ""Connected"" and ""Disconnected"" voice for some reason - no way to turn it down or figure out why. Last, on this pair the ear hooks are so uncomfortable. Last pairs were flexible and wrapped easily around ears, until last pair became overly flexible and wouldn't stay on at all.  I missed the return cutoff by a week so now I'm out $30 because I have to get something else.",B01G8JO5F2
"These are our “go to” wireless earphones for sports.  They work well, sound good, and are a good buy.",B01G8JO5F2
"Good quality, relatively reliable, last long. Bought second set.",B01G8JO5F2
These buds are well worth the price. Sound and construction are solid. Found adjustable ear hooks excellent at holding buds in place. Highly recommended.,B01G8JO5F2
Love the sound,B01G8JO5F2
I saw the reviews on this headphones and I just had to try them. For the price I couldn't go wrong. I was so happy with the packaging and the little container it came with. The sound quality is really good. I forget to charge them and they last pretty much the whole day while I am at work. A great feature is that I can connect both my phone and computer at the same time. Also when you take a phone call you can hear on both ears. I would definitely purchase these again.,B01G8JO5F2
"Very disappointed in the lifespan. Less than a year after getting them, they just stopped working. Won't even power on now. You can plug them in to charge, and it shows a full charge the moment it's plugged. But, they are dead. Right in the middle of a song, and boom, no more.",B01G8JO5F2
"I like the sound. Use when exercising. Like that I can adjust the earpiece around my ear. But, as usual, I have difficulty keeping an earbud in my ear. However, Senso fits better than any other brand.",B01G8JO5F2
I was going to return them because the instructions on how to charge headphones was inaccurate. The red light did not come on indicating they were charging. I called tech support and after numerous attempts they agreed they would not charge. They were sending me a replacement set and a return postage sticker. I decided to try them a day later and they worked excellent. I listened to music for over 7 hours. I am guessing somebody charged them then returned them. The red light now comes on when charging but the blue light never luminates. I love these headphones and decided to keep the replacement set to give as a gift. Great product for the money.,B01G8JO5F2
Bluetooth range is pretty bad; definitely can't  go more than 20 feet without them cutting out and have owned them since 2018 Jan.  Neither my husband or I would not recommend these at all.,B01G8JO5F2
"These were great for the first few months of use. After that I began having connection issues. The headphones would sync up and play for a little while then it would drop the signal reconnect, then drop signal again until I turn off head phones and re-pair again... lame.",B01G8JO5F2
"After a few months of regular use, the left earbud on the Senso headphones stopped working. When I sought support, the company told me to factory reset them. When that did not work, they stopped communication and did not fulfill their warranty.",B01G8JO5F2
"It is a nice product, but not good for swimming. Stop working after few minutes in the pool.",B01G8JO5F2
Teen son is happy.,B01G8JO5F2
I needed something like this for my workouts! So glad they work just great!,B01G8JO5F2
"These headphones are comfortable and reliable. When I had an issue, the customer service was very quick and helpful.",B01G8JO5F2
These are good for general use but they have a very limited blue range. Often they don’t work in colder weather too at or below 40 degrees. While running the reception is spotty and i’d often hear my music cut out which is not something you want during a run. I had to buy a different brand after all that.,B01G8JO5F2
"Cheap, you get what you pay for unfortunately, they broke after a year.",B01G8JO5F2
Works better than expected,B01G8JO5F2
I ordered these headphones because they had lots of good reviews on Amazon. However once I received them I was disappointed with there overall product.<br /><br />What I liked:<br />- they where only 20 bucks<br />- they came with a nice storage case<br /><br />What I disliked:<br />- cheep bulky construction<br />- poor noise canceling (if any)<br />- horrible sound quality<br />- no fine tunning volume adjustment<br /><br />The headphones where bulky and did not fit snuggly in my ear (even with the difference earpieces) they definitely we're not noise canceling.<br /><br />The sound was vary bass-y okay for pop or like Daddy Yanky but you didn't get a nice crisp sound. Also at higher volume it was very distorted.<br /><br />I was unable to make fine adjustment to the volume at lower volume. It was either way too loud or not loud enough.<br /><br />I will be returning them I'd trying something else.,B01G8JO5F2
works great no problems at all,B01G8JO5F2
"The product its good and more if you see the price the customer service its really good, i can buy it again, my only little issue its sometimes when i run i feel it little loose but not a big issue this is my third (i give the other ones and they are happy to) i buy and I going to buy another.",B01G8JO5F2
"Good fit, ease of use and setup and great sound.Used them while cutting the grass and had to pump up the volume ,but good product for a great price.",B01G8JO5F2
"These little bluetooth over the ear headphones are great. They have an impressive range, and still work with clear reception when my phone is downstairs and I am upstairs. They're quite comfortable in ear, and the grip around the ear is soft and very flexible to keep the earphones in place. The sound quality is great, very clear, but not fully noise cancelling. For me, as every day headphones, this is totally fine. For an airplane or a loud situation, I'd probably still opt for higher end headphones (bose, etc), but these are very good for day to day stuff. They stay in place, don't shift around, and all of the controls are easily on the headphones, so you can turn them on/off, adjust the volume, etc. without having to touch your phone. For the price, these are great, comfortable headphones for blue tooth enabled devices.",B01G8JO5F2
They are still working but the cord is cracking I can see the interior wires.,B01G8JO5F2
Wow.. these are great! Don’t fall out of my ears and came with extra ear puds,B01G8JO5F2
"For an inexpensive pair of headphones they are decent. I used mine at the gym and mowing the yard only. Best thing I can say about these is they stay in place. There is no bass or noise canceling at all. After 6 months of use, I could only Bluetooth pair with one device, tried with different devices and would get a connected notification but no music playback. Now, a year out they do not work at all, can not turn on. If you do not mind replacing every year go for it, just do not expect quality.",B01G8JO5F2
"Awesome Headphones, sound quality is fantastic.  These are awesome for walking and running and being able to have a telephone conversation on the fly.  I would recommend these to anyone and everyone.  Thank you SENSO for such a great product at a great price.",B01G8JO5F2
Nice,B01G8JO5F2
"Great product! Exactly what the dialog states what the product can do and how good the quality of the product is. I woild know because I am an fan of sound and comfort xoiple with durability and these headphones have it all, great product, thank you for putting something of this quality and price out there!",B01G8JO5F2
Good product,B01G8JO5F2
Great headphones!  My husband was given the expensive wireless headphones from his boys for Christmas.  They broke within 3 months.  We replaced with these and they work great,B01G8JO5F2
Purchased lots of bluetooth headphones  but this one is completely different...I mean is awesome and I really love it. Guess I'm gonna buy two more. I use it for running,B01G8JO5F2
"The sound is good. They are comfortable. I find that the switch control box tends to drift and hang to the right side a lot and doesn't stay in the center.  one of the main problem is, I am only getting about 2 hours out of a charge then the music starts to sound like a record skipping (for those who where around and remember that) this was one of my first blue tooth experiences so maybe that 2 hrs. is normal?",B01G8JO5F2
"This are good headphones. The only, but major, downside is that they stopped working after 2 years. And its not that I used them every day during this time. I use them mostly during the weekends. Meaning they lasted around 200 days which is the equivalent of 6 months if you use them daily. Sound quality was good.",B01G8JO5F2
Terrible. Stopped charging after a few uses. Do not waste your money,B01G8JO5F2
"This is my second pair. I thought I had lost my first pair but then found them. They both have good sound,etc. but the first pair had springy things that go around your ear to hold it in place. They worked great. The new ones had something like a stiff wire inside that I guess was meant to fold and bend around your ear for a custom fit. It doesn't work. It is difficult to make them fit, and as soon as you take them off the ""fit"" gets bent as you take them off. I think that the bendy wire will fatigue and break given time. Go back to the first version, people!",B01G8JO5F2
S-255s used to have a wire inside the silicone piece that fits around the ear so it was truly adjustable - but the 2 pairs I have ordered no longer have this feature - shame because it was very helpful,B01G8JO5F2
as title,B01G8JO5F2
I bought these two years ago to the day and they’re still rockin! I’ve put them through many sweaty days and rough b-ball pick up games. Impressed 😌,B01G8JO5F2
"So far this has been an awesome, cheap, better quality than any products I have purchased on any type of headphones. I’ve only had this for a day and the sound is amazing. I didn’t star the battery life yet since I only had it for 4hrs. But I will come back for another review once I start using this more.",B01G8JO5F2
"The product does exactly what it is supposed to. So Quality is OK to feel on your ear is OK, and the frequency is good as well.",B01G8JO5F2
Cheap wireless inear headphones. However they broke inside my backpack while not in the case....might have been my fault.,B01G8JO5F2
Great headphones for a affordable price.,B01G8JO5F2
I like everything about this product. I would be recommending it  to all my friends and family,B01G8JO5F2
"Second pair purchased..ugghh.. first pair are awesome.. However, the newer pair have adjust ear holds that bend.. they are terrible.. i can't get thru an excerise without them falling out.. The first pair has sturdy plastic hold ins which are great.. Sooo until they go back to original design DO NOT PURCHASE!",B01G8JO5F2
Lasted longer than any of the expensive brands ive bought,B01G8JO5F2
Good for price. Great noise quality!,B01G8JO5F2
I purchased a activbuds s-250 2.5 years ago. I've run multiple half and full marathons with them and loved them.  When they got stepped on I researched and purchased activbuds A1. They have the same great sound. Better bluetooth (my opinion). Better range. They seem to fit better since the ear hooks are easy to adjust. Plus for the money it is hard to find a better value.,B01G8JO5F2
"I ordered these headphones a month ago and the connector to recharge them has broken off inside the headphones.  I've had several pairs of headphones with this type of connector and have never had any issues with them.  So these are now useless as they can't be recharged.<br /><br />Additionally, if there is any slight breeze outside, all you can hear in the wind whipping in the  headphones.  You have to turn up the volume to hear your music, then you are blasting your ears off.  Also, after working out for about 20 minutes (I sweat a lot), the right earphone won't stay in my ear.<br /><br />Terrible headphones.  I would not recommend this brand.",B01G8JO5F2
"These are a good buy for the price. I use them for running. They don't have the highest quality sound you've ever heard, and they don't cancel noise from wind very well (and traffic noise not at all), but they're great if for running in quieter areas. I'm happy to be free of cords going into my phone for an affordable price.",B01G8JO5F2
"I can honestly say for the price, the quality and battery life are perfect.  From the first day and on, the battery has been phenomenal.  I got a full day of work (almost 8 hrs) out of each charge so far and it's been awesome.",B01G8JO5F2
I use these at teh gym and absolutely love the sound from them. I believe mine are 2 years old now and I still love them.,B01G8JO5F2
"Sounds great, fits my ear good even while running, very affordable.",B01G8JO5F2
For the price the quality is great.,B01G8JO5F2
"Bluetooth has nice range. Bass is incredible if I firmly hold pressure on them into my ears. Bass is okay once I let go. I can't tell any difference as far as noise cancelling. Of course I hear less noise because something is pressed into my ears, but I can't tell that they are actually suppressing additional noise. I have not used them for any phone conversations yet, but all other features seem to work good. Battery life is good. So far I am on approx 5 hours since charging. (approx 45 mins a day at gym). For the money they are awesome",B01G8JO5F2
they don't stay in my ears good. I've tried all the different covers...the foam ones do the best for me. The battery life is good however there is no warning of when its getting ready to die. The sound is great.,B01G8JO5F2
Sound quality really poor,B01G8JO5F2
"These are awesome...I know most will compare to Beats, but these are sweat proof, sound great, have a decent battery life and are a fraction of the cost..",B01G8JO5F2
easy to use. Sounds great for the money,B01G8JO5F2
Excellent product.....I'm very happy with it.,B01G8JO5F2
"Every time I buy a new pair, the quality of these get worse and worse.<br /><br />These used to be the best headphones, but now they're crap",B01G8JO5F2
The product felt apart right after I tried to charge the second time. Literally the charge ear output crumbled.,B01G8JO5F2
Big disappointment... I bought these headphones b/c the apple buds are really uncomfortable and I needed something that would tend to stay in my ears while being active. While bulky the earbuds were comfortable and for the most part stayed put while riding my bike which was a nice surprise. Things went downhill from there really quick as I noticed the sound quality was far from great.. the bass is absolutely dreadful. The speakers crack and distort with the slightest bit of bass and that's a real disappointment. These headphones are just about useless if it can't play music with reasonable sound quality. Will be requesting refund.<br /><br />I'm surprised by the 5 star reviews honestly... I read through a lot of them before buying but I'm starting to think that maybe these were fake reviews now.<br /><br />Don't buy this product if sound quality means anything to you.,B01G8JO5F2
"Ear loops were loose on my ears (I'm a big guy with big ears) and the right speaker started cutting out within 2 weeks.<br />You really only get what you pay for with these, pay a bit more to get something that might actually last a while!",B01G8JO5F2
Great product. Sounds good.,B01G8JO5F2
"Battery didn’t last super long, and they fell apart within 2 months.",B01G8JO5F2
Great ear buds for the money. My second pair. 1st lasted about a year with tons of use in the gym and at work.,B01G8JO5F2
I usually buy Senheiser and tried this based on price and reviews.  You get what you pay for.  This is a very cheap product that feels and sounds CHEAP,B01G8JO5F2
"Fantastic bluetooth headphones! Great battery life!<br />I listen to music all day with them and they stay charged the whole time.<br />I have weird ear canals and many eardbuds/headphones occasionally fall out; with the over the ear they don't get far.<br /><br />The only downside is the strap the connects the two sides was tightly bound with a rubber band during shipping and it's permanently kinked, that means the strap snags on clothing when I turn my head. (Pencil is pointing at the kink in the photo)",B01G8JO5F2
"Borrowed my husband's and loved them, so I had to get a pair!!",B01G8JO5F2
"Well right off the top when i opened of the package i was pleased with the ear hooks and dimensions of the product i like the way the plugs curve into my ear for snug listening... and the sound is full and bold my only dislike is the cellphone card wallet the width of it is not feasibly functional ...but the gesture was not under appreciated ...ill find a use for it THANKS SENSO....and in closing I'll run a pun intended statement ""Wow those ActivBuds S-250 from SENSO are SENSATIONAL !!!",B01G8JO5F2
I was looking for wireless headphones to use on the bus and while mowing my lawn.  These have excellent sound quality and battery life.  They are well worth the money.,B01G8JO5F2
"First set lasted only 3 months. Manufacturer replaced these. Second set lasted almost 9 months. Manufacturer refused to replace unit or help fix the issue due to the fact that I contacted them 10 days past original purchase date warranty period. The issues with the second pair started before the warranty ended, I just never had the time to message them. Figured since it was just a few days past, they would still help me out. Guess not. They offered me a 5% coupon instead which I felt like a slap in the face since it would only save me about a $1.25. They also take long to respond back to messages. Save yourself some time and buy a high quality pair like I am going to do now.",B01G8JO5F2
Works great,B01G8JO5F2
"This was my first bluetooth headphone purchase. I was not especially thrilled.  Sound was fine for the price, but they never seemed to stay in place. And the foam ear pieces came off far too easily. They did not re-connect to my phone as readily as another brand I bought last week.<br /><br />And - the sound on one side partially went out after a bit more than a year. Disappointed.",B01G8JO5F2
Love these buds. Bought a second pair for my wife and she loves them too.<br />Comfortable with good sound and the best of all is the price.,B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these with pretty low expectations, and I was very pleasantly surprised by them. I got them for working in a greenhouse where I was moving around a lot and needed the freedom of bluetooth. Our greenhouse was pretty big and I never had any issues with the range (I always left my phone on the charger). They come with a lot of accessories that most don’t. I have really small ears and have never been able to wear in-ear buds, but these stay in my ears with very few issues, even when I’m sweaty. They have a pretty decent battery life as well as a very common charger type. My 5 star rating is comparing them to others in the same price range, so I’m not saying they are as good as an expensive set. I would 100% recommend these to anyone who wants the convenience of Bluetooth without sacrificing quality or their bank account.",B01G8JO5F2
The Headphones are great and the support team is the BEST!,B01G8JO5F2
"Do I enjoy suddenly hearing a unrelated voice out of know where at full volume scaring the sh!t out of you?<br />No<br />Do I like picking up your headphones and finding I can't comfortable put them in my ears because for the millionth time the rubber part fell out?<br />No. (Although they do throw in extras, its still very annoying and the extras aren't always conveniently near by.)<br />Otherwise its a solid product.<br /> I hope have a firmware update to fix the jump scare robot voice to say ""battery low"" at the volume the user is currently using. If they did I would increase the rating.",B01G8JO5F2
"I chose an over the ear design just for extra caution so they don't fall off as I'm moving around. But I have to adjust occasionally as it starts to pinch that one spot on my ear. I guess I will find just an in-ear next... also the range is pretty low, barely can move around a 1 bedroom apartment without having to move my phone with me..",B01G8JO5F2
This is my 2nd pair because my first one was stolen.,B01G8JO5F2
"I use these all the time to listen to podcasts, hockey games, and even music. On the bus, at work, at the gym, and at home- connection is solid and strong, charge life is decent, and sound quality is great for the price. I did have to tweak some of the equalization on my phone as there isn’t a ton of low end, but adjusting the EQ helped with that a little. You can hear things around them at lower volumes, but it’s not a huge issue and could probably be solved by swapping ear pieces in the kit or turning them up. Carrying case is sturdy but will occasionally turn the power on if it gets pressed in my backpack.  Overall, great headphones that I use all the time and don’t feel bad about them getting a little dirty, shoved in my backpack, or beat up.",B01G8JO5F2
"These Senso wireless earbuds had surprisingly good sound for such an inexpensive item. They were so loud, in fact, that I actually kept the volume on my iPod turned down to the minimum while I used these for working out. That said, I always found the flat cable between them a little awkward, as it would never lay flat and always seemed to want to move to one side or another. It also, because of the nature of it being flat, would hold the shape from having been in the (nice) hard case, which also prevented it laying flat.<br /><br />The most disappointing thing was that, after less than a year of use, it suddenly started just skipping songs randomly. A song would start, and just a few seconds in, my iPod would jump to the next song, as if I had pressed the button on the right earbud. It would sometimes do this multiple times in a row and then stop on its own. As well, the volume up button on the earbud now seemed stuck (and I don't abuse these - just normal use during workouts) so that it doesn't press in or click like the volume down button does. Unfortunately, customer support was even more disappointing. I contacted them in November and they promptly replied apologizing for the trouble and asking for pictures to be passed on to the warranty department. I sent the pictures the same day and have not been able to get a response from anyone there since. Needless to say, I will not be recommending nor buying any Senso products in the future.",B01G8JO5F2
"Awesome sound quality. Having trouble keeping it in the ear though, doesn't seem to fit very well even with the replacement buds, but that might just be me. Amazing battery life!",B01G8JO5F2
The control on/off stopped working after about 15 times used.,B01G8JO5F2
I was pleasantly surprised about the sound quality. Good product for the price.,B01G8JO5F2
I bought it for my soon (11 years old) and he has been enjoying the freedom of this wireless Bluetooth earphones and has told me and I confirmed the sound is very nice and stay in place.Thanks to a friend who has a pair of this who recommended it!,B01G8JO5F2
The sound quality on these headphones suck. I purchased this brand years ago and after breaking them I thought I stick with it since I didn't haven't issues with the previous pair. I don't know what changes they made or if I just got a bad pair but the volume is SO low and the sound quality isn't good at all. The songs sound flat and I can still hear my TV on level 11 or people talking near me with no problem. Why fix what wasn't broken!?,B01G8JO5F2
I love these headphones. Charge them once a day n they will be best companions where ever you go!! 😁. Sound quality is pretty good. The packing was amazing. The headphones are great value for money. I recommend it!,B01G8JO5F2
Excellent product and good sound quality,B01G8JO5F2
These are some of the best headphones,B01G8JO5F2
Great product,B01G8JO5F2
"I've sworn by these over the years. Convinced my friends and family to buy them because they were fabulous. Well...I had to replace my pair after one of my pups decided to make them a chew toy. The new ones arrived today, and they are not the same as they once were. Absolute garbage. Sound is terrible, material is cheap. Something happened to this company. After singing their praises for so long, I am truly disappointed. 😢",B01G8JO5F2
I had these before and they were great. they got crushed accidentally. I bought again to find that the part that goes over your ear is now rubber with a metal wire in it. I constantly have to reshape it and 30 days into me using them this rubber and wire combo is failing. The last set had a very nice flexible plastic piece that retained its shape well.  The sound is great but the over the ear part IMO is terrible.,B01G8JO5F2
"a lot of my prior headsets became useless (not useless, but harder to connect due to the need of an adaptor), so finding an alternative solution to get headphones connected FAST became a priority. i use this at work to make calls/listen to music and it's been working out great!",B01G8JO5F2
Great sound quality and comfort.<br />Only complaint is that the mic is positioned in a way that it's not really useful. The other party can not really hear my voice clearly or loudly enough.,B01G8JO5F2
"I wanted to like these. They fit in the ear fairly comfortably. But the connection is AWFUL. The sound was fine while watching a show at the gym, while my phone was a couple feet from my head. As soon as I put my phone in my pocket and tried to listen to music it started cutting out so bad that I just turned it off. Will be trying to return.",B01G8JO5F2
"I've bought 2 sets , so I like the product , connects with no problems and has good sound quality.",B01G8JO5F2
"Ordered them in December, 2018. I finally had the opportunity to try the headphones. It was my first and extremely frustrating experience using a Bluetooth Device. They are muffled when applying pressure to them (to fit them in the ear properly). They are very high tone, when no pressure is applied. (Pushing them in, assists in a truer, but, poor tone.) I would prefer to return them for a better quality sounding headset, or, receive a refund. It took me over an hour to figure out how to get them to work. After doing so, it was nothing more than a disappointment. All the ear cushions are the same size (exception of one pair) None of them fit in the ear canal properly and they are all very difficult to switch on and off the headset. The power button easily turns off/ on while adjusting the ear piece. All 3 of my dollar store wired ear buds have a much nicer fit and sound quality. Would be nice to find a nice pair of wireless headphones with a healthy quality sound. I am not satisfied with these at all.",B01G8JO5F2
Exactly as expected,B01G8JO5F2
"Save yourself the aggravation, and pay a bit more for Bluetooth Earbuds.<br />These are cheap, and they lose charge quickly, then fail entirely in a short period of time.",B01G8JO5F2
Just what I was look for,B01G8JO5F2
"Good sound, stay on my ears while I workout doing various jumping activities and cardio. They are also lightweight, which I like.",B01G8JO5F2
"These things are awful for doing anything more than sitting at a desk listening to audio, and even at that they fail pretty miserably since they're so uncomfortable.  Save your $20.<br /><br />Pros: Bluetooth seems to work fine, but so have all devices I've used in the last 5+ years. Comes with a case to protect them (good, so I can protect the next pair I buy).<br /><br />Comes with a wallet holder for your phone (which is subsequently trash). Comes with a magnetic car mount for your phone (why do I need that with bluetooth headphones?)<br /><br />They are uncomfortable, ugly (stick out ~1"" from your ear...), the ear hook is made from foam that will be permanently disfigured after the first time it bends, but it doesn't actually do a good job of holding anything to your ear (and then go back that they stick out really far, the weight is all pulling out of your ear). They do a bad job at blocking out other noise, regardless of which size ear piece is being used.<br /><br />Forget trying to move with these things in, they'll fall out of your ears almost immediately.<br /><br />Not even worth returning this item.",B01G8JO5F2
I got this product for my SO based on recommendations on this app and she says it really great,B01G8JO5F2
"The headphones sound great and were super easy to pair with my phone.  Have used them primarily to work out in the yard, but plan on using them to work out as well.  Very comfortable.",B01G8JO5F2
Bad product don’t last very long sound is bad money wasted,B01G8JO5F2
"Tried a hard reset....does not work.  Great sound, OK moisture wicking.  Great while they lasted, but not long enough.",B01G8JO5F2
Battery lasted multiple gym sessions even though I kept forgetting to charge them. Could also go a whole day at work listening to audible after an hour at the gym,B01G8JO5F2
"Stopped working after a month.  Now they will not power on, even the charging light turns off a after a few seconds, but they still do not power on.  Trying to figure out how to return them since they say they have a warranty.",B01G8JO5F2
"I really liked these, but it’s been a year now & it keeps dropping the connection. Disappointed.",B01G8JO5F2
Great,B01G8JO5F2
"This was a gift to my husband so that I don’t have to hear the sound form his tablet, laptop etc I’m happy",B01G8JO5F2
The headphones are crystal clear and plenty loud. Great quality for the price point.,B01G8JO5F2
Sometimes it works and all of  a sudden it doesn't work. It must be the connection problem.<br />I know that it will work again a while later.,B01G8JO5F2
Junk. Died after a month,B01G8JO5F2
"These headphones are great. They have great sound, and do not slip off me during a workout.",B01G8JO5F2
"super bueno para hacer ejercicios y la bateria dura bastante, aparte nomas que el volumen es demasiado alto aunque lo tienes en 1.",B01G8JO5F2
Do not buy there is a delay,B01G8JO5F2
"I bought one for my use; it is clear and sounds great! My husband has used one from a competitor for 5 years, but after hearing mine he asked me to order him an exact match. Highly recommended.",B01G8JO5F2
"Sound quality:<br />Not amazing bass for but clear and much better quality for music and conversation than other Bluetooth headphones I own.<br />Comfort:<br />I use them all the time instead of other pairs because of how long I can wear them in the gym, running, wherever without discomfort or them falling out.<br />Durability:<br />No wear or loss of sound quality in nearly 2 years. The only thing that wore out was the zipper on the case.<br />Functionality:<br />Occasionally minor problems connecting automatically with phone. Resetting it in iPhone settings is an easy fix.<br /><br />Would definitely recommend and will purchase again if they ever finally die.",B01G8JO5F2
""" They work great and the performance is a bit better than what I expected for the price. Very satisfied""",B01G8JO5F2
There is a high pitching electronic noise during operation. It's hard to listen to anything with that noise in the background. Also after 2 years of use it disconnected from my phone every 60 seconds. It beeps every time it looses connection.,B01G8JO5F2
Home use for listening to music from my cell phone.  Great product!,B01G8JO5F2
"Great sound, great product for the money and very comfortable.",B01G8JO5F2
After getting the first charge works great and last like the stated good sounds even in loud environments and I use at work constantly.,B01G8JO5F2
"Wicked easy to charge and to pair with my phone. Insanely clear sound and so light! Walked all around my house, and it is not a small house and was still clear and cranking!! First day with it, tomorrow at work will be the true test lol but I will admit so far it has way exceeded my expectations :) I do not know about the moisture aspect yet, that will be tested but for now, I am a very happy bunny :)",B01G8JO5F2
"Broken out of the box, only one side worked",B01G8JO5F2
"I usually use these headphones at the gym and while running, like majority of my headphones, and these headphones work horribly in both of those environments. I've had mine now for over a year and it is just not consistent in performance. Majority of the time whenever I bend, squat, or just sit while my phone is in my pocket the music drops out. And I can't walk more than 5ft away from my phone without the bluetooth losing reception. I would not buy this product again, and I would recommend you not to. The only good thing I can say about this product is that it came with extra ear buds.",B01G8JO5F2
One side doesn't always stay in when i exercise no matter how much i try to manipulate it. Overall I like them but can fall out if i do burpees and other jumpy activities.,B01G8JO5F2
"For the price, You can't do any better. I wear them in the shower, the Gym and all day. the battery is great! BUY THEM... I assure you, you will not be disappointed.",B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these over two years ago and they have held up with no issues yet.  The sounds quality for me is fine.  If you're expecting audiophile SQ, these aren't for you but if you want to enjoy your music while on a run and still be cognizant of your surroundings these are great.  I am a heavy sweater when I exercise and have never had an issue with these crapping out due to moisture.  As a comparison in the past I had two pairs of Sport? Power? (can't recall exact name) Beats that broke from sweat/moisture.  The earbuds still charge quickly and hold a charge for a long time.  I had a pair of Jaybirds that suddenly would not charge or even turn on after less than a year.  One thing that I did notice with these, the Bluetooth sensor must be on the right side and you will want to run or carry your phone on your right arm or side.  Otherwise you do get some cutting out of the music.  It took me a couple of runs to figure this out.  And the more stationary (use an arm band vs keep in pocket) the better.  But overall these earbuds work like champs at a fraction of the price of the other big names out there.",B01G8JO5F2
Works very well easy to connect,B01G8JO5F2
Pops out,B01G8JO5F2
Works well for me. Overall no issues at all,B01G8JO5F2
"Very good headphones overall. Whatever you do, try to avoid ""maxing out the volume"" as much as you can. Audiophiles such as myself really can't help myself",B01G8JO5F2
"Purchased waterproof headphones with 8 hour battery life and 30 feet radius.  Unfortunately, they did not work underwater, less than 10 foot radius and battery lasted less than 40 minutes.  Do not buy.",B01G8JO5F2
"Very comfy even after hours of uses in the gym.One Dislike actually. Depending on ear size, product could feel very loosely fit at times. But overall wonderful.",B01G8JO5F2
"Throughout the first few months, they worked great.  I loved the way they fit for my runs. However, after a few months, one ear just stopped working.  Kind of frustrating to have this happen for no reason. I wish I could give it 5 stars, but when a product only works for a few months, it simply won't do.",B01G8JO5F2
"I really enjoy this product and would recommend it. My issue is shortly after buying, the sound would cut out. Almost like the wire shorts when you move it a certain direction. I probably should have exchanged it but it wasn't a big deal. Now that I've had it for so long, it's getting worse. The sound quality has been good and better than other wireless headsets I've tried. Plus, I really like having audio controls on the headset. This way you can easily adjust the volume, answer a call, and switch songs all while you're phone can remain in your pocket or wherever you keep it while running.",B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these headphones a few months ago when I gave my mother my airpods.  I wanted something cheap that I could use for several months while I decided what I wanted to do on replacing my airpods.  But when I started using them, they worked great.  The sound quality is exceptional especially for the price paid.  I haven't tested the 8 hour battery life yet but I have used them for 4 hours straight.  The fit was so good that I had no problems having them in my ears for that long.  I've also used them on video conference calls and the other parties could hear me clearly.  I like them so much that I will not be buying any other headphones.  The only thing I didn't like about them initially were the hooks until I figured out they bend to fit behind your ears.  Not one of my best moments.  So I highly recommend this product.",B01G8JO5F2
Poorly made.,B01G8JO5F2
"I have not had many hours using them but overall they are not bad as to quality of the product, the fit is below average, the weight tends to allow them to come out of my ears if moving. The testing is on going.",B01G8JO5F2
"Sound is pretty good, and they definitely stay put while jogging. Battery is good, as well. Happy with the purchase!",B01G8JO5F2
These are OK.  The sound is actually better than the Mifo brand I bought that were a lot more expensive.,B01G8JO5F2
Not much I like about them they fall off my ears all day at work I do landscaping can easily hear equipment n barely hear music they die quicker than 8 hours don’t recommend,B01G8JO5F2
"After using these at the gym for about 3 weeks, the music started cutting out while I was listening to them. I made sure they were charged, tried them again and still had some crackling, and then the next week they started to automatically shut off about 45 minutes after using them. Even with a full charge, they did this every day. I asked about returning them and it was conveniently 5 days after the return window closed. So basically, if you have any issues with these more than a few weeks after you get them, you're screwed. Save your money and do not buy these.",B01G8JO5F2
"It's fine, but I wish the Battery life was longer, I would recommended",B01G8JO5F2
Just as stated!!!it works!!!,B01G8JO5F2
"I LOVE these headphones! Loud volume and great bass. The battery lasts a long time also. These pair, unfortunately, now has a short in one ear. I will contact support  to inquire about a replacement. But my 1st pair - I've had 6+ yrs are still going strong 😊 Noise cancelation is pretty good. I can make and take calls, no problem. The other person can hear me pretty good, which is great in my book, considering I work near an airport and take calls mostly outside.",B01G8JO5F2
I've been using these headphones for more than a year and I was pleasantly surprised that they still work well. Battery life is more than enough for a run and they are pretty comfortable.,B01G8JO5F2
Reliable and nearly indestructible....had beats and they broke TWICE. Price point and quality are superb.,B01G8JO5F2
Mainly for audio books and podcasts at work . Battery lasts between 10-12 hours. Definitely water resistant. Only prob I have is after wearing over 5-6 hours straight my ears get sore. Not a deal breaker tho cuz they are excellent at everything else 👍,B01G8JO5F2
The sound quality was great but it started to sound really weird with bass. Noise cancellation is okay but when you have them like right inside your ear but it never really seems to stick well. I always feel like I have to adjust them for some reason. It feels odd wearing them. The part that goes over your ear is very flexible but feels weird. It seems to always be mois or oily I guess it's just how my ears are especially when working out it can be hard to adjust and stay on.,B01G8JO5F2
Good sound ....the best number one ...everything is great,B01G8JO5F2
I love these headphones but so much ! They truly are noise cancelling and the battery lasts 8 hours with a full charge. Best purchase I made so far in 2019!,B01G8JO5F2
"I returned these because they did not fit my ears. The ear “hook” was just that, a hook! They were silicone & soft, but not flexible! They would not wrap securely around my ear, and as a result, they fell out. Don’t buy these if you plan to use them for running. I contacted the seller and was told maybe a pair slipped by quality assurance. So I bought 3 different models from this company, and yes….they all “slipped” off my ears. I returned them all.",B01G8JO5F2
"These work well, overall good sound quality, and a variety of sizes for the rubber ear cups",B01G8JO5F2
The reason of the 2 stars is because I had a defective battery life unit that do not hold charge for stipulated time,B01G8JO5F2
"I use these headphones to work out. I have zero issues connecting (unlike some I've had in the past). The sound is actually quite good -- once you get them on correctly (and that wasn't super easy to figure out for me -- I suppose some people it would be no problem.). It's not noise cancelling, but I am amazed at how much it does cancel, and still keep me aware of what's going on around me during workouts. They are not the ones  want for really getting into my music, but they are perfect for working out.",B01G8JO5F2
Bought these for work because the are water resistant. The earbuds are heavy and uncomfortable if you wear glasses like myself. When you turn your head the cords stick to your neck pulling them off. The cover for the charging port does not seal after two days of use and the battery life is not impressive.,B01G8JO5F2
"After having this headset for just under two months, I couldn’t stand and take the quality of it. I had read reviews and actually believed what I read. When I ordered I realized I had ordered 7 years ago and believed they improved in quality. Boy I was wrong!!! Never again. I decided to be Beats headset that are known for the quality. I guess you get what you pay for. Really disappointed. I was truly hoping they were going to be good.",B01G8JO5F2
Bought this product on sale.  Amazing sound!  Charging port broke within days and stopped working altogether. Very cheap product!<br />Spend the extra money and get a real brand.,B01G8JO5F2
After few months of usage maybe only once or twice a week. This headphone will not charge anymore..,B01G8JO5F2
Pleased with delivery time and the quality of the product. I would highly recommend it.,B01G8JO5F2
"They beep ALL OF THE TIME. And it’s super loud in my ears.  Since I’ve gotten them this has been happening, I wrote in and never heard back.  Even when they are fully charged they will beep. I did read in the reviews that some people said this happened and I was naive enough to think I would get a pair that didn’t.  Don’t buy these, I’m sure there’s better blue tooth headphones out there.<br />If you don’t mind random beeping the entire time you use them, yes the sound quality is good.",B01G8JO5F2
Great product,B01G8JO5F2
"So far, I love these headphones. Great sound and they actually stay in my ears. I have not yet used them while working out, but i have walked around work quite a bit with them and they stay in place.",B01G8JO5F2
"I purchased the item on Aug 2017. I am not so frequent user so, was expecting it to be last longer. The power on/off button is not working. Basically, it is dead now.",B01G8JO5F2
"Ear hook doesn’t provide much support; nonetheless, when both earphones are tightly in place then the sound quality is great.",B01G8JO5F2
these are fantastic wireless headphones have enjoyed them very much,B01G8JO5F2
"They didn't fit well in my ears initially, but after realizing I can shape them to my ears they haven't been falling out ever since.",B01G8JO5F2
The sound quality on these is awful. I am going to return them.,B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these to listen to audiobooks on my Kindle so audiophile sound quality was not my goal.  Good thing too since music production was mediocre at best.  I chose these because they were the ""recommended"" earbuds by Amazon for the Kindle.  Bad on you, Amazon.  When rating the stars I was unable to evaluate the noise cancellation, if any, because they were so ill-fitting and uncomfortable I could not wear them for any length of time ...ditto for moisture-wicking.  They were not worn long enough for moisture to accumulate.  I too am suspicious of the 5 star reviews.  I am currently in possession of MANY different brands and styles of headphones and earbuds.  While these are not the worst I have encountered, they are definitely in the bottom 3.  Look elsewhere.",B01G8JO5F2
Best headphones ever.,B01G8JO5F2
Works great!,B01G8JO5F2
"It's falling out every time I try to run, it's bulky and can hear the wind when I run. I will return it after a few days if problem still persists",B01G8JO5F2
"Very decent sound from a budget pair of headphones. Connectivity can be intermittent, especially when I use my runner's belt. Overall, pleased with the purchase.",B01G8JO5F2
They broke after only a few weeks,B01G8JO5F2
"Fantastic, fits great with the provided ear tips.  The proper size ear tip is vary important.  I just love this item.",B01G8JO5F2
"I try to use these connected to my phone, and it looses connectivity at the distance of being in my pocket. I played around, and to maintain connection I have to hold my phone in my right hand. Even holding it in my left hand I lose connection. Mostly useless unless I can have my phone out in front of me while riding a stationary bike.",B01G8JO5F2
"Nice piece, just the one in my right ear doesn't stay in, the wire around the ear is very flimsy just on that one.  probably just a mistake with this one, but i don't know",B01G8JO5F2
Updated- These were my favorite headphones. Others that I've purchased over the last few years don't match these in comfort. I like how they don't push so hard into my ear canals like many others do. These hang off your ears but stay in well. The BIG downside in connectivity. The sound drops in and out when I'm outside even when fully charged and the connected device is in my front pocket. Fine for indoors while exercising though. Not sure what the problem is.,B01G8JO5F2
"I have had these ear buds for about a month or so. I use it mainly when working out and when traveling. So far, I am pretty satisfied with the quality. They've held up pretty well, I keep mine in the case when not in use, and the battery life has been good as well. The sound quality is good, given these are nothing like the more fancier brands like Beats or Bose, etc. so don't expect the crisp sounds or bass boosts if that's what you're looking for. Sound quality is clear and can get loud, but remember, you can always adjust your equalizer on your cell phone or whatever device you are pairing it with. However, I am overall pleased with the quality and price point.",B01G8JO5F2
"These headphones are not quality connecting at all. It is taking me 5 or 6 tries before they will connect to my phone, even after they've been paired. The overall quality of the headphones feels like cheap plastic that will soon fall apart; which is confusing because the actual quality of sound and noise cancelling is decent especially for the price. It doesn't help if I can't enjoy the music though.<br />Seriously considering returning them after only a day.<br /><br />I gave these my best shot, kept them beyond the time to be able to return them (honestly die to covid) but I am decreasing my raing to only star. When they connect and actually hold, decent sound quality. That's all I will give these. Not recommended at all.",B01G8JO5F2
It has been a year since I bought these headphones. they are now part of my gym routine. Bluetooth connection is very good so I can just leave my phone on a corner and walk around 50ft radius inside the gym. I usually use spongy heads for my ears. However they don't cancel windy noise while running outdoor. it is a little annoying,B01G8JO5F2
Wife uses this way more than I do.<br />She took it and uses it all the time. Seems to really like it.,B01G8JO5F2
"Pleasantly surprised with the quality of the sound.  Nothing fits MY ears, but these fit well and stay in place",B01G8JO5F2
"Battery life is average to short. A good value, great sound.",B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these Blue Tooth Ear Buds primarily to listen to music or pod casts while I run or lift weights.  I have used a different brand of blue tooth buds and several pairs of wired ones  over the years that all stopped working after a number of sweaty or rainy runs.  So far,  and I ran through a Southwest Florida summer in them, these have worked well and stood up to the punishment.",B01G8JO5F2
I bought these headphones for my wife and she loves them.  She likes the Bluetooth feature to listen to her music when going to sleep without all the cords.  They are comfortable and had good sound quality.  Battery life I cannot measure yet as she just starting using these headphones.,B01G8JO5F2
"Work great, really impressed with these head phones",B01G8JO5F2
Arrived on time.  Good quality sound.  Well worth the price,B01G8JO5F2
These headphones was recommended by a coworker and I couldn’t have ordered better ones. The Bluetooth is so efficient that I was in a meeting about 150yards away from my cellular device in a separate room and was still able to answer my call.,B01G8JO5F2
Great battery life.,B01G8JO5F2
I can’t be any happier with my purchase. No where on Gods green earth can you find headphones like these for under $20!,B01G8JO5F2
"This thing fell apart in my pocket with normal use. I contacted them about the warranty, but it doesn't cover 'physical damage,' I'm sorry, the head phones are clearly in good shape except for the plastic backing which fell off. They offered me a 5% discount. No thanks. Don't lie about a warranty if you aren't going to go through with it.<br /><br />I am updating this to say that they did do a warranty replacement after a couple of nasty emails. Still, I am adding stars because of that.",B01G8JO5F2
"I love that it does cancel noisy while outside, wind nor rain affected the sound quality or incoming calls. The only thing is that is a bit bulkier. other than that I give them 4stars.",B01G8JO5F2
"Great product. Very useful but, this is not sweat proof by any means. While km working out, the ear piece keeps sliding away from my ear and yes, I place it tight tight to my ears. Please fix and change the statement in the box until it is actually waterproof. Just saying.",B01G8JO5F2
"Great value. My wife uses them to run. Don't pay big bucks if it's not necessary to, these are great all around.",B01G8JO5F2
They’re ok.,B01G8JO5F2
All is well,B01G8JO5F2
"The Senso Bluetooth Headphones came a day after I ordered them.  The directions provided were easy to follow and I was able to quickly sync the headphones to my Android phone.  They were easy to adjust, and I liked that three pairs of tips were provided so I could customize my listening experience.  A compact case is provided and it's protective enough that I can throw it in my purse or backpack without worrying about damage to my headphones.  Finally, they were inexpensive and the best wireless headphones I've owned.",B01G8JO5F2
"Great sound, plenty of bass, and incredible durability.  This is my second pair, bought as a gift.  They pair in a flash, no skipping, and take a beating.  My first pair is still working as well as day one, and used everyday for over six months.  I have asked way too much from them, running in pouring rain, but they have not failed.  Best money I have ever spent.  Awesome product.",B01G8JO5F2
"I've bought several of these over the last year. It seems that each one lasts at least a few months before issues arise, but that's nothing new for earphones, at least in my experience. The sound quality is great, and it fits comfortably in my ear. The package comes with different-sized earbuds, so anyone concerned by that should rest assured; it is possible to change them out for comfort. The battery life is about 10-12  hours on average which is nice. The range is around 8 feet if the right earbud(where the signal is received) is pointing to whatever the Bluetooth is connected to such as your pc, phone, etc. If not, the signal will cut out fairly quickly which can get annoying. Another thing that may not annoy you, but it certainly did me, is the part that loops around your ears. It gets old fast, and the earbuds stay in your ears regardless of the loops being there or not so I always decide to cut them off. As far as I'm aware it does not damage them in any way, and I certainly have never seen a reduction in listening quality because of it.",B01G8JO5F2
"Work from home, on calls all day. This allows me to hear clearly. I can speak in a normal, conversation tone & they hear me clearly.",B01G8JO5F2
this is my second set and I've been very pleased with the performance.  Mostly used at the gym or while cutting the lawn.  Bluetooth range is very good; I can wonder all over the gym with my phone in a locker and have no problem connecting to my music.  I particularly like the flexible fit ear hooks.  Nice product,B01G8JO5F2
"Product feels cheap, and looks. I could get better quality from Ross, Marshall's, and even from Big Lots that would cost less than this product. On the second usage, the right ear bud where the speaker sits inside broke off and the wires snapped off the speaker.",B01G8JO5F2
This is my third set so I obviously love them,B01G8JO5F2
I charged them up and they easily paired with my phone. I love the way they fit my ears. I feel I made a great purchase.,B01G8JO5F2
"This is my 2nd pair - gave the first pair to my son.  They work great, sound great and what a great price.  The only thing holding me back from 5 stars is they occasionally have a hard time connecting to my iphone.  Not always, just sometimes takes a few times to connect.",B01G8JO5F2
I like that you can control volume from the headphones instead of using phone controls. Hooks up instantly using Bluetooth.,B01G8JO5F2
For 7 months I used Dime Blacks. They would not last through a 3 hour podcast. They weren't very loud and the volume would not change. Wouldn't stay in my ears if I bent over regardless of the size dome I used. So I gave these a try. What an improvement. They stay on my head no matter what. Mid volume on these is plenty loud. I've never reached the end of the battery so 5 plus hours so far. They are a very good value for a low prices set of ear buds for active people.,B01G8JO5F2
Son una maravilla!!! Los mejores que he tenido y hasta mejores que los de marca que son súper caros... Ninguna batería aguanta como la de estos audífonos!! No los cambio por nada!!,B01G8JO5F2
"great quality of ear phones , simple to use and connect to blue tooth",B01G8JO5F2
Great quality for the price. I get about a year out of each pair.,B01G8JO5F2
Love these. They are comfortable and setup was a breeze. I wanted to make sure I wrote my review after I used them. Sound quality is clear and noise cancellation works well depending on the song. Best of all I don’t have a bulking headset around my neck,B01G8JO5F2
"I have to say for the price these are great. I run short distances 1-2 miles on a treadmill, and lift weights, these earphones don’t budge. Battery lasts a while too, and charges back up quickly.",B01G8JO5F2
"Will be contacting the seller, item needs some adjustments. Unlike the previous pair ordered earlier",B01G8JO5F2
"I am really impressed with the inexpensive Senso Bluetooth Headphones. The sound quality is good, the ear fit is better than any other earbuds I have owned and the length of charge is longer than I expected. It takes only couple hours to charge which is also a plus. For the price I Definitely recommend Senso",B01G8JO5F2
"These did not stay on or in my ears at all. I tried all the different size ear fittings, and no luck. I think it’s due to the ear hook being playable. It allows for them to slowly slide out of my ear. I have another pair that has the ear hook and it’s silacone, but not playable, and they work great.",B01G8JO5F2
"Best product for the first timers. Those who do not know what a noise cancelling ear bud is will be super happy to have this. My spouse had some issue with her phone's mic. I have her this senso product. My spouse is super happy with the battery performance, the way it fits on ears, and the quality of the sound.",B01G8JO5F2
"These earbuds are of a very good quality for the price, and pairing them with my phone was painless.  I would recommend them.",B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these two years ago and they worked very well until a couple weeks when they started disconnecting from my phone whenever I would try to adjust the volume on the earpiece. It's too bad as these were really great for the price and somewhat comfortable. I guess for $20, 2 years of usage is fine",B01G8JO5F2
Great value and definitely sweat resistant,B01G8JO5F2
Very poor product.  The reception is so weak even if your phone is in the pocket,B01G8JO5F2
"I am not a techy person but I did like the sound these have. Also I have really small ears and the part that goes around my ears can be pinched tighter so they stay in my ears pretty darn good, even when i ran.",B01G8JO5F2
I have had these for 2 years they still work great hold charge I use them regularly. Im glad I stumbled across them years ago! The quality for the price is amazing! (I did get some silicone tips to clean easier),B01G8JO5F2
"They last 10 to 11 months. The right bud quit working and/or fall apart both times.<br />1st time I thought I might’ve been unlucky or accidentally roughed the right bud. I liked the sound quality so bought it again.<br />2nd time, same failure mode around same point in the life time.<br />I’m changing brands.",B01G8JO5F2
Very good sound quality,B01G8JO5F2
I bought these headphones because of the price and the reviews. The sound quality lives up to the hype and the button functions are easy enough to learn (although I wish the large logo was not the hang up button). Unfortunately for me the bluetooth connection was choppy at times. I am fairly sure that it is not my phone because my bluetooth speakers work fine and have a decent range (both are Bose). The range is also not great but that has not been an issue for me as I work out with my phone in my pocket or nearby.,B01G8JO5F2
Awesome earphones!,B01G8JO5F2
The Senso earphones are excellent and a great value for Bluetooth service.,B01G8JO5F2
People cannot hear me when I make calls.,B01G8JO5F2
Not bad. Not good. Bass is muddy but they do get loud. I liked the fit but it was just not the quality i was looking for but for 20$ i wouldn't pay more then that for them.,B01G8JO5F2
"Hubby likes these, unfortunately our dog does too.",B01G8JO5F2
"Feels cheaper than previous versions of this product.<br />I have had these headphones for years and the quality of the product for the price is great. I feel let down this time around, my old ones had the cord between the headphones crushed, my fault. This version is made of very light plastic, the outside sound echos more when you are wearing them, and the behind the ear part doesn't feel as natural to put on as before.  Might look elsewhere when these go bad.",B01G8JO5F2
Sounds quality is poor,B01G8JO5F2
I love my Senso earbuds!! I lost my original pair so this is my 2nd pair.  I highly recommend them.,B01G8JO5F2
These are awesome!! Very happy with them!!!,B01G8JO5F2
I mostly bought these for running. They still on my ear pretty well. I’ll stick with my AirPods for other because this product isn’t very stylish.,B01G8JO5F2
I purchased these headphones almost two years ago and they still work just fine. Sometimes they'll disconnect for no reason but it's very infrequent for me. I've used these nearly everyday for work (I work in a loud shop). These headphones have been washed at least twice and chewed on by my 1 year old and have stood up to rigorous use.,B01G8JO5F2
Working Great still use on my commutes. Decent range<br />Good battery,B01G8JO5F2
I bought some and they skip really bad when playing music. The sound is interrupted every couple of seconds. None of my other bluetooth devices do it.,B01G8JO5F2
They are worth the money.  I use them with my watch and if my arm back I lose the signal.  Other than this problem they fit well and stay on.  Very useable.,B01G8JO5F2
Worth for the price,B01G8JO5F2
Cant beat the price. This is my second pair (Lost the first one) I liked the first one so much I came back to buy the second one,B01G8JO5F2
Good quality sound.,B01G8JO5F2
For the price they cant be beat. Easy to use and robust.,B01G8JO5F2
"The sound is decent, but they murder my ear canals.",B01G8JO5F2
"For the money the product was adequate, but do not rely on the water proof rating. My first pair lasted a couple weeks and appears to have died from sweat while working out at the gym. The replacement was hassle free and I enjoyed the 2nd pair for about 6 months until I got caught in the rain one day while running. lasted maybe 15 minutes. Once finished with the run, I was unable to power off the earphones, pause the music, change the volume or skip forward or back. In other words, the buttons quit working. Service was great and sent me a replacement pair - which I'll keep as a backup if needed.",B01G8JO5F2
would recommend this product,B01G8JO5F2
"Buyer Beware. Product will no longer charge, didn't even last 6 months. Past the window for any exchange or refund. Not worth the money and now will just be added to a land fill.",B01G8JO5F2
Quit working at 4 months,B01G8JO5F2
"Love them. Great sound, they stay put and tune everything else out. My 6 year old wears them for her little dance parties and they stay put!",B01G8JO5F2
"Been a senso headphone users for years, old one finally broke down and the new one I just purchased had a worse sound quality and noise cancellation compared to last one, Disappointed with overall quality will continue testing.",B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these for my fiance, and he loves them! We were both really impressed by the sound quality. They are working out really well so far, but I will update if he has any issues with them.",B01G8JO5F2
""" This item is exactly as described. It arrived on time and has performed very well so far. I am very pleased with this transaction.""",B01G8JO5F2
Great value for the price.,B01G8JO5F2
great,B01G8JO5F2
Piece of crap. Died in 3 months. Never pairs now or pairs to a device for just 2 seconds and dies. Any one having this issue and knows how to repair this?,B01G8JO5F2
These are wonderful for the price! Highly recommend!,B01G8JO5F2
No stupid long cable hanging in the way. Great sound cancelling. I can't hear anything but my tunes!!!,B01G8JO5F2
Nope. Worked for a week.  Returned immediately.,B01G8JO5F2
Awesome for the money.  They sounds good and are perfect for running.,B01G8JO5F2
They are so loose on my ears. The piece that goes over your ear is not adjustable. So they feel like they are going to fall off at any moment. It makes them clumsy and is not a good fit. Even if they were noise canceling I would know because of the loose fit. The sound is not too bad. I would have returned them but I waited too long.,B01G8JO5F2
I use mine everyday to the point of wearing buttons down  this pair OMG. Ear loops are 2 different sizes  thank God they are bendable to wrap around ears,B01G8JO5F2
Holders wore out and got softer really shortly after the purchase and headphones started to fall off during the run.,B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these headphones in April, 2017. They worked fine. I'm not picky when it comes to sound quality. But I noticed recently that the thin wire that goes into the right ear plug is fraying; the black plastic covering is ripped and you can see the small metallic wires. After 4+ years of minimal use, I guess I can't complain. I'll duct tape the wire and hope that will solve the problem.<br /><br />Sept. 2022: Since my 2021 purchase update, I've rarely used these headphones. In the last week or so, I've tried to use them and they're basically dead. I've charged them all day via the USB port and they barely hold a charge. Got what I paid for, I guess. Can't recommend these for the long term.",B01G8JO5F2
I purchased these for the price point and am NOT disappointed. I like listening to audio books while doing other things and these are great. I’ve also had phone conversations and the person at the other end had no problem hearing me.,B01G8JO5F2
One year later and not that frequently used at all... just stopped working. They won't charge. Good while they lasted though.,B01G8JO5F2
Value,B01G8JO5F2
Sound quality is amazing for the price and I love how you can adjust the part that holds it to your ear.  Perfect for running.,B01G8JO5F2
The battery power lasts like they say it does. Very loud. Top volume can hurt.,B01G8JO5F2
"I'm really enjoying my Senso bluetooth headphones.  The sound quality is actually very good.  It only takes about an hour to fully charge them and they last a good 8 hours on a charge.  Included with the headphones were different size ear buds, a carrying case, and a magnetic car holder for your phone.  The different size ear buds were a nice bonus.  I was able to change the size and they fit perfectly in my ear with no slippage at all.  These are great headphones for the a good price.",B01G8JO5F2
"I mean, these aren't that expensive, but it just fell apart about 3 weeks after the return window closed.",B01G8JO5F2
"Excellent service provided by Senso, very good product warranty and customer service.",B01G8JO5F2
"This price vs sound quality seems unmatched.  The lower end of volume control could use more resolution.<br />I used the headphones 4 to 6 times a week during various workout types like outdoor running, indoor treadmill, and weight training.  Unfortunately after 6 months of use, the charging connector on the headphones physically broke and now the headphones are no longer usable.",B01G8JO5F2
Finally i found a good ond this Headphones Extremely comfortable and very easy to carry.,B01G8JO5F2
not good,B01G8JO5F2
I was very happy with my purchase. They are very lightweight and have excellent audio quality. The case is a big plus in helping keep my earbuds in good condition. They are a bit bulky but everything else overall is great.,B01G8JO5F2
I really like this product.,B01G8JO5F2
"Good value when they worked, but they only lasted me 6 months",B01G8JO5F2
"Not sure how to rate these earbuds. Sound quality is fine but not amazing. Build is okay but not amazing. I found the connecting strap to be both too short but also getting in the way (and the included tiny ties are a joke and fall off easily). All in all they work just fine, and I suppose if you use them for workouts etc, pretty much everything where you don't wear a hat,  you'll be a happy camper. But I was planning to use them on walks to listen to podcasts or music, and here's the rub. I'm in New England, it's winter, and that means, it's cold outside and you'd better were some head wear such as a beanie. While the piece that goes in the ear is okay (they actually come with adapters in different sizes) it's the large bulky pieces on the outside that kills you. With any kind of pressure on them (eg from a beanie) they hurt like hell. I've never had that problem with a design like the (wired) earplugs that come with an iPhone. Guess I will be looking for a new pair.",B01G8JO5F2
Receive these as a gift and These were great earbuds for the price but unfortunately only lasted about 2 months before the right earbud stopped working.,B01G8JO5F2
Good cheap Bluetooth head set.  Good for 18 months easily every day 9 hours a day six days a week. I charged it almost nightly.,B01G8JO5F2
"Didn’t fit my head/ears and weren’t adjustable.  The person I passed them along to, loves them and her daughter ordered a pair.",B01G8JO5F2
These headphones are awesome! I didn't even realize they would pick up my phone calls or alert me of a text message. These are better than I expected and really hold a charge for a while. Thank you for a great product!,B01G8JO5F2
"The sound quality and batter life was good, but they fell out of my ears constantly. really distracting.",B01G8JO5F2
I can't say enough good things about these headphones. I wore my first pair on long runs for several months and never had an issue. I even wore them when I was working from home. I left them at the gym and immediately got another pair. You cannot beat the quality of these for the price!,B01G8JO5F2
good,B01G8JO5F2
"Quit working after a month, red light cont to blink after you take this out of charge, tried multiple times thinking may will need full charge but no luck. You have a one year warranty. Please tell me what should I do",B01G8JO5F2
Right ear speaker is no longer working only after two weeks of use,B01G8JO5F2
They sound great and stay in place very well.  I have other bluetooth headphones that aren't connected to each other and one cuts out all the time.  No problem with these.  They're very comfortable to wear and I love them.,B01G8JO5F2
"They are affordable, the battery lasts & they came with accessories.  Great deal!",B01G8JO5F2
"I had a pair of Apple Airpods, which are awesome in many ways, but they stopped working after 1.5 years and Apple wouldn't service, only replace for $69. So I figured I'd try this highly rated product at the other end of the price spectrum. I'm really impressed with these little earbuds. Very nice sound (nothing like my old corded Sures, but very respectable), decent noise cancellation, easy to pair and use, comfortable, and I like it that they're connected to each other. I use them mostly at the gym and they've been pretty perfect for that. I ran into a pairing issue and the company replaced them quickly and painlessly. Would definitely recommend if you're looking for good, comfortable, easy-to-use, but not audiophile-level earbuds.",B01G8JO5F2
Love the earbuds fit perfect and sound quality is great.,B01G8JO5F2
Work great!,B01G8JO5F2
Stay on my ears!  Good sound quality and battery life. One of my favorite after trying many brands,B01G8JO5F2
"I purchased this unit and was quite pleased with the sound quality.  Finding the right size ear plugs was not too difficult.  The unit came with three different sizes.  The malleable over the ear loop took a little getting used to.  I had very little issue using the phone function.  Most of the time people could hear me when I called them using the phone and the bluetooth function.<br /><br />My biggest gripe is that after six months, the unit has stopped working.  I press the power button on the fully charged headset and...nothing.  No voice stating that my headset was powered on and that I was connected.  I figured it was just a glitch, so I didn't use it for a few days.  I made sure the battery was fully charged with the blue light (blue light = fully charged versus red light = needing a charge) and, still, nothing.<br /><br />I am just going to wait a few days and just keep my fingers crossed to see if this situation changes.  If not, I will try to contact the vendor and find out what my potential options are.<br /><br />Good luck to you all.",B01G8JO5F2
I am a distance runner and I have an extremely hard time finding earbuds that will comfortably stay in my ears while I am running. These are the first pair I've tried that actually stay in place! The sounds quality is great and I've had no trouble with battery life.,B01G8JO5F2
"The volume is excellent. Charge time is great. My only issue is the ear piece that goes over the ear is big. Although it is adjustable, with the right ear, my buds sometimes fall out. I have really small ears. Otherwise these are my second pair and I love this brand.",B01G8JO5F2
I never thought I would be that person using Bluetooth headphones at the gym but these are absolute gems. you can skip tracks right on the volume buttons and take calls. the mic sucks but if you're looking for a decent option to pair up for workouts this is a good bet. they last for a solid 4-5 days when I use them just for my runs.,B01G8JO5F2
"Surprisingly good sound quality for the price of these things. Noise cancellation is great too, so much I've actually missed important things. Will be my go to headphones for a while",B01G8JO5F2
"Pros: Easy to use. Connects to other blue tooth devices easily.<br />Cons: Sound is OK, but the earpieces don't fit me well enough to function as noise cancelling. I tried two different size silicon/ rubber ear pieces.<br />The ear hooks bend easily & need to be bent around my ears each time I put them on. I'm concerned that they will break eventually.",B01G8JO5F2
I feel comfortable hearing to music while I travel. I have to test on life of this. But  yes good for the price.,B01G8JO5F2
"Sound quality is good.  It is a little awkward with my glasses, but after a few adjustments it is fine.<br />1/21/20 update, the headphones will no longer charge.  Some cords work sometimes, others not at all, although the cords work with other devices.  The headphones aren't a year old yet.",B01G8JO5F2
I had bought a pair of headphones and they stopped working within the warranty so I called the company and they are replacing them now! Love this sound quality and the ear piece size options. I still use the car magnet!,B01G8JO5F2
Great sounds quality and greatest price,B01G8JO5F2
I would recommend this project.,B01G8JO5F2
Sturdy ear plugs but hurt my ears a little. Sound quality was choppy when I first connected but I adjusted my equalizer on cp. Great buy!,B01G8JO5F2
They are great,B01G8JO5F2
Great,B01G8JO5F2
I like this headphone but it doesn't seem to fit right and stay around my ear and keep the earbuds in my ear.  I try to use it when I go walking but the ear pieces keep falling out.  Even with the different ear buds.,B01G8JO5F2
Try them you will like them.  Don’t waste the big bucks if your like me and loose them in your gym bag.,B01G8JO5F2
"I've used these a few times a week since early January. I bought them because it's nice to be able to do strength training workouts while listening to music and not having to deal with wires. They worked great, sound quality was excellent. I had to charge them after every 2-3 workouts, but that's more or less what I expected. Now, they won't turn on, won't charge, won't reset. They're completely dead. These are obviously inexpensive but I did expect to get more than 6-7 weeks with them. Really disappointing.",B01G8JO5F2
"EZ bluetooth setup, like the adjustable ear loops/hooks.",B01G8JO5F2
"Good battery life, excellent sound",B01G8JO5F2
The wrap-around part of the earphone feels very good. Good quality sound for a good price. Very helpful customer support as well.,B01G8JO5F2
"I don't write a lot of reviews. I really expected a lot more from these earphones because of high ratings on Amazon. It's obvious that $29 earphones can't deliver audio quality as good as a set of $300 from Sony.  Unfortunately I can only compare SENSO's audio quality to earphones sold at a Dollar Store or the earphones given away for free to airline passengers. Senso's mid-range is muffled, high range is almost non-existent and bass is very muddy. I've had much cheaper, Bluetooth earphones with a MUCH better sound quality.<br />Audio quality gets ONE STAR! Overall rating deserves 2 stars because they included a free cellphone mount with the earphones (wonder why?).<br />I wouldn't recommend this product if you expect a half-decent audio quality.",B01G8JO5F2
"The headphones are great, whether you're running, lifting, or just walking around. The quality is great, it stays on your ears no matter how hard you run, and are just great all-around headphones.",B01G8JO5F2
"I used the headphones to run, they did okay but one of them kept twisting inside of my ear, kinda annoying but could just be a personal problem.",B01G8JO5F2
"My husband love it. He said he love the long battery life but the best feature is the ease of the Bluetooth connectivity to his iPhone 8, he said it connects instantly!",B01G8JO5F2
"Buena calidad, tiene buen volumen. Y son practicos a la hora de hacer gym. Los recomiendo.",B01G8JO5F2
purchased mine in March and now they are on the blink.,B01G8JO5F2
"Got these for Father’s Day 3 years ago.  They’ve been left out in the rain, the dog ate them and they’re still the best headphones I’ve ever owned.  Sadly, they’re finally starting to fade and not having the controls (that my dog chewed off) is cumbersome when running.  I recommend these to everyone that is looking for headphones, you won’t find better ones for the price.",B01G8JO5F2
"I like to run, but I Earbuds don't fit in my ears properly and fall out at inopportune times. So I took a flyer and bought these. I have to say I'm impressed. The sound quality is really very good--especially considering the price. Another thing I was amazed by was their customer service/tech support line. They answered immediate and helped me sync these with my phone. For around $22 these are a very good deal, and a very good pair of headphones.",B01G8JO5F2
Theses headphones were super easy to pair with my phone and the sound is great. Great value for the money!,B01G8JO5F2
I liked the comfort and sound quality. I was also impressed with how easily they paired.,B01G8JO5F2
The sound is very clear and rarely slips.  Easy to sync with the phone.  I have not figured out how to answer the phone when listening but bought for podcasts while I exercise.,B01G8JO5F2
Ok,B01G8JO5F2
"Stopped working after a few weeks, won't charge. Tech support answered the first email with instructions to do a factory reset. After that didn't work, support stopped responding.",B01G8JO5F2
Great product,B01G8JO5F2
"I've had my Sensos for a month and I waited to make sure I have them long enough and used them enough before I did a review.  Having gone through several different headphones in the last couple of months I am  extremely happy with these.  The fit is great; comfortable, secure, stable.  Furthermore the controls are integrated into the ear phones so there's no annoying control area that hangs awkwardly.  For the most part sweat is not an issue; the only time I've had some issues with sweat on the buds is at the end of an intense 30 or 35 minute run where I've been sweating for most of the workout.  And even then all it needs is a quick wipe and it's ok.  I'm not an audiophile but soundwise it's as good or better as any Skullcandy or JBL headphones I've had.  For the price I can't think of what more you can ask in regards to that.  You also get a lot for your money: a case which while not crush proof is pretty good for keeping them from getting knocked about in a bag and got keeping things like the charging cable and ear buds together.  Speaking of ear buds they give you nice range of tips, silicone and some some foam ones if you prefer.  There's a few other things they add but those are the key things.  Overall I think these Sensos are the best I've gotten for the price and I'd pick them over headphones I've paid more for.",B01G8JO5F2
"Generally well pleased with these bluetooth headphones. The sound is awesome, the battery life is good but I was disappointed in the noise cancellation. Overall though they are good headphones.",B01G8JO5F2
Used once and lost it so I can’t really give a great review but sounded really good,B01G8JO5F2
"For the price these are great head phones, they sound great when i use the phone, they sound great when i listin to music and they sound great when i watch videos on youtube. Great deal",B01G8JO5F2
"They keep dropping connection with iphone, can be frustrating",B01G8JO5F2
One of the best products I’ve ever purchased! I’ve had these for years now and they still work like new. Fantastic sound quality and block out all noise,B01G8JO5F2
"I ordered these to wear at the gym and I was very happy with the product, the sound is great especially for the price, even better than $175 pair that I had. But on that note do to me sweating at the gym the first pair failed But I contacted the cellar/ manufacturer and they replace them pretty fast for me and II bear have been great.",B01G8JO5F2
"Very comfortable, easy to use and great sound quality.",B01G8JO5F2
"""I live in an apartment and use my headphones everyday so I can enjoy music and youtube documentaries in full, clear, and beautiful sound! Thank You! Victoria""",B01G8JO5F2
this was a great buy!! They work well and are easy to use. Affordable and perfect for any type of exercise.,B01G8JO5F2
The battery just straight went to hell on mine wont hold a charge gos form red to blue right as i go to charge.,B01G8JO5F2
"I use these 3-4 days a week while working out. At least 3 of the days I am lifting weights for around 2 hours, as I do powerlifting. The fourth day is some sort of cardio, usually running. For both the gym and running, these are perfect. You can get them quite loud (if you’re like me and turn it way up when you’re about to do a set) or just mild enough to hear it and not destroy your eardrums. Bluetooth them to my iPhone for the first time and I find that the best EQ for them is “Rock,” which balances the bass out a little more. Sometimes (without the proper EQ and/or adjustments) the bass can be a little crackly and sound like a blown speaker in a car if the volume is up too much or the right adjustments haven’t been taken. “Well why would I want to buy these if I have to do a bunch of stuff to use them?” Well, they’re 20 bucks and you’re just going to workout in them. Go drop 200 bucks on some powerBeats and tell me how long they last. These have lasted me two solid years before I finally broke the earpiece while deadlifting, and the manufacturer sent me another pair.",B01G8JO5F2
"Second time ordering this product. Destroyed first pair... Toddler consistently yanking them, falling asleep in them. Used them everyday, all day. Stepped on them. Never had a problem.. Until now and re-ordered same pair. Never had a pair lasting this long until these senso.",B01G8JO5F2
Excellent- the best pair of buds ever used. Beats my old Bose (wired) too! And product support (so it appears) ahead of the competition at a fraction of the price,B01G8JO5F2
"I've used these for a few months now; running 3,4 times a week.  Absolutely no problems at all.  They are easy to set up and use while running.  Sound is great.  I love how low the volume goes!  I charge once a week.  Sometimes twice if I use them while walking to work also.",B01G8JO5F2
"I am a runner and I use music to keep my cadence. I replaced my older ""sport"" headphones with the SENSO phones and it is phenomenal! I get all of the deep tones without having to ratchet up the volume.",B01G8JO5F2
These are the second ones we have purchased to use kayaking or paddle boarding mostly.  The sound quality is (surprisingly)  good for what you pay for the budd.,B01G8JO5F2
Haven't had these long at ALL.  Already not working properly.  I can hear others and music just fine...but they cannot hear me.,B01G8JO5F2
Great headphones for running for people with lose wireless headphones.,B01G8JO5F2
"Bought these headphones in December 2018. They are good quality for the price. They didn't fit me great, but ears are weird, so not too big a deal. They just crapped out on me last month; one of the ear buds stopped working, so I only get audio through the right side. I give them a 3 because they were good while they lasted, but I had hoped they would last longer. Then again, for the cost, maybe 2.5 years is as good as one should expect.",B01G8JO5F2
Absolutely the worst wireless headphones I have ever had. I charge them all night and get about 30 minutes use out of them before they are completely dead. I will never buy these again. Do not recommend at all. I could have just gotten a bad pair. I would love to hear back from the company about their product.,B01G8JO5F2
"Let me start off with, it is almost IMPOSSIBLE for me to find ear buds I like. I want noise canceling and waterproof for the pool, cheap and all the things! Plus it's hard for me to find any that deliver all the things AND are comfortable. I was skeptical when these arrived because the wings that go around the ears are bigger than I expected and the cord, kind of long. I have abnormally small ear canals so it is really hard for me to find earbuds that stay (thus purchasing earbuds with wings). I fought to get them set just right so that they weren't falling out of my ears. Eventually, I tried the foam pieces they included and that seemed to help make a better seal. The pieces aren't easy to change but once you get them, they stay secured. When I got them in, I could still hear just about everything around me but it was muffled. No noise canceling. With that said, the second I put music on, the sound was incredibly impressive and I could no longer hear the world around me. The connection to my phone was easy peasy. Hold button 6 seconds, turn on blue tooth and select your device. BAM! Done. Overall, I am happy with these. They were crazy cheap, they're ""wireless"" (I've been mowing with wired earbuds and that is a true struggle with all the trees), and with music I can't hear the commotion in my office so I'm good. I have not tested moisture or waterproofing yet. I will update this review once I do. Oh! I tied back the cord and it isn't so bad. Probably a little longer than they need to be but not crazy.",B01G8JO5F2
"I use these headphones almost everyday. They are not even a year old yet and the battery life is TERRIBLE. I don't know if I got a bad pair or something, but if I don't charge them the same day they're more than likely going to die on me the next day I use them. I don't even turn up the volume very high. It's usually very low.<br /><br />Other than the battery, nothing else is too terrible. I think the worst part next to the battery is the cord holding them. They get caught/tangled up in my hair so easily it's annoying. If you have long hair, watch out.<br /><br />The sound is alright, it's not amazing but it's not bad. Definitely does not have any noise cancelation at the level I listen to, but I listen to them really low.<br /><br />The plastic for the ears isn't too bad, they don't seem to bother my ears. I wear glasses.",B01G8JO5F2
I think these are great!  I chose from the great reviews I read and I can’t find a flaw.  Thanks for creating a great product at a reasonable price.,B01G8JO5F2
Very happy with my senso headset!!,B01G8JO5F2
"Work great, used for 3 months.",B01G8JO5F2
I like everything about them but had to get a second set as the original pair wouldn’t recharge.  Senso sent me a free pair.  They work great.,B01G8JO5F2
"The product worked well at first right out of the box. Now after a few weeks of using it, there is barely any sound out of the right side. The left side still works fine. So now I have essentially a mono pair of headphones. Very disappointing as when they worked, they worked well. But need more than two weeks out of this product to make it worth getting.",B01G8JO5F2
"Love these headphones. Great bang for the buck! Had another pair for over a year, sadly my kids got a hold of them and ripped them apart in an effort to brown-nose their mother. I like my music loud in order to drown out the little ones when they get obnoxious, and these get pretty loud. They provide me with an escape via music, audiobooks, and podcasts. Battery life is good, did notice a little accent changed in the voice on the new pair. :)",B01G8JO5F2
I bought these in black and it lasted almost 6 months before the left side gave out. I ordered then in red December and already I've had to change it. It  wouldn't stay connected. It wouldn't hold a charge. Its ridiculous. That was certainly my last purchase from senso. And to think it was so great I ordered a bunch and gave it out as Christmas gifts.,B01G8JO5F2
"Senso used to be one of the best inexpensive ways to have good battery life and a killer sound . The last pair I got , the speakers were blown out and the battery life was shot .I had send them back and will never trust their brand again .",B01G8JO5F2
"Excellent product, I am not sure if it comes with a mic but I used it to answer calls and it worked very well",B01G8JO5F2
Airplanes,B01G8JO5F2
We really like these headphones.,B01G8JO5F2
"For this price, these are probably the best earbuds that you can buy. It's even better than some earbuds that I bought at a $40 price. The sound quality is very good, especially at this low price. What makes these stand out is the quality of design. The over-ear rubber doesn't just flap about uselessly and it's not too hard. You can literally bend them to the shape of your ear or however you want them to be shaped. I've bought several other brands of earbuds, and none of them deliver on the build quality that these have, especially the fit on my ear.",B01G8JO5F2
I have had three sets of these. The usually last me about a year. But that is using them 12 hours a day in a extremely dirty weld shop!! I like them!,B01G8JO5F2
excellent reception good value,B01G8JO5F2
Good,B01G8JO5F2
They work better than any of the others that I have purchased.,B01G8JO5F2
Bad quality and connection.,B01G8JO5F2
I purchased a set in May. They stopped working in September. The company quickly responded to my warranty claim and sent me a new pair at no cost.,B01G8JO5F2
"...then after 18 months, they would randomly disconnect and shut off, even with a full battery.",B01G8JO5F2
Dead after 9 recharging sessions.,B01G8JO5F2
I really like these.  They have great sound especially when you answer an incoming phone call.  Definitely recommend,B01G8JO5F2
Making an annoying buzzing sound,B01G8JO5F2
Battery life is very good. The sound isn’t amazing but u get what you pay for. If you don’t want to spend a fortune on earbuds then these are perfect,B01G8JO5F2
Easy to use.,B01G8JO5F2
Yjisbis  great product long life battery.,B01G8JO5F2
Awesome headphones for running. They do not fall out of my ears at all. Battery life is more than adequate. I even accidentally ran them through the washing machine once and once they dried they were like new.,B01G8JO5F2
"The sound quality is perfect, love the fit",B01G8JO5F2
No cord to get in the way while running,B01G8JO5F2
"They come in on time, and I’m satisfied with these, highly recommend, affordable and sounds really good",B01G8JO5F2
I absolutely love these bluetooth headphones! I have smaller ears and these are the first ones the actually stay in place with running and working out! I highly recommend them!,B01G8JO5F2
"I have a difficult time finding earbuds that fit in my tiny ear canals, and these were recommended by people who specifically have my problem finding a comfortable fit. I got them today, charged them, and tried them out. They came with four sets of traditional covers and 1 set of covers that are like foam earplugs. I traded out the traditional covers for the earplug version. They are incredibly comfortable, and do a great job of blocking external noise. After wearing them for well over an hour my ears weren’t sore at all, and they stayed put thanks to the earplug covers and the adjustable ear loops. Sound quality was better than expected—I don’t expect earbuds under $30 to sound like over-$100 models—but these are quite good, with adequate bass presence. Pairing was fairly easy, and while I’m still learning the controls I’m sure I’ll be happy with how things work once I get used to them. For the price I’m very happy with this purchase.",B01G8JO5F2
"I really like these ear buds.  Nice fit. Pairs easily.  Comfortable to wear. The seller is great to work with as well. I've bought other things with them.  Never an issue on incorrect items ordered.  Items show on time, as advertised.",B01G8JO5F2
The loops keep them on my ears while working out.,B01G8JO5F2
Love them for the money,B01G8JO5F2
I love ❤ the sound quality and great for workouts!,B01G8JO5F2
I am slightly disappointed with Senso headphones.  Not quite what I expected. I battled with keeping the left earpiece in my ear whilst running.  It did not fit securely and I find that the ear flaps are a bit useless.<br /> I am yet to still try the soft red foam buds in my ears ...but I really did not quite favor those too when on my other headphones. The sound quality was not much quality either.... Very deep and almost low and flat with no richness in stereo quality when connected to my ipod.  It pairs well to Bluetooth.,B01G8JO5F2
I like them because they are the loudest Bluetooth ones I have found to go with my IPod. I’m planning on buying a couple more just to have.,B01G8JO5F2
"Don’t pay for super expensive wireless headphone options. I was skeptical due to the price, and this was my third attempt to try to find the right pair. They really are great and I use them everyday now for work.",B01G8JO5F2
"Good set, good sound, works well, occasional issue with taking a phone call then returning to music.",B01G8JO5F2
"When replacing my S-255, i accidently purchased these s-250. They are not nearly as comfortable nor do they have they same quality ... big disappointment",B01G8JO5F2
"Back in February, I purchased a pair of these earbuds having only tried Apple earbuds or really high-quality earbud brands like Bose. This pair is the only pair I have found that I can say is on the same level as Bose and I can't recommend these enough. The sound quality is exceptional, especially for the price, the battery life is insane, and the only grievances I have with these earbuds is that they don't work that well over calls, which is a common problem among all Bluetooth earbuds, and that after 6 months of using them, the power/play&pause button got pushed in a little too far and wasn't working. I contacted SENSO and they were very understanding, and exchanged my broken pair for a new one after verifying that the warranty was still in place and that there was a clear problem with mine. If you are on the fence about these earbuds, please buy them. They are easily my favorite pair of earbuds and I always leave the house with my pair. Highly recommend!",B01G8JO5F2
"I exercise every other day, religiously, for about an hour and a half. So roughly, that's 3.5 days out of a week, for a total of about 5.25 hrs a week. With roughly 52 weeks in a year, I used these headphones for 273 hrs in a year for the gym alone. After roughly 819 gym hours (three years) and who knows how many hours outside of the gym, I've finally lost connection to the left ear. These earbuds survived extensive phone calls, music & video watching, and sweaty thrashings (that is accompanied by an intense workout). I can't speak for other people's experiences, but these earbuds have served me quite well and I couldn't have been happier. I think I'll buy another pair too!",B01G8JO5F2
Excellent product,B01G8JO5F2
Totally not what I was expecting. The sound quality is ok for the money you pay but wow these are the most uncomfortable earbuds I ever tried! After 20 minutes of wearing these I had ear ache . Sorry but I can’t recommend these to anyone,B01G8JO5F2
Great for the money. Good sound and the battery lasts a long time.,B01G8JO5F2
"I used these to listen to music while running outside and around the house. They lasted about a year. First, one side went completely dead, now they wont stay connected for more than 2 minutes and it says its charged, but they wont make it 1 full song before dying.",B01G8JO5F2
Worst headphones ever. Had them a year..  Don't even work anymore,B01G8JO5F2
Husband likes them and uses them while working out,B01G8JO5F2
Llllllllooove them!!!,B01G8JO5F2
I've been using these everyday for about 2 weeks and no problems.  I am very happy with this purchase.,B01G8JO5F2
"I like the product very much, is amazing sound.",B01G8JO5F2
I bought these sensos for my son and he absolutely loves them. They arrived a day earlier than expected amd for the price they are unbeatable! I'm sold!!,B01G8JO5F2
"""Exactly as described""",B01G8JO5F2
"This may be sweatproof, but failed after a few swims in pool. This occurred on two different headsets. Swims were on kickboard, not submersing headsets more than a foot on occasion.<br /><br />Mini-USB charging connection is very annoying due to its location by the ear hook and the rubber flat, which combine to make plugging in the charger frustrating.",B01G8JO5F2
"-lasted well over a year!<br />-sometimes the exterior facing ""plate"" of the plastic shells can fall off, but the boards and electronics you see can be easily put back correctly into the piece and the plastic ""plate"" clipped back on.<br />-computer on the right, battery on the left<br />-music quality is definitely a step above cheaper wired earbuds (I listen to extreme metal nonstop.)",B01G8JO5F2
I've owned these headphones for several months but they are now becoming nonfunctional by constantly turning off which is unacceptable during my workouts or anything elae,B01G8JO5F2
"Overall it’s great. Only downsides two: The lowest volume can still be too loud for me; when the battery appears halfway on my phone, it’ll say battery low a few times before turning off. It lasts a good while for me but it can just get annoying at times.",B01G8JO5F2
sound quality is ok. they fit my ears weird and can get uncomfortable since they're a bit bulky,B01G8JO5F2
Great headphones for the price. Sound quality is really good and the battery lasts quite a long time. I like that the hooks for the ears are flexible. They actually stay on my ears!,B01G8JO5F2
"Great headphones, great build, and best of all inexpensive compared to similar build quality headphones. Reccomened 100%.",B01G8JO5F2
Volume bottom fell off five minutes after taking out of box. So disappointed.  Packed it back up and returned same day as I received it.,B01G8JO5F2
Crap,B01G8JO5F2
I like the bendable ear piece.  Is there any way to know what percentage of the battery is left?,B01G8JO5F2
Can’t use with phone microphone does not work,B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these so that I could listen to podcasts and audiobooks while I take my dog for a walk.  I've used these everyday for the past week that I've had them and these headphones are a major disappointment.  Whether I keep my iPod in my pocket, in my bag, or even in my hand, the sound cuts in and out constantly as I'm walking.  It really only stays connected if I am perfectly still.  It even cuts out if I'm standing still and just turn my head to the side.  It's also difficult to hear the sound on a mildly windy day.  These headphones would only be satisfactory if you were indoors sitting down, had your phone/iPod lying flat on a table within 2 ft of you, and you kept your head facing in one direction the entire time.  I'll probably keep these for when I travel on the train or in a plane since that's when I'll be stuck in one position for long periods of time.  And I'd be totally fine if I lost these while traveling.",B01G8JO5F2
It was great,B01G8JO5F2
I received everything in my package but Wire Tie. It would have been great to get everything I paid for.,B01G8JO5F2
"I love these earphone!  They work great, are comfortable in the ear and on top of that they are waterproof!",B01G8JO5F2
These headphones sound fine. They don't fit in my ear as well as I want. I've tried changing the rubber ear pieces (different sizes) as well as adjusting the over the ear piece. Maybe it's just me. I wear a headband over them to keep them in place when I'm exercising.,B01G8JO5F2
Was nervous about these headphones due to price but great value,B01G8JO5F2
"They last exactly 2 years, but at this price, I keel ordering them 😊  Perfect for gym",B01G8JO5F2
"So i was ready to pull the trigger on a pair of Powerbeats and spend the $200, I'm glad I didn't and decided to buy these at the last minute. For $20 these headphones are AMAZING, they have good bass, good volume, and a great value. I use them primarily in the gym and they work great. No issues with bluetooth connectivity, worked perfectly. Before you spend money on overpriced headphones, give these a try, if my pair ever die on me I will be buying another pair.",B01G8JO5F2
Great product for the price.,B01G8JO5F2
I’ve had these for over a year now and it still works amazing .,B01G8JO5F2
Great earbuds,B01G8JO5F2
"I was liking this headphones a lot, until after 2 weeks of use one of them stopped working.",B01G8JO5F2
"Use these at the gym and have been really happy with the fit and durability. I even closed one bud in my car door and still haven't had a problem. They sync up easily and have a pretty long battery life, and most importantly, I don't have to mess with them a hundred times while working out. They sound good enough, no issues there either.",B01G8JO5F2
"I enjoy using the earbuds, but there are a couple minor issues I do have with them.  It would be nice if the volume control could have more adjustments between settings- also a longer warning time that the battery is about to die... Mine completely died after 4 months of use.  There was a ""fix"", but it didn't work for me, but the company quickly replaced it!  I hope this one lasts much longer.  If it doesn't, I will update my review",B01G8JO5F2
These headphones stay put in ears while running. I sweat a lot and they don't move or make additional noise.,B01G8JO5F2
It is hard for me to understand what $149 Apple pods do better.,B01G8JO5F2
"Love it, it literally tells you when its turning on and off. It also beeps when you can't turn the volume up higher. Great audio feedback. 5 stars because it's fun to use, but 4 because the sound quality is great great, just pretty good.",B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these in 2017. They lasted a long time until I broke them while on my motorcycle. That was my fault. I’ve tried a few other ones since then and they don’t measure up. These are the best and such a good value! That’s why I’m back and just ordered my second pair today. Another important point. The volume on these is really good. I can have these on while riding my motorcycle and it’s better volume than having my Apple AirPod pros on. In fact, much better. Just so you know. 5 Stars.",B01G8JO5F2
I bought these several months ago and was going to return but now I lost them. I really didn’t like these at all. Sound was tinny which I could have handled. But they don’t stay in my ears. I think if you’re just walking maybe they would as long as nothing pulls on them. Jogging on treadmill - the heavy side that has the volume thing will pull the other side out of your ear. And when you start to sweat same thing. Then I tried to use them mowing the lawn. Nope. Falling out. Waste of money for me but maybe it’s my ear shape. :-),B01G8JO5F2
Very good wireless earphones,B01G8JO5F2
The ear phones were a little challenge to put on.,B01G8JO5F2
They are awesome,B01G8JO5F2
"This is my second pair after the first set stopped working after a year.  This set reluctantly connects and then will drop the connection during various activities.  Apparently, I just ran out of support for this item even though it is only a few months old.  I will be looking for an alternative to these for my next set.  Even though they are inexpensive, they should still work.  I am also looking to process a refund or a replacement under the warranty provisions and will update if/when that occurs.",B01G8JO5F2
I like this product as it fits comfortably in my ears and the sound is very good.,B01G8JO5F2
"Purchased 2 within 2 months, they will stop charging after a month",B01G8JO5F2
"I gave these headphones 3 tries, since they seemed to have some good reviews. First time using them was JUST OK. 2nd time was also JUST OK. 3rd time, i almost chucked them on the ground in the middle of my run out of frustration. They are not flexible, they do not stay in/on your ears. I was not even sweating that much as it was a nice, cool, low-60s morning run, so I don't think that had anything to do with them falling out. I am done with them.",B01G8JO5F2
Quality sound and materials. Bonus for the ear customization!,B01G8JO5F2
There was good for the first couple weeks but after,B01G8JO5F2
This is my 2nd Senso. My cat chew the first one which I loved and used constantly.,B01G8JO5F2
""" Love them. Great sound, great price.""",B01G8JO5F2
good earphone,B01G8JO5F2
I love the noise cancellation.,B01G8JO5F2
The sound is great.,B01G8JO5F2
"They worked fine until they no longer paired with my iPhone and iPad. Even a factory reset would not fix the issue. So, they worked fine for about 18 months, then I threw them away.",B01G8JO5F2
These headphones sound is fine but they fall off in almost all my workouts.  The earpiece is adjustable and you would think they would stay but they just dont.  Still using them because i cant return.,B01G8JO5F2
"These were good headphones while they lasted only a year, now on the market for new Bluetooth headphones, they did often static or the bass in the headphones would sound rattling and static , they would loose Bluetooth connection all the time, and no it was not the signal on my phone if it was fine pairing with my Fitbit and Apple watch had no problems only the headphones , then I charge them and try to use them and they would be totally dead that I would have to plug them back in the charger 😒 just a waste of time and headache !!",B01G8JO5F2
In less than 6 months one of the headphone stop working. that very disappointing for a product that is so expensive.,B01G8JO5F2
I love it. Great sound. Comfortable and lightweight. Great useful extras included. Easy to operate. Stylish. I've already contacted friends and relatives urging them to purchase some for themselves. I plan on buying some for gifts.,B01G8JO5F2
Very affordable for the sound,B01G8JO5F2
Good,B01G8JO5F2
The headphones fit very good and will stay in while exercising.  Connecting is easy and sound is good.  We have several pair.  Had problems with one and Senso honoring the warranty and replaced.,B01G8JO5F2
bought March 2018. Last month I noticed the volume down button sticking....last 2 weeks button stuck in down postion no matter what I cant get it unstuck disappointed,B01G8JO5F2
Best Headset hands down,B01G8JO5F2
Sound quality. Perfect. Fit. Perfect. Buttons. Perfect. For working out. Perfect. Design. Perfect. Its just worth the mons.,B01G8JO5F2
Brought as a gift. Main comment is the weight of the headphones is a bit bulky on the ears. They stand behind their products and their quality. They do what it takes to make sure any issues are resolved quickly.,B01G8JO5F2
THANKS,B01G8JO5F2
Excellent value and works like a charm!,B01G8JO5F2
"These headphones are amazing! Super nice quality and defiantly worth the price. The battery life usually lasts for a good week if you use it for 1 hour workouts every day. Cancels out sound well, would recommend to purchase",B01G8JO5F2
Using the headset mostly for phone calls and listening to podcasts and music while commuting. So far so good!  Sound quality is very good and hold a charge for a reasonable amount of time.  Great product for the price.,B01G8JO5F2
The headphones are nice and fit well.,B01G8JO5F2
Right off the bat they sound great. I was impressed with the sound of the bass.  Bluetooth connection was quick and painless.  Came with 90% battery life right out of the box.  Good product for such an economical price.,B01G8JO5F2
I WAS ALLSET TO WRITE A GLOWING REVIEW BUT THE SHODDY QUALITY OF THEBCHARGING PORT LET ME DOWN AFTER ONLY 2 CYCLES. WE ALL HAVE GIZMOS THAT ARE RECHARGED BY THESE TINY PORTS WHERE WE PLUG OUR GIZMO INTO OUR COMPUTERS SO THAT WE CAN SUCK UP A FRESH CHARGE.THE PORT ON MY HEADPHONES DEFORMED BADLY AFTER ONLY 2 CYCLES RENDERING MY HEADPHONES USELESS. ANOTHER CONTRIBUTION FOR THE NEAREST LANDFILL.IT'S ALL MY FAULT FOR EXPECTINE TOO MUCH FROM THIS $20 PIECE OF JUNK.,B01G8JO5F2
I live these headphones!! I have for a few years and use daily! Even bought a second pair to keep in my gym bag. Word of advice... store in the case or the cord will become damaged and the sound will start to cut in and out.,B01G8JO5F2
Only used for running about 1 hour a day 4-5 days a week. Sound quality was not great. Battery life was okay. Biggest issue is they no longer will turn on after only 6 weeks of use. Trashed em!,B01G8JO5F2
"I got a fancy pair of wireless earbuds for Christmas that didn’t fit in my ears comfortably.  It prompted the search for “earbuds that fit in small ears,” which is how I found these guys.  For $20, they’re great.  I will say, they fit GREAT on/in my tiny ears.  I took them to the gym, and they work super well while running, lifting, etc.  However, during the course of my 30 minute workout, the music was cutting out really bad on two separate occasions.  Mind you, my phone was in my pocket, so it wasn’t a proximity issue or an accidental button push thing...  I ended up having to pause my music and restart the app.  This never ever happens to me with other Bluetooth headphones, so it leads me to believe there’s something funky with the buds.  But, like I said, for $20 it is what it is.",B01G8JO5F2
"Bought two pair of these, one for working out and one for traveling. Love 'em!! Great sound, great fit, great price! The only reason I didn't give a 5 star rating is durability - I haven't had them long enough to know how well they hold up, So far, they've been super!",B01G8JO5F2
I like the sound quality but the base is left wanting!!  That’s about all the battery life is great I can do audible books for hours a day I like it,B01G8JO5F2
"Right ear bud broke a week after using, sound quality very poor and material feels super cheap. There are better options at this price",B01G8JO5F2
"These aren't the nicest, best quality headphones on the market. But for the price, they are great! Not only does it come with headphones, but there are a bunch of other accessories for your phone and extra ear pieces. I haven't had any issues with the ""static noise"" that people have noted in other reviews and the battery life is excellent. Overall, I would say this was a great purchase.",B01G8JO5F2
"I loved these headphones when I first received them. After one week, I noticed poor connection after 45 minutes which progressively got worse until it was all static. I followed the instructions to disconnect the Bluetooth connection to no avail. After 3 weeks, they would no longer charge. Don’t buy these headphones.",B01G8JO5F2
Earpieces are comfortable to wear and very secure.  I am very pleased. Only negative issue I had was how small the type was in the directions. Big magnifier fixed that.,B01G8JO5F2
Great product at a great price.,B01G8JO5F2
"Bought two - one for my son and one for my husband. They both love them!<br /><br />Update: my son has had these headphones since Christmas. He uses them when he warms up for a wrestling match, so they don’t get beat up or used continuously. Recently, they broke. I’m very disappointed in their longevity. The return window has closed, but I’d love to hear from the company.",B01G8JO5F2
"So uncomfortable, none of the ear inserts fit. When I was walking outside and it was even slightly windy the connection would get spotty and eventually disconnect. I couldn’t walk more than 2 feet from my phone without it disconnecting. Overall a massive disappointment",B01G8JO5F2
"These are literally the best bluetooth headphones I've ever used. I was amazed by the price and the quality. I've had these for several years now, and use them anytime I'm running or working out at the gym. They don't slide out of my ears, regardless of how sweaty I get, or if it's raining outside. The battery life seems like forever. I've only charged them a handful of times. Couldn't even tell you where their charger is at this moment. Highly recommend!",B01G8JO5F2
For music and talking on the phone works great.,B01G8JO5F2
I use the earbuds when I do yard work.  No problems with them and nice to not have to worry about wires anymore.,B01G8JO5F2
"This headset is amazing for its price, do not miss it :) i dont write reviews but this one needed after I accidentally washed it (it was inside the pocket of my trousers) and its working better than before :D more clear sound now!",B01G8JO5F2
"I used these headphones for working out at the gym. They worked great for a couple years and then suddently wouldn't stay charged anymore.  There were a few times when working out there seemed to be more static. Don't know if that was interference maybe with other bluetooth devices nearby. But overall for $30 they did the job and had decent sound quality. I'm hesistant about buying them again, given they only lasted for a couple years.",B01G8JO5F2
I love not have a cord for my earbuds.  The sound is clear and the earbuds are comfortable.  The charger is easy to use and they have a good life when fully charged. I would recommend these for anyone tired of being hooked to your phone by a cord.,B01G8JO5F2
"Everything else about these is pretty great, but the Bluetooth range is so poor that it just ruins the experience. It’s obvious that the Bluetooth antenna is in the right earbud, because if my phone is in my left pocket, the sound constantly stutters and cuts out. Putting the phone in my right pocket fixes the issue. But, I wear my Apple Watch on my left wrist, and so the same problem occurs when streaming from my watch. Putting my left hand on my right shoulder fixed the issue, though that somewhat limits my ability to do anything but stand around. Oh, one other thing: the case is nice and compact, but not roomy enough to prevent the earbuds from turning on if the case gets a little squished in a packet or a bag. Funny thing, the same button that turns them on redials the last number called. Can lead to surprises.",B01G8JO5F2
"Sound quality good, not enough treble.  I don’t like the fixed earpieces, the loops are too large.",B01G8JO5F2
"I owned two pairs of the letsfit version. Of these and the were fine for the price. Well those are broke.and so I bought these. These sensors feel cheap to the touch. The audio quality is noticeable worse than the letsfit and the boot up sample sounds blown out. I returned these, because their a  cheap ripoff of an already budget headphone",B01G8JO5F2
"Even better then my last purchase. Best Bluetooth head phones for the price.<br />Best Bluetooth headphones available on Amazon period!!!!<br />For those skeptical minds, no I don't work for Sensor, nor am I being paid for my review.<br />I work out 3-4 days a week and I need Bluetooth headphones that can keep up. These headphones get the job done.",B01G8JO5F2
"Very well built,great sound and long battery life.Just as good as the big name brands without the ridiculous price tag.I bought my Senso Bluetooth headphones for use at the gym and I can’t be more happy with them,great product will be sure to let friends and family know about them as well.Thank you.",B01G8JO5F2
Have had for a year now. Around 8 months in the power button started to jam. Eventually the whole left bud cover struggled to stay on.  Connectivity has become spotty as well.,B01G8JO5F2
These were a gift and they are great,B01G8JO5F2
We have purchased multiple sets of these headphones they work great.  We did have a problem with one set losing sound in one ear but the customer service was outstanding and a replacement set is on the way.  When we contacted customer support they replied within hours with troubleshooting steps and when those did not work they said they would send a new set.  All this happened within days. Very impressed with customer service and with the product.,B01G8JO5F2
For the price I am not sure there is a better product in its class. The battery lasts easily 12 hours and the sounds quality is pretty good!,B01G8JO5F2
It took 4 years of heavy use and abuse to garner a replacement. I wasnt even mad when they finally died. I WON. WE WON. ALL HAIL THESE HEADPHONES,B01G8JO5F2
Cool,B01G8JO5F2
I paid $350 for my JBL and they do not work. The sound of this product is the same as my JBL. Great price for this product!,B01G8JO5F2
I purchased this item in order to listen to music while doing laps in pool. Bluetooth disconnects when phone is less than 5 feet a way,B01G8JO5F2
They are a little difficult to put in my ears but stay put very well. The sound is good.,B01G8JO5F2
"The sound is great, our gym is pretty loud sometimes and these do a good job of blocking that out. They stay on and don’t move much even during a hard workout. Battery lasts a long time.  I have had them for a couple weeks and only charged them once since my initial charge. They also arrived quicker than expected.",B01G8JO5F2
"Great headphones when they work. My original ones lasted me over a year, new ones stopped turning on or taking a charge after a couple weeks. This is after trying the newer version first which failed even sooner. Don't waste your time with these. Customer service is non existent.",B01G8JO5F2
"Sounded great and worked until one day they wouldn't turn on. Plugged them in to charge up fully and still dead as soon as I unplug. I tried holding the power button and attempted hard reset but still no luck.<br /><br />EDIT: Did want to note that when I plug them in, the light turns red then blue. Seems to be fully charged at that point. While still plugged in I can hold down the main button and it will take a second then blink light pink three times and then go back to blue. Light immediately turns off when unplugged.",B01G8JO5F2
Last battery life,B01G8JO5F2
"Love that if you fall asleep, don't lose them like wireless, and don't end up chocked like wired. These are great, especially for the price",B01G8JO5F2
I could not pair the headphones. Had to return the headphones..,B01G8JO5F2
Great headphones for just about anything. Easily synced to my phone and I was off!,B01G8JO5F2
Nice,B01G8JO5F2
So what's the solution to losing AirPods and various other over-priced BT earphones? These.,B01G8JO5F2
These earphones have great sounds but you need to change a bit on the equalizer to bring out the capabilities of these earphones. The sounds are great at this price point and the amazing sound isolation is big plus!<br />I use these earbuds mainly for working out in the gym and they are water resistant enough for them to get some sweat on them and not have any issues.<br />Battery last about 6-8 hours worth of listening time.<br />They are overall great sounding earphones and offer great value for what you pay them for!,B01G8JO5F2
Never kept a charge after only using them a month.  Now they dont work at all!,B01G8JO5F2
"This is my first pair of bluetooth headphones, and I'm no expert, but they are certainly just fine so far. Had them a couple weeks now, I use them a handful of times a week for an hour or two at a time and they haven't died yet. Seems to stay put but I haven't done anything super vigorous. Comfy. Feel like I'm part of a cool club now with the wireless headphones.",B01G8JO5F2
"These head phones sound great, for what they are. I have bought these head phones exclusively. However, the quality is lacking. After just a few months, the USB adapter or charging port inside the head phones broke.  I bought another pair, but it will be the last if I have this problem again.",B01G8JO5F2
Great headphone,B01G8JO5F2
Price worthy!,B01G8JO5F2
"The fit is really good and pairing with a phone or tablet is very easy. The sound is decent enough, not to ""tinny"" nor to ""bassy"". Customer service is great, so if you have any questions or concerns just reach out to them, they are quick to respond! Not really noise canceling (at least not on the level of my other headphones!) but once you adjust the fit most ambient sounds are muffled. Again, for the cost, these are a decent set of headphones.",B01G8JO5F2
I've had these before and I just replace the one that I couldn't find I love those  Headphone speakers.,B01G8JO5F2
"I really liked these for the first year I had them, but after that the Bluetooth connection fell off. They still connect to my phone automatically when I turn them on, but there is no audio connection. My music/podcast will be playing but there is no sound from either the phone or these buds. I have to go into settings, disconnect, and reconnect to get audio. Maybe I just got a bad set but I wouldn’t buy these again.",B01G8JO5F2
It is amazing. It is exactly that i wanted. I use everyday and it is work as new!,B01G8JO5F2
This were a birthday gift from my husband. I have really been happy with them! I wear them while running and it’s so nice to not have to deal with tangled cords from traditional ear buds. And a really great price!,B01G8JO5F2
"After trying a variety of headphones, these are the absolute best. The sound is crystal clear, it fits snug on my ear, and they are light in weight. I sweat a lot in the gym, but it stays on my ear. I wish I had found these way before now.",B01G8JO5F2
Great Product; Fit comfortably; Good Sound; Very reasonably priced!!,B01G8JO5F2
"Sound better than expected, very comfortable, bluetooth pairs very easily, battery life very good.  An excellent choice and for the price cannot be beat.",B01G8JO5F2
This is my second pair of these. These put out about 30% of the volume the last ones did. Totally not acceptable.,B01G8JO5F2
Product works as advertised,B01G8JO5F2
I love these so much. Light and easy to use. Sound quality is very good. I lost my first set and ordered knew ones immediately!,B01G8JO5F2
Use it around the house from the time I get home until I go to bed.,B01G8JO5F2
"While running, I find myself sometimes struggling to keep it in place.  The worst part is when I am running and making a phone call.  The person on the other end has a hard time with the loud wind noise. It's worthless for runners.",B01G8JO5F2
Great product so far but they are a little goofy trying to put them on.,B01G8JO5F2
"Find myself having to re-buy these once every three or four months. This pair I received Nov 10th, theee months later almost to the day (Feb 9) i have to reorder because they will no longer turn on. Have tried resetting, they simply are broken. When they work, they are great. But using them at the gym 7 days a week is apparently too much wear and tear.",B01G8JO5F2
These headphones are great for running! They work well and are well worth the money,B01G8JO5F2
"I loved this product. The only problem is the battery, oh and the noise cancellation has 4 stars because I was watching a youtube video while my mother was playing a soap opera and it WOULD NOT cancel out the baby's cry.",B01G8JO5F2
"I've had these headphones for a good semester now, but as I've written in the header, they don't even connect for more than a minute. I've done hard resets on them too but they still won't connect and it just makes me sad and I wish I could get new ones.",B01G8JO5F2
I’m writing a review today because someone asked me to recommend wireless headphones. I’ve had theses over 2 years and can say they are the best all around quality and comfort you will find.,B01G8JO5F2
"Unfortunately they are cheaply made, the cable on one side broke briefly after purchasing. Wouldn't recommend this.",B01G8JO5F2
Good product for the price and fit the need I had. Unfortunately they stopped charging after 30 days.,B01G8JO5F2
"I wanted to love these, trust me, I've been on the hunt for a good pair of earbuds to hike and run in, but these were not only uncomfortable and clunky feeling, they would not stay on my ears - had to adjust them constantly. They also did not pair with my ipod nano 7 - can't say that it is definitely these that were the problem, may be the bluetooth on the iPod, but I did connect the iPod to other things without. My ears are on the smaller side, and I did try using the different size ear bud covers but I'm returning these. If you have bigger ears, maybe they will stay put.",B01G8JO5F2
"Great product, thanks",B01G8JO5F2
Me gusto su diseño ergonómico y sus colores,B01G8JO5F2
Didn’t stay in ear camel tight enough and kept falling out anytime I moved my head.,B01G8JO5F2
"I've had these ear buds for about 2 1/2 years and they still perform just as good as day 1. The battery lasts through about 4 workouts at 1 1/2 hours each. I just ran them through the wash on accident when washing my gym bag. I let the ear buds dry out overnight, and they didn't skip a beat. These buds are built to last! I will definitely only buy these moving forward!",B01G8JO5F2
Don't buy these. The Bluetooth connection cuts out as soon as I put my device in my pocket. Garbage.,B01G8JO5F2
Good value.,B01G8JO5F2
I purchased these ear buds 2 years ago and they are used every day since. The quality is excellent and the extra rubber buds are useful. My only issue is that the cord attaching the left and right unit has frayed. That is a small price to pay for earbuds that have help up this well on a daily basis for and excellent price.,B01G8JO5F2
"Incredible ear buds for the price! They sounds great, fit perfect and the battery lasts forever! I love that it speaks when they are turned on and off, letting you know they are completely off. The also speak to let you know when a call is coming in. Overall I love these!",B01G8JO5F2
"Great product! Sounds better than many more expensive brands! I do love Bose, but wow, for the price...well done Senso!",B01G8JO5F2
Love the adjustable ear pieces and noise cancellation.,B01G8JO5F2
I bought it for my wife and she's very satisfied with your new device.,B01G8JO5F2
For music listening and block out noise,B01G8JO5F2
"Very good quality and sound, only last for 6 months",B01G8JO5F2
I liked that it would stay put in my ears. Very well designed product. Great sound.,B01G8JO5F2
"I like the wrap around retainers keep the buds in place.  I also like that can be used on more than one device, the TV and the phone.",B01G8JO5F2
I like the way that they fit. The sound was good  I purchased three pair of these and hardly worn them five or ten times. One pair will light up like they are charging with the red light. But when I go to turn them on nothing happens.  I feel like taking a hammer 🔨 to them. Instead I just tossed them. I have two pair left. We will see what happens.,B01G8JO5F2
Good,B01G8JO5F2
For just $20 you get 90% of what you would normally get from another brand that cost 5x to10× more.,B01G8JO5F2
"They're OK. Biggest issue for me is that bluetooth receiver is on right side of headphones, so does not connect well with my smartwatch worn on my left arm when running - sound constantly cuts in and out.",B01G8JO5F2
These headphones went through a clothes washer and perm press dry and still work.  Much recommended.,B01G8JO5F2
These headphones worked well for the price. But after only a couple of weeks of light use they stopped connecting to any of my devices and I can no longer use them.,B01G8JO5F2
My husband loves them.  The other kinds fall out of his ears.  These stay put and have good sound quality.  Great price!,B01G8JO5F2
I've had a pair similar to these before and I love them. So I've enjoyed them before and lost them as well.,B01G8JO5F2
I liked this product there was nothing wrong with it. However I want to put this out there in case anyones experiences similar issues.<br />After about a month of using this product I got really itchy ears and had to discontinue use. Maybe I am too sensitive however when I searched online I saw reviewers having similar issues for more expensive wireless  headphones too.,B01G8JO5F2
I had a problem with the unit powering up after a couple of months and the customer support team quickly found a solution.,B01G8JO5F2
"Update*** yeah, save your time and $$$, and get a better pair. After sending me a message to find out what the issue was, they copy pasted an irrelevant solution message, which did not work. Since then, crickets— despite their suggestion that the unit was under warranty.<br /><br />I bought my first pair in 2017 and really liked it. The sound quality was fair and Bluetooth connection worked just fine unless it was windy outside. I unfortunately yanked the chord by accident and I had to purchase a new pair in August 2019. By this time Senso replaced the harder plastic that clips on your ears with a more flexible, malleable one. This version was harder to keep on, especially when working out in an interior environment. The sweat made the clips easily slip off. It stayed on much better while running outside. But after less than a year, the unit stopped charging. When I connect the USB chord, the charging light does not turn on anymore. Ultimately, it's a decent, affordable product but it has a short life span.",B01G8JO5F2
"These headphones have incredible sound quality for the price tag that was recently reduced to half of what they sold for a year ago.  I have a $200 pair of PowerBeats and can’t stand their thin, treble sound compared to the Senso’s.  You do need to buy more than 1 pair because they are not long-lived.  I power walk 10 km a day in Thailand and combination of sweat and humidity breaks down the glue and they fall apart.  Superglue can extend the life but then the battery starts to go and when that happens, it takes multiple tries to connect up and then one day it doesn’t charge at all.  No worries, just grab your back pair for this price.  They recently changed the part that wraps around your ear from fixed plastic to a pliable rubber coated metal that you shape.  Horrible idea, now they don’t stay put and you loose the bass when they pop out.",B01G8JO5F2
Comfortable and nice looking. One side has a hissing sound,B01G8JO5F2
"I can't comment on noise canceling or moisture wicking. I bought these earbuds so I could answer phone calls while I'm moving around the house or somewhere where the phone can be near me. I'm tired of holding the phone up to talk into the speaker and really don't like holding it up to my ear anymore. So far, so good. I like the earbuds; they're comfortable to wear and I can hear my callers well. For what it's worth, I love the nifty case they came with. That's quite an extra bit of swag for the money.",B01G8JO5F2
"Hi , I bought the earbuds last month. Yesterday it seemed to disconnect and reconnects within a few seconds, I don't know what is the problem?",B01G8JO5F2
These headphones are great for the money.. I have had 3 sets only because I lost the others.. The sound quality is good.  Not complete noise cancelation but I don't really notice anything and I wear that 3 hours A-day at least through hardcore workouts or just the grocery store. Good buy!,B01G8JO5F2
Purchased this product on 10/10/18 today’s date is 10/16/19. Headphones just stopped working will not turn on at all don’t know why but because it is 6 days past the purchase date I was offered a 5% discount. Headphones worked great up until this day. Convenient that they stopped working 6 days after the warranty expired. Not happy with this product at all or the customer service.,B01G8JO5F2
I love the fact that I am no longer attached to my phone when I walk in the swimming pool with headphones on.,B01G8JO5F2
Great product for the money. Power on/off and connectivity process is better than much higher priced units.,B01G8JO5F2
"Worked for one day, then the left bud stopped working altogether.",B01G8JO5F2
I enjoy it a lot,B01G8JO5F2
"Great headphones, love them. So happy I found them.",B01G8JO5F2
Ive had these since decemeber of 2017  and they worked perfectly. Its now february of 2019 and one earbud is starting to act up. I will probably be purchasing this product again.,B01G8JO5F2
Well I got these 1/5/19 it’s now 3/04/19 and guess what THEY WoNT CHARGE!??  So they were good for the piece while they lasted but they are toast now. I guess it’s the old “get what you pay for.”😡,B01G8JO5F2
Can not believe how good the sound is. Easy to use too. Can't be beat for the money that is for sure.,B01G8JO5F2
Really sweat proof and has a great sound. The battery life could be longer but its long enough for my workout.,B01G8JO5F2
I bought this product on November they were great In all the ways but for some reason two weeks ago they started to turn off by them selves every two minutes so stop using them. What to get them repair or replace?,B01G8JO5F2
"When these first arrived I was initially quite happy with my purchase. The only problem initially was the audible low battery indicator gave me only a few minutes before shutting off the unit. Although the percentage of battery remaining was indicated on my phone via the Bluetooth function, it was always a mile off. I had to guess when it needed charging unless it was completely dead.<br /><br />The stems that go over the ear (to hold it in place) are very flimsy. If bumped or squished they'll bend very easily. I cringed each time I re-bent them because I was always concerned the rigid wire inside would eventually break.<br /><br />These flaws I could live with, but it wasn't long before the sound in one ear shut off. No doubt it's something in the connecting wire as it enters the earpiece. So pretty useless now unless I just want to listen in one ear. It didn't get heavy use. I suspect I got about 50  hours of use out of it.<br /><br />Sound quality is okay. I usually listen to news or books, so quality isn't as important.",B01G8JO5F2
"Suppose to be 8 hours, bought mine maybe 6 mos ago and might go 2.5 hours that's it.<br /><br />Why lie?<br /><br />Why not just tell us how long it actually will last. It is a waste of my precious time performing more critical situations.",B01G8JO5F2
Got these for my boyfriend. He loves them. Says they're the best headphones he has had.,B01G8JO5F2
Very good but not loud at all. Trying on different phones too,B01G8JO5F2
"Do NOT buy these if you want them to last the full 100% of power. They last until about 30% and then every 2mins it says ""batter low"" over and over again until they die around 20%. Most annoying thing I can think of is it repeating ""battery low"" as if I didn't hear it the first time..or 2nd..or 3rd..or 4th.",B01G8JO5F2
"They simply did not work for exercise. They paired fine and I played a song through them and everything seemed ok. As soon as I tried to take them out on a run, they simply would not work. My phone was in my flip belt so it isn’t like it was too far away. Every other second, it would cut out. I thought it was a problem with my phone trying to connect to the wifi at my house but even well outside of that range, it was still spotty. I counted and the longest it continually stayed connected and played music was 6 seconds. Other than that it was like someone was changing the radio dial constantly. I’m returning them.",B01G8JO5F2
The left speaker barely works.  Very disappointed and this pair was a waste of money.,B01G8JO5F2
It serves its purpose yet the battery life isn’t long and when it’s about to die it slows down and speeds up.,B01G8JO5F2
"Disappointed, this seemed promising in durability but these broke after one month of use.<br /><br />I only used it for the gym, and i went twice a week for roughly 1-2 hours per session. Activities were running and lifting weights. Fit snug and stayed on, sound was fine, but unfortunately only have one side working after a month.",B01G8JO5F2
Amazing sound! Easy to use for hours,B01G8JO5F2
"I ordered these headphones in April 2017. In February 2017 they started to malfunction. First, one of the earbuds stopped working. Then, after a week or so they started dropping the connection with my phone. I would only be able to listen for about 10 seconds before having to reconnect them. I called their customer service and filed a warranty claim. A new pair was sent out and arrived within days. A little over a year later and I am having the same connectivity issues.<br /><br />I will say that they are great earbuds - with a 12 month shelf-life. Not very expensive, but still... I don't want to have to be replacing my earbuds every year. I am thinking that I will invest a little more into headphones that I can keep around for more than one trip around the Sun. Good sound quality, cancels noise, lightweight, and easy to pair. Purchase at your own risk.",B01G8JO5F2
Product worked less than 2 months,B01G8JO5F2
Great headphone for the price. Easy to connect to iPhone and reliable. This is my second pair. I had my first pair 1.5 years before it was destroyed by my 1 year old. I use these headphones ~3 hours a day.,B01G8JO5F2
I love the quick response to the buttons and easy pairing. The sound is fantastic and clear also has base which is a plus.,B01G8JO5F2
"Very good product. Lightweight, no pressure, very good sound quality. Not the greatest noise cancelation but good for the price.",B01G8JO5F2
Running.,B01G8JO5F2
No e recibido nada y supuesta mente ya lo debí de haber recibido.,B01G8JO5F2
Too difficult to charge . I’ve gone back to cheap wired headphones.,B01G8JO5F2
The left headphone did not work!!!!,B01G8JO5F2
"For 19.99 I thought it was going to be just ok. It was more then ok, it was a good buy! The battery feels like it last forever, blue tooth connect right away, and the incoming call and notifications where on point. I applaud Senso, why spend 200 for some ear buds when for just 20 dollars you can het a long lasting, comfortable product. Good product indeed, a must buy!",B01G8JO5F2
Can't go wrong for the price . after a while the wire that wraps around the ears got loose from headphone and doesn't really hold well to ear anymore.,B01G8JO5F2
Great sound and good value!,B01G8JO5F2
Amazing headphones. I bought these after pulling my wired set off my ears over and over. They are so easy to set up. I leave my Bluetooth on so when I power these on they immediately connect to my phone. The sound quality is great. I've never bought really expensive headphones so I can't compare these to any other but I definitely enjoy the sound. Also I love that these go around my ears and can be molded to fit tightly on my ears. I can't wear earphones that stay inside the ear. They always fall out and my left is smaller than my right ear hole. With this set I don't have to worry about them falling out. They are also very comfortable.,B01G8JO5F2
"Very good sound quality, putting the product on is a bit awkward, but overall I'm glad I purchased it. I am on bridge lines at work that sometimes can last a few hours, some participants do not speak good English, the good sound quality makes it easier to understand them.",B01G8JO5F2
"They look great, they sound great and very affordable pricing.",B01G8JO5F2
These advertise to be water proof. I went in the water with these and within 10 seconds they stopped working. Super disappointed,B01G8JO5F2
They re-connect so fast that is crazy... Sound quality is good for the money and comfortable to wear. Would buy again.,B01G8JO5F2
"The quality is very good, the workmanship is fine, the wearer is comfortable, the sound quality is very good, the bass is heavy, the color is very good, it is fashionable, the electricity is enough, it is very durable",B01G8JO5F2
Love the product,B01G8JO5F2
I am so surprised at the price of these awesome sounding earphones.  Keep up the good work.,B01G8JO5F2
"These headphones were fine when I first got them. Decent (but not great) battery life, and good quality sound. However, I bought them only 2 months ago and they have already stopped working and won't charge.",B01G8JO5F2
"Won't stay put for nothing, impossible to workout with these.",B01G8JO5F2
"Compared to prior ear buds of similar cost, these were not impressive. Very tinny sounding, and little bass.",B01G8JO5F2
Comfortable and decent sound for the price. I use them at the gym.,B01G8JO5F2
Great quality for the money.,B01G8JO5F2
I use it when I workout,B01G8JO5F2
Great earbuds!,B01G8JO5F2
"Skips on iphone se when playing spotify, even after replacing with new pair. I don’t know if the fault lies with Spotify, Apple, or Senso, but it’s not a bandwidth issue. If you have iphone 7 or newer hopefully it won’t be a problem for you.",B01G8JO5F2
Excellent product for the price,B01G8JO5F2
"I like these better than my ""Beats"".  The sound quality and volume are much better.",B01G8JO5F2
I had no difficulty in setting up the connection to my phone. The headphones are comfortable and the sound is great!,B01G8JO5F2
These will randomly disconnect from my phone. Battery life will show 90% but they will only last about 20 minutes after they get to this point. Battery life is probably only 3 hours.,B01G8JO5F2
"The product is clearly becoming more and more cheap. I've bought this product 4 times now as it's either been lost or I've wanted a spare set and as time as progressed, it's clearly become cheaper and more chinese. At this point, I wish I went with a competitor rather than this brand, the product should IMPROVE over time, not degrade, what a waste.",B01G8JO5F2
I really enjoy my headphones. I will most def say it was a good purchase but people cant hear me when I try to talk on them.,B01G8JO5F2
"Reasonably priced.  Good sound quality.  I gave a 4 star rating for sound because it isn't perfect.  Nevertheless, it sounds good.  The price is right!  I had a more expensive pair before these, from another company, and these are by far better.  They stay in my ears fairly well too.",B01G8JO5F2
Value.  My wife loves her set and they help to prompt her to work out at the Y.  I bought a 3d pair for my daughter at her request.,B01G8JO5F2
"Have bought two of these in about 30 months after my first one broke about 9 months ago.  Had some issues with the first one where it would require me to connect about 3-4 times to my ipad or iphone before the connection would work.  It would show the headphone and battery bar icon on my phone but when I played music the music would come out of my phone or ipad and not the headphones.  Occasionally I would even have to restart the apple product and reengage the bluetooth again to get it to work.  It was rare that it connected perfectly on the first try but 2 tries was most common.  The first set eventually broke when it wouldn't connect to my phone at all anymore.  It kept saying searching and my phone would not see it come up.  I tried the headphones on 4 different devices to make sure it wasn't the connecting device that was the problem, but it failed to connect on any so I threw it away.  I bought another pair because for $25, lasting nearly 2 years was good enough for me.  I would absolutely recommend these over wireless beats as I went through three pairs of wireless beats (2 for me and one for my wife) in 2 years.  For the ripoff price beats charges they had better last 5 years not just under 1 year.  Sound quality for these phones and beats were even to me and neither really do much noise cancellation at all, which is fine because I wouldn't expect much out of this type of design.  Of important note, my second pair of these headphones does not have any issues with bluetooth connectivity and I honestly don't think it has EVER failed to connect on the first try, so perhaps just got a bad pair for my first go round (or an unusually lucky pair this time!).  One issue I see with all three pairs (both of mine and the pair for my wife) is that they all fail to show the battery strength accurately on the phone.  The battery bar on the device starts at 100% and then goes down to 75% or 66% or so immediately on the icon on the phone, but never goes below that ever.  Thus I have had many a workout where my headphones died 15 minutes in to my 60 min workout which is very annoying!  For that, I try to keep rough track of my workouts and try and charge the headphones after each 3rd or 4th workout to be sure they don't die on me, but occasionally i still forget.  Have a pair of Bose noise cancelling headphones (that are amazing!) that always tell me battery strength remaining when I turn them on and that notification is always accurate.  Wish these headphones did the same.",B01G8JO5F2
"I highly recommend grabbing one or two of these! Great quality, superior sound, and affordable price compared to those branded ones. No issues at all.",B01G8JO5F2
"The headphones are light and comfortable and fit pretty well. My biggest complaint with these types of headphone is usually the volume but these Senso headphones have a good sound output level and choosing the right tips helps too. When the earpieces are properly seated and sealed in the ear canal, they actually have really good sound quality with rich bass, solid midrange and good highs.",B01G8JO5F2
"The quality of the senso headphones has fallen sharply. This is the third and last time I buy their products.<br /><br /> I bought these on October 5th(writing as of October 29)  and have had nothing but issues with them. I believe senso switched to cheaper parts, leading to the problems.<br /><br />I have had issues with the headphones charging, and never charging fully since day one. They advertise 8 hours of audio, I'm lucky if I get one.",B01G8JO5F2
Excellent sound quality,B01G8JO5F2
"Excellent for resting, mowing the lawn, or any other activities.  Definitely recommend!",B01G8JO5F2
"I buy at least 2 of these a year because I unfortunately lose them. So I typically buy these and somehow picked this one up.<br /><br />Out of all of them, these were by far the worst. They lose the connection to the phone constantly and are impossible to reconnect. And even harder to actually cut on and get them connected. I have to cut them on twice in order to get them to work. Very awkward when I'm accepting business calls.<br /><br />After a couple of months I think they have gotten worse. I went and ordered my regular ones and haven't been happier. These are my backup and even there they make it replaced.",B01G8JO5F2
"Every two weeks or so the headphones switched to Chinese. Took me a while to figure out how to switch back to English. Power off button works about half the time. Eventually overheated and died, after owning for just a few month. Tried three pairs, switching to another brand.",B01G8JO5F2
"I suppose they work but the button on the side that controls everything is right where you push the ear buds into your ears which can pair, unpair, turn them on off etc- very impractical",B01G8JO5F2
Loudest earphones I have ever owned,B01G8JO5F2
Love these headphones- bought a pair 3 years ago & couldn’t be happier- my old ones got a little funky with the blue tooth connection when the battery was low so I thought a new pair<br />- same quality<br />- great fit - doesn’t fall off when running or exercising<br />- buttttt my right ear piece : there seems to be something loose in it because when I run it’s a very obvious noise- so I might send it back: trade it in,B01G8JO5F2
"I’m using it to pair with my Apple Watch while running. Only the foam ear pieces will stay in my ear. I wish there was more than one pair of the foam ones.<br /><br />Also, the sound is often static??? I don’t understand why and this is disappointing.",B01G8JO5F2
Stopped working within a year for no reason. Warranty from senso is impossible to navigate and complete,B01G8JO5F2
"I used these at work and when I go grocery shopping because I get social anxiety with crowds of people and it puts me in a bad mood. The noise cancellation is pretty good without being too good, I can still pay attention to what's going on around me if I have to. The volume adjustment and ability to skip to the next to YouTube video right from the earbud is great. For the price the quality is pretty good but then again I don't listen to heavy bass music, I mostly listen to YouTube videos.",B01G8JO5F2
"I’ve ordered these headphone three times not because of how much i love the ease fit and quality.<br /><br />However after 4-6 months of everyday use there always seems to be something wrong. First time they wouldn’t charge, second time the connection between wire and headphone was poor and kept showing wires. This time the headphones are fully charged and will connect for 3 seconds and then disconnect and turn off.<br /><br />If you’re looking for short term Bluetooth headphones... these are great! But if you’re looking for something to last you longer I would chose a different brand.<br /><br />It’s a bummer because they’re my favorite headphone to run in and they are not expensive. however at this rate with the amount that I’ll need to keep buying them I’ll be spending a lot more and will invest in higher quality headphones.",B01G8JO5F2
"I had an older pair of these that lasted more than. A year. The wire started fraying by the ear piece, so I ordered a new pair. They worked fine until they died shortly after the return window expired. They are cheap so I ordered a new pair. The “your headphones are on” would blow you away with the volume, but despite turning them all the way up with my phone volume maxed out, they were not loud enough. With a fan on in my garage, I could not hear my audio book while rowing. These are being returned. I learned my lesson and have purchased some Jabras on Prime Day.",B01G8JO5F2
"They are fantastic for sound and quality, but for the life of me I can not keep them in my ears.  Why?  I have tried ever one of the ear bud sizes.  Nothing works.  Every single time I turn my head they pull on the cord and the buds slip out of my ear.  Plus if you have long hair they are super difficult to put the ear pieces around your ear because they get caught up with your hair.  I don't always like to have my hair in a ponytail just to wear these headphones.  So I am happy with their sound and battery life, but keeping them in my ears is a problem...",B01G8JO5F2
Perfect thank you,B01G8JO5F2
Great headphones but could use some improvement on the left side.,B01G8JO5F2
"The  best headphones that I have amazing like wow 😱😱🥰🥰These were a lot better than I was expecting Battery is good right out the box it will last 9 hours, also included Cary case ,short charging cable ,cellphone card wallet ,and cellphone car mount . easy to pair, just turned them on and found them in the bluetooth settings.<br />Fit pretty well Easy controls, they are located in the right headphone.<br />And also calls are very clear people can hear me so good.<br />MUST HUY THIS IS GOOD COMPANY HAPPY CUSTOMER 💋",B01G8JO5F2
They just stopped working after a month and half.,B01G8JO5F2
"So far so good, only used them twice and seem to be a good buy..time will tell if they will last",B01G8JO5F2
This are my favorite ear buds!  Great quality for a low price!,B01G8JO5F2
"Perfect for the gym or running, but the noise calculation isn’t good enough for cycling.",B01G8JO5F2
Stopped working after a month,B01G8JO5F2
Product is as claims- have had no problems with these earbuds,B01G8JO5F2
Thank you im planing on giving them as a Christ mas gift i might be ording some more<br /> Thank You again,B01G8JO5F2
"I use these every day, pretty comfortable.",B01G8JO5F2
"Bang for the buck I couldn’t be happier. I’m an audio engineer and know these aren’t designed for pristine sound so I wasn’t disappointed. But with that said, they provide plenty of amplitude and the battery life is really good for the money. The right channel is a tad quieter than when they were brand new but I still really enjoy these. I’m a heavy sweater who lives in the south and I use them daily and after 5 months they’re still going strong. Would recommend.",B01G8JO5F2
Use mostly when doing exercising. Sound is a little tinny but good enough for that.,B01G8JO5F2
Great sound quality for the price,B01G8JO5F2
"They don’t hold in my ears well, but I have that problem with all headphones. They do come with multiple sized plugs",B01G8JO5F2
They were great headphones very good with sound base and noise canceling,B01G8JO5F2
Needed something more practical to workout with since having an arm band and traditional headphones was more or less annoying. Read some reviews on these and was sold. It’s just too bad that they were just as annoying as my normal headphones. During one of my runs every 10 seconds it would cut out my music and say connected. I trashed them directly afterwards. Don’t waste your money like I did.,B01G8JO5F2
"Great product for the price. Wear them for biking and running. Sound was better than other running headphones I had tried at $100+. The battery died after 7 months, however their customer service was awesome and shipped a replacement pair promptly.",B01G8JO5F2
Fast delivery. Great product,B01G8JO5F2
"The earphone came with a lot of accessories; silicone ear tips for all size and a comfortable foam tip. Good sound quality for its price range. Good and fast connection with my iPhone and battery lasted pretty long.  Only thing I didn’t like is the plastic behind the ear tips are a bit hard and could be uncomfortable.  Overall, great product for its price and would recommend it to anyone that need an affordable earphone.",B01G8JO5F2
"I was looking for some headphones because I am a big fan of bass. I liked these headphones because they produce very good bass. Sound quality is fair, and noice cancellation is good as well. I didn't face any challenge connecting to bluetooth with Andriod, and iOS devices. The setup is very easy. The only negative about these headphones was that they stopped working after 3 months, but I got a replacement for free so that was good.",B01G8JO5F2
Nice,B01G8JO5F2
"...these are 5-star headphones. I did have to return one pair, but they refunded me completely in addition to giving me a discount code. For the price tag, I'm not sure you can beat these.",B01G8JO5F2
"Use them for working out and phone conversations. They have disconnected a couple of times, but then reconnected. Also a couple of times connection was poor and breaking up.",B01G8JO5F2
Long battery  ✌🏽♥️,B01G8JO5F2
"I purchased these earbuds a few months ago because I need a new pair of running earbuds. These were the first Bluetooth earbuds I have ever bought and I spent a great deal of time evaluating other products before choosing these ones. However, I must say that I was extremely disappointed with them. The sound quality is good, but there is way too much base in my opinion. In addition to this, the claim that these earbuds have ""noise cancellation"" abilities is completely false. I can have these earbuds in and still hear others around me. This may be attributed to the fact that they are way too big. The only support for these earbuds is a thing that hooks onto your ear, but the hook only comes in one size and is way too big. Because of this, there have been times when I've been running, and they just fall off. One of the only redeeming qualities is that the battery life is excellent. I can use these earbuds for hours without charging them. All in all, you can probably get a better pair of wireless earbuds for the price.",B01G8JO5F2
"I’ve had three pairs. All three stopped charging at various times. I’ve only ever used the chords sent by Senso, and did not use quick chargers ok the last two pairs I owned. Do not buy these headphones. Waste of money. Sadly, everything else about them are great.",B01G8JO5F2
I have ordered two senso Bluetooth headphones two my family members .. out of two one is not working as expected right ear was completely not auditable I have raised a concern about this but no response .. product I liked it . But only concern is one headphone is not working ..,B01G8JO5F2
Not quite sure but barely after 6 weeks the headphones are no longer charging!,B01G8JO5F2
"There is a little bit of a learning curve trying to use this product. I wear glasses, so it took some trying to get it to fit properly and the attached cord seemed to get in the way a lot.<br />Once I got it to fit and learned the controls, the sound quality is awesome. The earbuds blocked out all the outside noise and I was able to enjoy my music without interruption.<br />It has been 4 days of constant use and the battery is still going.  Battery life is great.",B01G8JO5F2
I have get the best sound quality at a low price,B01G8JO5F2
"The section that goes behind your ear is moldable, which you think would help but it's so flimsy that it doesn't hold in place. They fall out of my ears when I run. Not happy at all. And the sound isn't that good either. I should've bought my Jabras again.",B01G8JO5F2
Not what I expected. Probably a bad order. Would buy again and hope for a better product.,B01G8JO5F2
"For the cost, these are hard to beat! good sound, easy to charge and convent carrying case is provided.",B01G8JO5F2
Good value for the peice,B01G8JO5F2
"After about 6 months of using the product on and off while running, the ear Senso buds would simply turn off on it's own. I contacted Senso, and they asked me to try resetting. That worked, but the ear buds still shutdown while I was running. I am a fairly patient person, so I kept resetting my ear buds, until I finally got tired of it and contacted Senso again (after the 1 year warranty period was over) to request for a replacement. Senso admitted that sometimes they have defective products that allow moisture to enter the electronics, causing performance problems, but they would not replace the ear buds because the warranty period was over. They knew I contacted them after about 6 months of use for the exact same problem. So here's my suggestion to you. NEVER try to be nice to Senso by trying out their suggestions to fix problems. ALWAYS request for a replacement the first time you experience a problem with the ear buds.",B01G8JO5F2
Bought these as a gift for a person who enjoys running.  She loves them!  I have since bought other pairs for gifts.,B01G8JO5F2
"The instruction guide is a little hard to follow. not a big problem, but it's a little confusing",B01G8JO5F2
Bluetooth not very good.,B01G8JO5F2
"Great with music or using to connect the phone in the car, comfy fit too.",B01G8JO5F2
Good stuff Works great happy the way it works,B01G8JO5F2
Sound quality is good and they feel real good on my ears even for prolonged periods of use. Using them for gaming on my iPad and there’s no delay which I appreciate,B01G8JO5F2
"Amazing bass. Almost to much. Almost. These things thump.<br />These are comfortable, the controls are easy to get used to, the battery lasts a long time and they sound great.",B01G8JO5F2
I am very satisfied with my wireless headphones. They were easy to use. They're light and the earpiece is flexible so it molds to my ear shape.,B01G8JO5F2
"I’ve had these for several days now. I’ve used them for about 5 hours so far and have not had to charge. Sound is actually better than I expected, even with the good reviews on them. They are LOUD. Which I like. Great bass, decent treble and mid sound. You really can’t go wrong for $30. In fact you wouldn’t go wrong with these for more than double the price.",B01G8JO5F2
The volume is horrible  You can not turn up the volume to any reasonable level to hear. It does not go ups whisper no matter how you adjust your phone or the head phones.,B01G8JO5F2
Works great with kindle paper white. Easy to us and comfort fit. Quickly charged.,B01G8JO5F2
Great earbuds for the price point. Forgot they were in my jeans and washed them and they still work.  Earbud I.D. tip size is 3.8 .,B01G8JO5F2
My wife loves these. Great 👍 job guys.,B01G8JO5F2
These headphones sound amazing.  I love them. They charge fast and I own two pairs.,B01G8JO5F2
"Great headphones that I use when I workout, while at work, or when going for a walk. Hold a charge for a really long time and has good sound quality. Would definitely recommend.<br /><br />Update: Less than a year later, after raving about these to several people they just stopped working. The power button no longer presses in. Now on the hunt for a new pair of inexpensive quality wireless headphones. I'm so upset these don't work anymore!!",B01G8JO5F2
"I have these a short time, a couple months, and they suddenly have gone dead. The pair before this I had four a few years before problems. I like the fit and sound so I am ordering again.",B01G8JO5F2
These are great for working out and running.  I even bought my wife a pair to use.  Her pair stopped charging after almost a year's worth of use but Senso sent a replacement pair at no cost.,B01G8JO5F2
They work great and are about the only wireless that seem to stay in my ears while working out and getting sweaty!,B01G8JO5F2
Broken within a month. The charger port is sunken in and no longer accepts the charger. I want a refund! Don't buy these,B01G8JO5F2
Wicked painful on the inner ear and alot bulkier than what good gym headphones are suppoed to be. I’d recommend saving up and upgrading to the jbl reflect mini bluetooth headphones for 60 bucks. Theyll outlast their year-long warranty and you’ll actually want to wear them to the gym.,B01G8JO5F2
Pleasantly surprised with these Bluetooth headphones.  I use them when doing housework and the sound is surprisingly good for both music and podcasts.  Agree with other reviewer that said red memory foam ear pieces are great!,B01G8JO5F2
I’ve had these for about six weeks and they’ve already stopped working. Would have given it one star except that I really liked them. Used then with my Peloton. Too bad they are not better made.,B01G8JO5F2
Low in treble,B01G8JO5F2
Good sound but two songs in and they busted not worth it prime garbage,B01G8JO5F2
Ok,B01G8JO5F2
not the best quiality sound ... you do get what you pay for. the bass that comes from the headset sounds pretty bad like if the speaker was popped the ear pieces that go around your ear to hold the earpiece in place move and are very flexible when i try to place the right earpiece in i always pause the music or turn the volume up or. down due to the fact that the control is located there wouldn’t recommend them if you’re an active person and enjoy quality sounds,B01G8JO5F2
I have ordered them before last a long time,B01G8JO5F2
Excelente,B01G8JO5F2
"Great Tech support - provided instruction for making outgoing calls from bluetooth (just hold down both volume control buttons)<br />Great sound and volume control. Comfy ear piece that have flexible holders to confirm to your comfort.  Noise cancellation apparently isn't good according to the people I talk with.  Overall, I like it",B01G8JO5F2
"Overall, these are good earbuds. They sound fine, they paired without issue, and battery life is good (I can get pretty much a full day of use on a single charge). I only have one complaint: They are LOUD, even at the lowest volume. It may not be an issue for everyone, but for me it makes them unusable/uncomfortable to use for much more than YouTube.",B01G8JO5F2
Bought a pair for myself and one for my wife. Great for audio books and music alike. Highly recommended.,B01G8JO5F2
"OK, so I've had these for quite some time, so I feel almost qualified to write a review on them. Below you'll find all the skinny on these cheap but potent beauts and hopefully it'll help you make a decision. I'm going to go down the list as it's shown on the product page so it'll be easy to follow.<br /><br />First things first, do these do what they say? Absolutely! They're BT headphones with a mic and multifunction button on the powered side and they all work great, well almost.<br /><br />True High Fidelity Sound? Well, that depends on what you're listening to. I've found the lows sound pretty good for this type of unit, but they're inherently limited just because of the size and type of speaker used. However, I'm very happy with the base these produce. The mids are also very good, all things considered. Some artists sound better than others, of course. But generally they're clear and concise. The highs, well that's another story. Again, depending on the music you're listening to and how you have them adjusted, they can sound tinny with some music. Mostly rock and pop. However I don't listen to most auto-tuned music of today's artists so I can't speak to that, but I do listen to a wide range of music and overall am pleased. Watching a movie with them is enjoyable because of the noise reduction tech they have. Outside noise has yet to be a problem while listening to anything.<br /><br />Are they comfortable and secure on a sweaty head? Yep. They're equipped with the hooks that really do grab and hold on to your ear. I've mowed, walked and even did home improvements while these were on my head and they never became a problem. Over time they may slip out of my ear canal a bit, allowing outside noise in, but a light press and they're back and sealed. Now, after watching a long movie my ears may become sensitive but that's after a couple hours. Plus, they come with a few sizes and types of ear plugs so you'll likely find a set that works for you.<br /><br />The battery life has been remarkable, thus far. I've let them sit for a few days, come back and they're working just fine. It doesn't hurt that they charge pretty quickly, too. So even if they're dead it'll be no time on the charger and you're back in business. So in that regard, they perform as expected if not a touch beyond.<br /><br />On to the BT technology. I have not researched the various level of tech BT has these days. I can only assume the larger the number, in this case BT v4.1 with 6.0 and all that jazz, means it's going to perform better. In this case, I think not. My only complaint thus far is the quality when outdoors or beyond one room in my house. When outdoors the phone must be within about 12-24&#34; of the BT headphones or it'll beep repeatedly, indicating<br />there's a weak connection. A weak or lost connection will cause the music to stutter, for lack of better words. It's not skipping, it's actually stuttering for a good 30 seconds before it makes a full reconnection. This is consistent no matter what I'm listening to. The strange part is that if it's windy it's worse. Go figure. I called support and they were very supportive. They directed me on how to reset the unit, which we did and then it returned to what it was doing but the call was over and I never called back. I just try to work with them because it's been too long to do a return.<br /><br />This leads me to warranty. I can't speak of it, although I don't doubt they'd support a claim with a smile. Who knows, maybe I'll file a claim, but I'm guessing I'll just get another unit with the same problems so in the end I'm not sure it'd be worth it.<br /><br />I have seen these under a different brand name and they were a little cheaper. It wasn't on this site and I'm not even sure where it was. A friend seen these and asked me if I bought them here and took me to the site where the others were. It's been too long to recall, but I'm happy with the price I paid and can still recommend them.<br /><br />So in the end, these are of higher quality than any other headphones of their type, especially for the money. They truly live up to the hype put out there by Senso and you can believe what people say in their reviews. I gave them 3 stars because the BT isn't up to my level of expectations. The connection problem is the same I've had with BT when they first arrived on the scene and I expected them to be solved, but aren't. I'm not crazy about BT headphones but these will make a skeptic think twice.<br /><br />UPDATE: August 22, 2017<br /><br />The day after I posted the review above, my volume button on these beauties broke by collapsing inside the unit. It was on the volume up button, but before I realized what happened I had pressed the volume down button until the unit went to mute so they were useless to me afterward. I made the dreaded claim I mentioned may happen, but things went a lot smoother than I thought.<br /><br />I wrote via Amazon here so the claim was far easier than ever imagined. I wrote what had happened and added that the connection gets lost when outdoors and I have to keep the phone too close to the unit to make them usable. Well, as they stated the new set did not have that problem.<br /><br />First, let me say I wrote on a Sunday since I had some extra time. Oddly enough they responded that same day and, with proof through photos of the damaged part and the new set was off and in my hands by Wednesday. That's 3 days! Impressive I must admit. Plus, other than providing a photo and confirming my shipping address, both very reasonable, there was nothing I had to personally come up with. No returning of the old unit and it's accessories either. To me that's fantastic and makes this purchase even more worth its asking price.<br /><br />One last thing I forgot earlier and that is how does the mic work. Well, I don't make a lot of calls and use these more for music and movies. However, I did use them on a couple of occasions and they seemed to work fine. The caller confirmed they sounded great so that's what I'm going with. More later if, indeed, there's more later. :)<br /><br />UPDATE October 29, 2017<br /><br />I should say again that Senso was on the ball with my warranty claim and I can't complain one bit about them. They're willing to talk to you and more than willing to replace the unit if it appears to be shot, like mine were.<br /><br />When I first got them it seemed that the problems I reported earlier were no longer an issue and could have been an anomaly. Unfortunately, after a while they returned to the same old problems the first unit had. In their defense, I've never had a BT headset that worked so why should this one?<br /><br />To recap the problems, they lose connection when outside, regardless of where your phone is in relation to the headset. I literally was squatted on the ground with the headset about 15 inches from the phone trying to enjoy music and every time I turned my head it'd start to lose connection. It wasn't terribly windy so I don't know. When you have lost connection, for whatever reason, and reconnect the music doesn't play smoothly. It skips like I said before. I have to pause it and wait a minute for it to catch up and then restart the music. This is annoying as hell when your hands are dirty from working.<br /><br />They still sound very good for what they are and the battery lasts for several hours. However with all the other problems they have I can't give more than 2 stars because if you're outside all day like I am, these units will keep you frustrated and you won't enjoy your music.",B01G8JO5F2
Great headphones for jogging.,B01G8JO5F2
This is the first wireless earphones that actually stay in my ears while I'm running on the treadmill.  I don't have to fidget with the earphones or stop and make adjustments while running for 30 minutes.  I can stay focused and listen to music or podcasts. The behind the ear piece is super flexible.  Totally happy.,B01G8JO5F2
Good one. Gifted my dad. It made him happy.,B01G8JO5F2
"Pleased with these. Sound quality is good,The case is nice.Very professional seller,thanks.",B01G8JO5F2
It easily beat dr beats 350$ headphones!<br /><br />First 4 hour use expression!!<br />Will update next week if anything noticeable changes happen,B01G8JO5F2
"Worked for two years, then died. It's take it for $20.",B01G8JO5F2
They've been great. Stay in place and work exactly how they should. Love it.,B01G8JO5F2
Loved all the bonuses that came with the earbuds. Nice packaging. Really good for the price.,B01G8JO5F2
The headphones shut down about a week after I purchased them. Wouldn’t turn on or charge.,B01G8JO5F2
"I'm pleased with these headphone, especially for the price, just wish the battery lasted longer.",B01G8JO5F2
"I purchased these to replace lost headphones...found my lost ones and didn't use these till I lost my old ones again. Wish I hadn't waited so long to try these out only to discover that they don't work. They connected to my phone and worked maybe 3 or 4 times tops. They are fully charged, and volume is up... but they do not work.",B01G8JO5F2
Broke within 2 months and haven’t heard back from customer service regarding replacing it considering it’s STILL under warranty,B01G8JO5F2
Mic stopped working in couple of months. Sound quality is good though.,B01G8JO5F2
"Used this mainly as my running / gym pair of headphones.  They work really well for staying in your ear, drowning out background noise, and decent voice quality.  My complaint though is they only lasted 4 months before it started getting loose wire connections at the base of the headphone (where it connects to the other earphone)... now the sound basically jumps around and is unusable :(.  Really liked the pair but they should have lasted way longer; I am not rough on my products.",B01G8JO5F2
Gracias,B01G8JO5F2
Hundred percent am satisfied with the quality.,B01G8JO5F2
"Purchased these headphones a month ago and was pretty happy with them.  I purchased them to use with my peloton, they connected easily and the sound was pretty good.  They weren't very comfortable but I was getting used to them.  Last week I plugged them in to charge and when I came back to use them there was no power indicator light and they would not turn back on.  Seems as if they just died while charging.  I called Senso support and they just told me to return them.  Pretty disappointing, probably won't be buying another pair.",B01G8JO5F2
"I have now had these for 2.5 years, and last night I accidentally ran them through the washer and dryer, and this morning they still worked perfectly! The connectivity is not always perfect when I go on runs with them, but the battery life is great - I can usually exercise about 5-7 times between charges. I’m not much of a sound-quality snob, so I can’t say much for that, but they are good enough for someone like me who just wants music during exercise. I would absolutely buy them again.",B01G8JO5F2
Finally able to listen to music while I am commuting on public transportation.  Connection to my iPhone is consistent and of reasonable quality.  Good deal for &lt; $20.  Wish I could adjust the volume more finely.,B01G8JO5F2
Awesome,B01G8JO5F2
My earbuds stopped working after 3 months for no known reason and the company replaced them as per one year warranty. Very happy with the customer service I received.,B01G8JO5F2
Great quality and great sound,B01G8JO5F2
Loved the extra accessories.  Nice carrying case.,B01G8JO5F2
"I have had these for 3 yrs.  They sound and work great. They charge up within a couple, plus they hold their charge for days depending on use.  So glad I got these.",B01G8JO5F2
"I lost my headphones unfortunately. I used to use it at gym. In office, if I put sound at (what's equivalent to) 7 - everyone around me would hear the noise. It is light, battery stays long and it looks good.",B01G8JO5F2
"I used this product for about 2 months before they stopped powering on. I contacted customer service to report the malfunction, and received a prompt reply from a rep named Amelia. That is the last time I heard from her (or anyone else). I emailed Amelia telling her the troubleshooting steps she sent me did not solve the issue (performing a factory reset), and haven't heard back since. I've tried to contact her 3 times since then.<br /><br />Also, when I was performing said troubleshooting steps, the wire connecting the two earbuds snapped in half. With the plethora of options out there today for budget bluetooth headphones, stay away from Senso. In my experience, they're the worst quality of the half-dozen or so pairs that I've owned over the years. I'd expect to be ghosted while using a dating app, but definitely not while trying to resolve a customer service inquiry.",B01G8JO5F2
These sound pretty good.  I have owned these headphones for almost 4 years and they have gotten some use. I recently washed them in my HE front loader and they survived! And they still hold a decent charge! I am super impressed and give them my highest recommendation.,B01G8JO5F2
"I was somewhat skeptical about ordering a $20 pair of headphones, however upon opening the package and listening to them, I'm convinced that they are more than worth the price of admission. The setup was easy and the sound quality matches headphones I have paid 4x as much for. They also stay securely in place, something other similar headphones have not done for me. The packaging was very nice and the carrying case was more than I expected for the price.",B01G8JO5F2
These headphones were too big for me to even wear. I received them and had to give them to my b/f as soon as they got here.,B01G8JO5F2
Junk don't buy this ...as it is low quality. Item lasted all of two charges before it stopped working.,B01G8JO5F2
I love my senso Bluetooth headphones! They have been perfect for my daily running! The company is so awesome in their customer service. My headphones stopped charging and they offered to send me a new pair,B01G8JO5F2
"Buen producto, aún estando sin uso se le acaba la batería en menos de un mes.",B01G8JO5F2
"Altogether I have ordered about 5 sets of these earbuds.  They are of good quality at a fair price.  After a few years of usage, my first set began to have some static problems, so I ordered another set.  My new set doesn't seem to fit my ear as well.",B01G8JO5F2
I like everything but the 2 days it worked. Speakers are crackling when the bass hits.<br />Replace please!!,B01G8JO5F2
Great for traveling in the airport and on the plane.,B01G8JO5F2
"I really like these headphones. I love the fact that they are wireless and not bulky. I can easily carry them in my hand, pocket, or purse. I have had issues before with headphones that are not over the ear due to multiple earrings that I have but these were not uncomfortable. They hook over the ear to help keep them in place.",B01G8JO5F2
Product didn't work.,B01G8JO5F2
Horrible product. There is static way too often. I tend to return,B01G8JO5F2
"After using 3 month my headphone is turned off after pairing with any device, please advise to solve this problem.",B01G8JO5F2
i recentely purchased senso.to replace  wireless ones that my dog ate.. However I had ulko prior.Senso plugs do NOT STAY IN MY ear walking let alone running..You would think the flexability around the ear would be an advantage.IT IS NOT!<br />It is a major disadvantage and im very disatisfide.i will be giving this product a poor rating due this.,B01G8JO5F2
"I purchased these for my son for a Christmas present.  I had owned a couple of pairs over the past few years so I thought they were pretty good.  He finally started to use them about three weeks ago.  They stopped turning on after two weeks use.  But, it was more than a month since I had purchased them (before Christmas) so I could not do an Amazon return.  Very disappointed in these.  I guess I am done purchasing this product.  I was going to update this review to mention that the seller replaced the headphones and was very responsive.  That is great.  However, the replacement headphones after a month, melted down (literally) while charging overnight!",B01G8JO5F2
Sound quality of my Audio books.,B01G8JO5F2
"I had a GREAT headset off of Amazon over a year ago but they stopped charging. I will say I'm a  mega sweater and my last ones lasted longer than any Sony headphones, but they no longer were made and this was the closest option. The battery doesn't last too long, if I put my phone in my pant pockets it will disconnect as if its too far. Once its at 15% or 10% it gives a warning like every 30 seconds which is annoying. They do the job for short term workouts and work days",B01G8JO5F2
"Definitely not the best like they say. You get what you pay for, but for that low price they are ok. Mine didn’t last very long but I got my money worth out of them. Spend more money and get a better set of headphones.",B01G8JO5F2
Great.,B01G8JO5F2
"The sound is fine, the charging is fine. The only drawback I have seen is that the earpieces seem to fold over when it is in my pocket. I then have to straighten them out to use them. I like they are soft, but perhaps they are ""too soft"". This is my second pair of senson headphones so I do like them. The first set, also soft did not break but I needed a second pair so I could have them where I was working out and at home.",B01G8JO5F2
"I was excited to receive these headphones and looked forward to using them.  I put my iPhone in my pocket and listen to audiobooks on YouTube.<br /><br />The sound would keep cutting in and out. The tech guy at target and a genius at Apple told me that the metal in my artificial hip was interfering with the signal and there isn’t really an solution.  So, I’m sure the headphones are fine but I’m really disappointed that I can’t use them.",B01G8JO5F2
"I've had mine for two years when Amazon had it featured as a ""Lightening Deal"".  There are a lot of cheap AirPod knock-offs and most are not very good.  This isn't trying to be an AirPod, as there is a cable between the left and right earbuds but they are bluetooth (thus wireless) to the device.  But these ARE very good- they are durable, lightweight and sound great.  I am no audiophile but I wear them running, biking, mowing lawn and other physical activities and after two years are as good as knew.  My son was impressed that instead of paying 7x for a pair of AirPods he liked these and is happy with them for his Iphone (I use Android).  Mine came with extra ear tips, micro USB cable and a sturdy but lightweight carrying case.  Now it appears they also add a wire tie, cellphone card wallet and car mount- a nice bonus if you need them.  A great value for sure.",B01G8JO5F2
"Bought after getting tired of clotheslining myself with my normal corded headphones.<br /><br />Had to adjust the earbud size after first day; they do come with different earbud sizes and I'm glad they do, as the ones that came with were extraordinarily uncomfortable.<br /><br />Sound is good. The little wrap-around wire that holds the bud into your ear isn't the best. While I appreciate that you can change it's shape, when you're doing high-impact stuff they do tend to lose some grip and have to be readjusted.<br /><br />Honestly, my biggest complaint is that the ""handsfree"" controls are a bit non-intuitive: the + button is back, and the - button is in front. So it was an adjustment to want to change the volume or change a song...and then realize that the button that is most forward on the controls is actually the ""back a song"" or ""decrease volume"" control. Of all the quirks o this product, this is genuinely the one that I have the biggest quibble with. Even than, they're not bad. Certainly not bad for the price. I'd recommend tailoring your expectations accordingly, but def try them out.",B01G8JO5F2
"Very comfortable and convenient, sound is excellent, good base quality",B01G8JO5F2
Great for listening to music on my walks.,B01G8JO5F2
"I just got these today and I played a few songs, honestly they're great. The arch keeps the buds in my ear and the sound is clear and good quality. Even better is I simply love that the box came with a phone mount, caribiner clip, a stick on card holder for a phone, and what I love most is the case. It has mesh inside for the spare rubber buds (thank you!) And even the case itself. It's a nice carbon fiber finish with red accents. Awesome product so far!",B01G8JO5F2
"I really liked these headphones and used them for just over a year. I work from home and enjoyed using these to listen to music and seamlessly answer calls as well. The range was great, I could leave my phone in the office and walk at least 30-40 ft away without losing signal. I had switched the ear pieces to the foam pieces that came with it and after a month or so they were hurting my ears so I wanted to switch them. One ear piece came off fine, the other actually broke the headphone instead of coming off. You can see in the picture that it broke at the seem. I owned these approximately 15 months when this happen and since they didn't break from my own abuse, I sent Senso an email. They responded with a mere 5% discount code and advised it was out of the 1 year warranty. Had this been my fault I would understand not wanting to offer further assistance, but this appears to be a weakness in the product. While I enjoyed these headphones I will not be purchasing another pair.",B01G8JO5F2
These work great!  Had my first pair for work and lasted 2 years in a autobody shop. Used 5 days a week 8 hours a day!  Would recommend!,B01G8JO5F2
"There’s a lot of distractions every time I play a song, I didn’t like it it was my worst choice ever.",B01G8JO5F2
"LOVE the sound quality, easily adaptable to fit my ears, good battery life charge.",B01G8JO5F2
My husband loved these and said they were the most comfortable headphones he'd ever worn.  Unfortunately they quit working after only 5 weeks of gentle use during his dialysis treatments. So disappointed!,B01G8JO5F2
"is the 4 time that i buy this headphones,just great i love the sound of this product",B01G8JO5F2
"I love my headphones, I wear them everyday for work & to play my music & talk to my friends all 8hrs.",B01G8JO5F2
"I really liked these headphones and used them for just over a year. I work from home and enjoyed using these to listen to music and seamlessly answer calls as well. The range was great, I could leave my phone in the office and walk at least 30-40 ft away without losing signal. I had switched the ear pieces to the foam pieces that came with it and after a month or so they were hurting my ears so I wanted to switch them. One ear piece came off fine, the other actually broke the headphone instead of coming off. You can see in the picture that it broke at the seem. I owned these approximately 15 months when this happen and since they didn't break from my own abuse, I sent Senso an email. They responded with a mere 5% discount code and advised it was out of the 1 year warranty. Had this been my fault I would understand not wanting to offer further assistance, but this appears to be a weakness in the product. While I enjoyed these headphones I will not be purchasing another pair.",B01G8JO5F2
No warranty support. Do not buy these. I have had 2 and they both died before the warranty was up and there was no support from senso. Try Mpow!!,B01G8JO5F2
"compre unos auricularesen en mayo 2020  que se descompucieron y fueron remplasados, se descompusieron por segunda vez y se puso un reclamo a SENSO  para su garantia  y asta el presente despues de un ano no se me a remplasado",B01G8JO5F2
Noise cancelling is BS. Other than that they are good.,B01G8JO5F2
"Exactly what I was looking for!! Great value for the dollar, will buy again!!",B01G8JO5F2
"So I scored this product low because while the sound is amazing...it never fails after a year...one of the speakers go out. I have purchased these headphones three times (yes they are that good in terms of sound and noise cancellation) but once again, one side giving out. I purchased them mid January of 2019 so I guess it was time.",B01G8JO5F2
Amazing product and amazing customer service!,B01G8JO5F2
Quit working after about 1 week. Seemed decent until they quit working.,B01G8JO5F2
"I like how fast it connects every time I use it, and how I can adjust the earpiece. I just hope these will last longer to at least two years because I bought a pair last year in March, and it broke in August this year. Overall, I am happy with the product, I just hope the longevity is there. If it is, Senso will be my go to since I did spent 2 weeks considering what else to purchase besides Senso.",B01G8JO5F2
"I have had these headphones for two years now and finally have to retire them.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Good sound quality<br />Pairs easily<br />Lasts 2 years without an issue<br />Battery life has lasted, I got about 8 hours new and about 6 hours used<br />Comes with awesome accessories. Makes it worth the buy alone.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Improper fit- unless you have large ears, they will not fit properly for long runs. If you are weight lifting or walking you won't have a problem.<br />String (wire) length- slightly long so it will stick to your neck and pull on the ear when you turn you head.<br />Material quality- The wire is finally starting to fail. The sound in the left ear piece is intermittently transmitted through the wire, making the headphones too annoying to use.<br /><br />Overall a good buy for the price. Two years of use (5 days a week) for this price isn't bad. No buyer's remorse.",B01G8JO5F2
These headphones are my favorite right now,B01G8JO5F2
Don’t work,B01G8JO5F2
Purchased in feb abs one of the ears already stopped playing music. But the sound was good until now. May still buy another pair.,B01G8JO5F2
Works for the price.,B01G8JO5F2
This is a wonderful Bluetooth headphone I love it plus the charging is great 8 hours of battery life the sound is amazing. Good product it’s a must buy at a reasonable price I would give it 7 stars,B01G8JO5F2
This is the 3rd pair Ive purchased. My mom saw me wearing mine to cut grass and liked them. She said she’d love a pair for Mother’s Day. Very good quality for the price. 1st pair is over 3 years old. I lost them and bought another. The first pair got found and still wrk perfectly.,B01G8JO5F2
Great set of earbuds. Exactly what I was looking for.,B01G8JO5F2
don’t waste money on the BOSE or other expensive headplugs. these work just as GREAT. love them..,B01G8JO5F2
"Headphones will not charge, got as few. Hours out off them. I attempted to charge them after the battery was low and they will not charge.",B01G8JO5F2
Really great headphones for the gym! Good sound quality and they don't budge while I hop all around lol.,B01G8JO5F2
I’ve been using these for about a month. So far all is great. I use them while on the treadmill. They stay in and work great. Good price!,B01G8JO5F2
"""I had an earlier pair which I misplaced, so I bought a new one. The old pair had pauses at the beginning of playback. The new set has no pauses. Comfortable, work well. Come with a convenient case.""",B01G8JO5F2
"Unfortunately, this is the second pair of these headphones that I have owned in the last year and again they have began to falter. I understand paying for what you get, but I'm really disappointed in the lifespan quality of these headphones. I have had this specific pair for just about 8 months and the sound is beginning to go in and out from ear to ear. Not sure if I will buy again and might just end up spending money on better quality so I don't have to keep dealing with this problem.",B01G8JO5F2
Nice people at this company but buy the higher priced buds.,B01G8JO5F2
Excellent product.,B01G8JO5F2
Pretty bad sound quality. Bad fit. There are better options out there for this price.,B01G8JO5F2
"sound is clear , no echo , wire is practical , strong , i will buy another one",B01G8JO5F2
"Quality is so good and so easy to use, I bought a second one for my daughter because she wanted mine.",B01G8JO5F2
"I decided to try and get into the world of wireless earbuds and these things are amazing!! Like having mini Beats headphones. I saw that Beats actually made a similar product to this and I've heard it sounds just as good as Beats, perhaps even better! I can't recommend this product enough! If you're looking for wireless earbuds whether you work out or not, you should definitely give these a shot! (If only they made a wired version for in-ear monitors...)",B01G8JO5F2
Best wireless headphones I've owned. Wasn't about to pay hundreds for Beats by Dre and glad I didn't. These work well and sound good. Also double as hands free bluetooth for phone calls. Case and extra ear buds make this an excellent deal.,B01G8JO5F2
Really GREAT sound. Rich deep base and very comfortable to wear,B01G8JO5F2
"I ordered these to replace a set from mpow jaws.  It is advertised as light weight and comfortable.  I am glad the parts that go over each ear are flexible and comfortable.  I usually use them  with only one ear bud in, they often fall off because the weight of the other ear bud pulls the one inserted out.  I have found that sticking the unused earbud in my shirt over my shoulder will hold it in place better, but I think there should be a better solution.",B01G8JO5F2
"Great sound. Very loud. I listen to metal and rap. Very Good bass. Very good price. Great for running. I would give 5 stars... However, when bicycling, they create lots of loud wind noise over about 6 mph.  I have the jam on brand ear buds too . These Sensos last way longer and are way better. For 1/3 the price. Battery life on these is 7 hours on loud music.",B01G8JO5F2
"Good connectivity to my iPhone and I use it to listen to songs, audiobooks and podcasts while in the gym. The earpieces fit very well and can keep out most of the noise around me. The flexible earbands work very well.",B01G8JO5F2
"Can’t beat the price. My first wireless headphones. The ear attachments could be more durable. I spend too much time adjusting to fit just right. I use them during my gym workout. I wear glasses, which also contributes to a poorer fit. Overall though, I like them and will use until they wear out.",B01G8JO5F2
"this is my 2nd Senso earphone. I returned the first one because of poor sound quality. 2nd one last longer, had issue with one of the ear buds, I was told to reset the unit, it should after that. I did reset per instructions, but problem persist.<br />I bought square trade insurance for this one. no response yet from Square trade.",B01G8JO5F2
Good fit. Back of ear has pain after long use. Sound is good. Charge in an hour. Battery lifelast up to 5 hours.,B01G8JO5F2
My headphones stopped working and I have contacted the company and given my info twice for a replacement. They never processed or contacted me back. They do not honor their warranty.,B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these headphones on a sale and I really do not regret. The material looks to be really durable, they are quite comfortable and they attach perfectly so I can even run and they do not fall. I am impressed with the passive noise canceling, I can use them at the gym with the environment music and noise and I can hear my favorite songs in peace. The sound quality is not the high-end type but it is okay, its bass is very good but it lacks of highs. If you are planning to use them for sports then I highly recommend them.",B01G8JO5F2
"Nothng not to like, from the secure carrying case to the quality of the headphones The folks who make these awesome devices, from the owner on down, have been as wonderful as the headphones themselves.  They have sought out more than just a product review they genuinely are interested in customer satisfaction and that is impressive. Thank you",B01G8JO5F2
Very good for the price. Has great audio and the buttons work very well.,B01G8JO5F2
I like the Bluetooth because it easy to communicate and. The sound is clear while u listen to  music.,B01G8JO5F2
Great Bluetooth headphones. Don't fall out when using.,B01G8JO5F2
For twenty bucks  you can't go worng. I'd buy them again!  I've bought three sets o ear buds. Senso outdid all the rest in their price range!,B01G8JO5F2
To hear my music.,B01G8JO5F2
The sound quality and bass is awesome. Great at noise canceling. They fit comfortably with my glasses. The best part I don't have to keep readjusting them while I'm walking.,B01G8JO5F2
These bluetooth earbuds work great with the new iphones.,B01G8JO5F2
I would buy again and again!,B01G8JO5F2
"This is a great product, especially for the price. It came with a couple surprise extras, including a magnetic vent mount for your cell phone. The sound quality is pretty decent and they come a nice case. The synced up quickly with both phone and tablet. They stayed on at the gym and have decent battery life.",B01G8JO5F2
Can't go wrong at this price point.  Only word of caution is adjustable over ear component can be a bit finicky.,B01G8JO5F2
"These are excellent headphones. They hold charge, stay put, are comfortable, good-great sound quality.",B01G8JO5F2
The headphones are good for the price. They stay in place for the most part while I run and lift. They also seem to be pretty sweat proof. The most important thing for me is that they don’t feel uncomfortable like some other earphones. I use the medium size caps.,B01G8JO5F2
"I purchased a couple of these in 2018 and they were great. The sound quality was good, the battery was decent, and the ear buds stayed on your ears. Unfortunately, this is no longer the case. The quality seems to have dropped tremendously to match the lower cost of this latest build (30% cheaper than what they cost in 2018).<br /><br />The sound is really disappointing now. It's like they stripped out the some of the low and high frequencies, and now it's just mid heavy. The case feels cheaper, and they fall off your ears easily due to the larger ear hooks it has now(and yes, I've tried bending them to fit my ears). I can't comment on battery life because they sound so bad that I have not worn them long enough to drain the battery.<br /><br />I'll be tossing these in a drawer for emergency use and looking for another full time use headset.",B01G8JO5F2
Great sound at an affordable price!,B01G8JO5F2
I bike everywhere as well as workout and needed something other than earbuds as they don’t work for me but this just doesn’t cut it. The sound quality is terrible and the earpieces don’t stay in my ear even with the hooks. If you have more money and time invest in something more.,B01G8JO5F2
"All I have to say is that after two and half years of serious use, training, abuse, etc - these things have NOT failed me.  They sound great, last a long time, take all kinds of abuse, charge quick and easy - they just do EVERYTHING right.  There is not a single doubt that I am buying these again - if they ever even die on me.  I love finding a great product at a great price.  I almost want to buy three or four more sets so I have these for the next ten or twenty years.  Seriously, for $20 - my goodness.  God bless this company.",B01G8JO5F2
Good,B01G8JO5F2
Good sound deep base better than most I’ve bought that were much more expensive,B01G8JO5F2
"I work with them around my neck all day and for the most part I keep them well protected, but they have started to disconnect from my phone randomly. That being said for jogging and other instances where you might not wear them all day, these are a pretty decent pair of headphones. Sound quality is good and they are comfortable over long periods of wear. Very good price point for what you get. The customer service is great! When the pair I bought started having issues they replaced it for me.",B01G8JO5F2
"This is my second pair I have purchased of the same earbuds. I want to clarify something, I am not a crazy, gotta be a perfect pitch kind of guy, please understand that. My first purchase of these buds was in April of 2017 and I paid about 35 bucks. They lasted almost 2 1/2 years of constant use as well as abuse and whether I was at the gym with volume maxed out ( and they handled that) or relaxing watching a movie these buds did the job for me. My recently purchased 2nd pair work as well as the first set and only cost 20 bucks. If you are looking for a very inexpensive set of buds that deliver great sound, then these should work for you. Looking for say Bose quality, then no, but I am pretty hard on my buds and these hung in there with me for over 2 years originally. I went back to them and am not disappointed. I still haven't received my free gift as promised, so I wouldn't count on getting it if I were you",B01G8JO5F2
First pair quit after 4 months on the second set now.,B01G8JO5F2
"The wires between the ear buds wore out after 3 years, the black plastic shredded and does not flex well, exposing the red wire inside which eventually broke.",B01G8JO5F2
Great sound except for cracking noises. Not real easy to use.,B01G8JO5F2
Great sound and easy to connect.,B01G8JO5F2
Been using these for workouts and yard maintenance.,B01G8JO5F2
"Great product, no regret of buying it..",B01G8JO5F2
I love the versatile ear pieces. I can interlock them when not in use which prevents them from falling off my neck.,B01G8JO5F2
"Los mejores que tuve para hacer ejercicios, sin preocupación de sudarlo o que se saliera del oído",B01G8JO5F2
This headphones has an unbeatable price and sounds great.,B01G8JO5F2
Love these headphones—and the price.,B01G8JO5F2
I own these as well as the S-255.  One thing that surprises me is the bass. These things sound great.  The battery life is a huge plus. It really is 8-9 hours.  Would easily recommend these.,B01G8JO5F2
"it is very good sound, no noise, dependable, very attractive,  I love it  easy to use freely to use without worry, or destruction i have recommended for more than 7 people",B01G8JO5F2
"My second pair, 1st set lasted over 2 years, great fit, easy to pair, great battery life. Very good value at $22.",B01G8JO5F2
Use these all the time - during water aerobics and strength exercising these are my go to headphones - very comfortable and reliable!!,B01G8JO5F2
This is a good product for its price. The design is cool.,B01G8JO5F2
Llegaron en buen estado!,B01G8JO5F2
I love the distance I can get between my phone and headset.,B01G8JO5F2
"I like the sound quality. I would reccomend these . They fit comfortably around my ears. I have not used them in the gym yet however . Battery life seems good as I have left them in the car overnight quite a few times, and did not have to charge them the next day.",B01G8JO5F2
can't even hear when driving down the road with the volume down.,B01G8JO5F2
Good,B01G8JO5F2
"This is a good product, not too much bass but if you are just using it for the gym should be sufficient sound.  For the price I believe is a good product, will recommend this product.",B01G8JO5F2
"Initial use was satisfactory that I purchased a few more and when one went bad I returned for another.<br />Now I had to return one for credit and am holding the other one because it cannot hold a charge.<br />The warranty did satisfy 1 of 2 purchases and sad because I really enjoyed the use while it worked.<br />As for the one that I have that will not hold a charge, I will ask for a refund or replace with a comparable model that will hold a charge and last for more than 6 weeks. A shame.",B01G8JO5F2
"Bought this just one year ago and did not use it that much until last month after the COVID-19 force me to stay home more.  It connected and worked OK, not too secure in my ears so I have to adjust them from time to time during my one hour daily jogging.  But since a few days back, it started to suddenly lost the connection, power on/off would not help.  And a re-charge the phone will get it connects again.  This always happens after about 1 hour usage, happened 3-4 times already.  It could mean the battery faded?  What to do next?",B01G8JO5F2
Great value for the money. Outstanding sound.,B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these as a gift for my husband first. He raved about them for a while, and I decided to buy myself some since I was tired of *always* catching the wires of my headphones on stuff. I have to say, he was absolutely right, these are great headphones. We've had his for almost two years and they're still going strong. Mine are every bit as fantastic as the day we bought them as well. The volume capabilities are great (I often use mine during yard work when there are typically machines making noise that has to be competed with, and I can *always* hear whatever I'm listening too very clearly), the battery seems to last forever (about 8 hours of use between charges), and they aren't uncomfortable or heavy. I love these headphones!",B01G8JO5F2
"For its price, it does the job well.",B01G8JO5F2
"The earphones worked perfectly the first day, and then we had an issue getting the bluetooth to stay paired to the iPhone. The service help and responses were quick and very helpful. Following their simple re-set instructions, we got them paired again and they've been great ever since.  I can highly recommend this product and the company behind it.",B01G8JO5F2
"I am very happy with my earbuds.  They were very easy to sinc with my TV and give very clear sound.  I have had them for a month and have not had to recharge them yet, but I don't use them very often...just when I want to watch TV in bed and not disturb anyone with the noise.",B01G8JO5F2
"These have great sound, easy to install, comfortable to wear.  Amazing range...packaging says use within 3 feet of bluetooth device.  I got all the way down the hall at work and suddenly realized I could still hear the music from my desk, well over 50 feet away.  Very comfortable to wear for extended periods.  Most earbuds are too large and my ears hurt after just a short time, but these came with different sizes and smaller size works perfectly.  Sound is clear and crisp.  Haven't tried exercising with them, but just walking and moving around at work, they seem to stay put just fine.",B01G8JO5F2
They are great.  I love them.  They are perfect for everyday use and i use them for running and working out.  Better than airpods in my opinion.,B01G8JO5F2
Won't hold charge anymore. Stayed on for 1 minute then turns off. Didn't even use them for that long.,B01G8JO5F2
"I have had these since August.  They don't keep the best connection consistently.  Not sure if that is because I have used them between my phone and laptop.  But there is a lot of interference during phone calls, static with music, etc. The price is great but honestly, not sure if it's worth the cheap price for the quality of sound and poor connectivity",B01G8JO5F2
I have gotten 2 other Senso before and the were great. This Senso earbuds feels cheap and the sound quality is not so great. It also takes a long time to turn on when you press the button. Was kind of disappointed with them.,B01G8JO5F2
Great sound and product.  Long battery life -love it!,B01G8JO5F2
Broke very quickly,B01G8JO5F2
I work in auto body so I'm moving around all day.  These headphones are awesome!  They stay in place and are loud!  I love them!,B01G8JO5F2
"It worked fine, but didn't last even for 6 months. It is not worth spending money to buy this item.",B01G8JO5F2
Good product for the price,B01G8JO5F2
"I’ve used them like five times. Invariably, either they don’t stay charged, or they just don’t turn on no matter how many days they’ve been on the charger. Or they just don’t connect to my phone. They are so unreliable it’s impossible to use them without also having regular headphones as a back up. I wish I could return them.",B01G8JO5F2
Very easy to use and comfortable,B01G8JO5F2
Lasted longer than the 100+$ I have purchase. Great buy.,B01G8JO5F2
"Although they lasted 2 years while my husband was wearing them he felt a pop in his ear, the battery pack flew out of the earbud. Luckily,  not injured.",B01G8JO5F2
I lost a pair of these and ordered them again. I love them. I use them when listening to music while roommate watches TV,B01G8JO5F2
"great sound, easy connection.  Great buy for the price.",B01G8JO5F2
"Bought this device 2 years ago. Used it for a couple of months. Then I forgot about it. I was just going to use it again. Fully charged it, buy the power button no longer works and it doesnt turn it on",B01G8JO5F2
"The sound is crisp and the bass is excellent; and for a rocker, bass is imperative! The fit is so comfortable. Even on the lowest volume setting, I can barely hear anything other than my music.",B01G8JO5F2
They are great for day to day use!,B01G8JO5F2
Headphones are easy to carry and provide great sound quality. Overall very satisfied for the amount of money I paid!,B01G8JO5F2
One of the ear buds does not work,B01G8JO5F2
Connected fast and easy when i turned them on. Great quality sound. Great battery life. Durable,B01G8JO5F2
They either become loose or fall off after running for a few minutes. The new wire in the ear hooks begins to droop after repeated shaking while running. The earlier models did not have this wire and were perfect. I put these new ones back in the box. Very disappointed.,B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these and they are perfect for my spring/summer exercise. they are great to cancel the roads and people talking while I am running. they are perfect for my ears, fit and don't fall out. GREAT BUY",B01G8JO5F2
Everything it is very good,B01G8JO5F2
Like for my cell phone,B01G8JO5F2
There is no way to answer your phone and you can not change songs with these. I wouldn’t have bought them if I knew that.,B01G8JO5F2
Great product...,B01G8JO5F2
Earbud broke off while in my pocket.  The wiring that holds the earbuds to your ears is finicky and requires frequent adjustment.,B01G8JO5F2
Work well.,B01G8JO5F2
Excellent product at a great price. Comfortable with great sound quality.,B01G8JO5F2
They seemed fine right out the box but I hear a very loud buzzing in the left ear. Not happy with the purchase I’d suggest paying a little more for a product that doesn’t sound like a June bug in your ear.,B01G8JO5F2
I can still hear the surrounding areas but the sound is crisp. I love it that it only cost $17! I believe it was on Unbox Therapy on YouTube. Lew never lied!! Too bad that my 👂 just gets sweaty. Good product! Thanks 😘,B01G8JO5F2
I like this headphone so far I don't have any issues with sound quality.  It fits me right!,B01G8JO5F2
"Good quality, fits well, like having the earpieces on a wireless cord",B01G8JO5F2
"I'm a big fan of these headphones. I actually bought this pair to replace my previous ones,which had lasted several years before I broke them. The connection to both my phone and computer is great and sound quality is excellent. There are a few modifications from my last pairthat I really like, such as the malleable-ness of the past that goes around my ear. I have little ears and find that feature to be really nice!",B01G8JO5F2
The price was right for my use and needs. It's nice that the headphones are easy to use also works well with my phone.,B01G8JO5F2
"no complaints. battery doesn't last a million years and the audio quality isn't sennheiser, but it's like 30 dollar bluetooth earbuds, y'know?",B01G8JO5F2
If you have an iPhone and want to lose your hearing in less than a year.<br /><br />These headphones are so loud even on the lowest volume that it hurts. I contacted their support team for help but they told me all BT headphones are loud with Apple. I have other pairs of BT headphones and have never had this problem. Would not buy these or recommend them.,B01G8JO5F2
These headphones are Very Comfortable to wear and have a Great sound! Light weight and feel very secure when working out!,B01G8JO5F2
"At this price, this is the best you can get. It works pretty well. You can even use it without the ear straps if you wear glasses.",B01G8JO5F2
"A while back i bought the Jabra pulse earbuds - bluetooth @ $199  The battery only lasted the max 3 hours and when i tried to turn the Jabra earbuds off i didn't receive an acknowledgement so maybe that was the cause of the battery life.  The SENSO bluetooth headphones are quality headphones.  They wrapped around my ears securing so they will not fall out; sound quality was equal to the Jabra earbuds; and the ackownledgement turning the on and off was absolutely clear and to the point.  Unlike the Jabra set the multifunctional button was useful.  The only reason i bought the SENSO is because the Jabra battery died and I couldn't afford to buy another set for $100-200.  Don't be judgemental on the price tag of the SENSO headphones @ $19.94 from amazon, they're quality.  Since I've received my SENSO I've used them for a short time (2 weeks) - used them on 3 run and my 2 bike rides while listening to music.  However, I have not used them for my calls as of yet.  I totally recommend anyone to buy them for under $20.",B01G8JO5F2
"They sound good, but they don't fit that well. They also broke and I lost the sound in one of the ears but was able to get it replaced for free without any issues. Unfortunately, my new pair also started having the same issue after only a few months.. It seemed like one of the connecting wires broke inside both times, as one ear was great, they other would turn on/off as I just wiggled the wires.",B01G8JO5F2
"The ear wires don't have any spring -- you wrap the wire behind your ear every time, and the shape pulls out with every little tug on the wire. The housing on the side with the controls falls open continually, and after a couple of weeks, the connection failed completely so one side still sounds great but the other is dead. I've had these about a month.",B01G8JO5F2
They are very comfortable and the battery lasts more that what you’d expect.,B01G8JO5F2
This is a Christmas gift.,B01G8JO5F2
It sounds awesome and is great quality for the price!,B01G8JO5F2
"if you move 20 ft from sofa ,it cuts out and off. Very limited distance.",B01G8JO5F2
This thing worked ok for a bit but quality control is definitely an issue. The sound cuts in and out when it gets windy which isn’t a HUGE deal but the straw that broke the camels back wasn’t when I pressed the on button one day and it just depressed permenantly. The button literally sunk in and didnt pop back out. I tried my best to pry it out but it was useless. Needless to say these are now trash.,B01G8JO5F2
"Not as expected, sound was not that good and not very comfortable. I dont recommend",B01G8JO5F2
"So far these are the most comfortable buds for my small ear holes!  Rating how well they stay in my ears, I give them an 8.5 out of 10.  Quality is great and they are comfortable.",B01G8JO5F2
Updated my 5 star review. This product stopped working exactly one month after purchase.,B01G8JO5F2
"I see allot of politically correct reviews about different products. This is not one of those. To cut to it, these headphones will beat your brains out for several hours straight all while cancelling the outside world. If you want no $#!+ headphones then buy these. The only complaint I have is that my cat keeps eating them. Please stop putting katnip in them. Thank you.",B01G8JO5F2
Works great and love the accessories,B01G8JO5F2
Audio system is not good,B01G8JO5F2
"Good battery life, good sound, good price. I've used them and abused them for almost a year now. Thrown around in my gym bag, lots of sweat, bent out of shape several times. For the price, I think they're hard to beat.",B01G8JO5F2
I alternate between the two devices I ordered when I watch tv. I am hard of hearing and can enjoy the higher volume without bothering anyone else.Great product,B01G8JO5F2
"I do not reccomend these at all!<br />Really disappointed to have these quit working on third use, after diligently keeping them dry before charging, as other users suggested. I guess you get what you pay for!",B01G8JO5F2
Very good for music and talking just like a phone.,B01G8JO5F2
You get what you pay for but pay some more and get a better one,B01G8JO5F2
"I like it easy to use,good quality,so far so good,hopefully will last longer,I like the 1 year warranty",B01G8JO5F2
Great headphones for the price. I was surprised by the sound quality.,B01G8JO5F2
"I bought a set of Senso S250 earbuds back in March of 2018. It has been great for working out, for travel, listening to music at work. I highly recommend the memory foam ones.<br /><br />Last week my earbuds just stopped charging. They would turn on, connect, work, but could not connect to any of the micro USB chargers I had. I reached out to customer service around 6:45am on Thursday morning, and by the next Monday I had a new pair in my hands. Quick, easy, and courteous service.<br /><br />I love these earbuds and would have gladly bought a second pair, but the 1 year warranty awarded me a pair to replace the non-charging ones. Just in time for another trip! Those memory foam earbuds are great for airplane pressure and sound blocking!",B01G8JO5F2
It works,B01G8JO5F2
As advertised!,B01G8JO5F2
"Extremely uncomfortable. They look nice but they hurt my ears, I tried all the different tips and they didn’t make a difference. She. You bend it to fit over your ear it doesn’t hold that shape at all. The wire inside is super pliable and it wouldn’t stay on unless I crimped it as close to my ear as possible (which was uncomfortable). Not having a remote on the wire was a bit confusing and an adjustment. For calls I’ve been told that it’s difficult for the receiver to hear me when I am using these. The mic is within the bud. I accidentally called several people because a certain pattern of presses will redial the last number. Maybe I could’ve adjusted and looked past all this if the sound quality were at least good. Perhaps this pair has a defect, I don’t know, but there is a constant crackling in the background of all the audio. It’s quiet, like a crinkling, almost static noise. On the breaks between songs or calls/ when I pause a video to walk somewhere it’s there and it drives me nuts.",B01G8JO5F2
Excellent quality sound and also came with a perfect case and a dozen replacement earbuds.,B01G8JO5F2
Easy to install,B01G8JO5F2
Best Value,B01G8JO5F2
"Sound pretty decent,  noise cancelling is so so.. Very uncomfortable so far.",B01G8JO5F2
These headphones are amazing. I like the way the part that wraps around your ear can be adjusted to secure to your ear better. They're very comfortable and easy to connect.,B01G8JO5F2
"I repurchased this way ago, and I must say this product is pretty durable. The sound quality is excellent under that budget — overall satisfied.",B01G8JO5F2
These are not swimming headphones despite appearing under tags for waterproof and swimming. They are decent $20 headphones if you are active but look elsewhere for water proof/swimming head phones,B01G8JO5F2
This are a nice and cheap solution when you're in a bind and need a set of wireless headphones. But I have purchased them twice now and they've stopped working each time after a few months. Haven't tried out the warranty but will give that a go.,B01G8JO5F2
"Love this product have had it for so long and it still works like a charm.  Couldn't have bought anything better and cheaper this this product.  In the gym, on the rail, at home or at work this product is good to use.",B01G8JO5F2
"Sound quality is good for sports earphones that use Bluetooth. I felt that the sound tends to have a slight favor toward treble and is weak in regards to the bass, especially at the higher volumes, but, I have definitely have use far worse earphones.<br />The ear looks are very comfortable and have a great degree of flexibility toward fitting around various ear shapes, same goes for the three different sized ear heads.<br />Battery life is good and last me a couples days for my use case, 4-5 hr/day.<br />The noise cancellation feature, I haven't really noticed it, outside what I would expect from having headphones in.<br />Have not had to deal with high moisture situation yet, will update once such a situation occurs.",B01G8JO5F2
"The earpiece is somewhat uncomfortable for me because it tangles with my curly hair but otherwise fine, it does adjust properly to the ear and does not hurt. I don't think they will fall out while exercising (I bought these for work and haven't used them while moving much) and sound is clear for me BUT the mic does NOT work and I need to take them of (and untangle from my hair) to make/take calls because people can't hear me instead of just switching between calls and music.",B01G8JO5F2
Cheap quality,B01G8JO5F2
Husband has been using them for awhile and seems to really enjoy them and says the quality is really good. Easy to work out with.,B01G8JO5F2
Looses connection constantly,B01G8JO5F2
I have gotten two pairs and both have broken. Very disappointed.,B01G8JO5F2
"I absolutely love these, they will work all day on one charge. My only complaint is the sound quality while talking on the phone, people say I sound like I'm in a tunnel.",B01G8JO5F2
"Nothing but mid range sound, absolutely horrid.",B01G8JO5F2
Not fit well,B01G8JO5F2
"Lightweight, good sound quality, good noise cancellation",B01G8JO5F2
"Bought these to replace a set that I had for almost a year; they were great but I didn't use the carry case that was included (instead just stuffed them in my pocket when I went to the gym) so eventually a wire wore out.  I'll use the case with these new ones!<br />These headphones give very good sound quality and have outstanding battery life. Pairing is a snap and the connection distance is very far - I've had times I left my phone on an equipment and walked almost to the other end of a large gym building before I lost connection and knew I had left it.<br />The only negative I have, and this may be true of any earbuds, is that when walking outside, wind noise almost overcomes the audio being delivered by the earphones.",B01G8JO5F2
"For the price, these work great until they break.  I used mine frequently over the span of about 12-18 months and then they break and won't turn on.  I bought a second pair and the same thing happened. If you expect these to work for multiple years I reccomend a different brand.",B01G8JO5F2
"I wanted headphones for streaming and playing music. I tried regular earphones but no matter how cushioned they are they begin to hurt my ears within an hour. Didn't realize I could buy wireless earbuds, but then I found these. The price was right so I bought them and glad I did. The sound is very good, the distance is great (I can go anywhere in the house and still hear what I'm listening to) and they last a long time. They are very comfortable, there are several options to choose from to fit my ears comfortably. They also paired easily and charged quickly. Everything can be stored in the carry case. I definitely would purchase these again.",B01G8JO5F2
Would not charge properly and died in mid-use when supposedly fully charged.  Odd delay in taking almost a minute of holding the on button to turn the headset on.  Do not buy this product.,B01G8JO5F2
Compact and good quality. I have two,B01G8JO5F2
I bought a pair and it was going well until the charging port wouldn't accept a charge. I contacted the company and they sent me a new pair. The 2nd pair worked fine but now it shuts off after 30 seconds despite having 100% battery life. I noticed that the cords looked like they were spliced and you can see the wires which is funny since I took good care of my headphones. These were good at first but now I have no choice but to toss them out.,B01G8JO5F2
"They worked great at first, then after about 6 weeks of normal use the left speaker stopped working completely.  I could wiggle the wires a bit to make it play for a little while, then it just stopped entirely.",B01G8JO5F2
Great product and highly recommend,B01G8JO5F2
These work perfectly for me when I work out. Great product!,B01G8JO5F2
Good,B01G8JO5F2
Was able to use and enjoyed,B01G8JO5F2
They have been great and the sound is very good,B01G8JO5F2
"I planned to listen to recorded tour guide comments as I explored Ancient Rome and the Vatican City. Wireless headphones seemed like a good idea so I could keep my iPhone hidden in a pocket as I moved through the tourist sites. These headphones were the perfect answer to my wishes. I was pleasantly surprised that they worked so well. I used the headphones to control the narrative volume and to pause the narrative while I took photos or discussed the details of a site with others in my group. I also used them on the plane to/from Italy as well, where the noise cancelling feature was put to the acid test. All for a very low price. I am very satisfied! Julius Caesar never had it this good! Et tu, Brute?",B01G8JO5F2
"great item for the price, the battery lasts a decent amount of time as well. the range could be better but isn't bad.",B01G8JO5F2
"I have only used them four times. I tried to charge them, but they don't seem to charge. They don't even turn on after trying to charge them. Many usar with the same problem",B01G8JO5F2
"These headphones are awesome. What's my second set but the last set lasted for 2 years. I use them 7 days a week for 2 1/2 to 4 hours a day in the gym. They stay in place, sound great and they are unaffected by sweat. they are also a great price.",B01G8JO5F2
I have had these for 2 months and used them every single night in the gym and have loved them since. I haven't had any problems with them and they dont get in my way while I workout. Personally suggest getting them for their price and the fact they come with 3 different sized earbuds. I love the earbuds that are moldable to your ear canal! Over all 5 out of 5 I love these so much!!,B01G8JO5F2
These were Awful and didn’t even work. Returned them.,B01G8JO5F2
"Big fan of the headphones for the price. I actually loved them soo much i got a second pair. I use one in the office when i want to zone people out. I have a home pair that I use on runs, working out, jumping rope. They are fantastic. Pros: Battery life is about 8hrs, $17!, easy to connect, show battery on my phone. Con/Neutral: The band that goes around your ear is a bit too bendy. This is not necessarily a bad thing,  but i wish it was a little stiffer. I would definitely recommend these.",B01G8JO5F2
"What do you expect from cheap garbage from Amazon?  Well I go news for you, you get what you pay for.  Yes, this junk will stay on your ear.  Big deal, they have a bendable ear clip which I guarantee will break in 30 days.  So the good point is they stay on your ear, the bad news is that the sound is as horrible as you’d expect from such cheap junk.",B01G8JO5F2
"First off, there is 0 noise cancelling in this device. It is an earbud that has a mic that is all.<br />The sound is pretty good for what it is. I wear them while running and get a lot of wind noise somewhere on the device.<br />The battery life is about 4-6 hours<br />It comes with a case but I wish the case was hard because they get activated often with random pressure due to the case and their shape. If it were a hard case this would be eliminated. I wouldnt recommend storing in a pocket or bag.<br />Definitely a good buy for workouts.",B01G8JO5F2
Every other headphone I've used has died in one ear or stopped working after a short time. These lasteed over 2 years and only needed replacement because I slammed one in the car door and crushed it.,B01G8JO5F2
"I am three weeks outside the warranty period and these won’t turn on anymore.  They worked fine until they all of a sudden quit working.  At first, I thought the battery was dead, but they still don’t turn on with a full charge.  I won’t buy them again.",B01G8JO5F2
"after about  10 usage power button falls and to power it on, you need to open the whole mechanism and press the little dot manually, then close it again. :)",B01G8JO5F2
"I really like these earphones. They work super well, last super long and look great. I have had no issues with these earphones and love using them at the gym, or just when walking around!",B01G8JO5F2
I have an earlier version of this same product and the volume is much greater and for someone who is hard of hearing it make a poor quality of a ear buds.,B01G8JO5F2
Very good quality headphones!,B01G8JO5F2
Great sound and convenient to use.,B01G8JO5F2
"Like many headphones, you can change the part that goes into the ear. Most are normal rubber like. One is softer, more like foam ear plugs. It doesn't make my ears sore after using it for long periods of time.",B01G8JO5F2
"If I were writing this review 5 years ago it would be 5 stars. My original pair recently broke so I figured I'd get the same ones again. The quality was amazing up until the end, they only broke because I tore the wore by accident.<br /><br />Something at the factory changed big time, there's a noticeable drop in sound quality plus the part that wraps around your ear doesn't bend anymore making it basically pointless. Such a shame, I thought I could keep faith in this company but they seem to be cutting corners and running their brand name into the dirt to make some easy money before going bankrupt. Stay away!",B01G8JO5F2
Great noise cancellation,B01G8JO5F2
Good for working out and cleaning house but starts cutting out if I walk more than 15 feet away from my phone.,B01G8JO5F2
"These earbuds have a good distance,  even through walls",B01G8JO5F2
Great product,B01G8JO5F2
Very comfortable. Sound is awesome. Mic works great.,B01G8JO5F2
Fit's nice and sound quality is good.,B01G8JO5F2
Still going strong a year later. Great sound. Great price.,B01G8JO5F2
They were a gift and I know the person who received them uses them quite a bit and no complaints.,B01G8JO5F2
"Tried a couple different headphones. For the price, these are the best! Love the adjustable ear piece. Helps with keeping them in the ears. All headphones with the plug in earpiece do come out, especially when you are eating or moving around a lot. But these do stay in really good!",B01G8JO5F2
"By far the BEST headphones I have owned!! For me, I think these are better than the 🍎. Js! 5 ⭐️ Now if y’all would make them completely wireless I would be in heaven!",B01G8JO5F2
I can not believe these are as good as they are for the price. Can't be beat.,B01G8JO5F2
"My husband has two of these that he has had for over a year.  He uses them in the jacquzzi and has had no issues with the moisture.  I tried using one during my daily walk to listen to podcasts.  It worked so well that I ordered my own that I could keep charged and paired with my phone.  The sound is clear. It has just enough noise cancellation that I'm not too distracted by outside noises, but not so much that I'm in danger of being hit by a car.  I think there is another model that is more noise-cancelling, but being as I want to be aware of my surroundings when I walk, this is perfect for me.  The ear loops can be bent to fit, and I have had minimal problems with the ear pieces falling out.  I never notice the connecting wire when I'm wearing it.  I charge them after my 90-minute walk, although they probably could keep working longer.  I would buy them again without hesitation.",B01G8JO5F2
sound is decent & i did not have any trouble connecting to bluetooth switching from device to device. i would buy again,B01G8JO5F2
"If I were writing this review 5 years ago it would be 5 stars. My original pair recently broke so I figured I'd get the same ones again.

Such a shame, I thought I could keep faith in this company but they seem to be cutting corners and running their brand name into the dirt to make some easy money before going bankrupt. Stay away!",B01G8JO5F2
"I love them, but they stopped working after less than 4 months. My last pair lasted two years (longer than any headphone I have ever owned), which is why I purchased another pair. I think I may just have a bad set and will need to use my warranty.",B01G8JO5F2
I liked the previous version of these. The mold-able ear support feel cheap and don't stay the molded position long.<br />The noise cancellation doesn't seem to be as good either.,B01G8JO5F2
They are great!,B01G8JO5F2
For the price the sound quality is outstanding. They don't really have too much is at all noise cancellation themselves. If you use the ear plug inserts for the ears then you can get some noise cancellation.,B01G8JO5F2
My adult son's very pleased with these..can wear and easily hear others without removal. Fits ears with no irritation. Sound quality is very good. Very pleased with this stocking stuffer! Excellent buy!!,B01G8JO5F2
Very good.,B01G8JO5F2
"For this price point, these ear buds are unbelievable. Unparalleled battery life versus anything you can get at Walmart, and the sound quality leaves nothing to be desired. Yeah, if you are an audiophile you can probably find some better sounding ear buds but no where near at this price. I have had these buds for over a year now and they are my tried and true pair whether I am going out to eat, going to an event, or even during work. They double exceptionally well as a way to answer phone calls while in public with their intuitive and easy to use controls. You can even skip a song by pressing the volume ""+"" button twice!",B01G8JO5F2
These are amazing! They have great sound and are comfortable. I have bought two pairs and want to but one for each of my kids as well.,B01G8JO5F2
Great head phones. They work better than the expensive brands. Also great customer service when needed!,B01G8JO5F2
sound quality is very poor. not happy with it,B01G8JO5F2
My wife and I use these earphones for exercising. They are great! They latch onto your ears so they stay in place while jogging and doing different kinds of workout.,B01G8JO5F2
Estoy altamente satisfecho con este audífono me encanta el sonido nítido  es muy cómodo de usar y la duración de la batería cumple con lo prometido. Su  nitidez en el sonido es inigualable,B01G8JO5F2
So far so good.  Thank you for the extras.had them for a while and they fit my small ears perfect.<br />Sounds great,B01G8JO5F2
Muy rápido y muy bueno!!!<br />Súper recomendado!!!,B01G8JO5F2
Love them easy on my bike rides,B01G8JO5F2
Good sound and grips the ears really well when I’m working out or doing projects around the house,B01G8JO5F2
"These are not sweatproof. I used these when outside mowing the lawn and doing yard work (I live in FL and it’s summer). I also used them when I work out. I work out hard and sweat a lot. They worked the first 10 times or so, but now they continually cut off (with a full battery) and won’t turn back on until they’ve dried out. I bought these as a cheaper alternative to the Plantronics Backbeat Fit earphones that I had previously (which died after a few years). I bought these in July; it’s only September and they’re already malfunctioning. Spend the extra $25 on the Plantronics earphones. Superior sound and actually sweatproof!",B01G8JO5F2
"The headphones are great for their price! They have lasted me a long time, and I absolutely adore these Bluetooth headphones!",B01G8JO5F2
"It is okay product for the beginners. I bought it for my Delta flight overseas, but I definitely don't hear HD sound through these Senso headphones. The quality of the sound is good, but on scale from 1 - 5, I'd give it a 3+",B01G8JO5F2
"Love these! These are my third pair. I use these 5 days week and take a shower with them on afterwards. They have improved the quality and the addition of adjustable “ear straps” is nice since my first pair. Their customer service is ASTOUNDING! After 3 months, my first pair went bad and they immediately replaced them without me asking. They just read my review. That second pair lasted for over a year. You may think, “only a Year?!” But I wear them 4-5 times a week for an two hours in sun, rain and snow. I only wear one bud while biking so the other dangles under my shirt so it is bound to break from the extra pull. My third pair suddenly stopped working and I emailed them about the issue. Within a day they answered back with a diagnosis and fix. Perfect! My only problem it sometimes can skip once in a while while I shower. I wonder if it is something to do with moisture sneaking in. I mean, really they weren’t built to take a shower with.",B01G8JO5F2
They stopped working within 30 days. I wouldn’t buy them. They aren’t worth the hassle.,B01G8JO5F2
Still the best for your money. On my second pair because I smashed one in the car door.,B01G8JO5F2
Didn’t like cause they shut off while swimming thought they were for swimming but not apparently.,B01G8JO5F2
Happy,B01G8JO5F2
Awesome earphones for the gym.  I’m definitely happy I didn’t overpay just to get a brand name,B01G8JO5F2
I purchased 2 sets of these headphones for my daughter and I to use with Aqua Exercise. They don’t pick up Pandora very well. Lots of static. Left bud keeps going out all together on BOTH headsets. Acts like there is a “short” because music goes in and out even with phone close to headset  This happens on BOTH. The piece that slips around ears keeps slipping off and bud doesn’t fit ears properly even with switching bud pieces. Would NOT recommend these. Very disappointed.,B01G8JO5F2
N/A,B01G8JO5F2
"At first I thought it was just one pair that happened to get wet or something, so of course I bough a second pair. With in two months of using it the second pair also stopped working. Out of the blue will not charge will not turn on its crazy. This company should be banned.",B01G8JO5F2
The earbuds came as described and arrived as promised. I really liked the case they came with along with the other couple of things. I appreciated  the ear hooks were able to be made tighter around my ears. So far I have really enjoyed them!,B01G8JO5F2
"Excellent product, easy pairing and good sound quality you got your money's worth.",B01G8JO5F2
Best headset for the price!!,B01G8JO5F2
They hooked on my ear really good. The sound is great and clear. The battery last longer than the ones I previously owned.,B01G8JO5F2
"Using the headphones for meetings, video calls and conference calls.They work pretty well with the sound quality and levels of audio",B01G8JO5F2
Works great for me... love to use at the gym.,B01G8JO5F2
"I love these headphones, this is the second pair I bought. I lost the first pair and I would buy them again in a heart beat. Great sound and great price. Amazing product!!!! A+++",B01G8JO5F2
For the price point it’s a spectacular deal and product. Got them today. Worn them a few hours straight out of the box and didn’t have to charge. Sound is decent but remember the price point. I’m satisfied,B01G8JO5F2
Sounds great and awesome for workoutouts,B01G8JO5F2
Did not even charged battery the first time I tried it<br />Amazon is selling this Item which is a piece of garbage and is asking a high price for it,B01G8JO5F2
"I'm way behind the times.... And these are my first pair of Bluetooth earbuds.<br />All I knew was that I wanted to vac the house and listen to music without having to carry my phone/with old school audio jack earbuds plugged in... Lol.<br />I figured sports style ones would be hassle free (not fall out easily, have the cord to prevent falling to ground).<br />I couldn't be more impressed. The countless positive reviews about this item are accurate (and certainly more detailed about the tech aspects than I know about)... Lol.<br />I'd highly recommend! Either for yourself or to gift. The box they came in was high end, packaging was stellar. The storage case is well made and really set this product apart from other similar earbuds. A small mesh pocket within case securely holds all the additional earbuds included. They included bonus gifts like a cellphone mount (magnet) and a cellphone pocket (to attach to cellphone to hold money or credit card). As for comfort/sound... I'm no expert. But they are quite secure and have excellent sound quality...even over the sound of my vacuum! Lol...",B01G8JO5F2
Mal esta vez me dalio más caro avia comprado uno antes y este no trae cable USB y no trae gomitas de repuestos,B01G8JO5F2
"Purchased item back in May 2018, had to replace them in August 2018 as they no longer worked, about a month and a half ago, they no longer worked again.  Tried to get a replacement as the replacement headphones was shipped in mid August and would have thought the warrenty would be good but Tekatron said no.  I would not buy this product again as I purchased two sets and both are no longer working.",B01G8JO5F2
"One of the best Bluetooth headphone I ever used, and I tried many, only thing is, after using it for 5-7 hours it starts irritating my ear.",B01G8JO5F2
terrible connectivity but what do you expect,B01G8JO5F2
"This is my second pair. For the price, they are solid, sound great and I will continue to purchase them.",B01G8JO5F2
No complaints,B01G8JO5F2
"The fact that these headphones are under $25 is ridiculous! The noise cancellation on these guys are insane. The sound quality is great. Although the sound quality could be a little better, for sub $25, the sound quality is an absolute steal. I have owned a pair of Beats Headphones in the past and these are honestly comparable in terms of noise cancellation, if not better, but the Senso headphones are a little inferior to Beats in terms of sound quality. Taking into consideration the price point and the quality of Senso headphones, I would buy these over any other headphones in a heart beat.<br />WARRANTY: The right earbud just recently stopped working after about 5 months, but the customer service team responded quickly and was able to offer me a replacement pair in about 20 minutes time after exchanging e-mails. Great service and a great product. Highly recommend.",B01G8JO5F2
I went through 4 pairs of Bose headphones before discovering these babies. It’s been 2 years and I just purchased my second pair of senso headphones last week. The first pair broke from wear and tear. I go to the gym 5-6 days a week and sweat profusely. I love that I can’t hear anything when I wear them. These have never let me down and never fallen off.,B01G8JO5F2
Not worth it. The quality is bad.,B01G8JO5F2
I bought these mostly to listen to podcasts while walking- they are just fine for that application.,B01G8JO5F2
Bought these in Oct 7 2017. It’s now Jan 22 2019 and they still work great.<br />-Good sound<br />-Bluetooth<br />-Doesn’t hurt ears<br />-good battery life<br />-easy to clean,B01G8JO5F2
"Good sound quality for the price although fake waterproof, took one shower with it and that is it, not working. Pretty disappointed.",B01G8JO5F2
Very impressed and happy with overall quality,B01G8JO5F2
"The ""wings"" on these that are supposed to keep them in place are pretty much useless. It's made of a flimsy, pliable plastic and never keeps its shape. You'll feel it flopping around on the top of your ear if you move at all. I finally took a pair of scissors and cut them off entirely.",B01G8JO5F2
Great product,B01G8JO5F2
The sound is great,B01G8JO5F2
"I purchased the wireless headphone in April 2018.  The product worked well until earlier this month (May 2019), when the left side no longer played audio.<br /><br />I contacted Senso’s customer service, who instructed me to perform a factory reset.  I do so several times; however, the left side still didn’t sync or play audio.<br /><br />Senso informed me that it has been 12 months since I purchased their product, so they couldn’t provide a replacement.  I was provided a 5% (five percent) discount code for purchasing another set of Senso headphones instead, so that’s something..",B01G8JO5F2
sound quality is pretty good.,B01G8JO5F2
"Haven’t used these in the gym yet, the reason I purchased them.  I have talked on the phone using them and was told audio was very clear.  I’ll be checking out the different size ear pieces as One ear got a bit sore while talking on the phone (about an hour).",B01G8JO5F2
Good sound,B01G8JO5F2
They worked great for about a month and got progressively worse until they finally stopped working completely.,B01G8JO5F2
Great headphones at a great price!,B01G8JO5F2
These things are the best. Super happy with my purchase.,B01G8JO5F2
"This product worked great a few times. After about 6 months of use, the audio cuts out for about 2 seconds and returns. I just ignored it intially thinking it was my bluetooth connection but lately it has been happening almost every 20 seconds.<br />I cannot use it anymore.",B01G8JO5F2
This are not noise cancelling earphones. One cannot notice the difference between having them turned off and turned on. Street noise or any other kind of noise is the same.,B01G8JO5F2
Used headphones for a week and the right ear went out. They were good until then.,B01G8JO5F2
"Works great, easy to link to phone, Tom of size options for ear buds, nice case, long battery life, great for the gym",B01G8JO5F2
They work well.  Only complaint is the low battery warning keeps repeating every minute.,B01G8JO5F2
They fit really well and sounds really good.,B01G8JO5F2
I bought it on October. Every thing is ok but right side works only now. Worthless! thank,B01G8JO5F2
"Love these!  Got them a couple days ago and this morning was my first gym workout with them.  Very freeing to not be tethered to my phone.  They are truly noise canceling, and very comfortable to wear.  Too soon to tell about the battery life.  Easy set up, paired quickly and easily with my phone.  My husband liked the sound so much he is going to get a pair himself.",B01G8JO5F2
I’m doing this for a free arm band,B01G8JO5F2
"I liked the package it was very well packaged, and it looks like a higher quality headphone",B01G8JO5F2
"For the price, you can't beat these wireless headphones.  My boyfriend uses them.  He says the base is awesome and sound quality is good overall.  The only downside to these headphones is the way it sits in his ear.  He says they keep falling out.  I don't think it's the headphones, I think my boyfriend has weird ears because only certain type earpieces fit him. Overall, you can't go wrong buying them.",B01G8JO5F2
They are working great. I wear them everyday during my workouts.,B01G8JO5F2
I love it! good quality and the sound good.,B01G8JO5F2
It’s good. Does what it claims to. Didn’t personally notice sound cancellation. But it’s better than some of the others on the market for the same price. Someone else said it best: don’t spend more on another set claiming to do the same things these do. It’s not worth it. Just buy these.,B01G8JO5F2
"Since I cant find anywhere to contact the seller, I will leave feedback this way.  Look what happened after just 6 or so weeks of use!  I would like them replaced if the seller sees this!",B01G8JO5F2
"Affordable and functional. Good bass response. Fits kind of weird over the ear but adjustable (unless I'm using them wrong. The arm doesn't hang over the ear from the back, it does from the front. Strange, but it works and is fairly comfortable).<br /><br />I accidentally left them on overnight and they were still on in the morning indicating a long battery life. However, I wish they had auto shutoff if they go for several minutes without audio).<br /><br />Happy with the purchase. I haven't used them as a phone headset so I cannot comment on microphone pickup or quality. I imagine they will be okay, but can't say.<br /><br />As for noise cancellation... not sure if they mean because you can use them to plug up the ear canal or if they actually produce frequencies that cancel outside noises. I'm going to guess because you can use them as earplugs. Either way, didn't buy them to cancel out outside noise and I don't know if that works or not.<br /><br />Happy with purchase. Glad I bought 'em. :)",B01G8JO5F2
Love it,B01G8JO5F2
Easy to charge..love the case..LOVE THE CLARITY OF AUDIO.. I LOVE THE COLOR RED... The length of the wire was just the right length so was not to be cumbersome.,B01G8JO5F2
The button on mine just stopped working one day. I left a review before and i need them to get in touch with me so we can sort this out. These are a great pair of headphones and i like them a lot but i cant do anything with them because the button to turn it on or off is stuck in place.,B01G8JO5F2
"Had them for a few months and they worked well during that time. I thought the sound was good and they fit well. After a few months, they just stopped working. I've learned not to go cheap on earbuds, you are better off getting a reliable pair for more.",B01G8JO5F2
I use these primarily when I mow my lawn.  I keep my phone in my pocket so that I have ready access to my music or if someone should call.  If I turn my head to the right I lose Bluetooth connection and if I turn my head to the left I lose Bluetooth connection.  So basically the distance from the sending source is critical.  If my phone is right next to the headphones it's flawless.  More than 3 feet away and it disconnects.,B01G8JO5F2
"did not meet expectations, couldn't find a ear piece that seems to stay in ear. part that goes around ear seem to loose shape/setting ,if you will. Tried for a month then noticed return window was closed  ...LESS THAN 30 DAYS ALOWED 1/24-2/22 PRETTY BAD",B01G8JO5F2
Bien,B01G8JO5F2
Greetings!  Very pleased with the service. Great product!,B01G8JO5F2
Great product,B01G8JO5F2
Sound quality is excellent. Easy to use. Would recommend highly.,B01G8JO5F2
"Im sick and tired of BS reviews that promote items to a level they dont meet - these headphones are as good a money as i have spent on ways to play music in the gym. I have trouble keeping them in my ear canal but that is my problem as I have had this with every headphone/earbud ive ever owned. perfect bluetooth connection each and every time, great battery life and better than average sound quality",B01G8JO5F2
Great for price,B01G8JO5F2
These are hands down the best earbuds I’ve ever owned. The BASS is Astounding !!!!,B01G8JO5F2
"Too big for my ears, wouldn’t stay in place just sitting still so I didn’t even try working out with them. Not really a quality problem-I just have small ears. Otherwise sound was good. Gave them to a friend who loves them!",B01G8JO5F2
I bought these for the gym and they are really great. The sound is amazing and noise cancellation is perfect. These are just as good as any other brand out there.,B01G8JO5F2
"I had these since 2017 and they just now stopped working (2022)! That's pretty good for a product that's $25. Can't complain, just ordered a replacement pair!",B01G8JO5F2
I love the way they fit.,B01G8JO5F2
Great! No more bugging the household with loud music etc.  Love these things. I get 4 and 5 hour IV's at the doctors periodically and I can jam on to my phones playlist without disturbing the nurses or other patients.,B01G8JO5F2
"Great headphones for even better price. Bluetooth to my phone for music. Works great for that but when phone calls come thru, the sound and voice coming thru isn’t very clear and hard to have a conversation using this headset",B01G8JO5F2
"Ordered them Sunday morning, had them Sunday night. Used them all evening. Great sound. Very impressed given their price. Added goodies too. Magnetic cellphone holder. Nice! Highly recommend.",B01G8JO5F2
"Product came fast works great""",B01G8JO5F2
"These do exactly what I wanted them for, listening to the television later at night. Once paired they stay paired very well. I tried disconnecting them from the tv Transmitter to use with my phone but could not accomplish the task. Maybe that could be highlighted in the next instructions that Senso prints out. However I have no repairing issues. These are connected!",B01G8JO5F2
"Great earbuds that sounds awesome, unfortunately they just quit working after a few months. No visible damage or no mishandling they’ll just quit working.",B01G8JO5F2
"I have had the headphones for about 18 months. I was happy with them, until now. Recently, the headphones just began to shut off after a few minutes of use. I tried several resets, but the issue continues.<br />So, if you don't mind replacing headphones within a couple of years, these are for you. If you are looking for headphones that are not disposable, think twice about purchasing these.",B01G8JO5F2
Good,B01G8JO5F2
If they had been magnetic and announced battery life they would be perfect,B01G8JO5F2
"I’ve owned two pair of these senso Bluetooth headphones and each died after nine months. Suspect product quality where both devices failed to take a charge.<br /><br />To the positive, the fit, sound quality and ability to stay in place during my workouts was entirely acceptable. But to fail so quickly— twice — is unacceptable and leaves this product rated 1 star. (First pair 1/2/2018, second pair 9/23/18).",B01G8JO5F2
I’ve learned that I can fast forward or rewind to the next music track,B01G8JO5F2
"The only I found kinda hard to adjust to, is the way the headphones wrap around the ear.",B01G8JO5F2
The headphones no longer work and have only been used for 3 months!,B01G8JO5F2
Son incomodos y cuando se corre se escucha el sonido del impacto del aire,B01G8JO5F2
The first one i purchased lasted 10 months before the battery went dead and the replacement pair only lasted 3 months.  Spend your money elsewhere.,B01G8JO5F2
please get a warranty with product  these ear buds and all brand types  after 45 days battery goes dead not rechargeable  after  purchasing  4-5 different types . they all have short life battery life. unfortunetly you cant remove or replace batterys. Hopefully they make some types in future you can .Looks like were not there yet. Good luck  beware buyers.,B01G8JO5F2
I used this maybe 10 times and suddenly the battery went from a good 45 mins to less than 5. Even charging overnight the battery started claiming low battery within minutes and died before I made it to the gym. Garbage.,B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these headphones because they had good reviews, specially for the fact that reviews said they were good for fitting small ears and great for working out.<br /><br />I have very small ears and these headphones fit very uncomfortably, despite there being three different sizes to choose from.<br /><br />Also, when working out, specifically running the cord in the back is very long so it bounces up and down which is really annoying.<br /><br />Overall, I would not purchase again.",B01G8JO5F2
they're ok for the price. i don't think the volume buttons work any longer. sound ain't great but they're fine for the gym. don't expect great sound from these.,B01G8JO5F2
"Very quality item, so good sound, the bass is awesome, battery is good.",B01G8JO5F2
These are the best headphones I’ve bought in terms of price for quality. On my 3rd set and will buy again if I lose these or they break (first set lasted about a year after daily HEAVY use). No complaints.,B01G8JO5F2
"""I had read that these were excellent earphones for the money and that is correct! The set up is easy, sound is crisp and clear and they fit well, with several earpiece options. I work a lot in a wood shop and a pleasant surprise with these is the noise canceling earpieces that are also comfortable. I can not recommend these enough!""",B01G8JO5F2
"The quality overall seems to be good. The sound quality is alright, and they have a good Bluetooth connection, but wearing them over your ears is very uncomfortable. I tried the different ear tips, but still it feels loose and like it's going to fall out of your ear. The hook doesn't seem to do anything since it doesn't really rest on your ear all that much, at least on my ears. I'm going to return it to Amazon and look for headphones with a different design.",B01G8JO5F2
Real bummer. Wanted these for running but they don't pair with iPhone 7. Now I need to drive to repackage and then drive to a return location to ship back and find another device that does work as advertised. Very disappointed.,B01G8JO5F2
I bought these for my husband for Christmas and he loves them.  Easy to use.,B01G8JO5F2
"I just bought my 2nd pair b/c my first pair continued to work well over a couple years despite a decent amount of abuse, until my dog got to them. I try to avoid using bluetooth when possible, but it's often the best option for workouts.",B01G8JO5F2
Pros: Sound quality is great for the price range.  They fit comfortable and are perfect for any type of exercise you do.  I could not believe how great they were once I took them out and put them on.  Too good to be true.<br /><br />Cons: After less than two months of use the headphones are completely dead and won't even charge.  The LED light won't turn on.  The only charger used on the headphones was the one it came with.  I also have a pair of Jaybirds that I purchased over three years ago and they are still going strong. At the end of the day you get what you pay for.,B01G8JO5F2
"These headphones are great. I use these for mountain biking and running all the time. I bought two pairs.  One as a gift and one for me. The battery stopped charging on me,  it happens, their customer service immediately replaced them....with ease.  I would recommend this company and headphones",B01G8JO5F2
"I'm a distance runner so I rely on music to keep me occupied.  The first thing I noticed was the sound was not so clear. It was slightly muffled.  The first time I used it I was out for 2 hours and the battery was fine. The second use after charging they died after 10 mins of being turned on. The 3rd try, I noticed the battery wouldn't fully charge (only reached 70% after plugged in overnight) and they died again after only 10 mins.<br /><br />I contacted the company and they told me to reset the earbuds, so I did but to no avail, I contacted the company a second time and no response, so I returned the defective item.",B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these headphones so I wouldn't have to hold my smartphone with my hands while out walking in the cold.  Unfortunately, this doesn't work so well.  Either the Bluetooth from my phone isn't strong enough or the receiver on this unit isn't strong enough to pick up the signal.  I still have to walk with my phone in my hand and my hand raised up a bit above waist height.  The volume on this unit is either too strong or too low.  There is a volume rocker (?), but I can't adjust the sound as I would like.  Usually when I am walking, I leave the earbuds out a bit from my ears so I can hear but I don't hurt my eardrums.  When I am inside and don't have to deal with outside noise, though, I the lower volume setting is just right.  I like that I am not attached by a wire to my smartphone.  Recently, I have begun using these with my new computer which has Bluetooth.  I am enjoying these earbuds.  I just wish I had a better connection to my smartphone while walking.  I don't know where the fault lies.",B01G8JO5F2
My son loves them.,B01G8JO5F2
love the sound quality but the batteries run down to fast,B01G8JO5F2
they were ok. didn't stay in my ear as good as I would have liked,B01G8JO5F2
Clips that hold buds to ears are too large,B01G8JO5F2
"Second pair - I lost the first pair and liked them so much, I ordered again. Love the new memory ear pieces that are like ear plugs - you squish them a little, put them in your ears, and then they expand to fill your ear canal. They are a little difficult to put on the actual headphones but worth the effort.",B01G8JO5F2
I love how they fit. Comfort.  Sound to me is great. Sometimes I feel that I am talking loudly for the phone . So I can be heard.,B01G8JO5F2
Product  arrived broken.  Unable to charge device due to charging attachment on earpiece pushed into earpiece.  Returning product for higher quality product.,B01G8JO5F2
"Good sound quality, wish it lasted more than a year.",B01G8JO5F2
"I don't usually write reviews. But I absolutely love the sound quality of these headphones.  I bought them for walking &  jogging in the pool.  I listen to smooth jazz & the sound is lush. I hear not only the main instuments but the background nuances too. The range is incredible even. The sound is full-bodied. I was surprised as the cost was so reasonable and they sound as good or better as the more expensive ones.<br />Cons: -Sometimes I have to keep adjusting to keep them comfortably on my ear.<br />-I keep hitting the off/on button when I try & adjust them. Due to where its located.<br />-I don't want to get out of the pool because music is sounding so darn good (that's more my problem)<br />Bottom line, well worth the price & you'll love the sound quality.",B01G8JO5F2
Cheap quality,B01G8JO5F2
They are a bit bulky but an incredible deal for the price,B01G8JO5F2
"Sound quality is good, but the bluetooth constantly loses connection for no reason on multiple devices, literally when the device is in your hand. If you raise your arms over the head, like doing pull ups at the gym, connection is gone. Not only does the connection to the bluetooth go out, sometimes the headphones turn off completely. If I could give 1 star I would. This problem began about 3-4 months ago. It would be nice if a full refund could be issued, because I'd expect headphones to last for more than 9 months.",B01G8JO5F2
Operates as advertised.  The earpieces hang well and provide a secure and good sounding connection as we walk.,B01G8JO5F2
"Great sound. Excellent noise cancellation. Great packaging and the added cellphone car mount was icing on cake. Oh, the cost was well worth it.",B01G8JO5F2
Stopped working after a month and looses connection when you are more than 10ft away from your phone.,B01G8JO5F2
"An earphone deserves such kind of price. However, not a good earphone.",B01G8JO5F2
Don't expect good mic quality. Other than that they are great.,B01G8JO5F2
This Bluetooth is not a good as described. The sound is horrible that people could not hear me if left phone in livingroom and went to kitchen or any other room without phone. You have to have phone close to you all time for better qualify sound. The port for charging was broken and not able to charge after one use. Returned to seller.,B01G8JO5F2
"Got this pair a month ago. The sound quality isn't bad for the price. One problem that I noticed is the Bluetooth connectivity. I use this both on my phone and watch, and on both I experience stutter in playing music even in close distances",B01G8JO5F2
We purchased two set of ear buds last spring.  One set stopped connecting to the iphone.  It was a breeze to receive a replacement set.  I would order from this company again based on my customer service experience.,B01G8JO5F2
"I did lots of comparisons before I purchased, I""m glad I did, excellent value !",B01G8JO5F2
Love these ear buds! Last all day at work. Stays in place and the different size ear pieces are made to fit me!,B01G8JO5F2
"I've had these headphones for about a year and they worked great - paired with my phone without issues, stayed in during workouts, and had decent sound quality. They aren't necessarily sound proof, but they worked for working out.<br /><br />The reason I'm giving it one star is because I plugged these in after a workout, and woke up to the headphones melted onto the charger. The headphones (as you can see in the images) came apart at the site of the port. My outlet and charger itself are fine and luckily this didn't start a fire, but this is definitely a safety hazard.<br /><br />Overall, I was content with the product, but this is definitely concerning.",B01G8JO5F2
Unit only works when the signal to the MP3 player (FM radio mode) is very strong.  Inside a building only static is heard.  Wired headphones work very well.  I'll do some more testing and possibly modify this review.,B01G8JO5F2
Using them at the gym. Other pair I used would fall out from sweat and no wrap around ear.,B01G8JO5F2
Very poor sound quality,B01G8JO5F2
"I thought I’d wear these while jogging, walking the dogs.  The distance between my hip pocket/ears is too great for these “wireless” headphones.  They only stay connected if you’re sitting still, and in close range.  I switched back to a more expensive apple product.  Sometimes you get what you pay for.",B01G8JO5F2
Love the adjustable ear wraps,B01G8JO5F2
Well these broke the moment I tried them on... so who knows how the sound quality is,B01G8JO5F2
I have a hearing problem in my left ear therefore these really help.,B01G8JO5F2
The  sound quality was ok but had trouble keeping the headphones on my ears even with the ear holders.,B01G8JO5F2
"2nd set I bought. 1st pair lasted two years. This set didn’t even last two weeks.<br />Just completely poor quality. The speaker part would always separate from rest of housing so rubber ear piece is just dangling.<br />The stupid flexible ear supports are trash. They have no strength to maintain the shape of your ear so are easily pulled off and aren’t durible at all.<br /><br />I just bought a different, cheaper costing pair that had same or better reviews.",B01G8JO5F2
"It does a good job, and a surprising amount of base.  I do get it cutting in and out from time to time, but other than that no issues.",B01G8JO5F2
8 hr battery life. Crystal clear with no background noise. Great for the price. Would recommend.<br /><br />Update since original purchase. Bought these a few months ago. Comparable quality to my Anker's which I accidentally stepped on.. The case is nice but I lost the first one on day one. Looked everywhere don't ask I have no idea. The first pair stopped working but the light came on during charging. I did a factory reset per the instructions and they were instantly fixed so watch out for that. I prefer less expensive headphones since I am clumsy and forgetful with them so I tend to look for the best quality I can get at a low price so I can replace them without freaking out. So far these fit the bill. I listen to these seven days a week for a one hour walk and I love them. Now that I have two pairs I will just run them till the battery dies and keep the second pair in my pocket in the case.,B01G8JO5F2
"Coming out of my ear, it would be good to have adjustable ear holder",B01G8JO5F2
"Received in a timely manner. Actually received my package because they get stolen often. These headphones are sleek, nice looking & work perfectly. No complaints. Will let you know how they are holding up in a couple of weeks.",B01G8JO5F2
"Constantly having problems, can turn on by itself, Noise cancellation rarely work on mine but battery last long!",B01G8JO5F2
This product only lasted about 6 months before they died. Used them to work out at the gym and yard work.,B01G8JO5F2
"Great set of Bluetooth headphones, came with different sizes of rubber ear buds and an amazing foam one that keeps the buds in my ear comfortably even when I'm working out or doing chores around the house. Good battery life, could be better but lasts most of the day, and charges quickly. Reach of the Bluetooth is also pretty good, if you stay in the same room as the source device you shouldnt have any problems. The only thing I dont like about these is that during use there is a constant blue flashing light and it is pretty disruptive at night (small piece of electrical tape took care of that problem)",B01G8JO5F2
its not good,B01G8JO5F2
even overnight charging did not fill the battery,B01G8JO5F2
The only thing I don’t like is that I have to keep repositioning them in my ear as they slowly slide out while I’m working out,B01G8JO5F2
"Had Senso bluetooth earphones that I'd bought a few years ago and had been very happy with them, but lately they were cutting out and I didn't understand why, until I noticed I'd been basically mistreating them, not careful and tugging on the wire. Decided to purchase these, an updated version. The difference in updated quality was immediately noticeable. They pair up immediately, on/off and pause controls seem much better, and the earpiece that goes around the ear is easily moldable to the ear. Love these.",B01G8JO5F2
"I have tried many headpphones for the gym but nothing compares to these. They are affordable and the customer service is terrific. They truly care about their customers and aim to help them in anyway possible. Headphones work great, last a long time and are great for working out.",B01G8JO5F2
The headphones work great but I'm not sure they are really waterproof. After a few days of wearing them in the shower the down volume stopped working. I can't imagine what caused it besides the water,B01G8JO5F2
The casing is breaking near the earbuds,B01G8JO5F2
Buen producto,B01G8JO5F2
These aren't noise cancelling. They have great sound quality for the money though.,B01G8JO5F2
Didn't even last 4 months,B01G8JO5F2
"Wworked perfectly for one year and nine months. Then stopped working inexplicably. If you’re okay with that duration, purchase by all means.",B01G8JO5F2
"At first I was fascinated with these little guys, they came with a carrying case and multiple eartips. But that's pretty much all the positive I can say.<br /><br />Sound quality: regular, I had issues with loosing audio and bluetooth connection issues with my phone which was literally next to the earphones.<br /><br />Battery life: is one of the biggest issues with these ones, just around 1-2 hrs of continuous play.<br /><br />And see for yourself: the cables are damaged with normal use, 3 years later. Pretty much rendering them useless, will now have to find a new psir of wireless earbuds.",B01G8JO5F2
These have lasted me almost 3 years now and decided I’d write a review to show some appreciation. I can’t believe the value I’ve gotten out of them. I’ve used these countless times in the shower and for construction work and the battery still gets me through the day.,B01G8JO5F2
"These Bluetooth headphones are very nice for the money.  I’ve owned a pair for almost two years now and because of their performance I bought a pair for my wife.  I use mine when doing chores around the house listening to music from my iPhone.  They’re light weight and might seem very cheap but the switchgear are sturdy, have held up, and still feel as new.  They paired easily with both my iPhone and iPad.  I’m not much of an audiophile but the sound produced is just fine for me.  I know I’ve easily gotten 6 to 7 hours battery life a few times although I rarely have them on for more than 3 or 4.  I usually charge them immediately after I use them.  Battery life has not been an issue for me.  There was a time when the device had trouble pairing or staying connected.  Did some research and did a factory reset of some type (I don’t recall the procedure).  I have never had to reset it again.  Rarely use them for phone conversations but they worked fine the few times I have.  Been very happy with this purchase.  I’ve gotten a lot of satisfaction for very little money.",B01G8JO5F2
Right ear didn't work ..,B01G8JO5F2
"Even though the left earbud stopped working, the costumer support was very nice in trying to help fix the issue and gave me new earbuds when it did not work right away. Overall good earbuds and great costumer support",B01G8JO5F2
"It took me a few uses to get used to the ear pieces, but once I did they are really awesome!",B01G8JO5F2
They are a decent pair of Bluetooth earbuds but really nothing spectacular. The sound quality is good when you are close to the phone but if you walk away any it fades easily and the range is minimal at best. But they are serving their purpose....,B01G8JO5F2
"Bought 3 pairs (one for myself, sister, and my mother). Great audio quality, noise cancellation, and overall design. Easy to use and they stay in my ear when running.",B01G8JO5F2
Very good quality with exceptional sound.  I use this for both listening to my music and to answer in-coming call while I am driving.,B01G8JO5F2
Very happy,B01G8JO5F2
Love these headphones! Sound quality is great!,B01G8JO5F2
"For the price, these are amazing. I can put them in and drown out conversations and other noise in the break room. I use them daily at work and even at home.",B01G8JO5F2
Use for pool exercising,B01G8JO5F2
"Great sound quality for the price. Perfect for working out, it doesn't fall off easily. I got three of these SENSO which I gave two of them as birthday gifts, and I can say all are happy! Most importantly , I had issue with the cable of one of the SENSO, and once I contacted the company, the resend me a new one, even it was after couple of months. I liked this service a lot to be honest!",B01G8JO5F2
"After my favorite ""Blayz"" headphones "" stopped being available, I decided to try the Senso - as they seemed very similar.<br />I would say 90-95% as good as the Blayz, which is quite a feat for a sub $20.00 pair.<br />I haven't tested the 8 hour Battery time, but for sure 5 hours, and they rarely miss a beat. Sound over Voice calls and Skype are excellent. Good Base, could be better on the High's. Very comfortable - A winner!<br /><br />So Much better than any of those ""Ear-Bud"" systems. My sons who use The Apple AirPods are amazed at the sound these produce, but they just aren't as ""cool"" as the Ear Bud/style  they say.<br /><br />I'l go for sound and quality!",B01G8JO5F2
This is the 4th pair of headphones I have bought.  I keep them everywhere!  I have bought and returned more expensive headphones but these headphones have  BY FAR the best sound and connectivity of all of them.  I have bought them as gifts and everyone loves them.,B01G8JO5F2
So far so good. Lightweight. Waterproof. Good quality sound.,B01G8JO5F2
I had a similar pair from another company. This pairs smoothly and I live the sound and easy controls. Best pair yet.,B01G8JO5F2
"The only thing I dislike about these are the arms that go over the ears,  they are not hard and sturdy but Soft and flexible A little too flexible as they tend to fall off.",B01G8JO5F2
"Best value for the price you pay.<br />Great sound, and if you like me and love to hear veryyyy LOUD music then this is the one for you :-)",B01G8JO5F2
"Ordered my first pair of these headphones and they worked well for a month or so. You need to charge them pretty regularly if you use them every day for an hour or so. I would say every other day if you workout every day. After a month or so my headphones just stopped working - they would not turn on and no light came on when plugged into the charger. I contacted customer service and followed their instructions to reset, but that did not fix the issue. They sent me another pair because it is still under warranty. The same thing happened after a short usage time. Again I contacted customer services, but now they are telling me I have to send the earbuds back to them, at MY expense, so they can see for themselves what the issue is. I asked for a shipping label weeks ago, and still have not received a response. I tried countless times to reset and charge these earbuds but that did not work. They are good for the price and decent for working out - that is, when they work! There are so many companies out there that sell similar earbuds at comparable and even cheaper value that have higher ratings. I may write this company off altogether, but hoping they get back to me soon to resolve the issue.",B01G8JO5F2
We love the quality a d connecability of these headphones.  They mold to your ear and we did not expect that.  They were charged and ready to go out of the box.,B01G8JO5F2
items delivered on time and good sound quality,B01G8JO5F2
"Great sound, easy to connect, good price",B01G8JO5F2
Gets the job done for the price,B01G8JO5F2
"Presentation/packaging very nicely done, especially for the price.",B01G8JO5F2
"They feel and work good, a little annoying to put on with thicker glasses, but stills fits and works well.",B01G8JO5F2
Al tiempo se pela el cable y queda expuesto hasta el cobre. No comprare otro.,B01G8JO5F2
"This is the second set of Senso earbuds that I have purchased.  The sound quality is very good, and the over the ear fit is very comfortable.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone considering the purchase of a Bluetooth wireless device.",B01G8JO5F2
Best 20$ ever spent. I own a power washing company and I have been through several high dollar water resistant buds and these actually sound great and handle my abuse. Great buy!,B01G8JO5F2
Extremely comfortable and easy to use,B01G8JO5F2
Did not like the adjustable ear holders.,B01G8JO5F2
"I might have already wrote a review a few years ago, but my pair finally crapped out after constant use. For $20 I will gladly buy a replacement pair. For running or the gym, who wants to be wired to their cell phone? The quality is excellent, they hold a charge for many hours, and stay put in my ears. Don't know why they stopped working; one day they just wouldn't turn on. But after four years? Totally worth it!",B01G8JO5F2
Good sound,B01G8JO5F2
"I really loved these headphones but after hearing them about a year, they suddenly stopped holding a charge and no longer work",B01G8JO5F2
Not bad for the price. I’m pretty pleased with what I got,B01G8JO5F2
"These are great, simply. Compared to other wireless headphones I've used these are at the top of my list. The wire connecting them is perfect. I mainly use them for yoga and when I mow yards and i love how if i have to take one or both out that they just stay around my neck",B01G8JO5F2
Like that I am able to hear out of them and that they stay on my ears.,B01G8JO5F2
Afree thing ok,B01G8JO5F2
"I love the fact that the battery life is so long. I charged it 3 days ago and i'm still using them. They're not constantly running, but every time I'm outside doing yard work I need my hands and use these. They are great with noise cancellation on my end, but anytime i'm on the phone with them on everyone hears everything in my background. You have to have both pieces in your ears because one side will end up pulling on the other if you just have it hanging around your neck. For the price you pay these are great. Quality is great.",B01G8JO5F2
For the price they are great.  They Don’t fall out either,B01G8JO5F2
Don’t work well. Invest money elsewhere,B01G8JO5F2
"Great sound, comfortable, stay in place... perfect.",B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these headphones almost a year ago. They are WAAAAY TOO LOUD if you have an iPhone.  On the lowest volume settings the sound is as if it were almost halfway up to the max.  I guess thats fine during the day, but if you like to watch a little youtube while you fall asleep at night, FORGET IT.<br /><br />After a year the Battery wouldn't hold a charge so i emailed customer service.  At first they were helpful, providing me with a few tricks to try to reset it.  The promised me if it didnt work they would replace it since it died just be fore the warranty expired.  BUT THEY DID NOT HONOR THAT PROMISE.  They told me I was out of warranty and give me a MEASLY 5% coupon to buy a new pair from them - YEAH RIGHT!!!  Let me buy ANOTHER piece of garbage.  i pointed out in an email how they went back on their promises and got no reply.  2 more emails after that and STILL NO REPLY.<br /><br />Thanks for nothing SENSO - you are the WORST!<br /><br />DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!",B01G8JO5F2
Too much bass,B01G8JO5F2
"Great earbuds, only need the volume up about half to hear perfectly. Does great canceling out background noise.",B01G8JO5F2
Excellent sound. Very easy to use. My husband and I both have a pair,B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these upon the recommendation of my son, who has had used his for 2 1/2 years with no problems.  They are comfortable and easy to pair. The sound blocking quality is good too. The battery life is decent too.  The sound was really good at first.  Unfortunately, after a couple of months, the sound quality has become subpar.  They cut out and the volume will jump very high and then very low.  The music at times sounds like I am listening underwater.  I tried the factory reset with no luck.  I am disappointed now as I am having to start the search for new sound blocking earbuds that are comfortable and have quality sound.",B01G8JO5F2
If i could give it a negative star i would not worth the money at all,B01G8JO5F2
"This is my second pair, I love these for the price. They have good noise cancellation as I use them when mowing the lawn",B01G8JO5F2
All not good,B01G8JO5F2
"Bought these a few months ago, one side literally just stopped working. Sound quality is great enough. I enjoyed it while it lasted.",B01G8JO5F2
Great sound and long battery life. Fair price. Does not disappoint!,B01G8JO5F2
"Great price, good sound. This is my second pair since my son took the first pair from me (which still work great by the way and I’ve had them since 2017)!  Tried a pair of Tozo wireless and they did not work, only one earbud would charge, so returned those and went with what I knew with work!  This Senso set!",B01G8JO5F2
They do not fall out of the ear and stay in place.  It fits the size of the ear perfectly,B01G8JO5F2
Can't complain for the price. Worth every penny,B01G8JO5F2
Didn't last long. Battery couldn't hold a charge after a couple of months.,B01G8JO5F2
I enjoy these earbud sports and have been using them for two years. Great battery and price but I have three issues with their performance.<br /><br />1. They seem to always turn on like they have a mind of their own. I turn them off and shortly after I will notice they are on and connected to my iPhone. Power them off and they power back on  connecting via Bluetooth immediately. This is annoying because they may be across the room or in a bag. How long it takes for them to turn on is variable.<br /><br />2. The lowest volume setting is almost to loud for indoors. I use them at work and I want to be able to turn them down one more notch but that shuts off volume<br /><br />3. Microphone volume is low when talking on phone. The sound on the other end is clear but low volume.<br /><br />Other than those gripes an overall good purchase,B01G8JO5F2
"They cut out from time to time with phone calls, however for listening to music they seem to work great. I use them while I am at work to help keep focused without having to hold my phone, I also use them in the car to talk to my wife while I drive that way I am hands-free.",B01G8JO5F2
"I have bought 5 of these headphones. One for me, three for my children, and one because I suck at paying attention to how much of something I'm ordering.<br /><br />I'm not going to comment too much on the quality or the sound and all that. I am no expert. For the price (on sale at the time I purchased) I found it to a big bang for the buck. They worked well (enough), they weren't perfect, but for roughly 40 bucks a pop, I don't think I could have hoped for better.<br />Occasionally had issues with connecting to Bluetooth (but that could be the wonkiness of other systems involved)<br />Audio 'skipped' sometimes.<br />Generally had no issues though.<br /><br />Point is I was happy with them. So were my kids.<br /><br />But, as all things are wont to do, eventually they failed. As in, every single one of the headphones stopped functioning completely. Well, one didn't get the chance, a dog chewed them up. But the rest that lived long enough to flourish eventually gave up the ghost.<br /><br />The number that comes with the box, with its 24/7 support and minimal wait times (all pluses*) they will walk you through the basics of how to reset the device. If it is deemed faulty, they will replace the headphones with minimal fuss. It is pretty great.<br />BUT!! Keep in mind that the 'one-year-warranty' does not 'restart' with the replacements. If those fail outside of the original time-frame, no replacement will be given. This might be common sense to some, but one can dream can't they?<br />CAN'T THEY!?!?<br /><br />All-in-all, 40 bucks for a decent pair of headphones that get a hassle-free replacement that all together is over a year of use is all gravy to me.<br />No.<br />More than gravy... gravy AND biscuits.<br /><br />I will probably purchase again.<br /><br />*....ew. The plural for 'plus' looks bad<br /><br />Edit: Holy Hell, I didn't realize the price has gone down even further. Yeah, for 20~ definitely worth it.",B01G8JO5F2
"This is the second pair of these headphones I’ve bought. The first pair worked beautifully.  I had no problems with them. I only brought this pair because I thought I had lost the first. Unfortunately these headphones are constantly losing connection with my phone, even though my phone is 3 feet way. If move my head the wrong way they lose connection and power off. Since I use these for working out, this happens constantly.  I found my old pair, so these are going in the trash. I should have returned them when I had the chance.",B01G8JO5F2
These SENSO bluetooth head phones provide excellent sound.They are easy to use and I use them to listen to music streaming through my android phone. You have to be close to your device but not right on top of it but my phone is usually in my pocket.However in my small apartment I can really put the phone anywhere and the headphone pick up perfectly. The battery lasts quite a while and recharges quickly via a small usb cable. Very good product.,B01G8JO5F2
Stays in place well.,B01G8JO5F2
"Very poor. This was the second pair i bought.  They melted will charging. Had to throw them away.  Bought Beats, much better.",B01G8JO5F2
I did not use the product. I purchased as a gift. The recipient loves them. Says he uses daily and performs up to his expectations.,B01G8JO5F2
I really love these headphones! I use them at the gym all the time and they work great. The sound quality is pretty good. I usually go a couple days on a full charge. I don’t have problems with them falling out of my ears. The only problem I really have with them is when I try to skip a song.,B01G8JO5F2
Headphones worked fine until 2nd night when plugging the charge cord into the port to power up.  The port mechanism loosened and disappeared into the earpiece.  Returning for a replacement.,B01G8JO5F2
Short life,B01G8JO5F2
"Gift for my son-in-law.  He's really happy with them, so far!",B01G8JO5F2
I've had 2 sets of these. Both of them lasted about 4 months then wouldn't charge. I'm going out to buy a better set.,B01G8JO5F2
Bought for my 11 years old grandson who use to play outside with ball and I am not afraid that he may loose it; if it's felt from his ear - it will stay on his neck. He said he loves it.,B01G8JO5F2
The sound quality is great. I love that the ear piece goes in your ear and around you ear. Perfect for any activity. Amazing product for the price!,B01G8JO5F2
Sound is fair but not good and battery life was a joke.,B01G8JO5F2
"Love these - they’re m y second pair. No problems w/ the other ones, I gave them to my son. Great sound, they  stay in my ears, and don’t hurt. Easy to use too.",B01G8JO5F2
great for me at the gym. great sound. deep bass. stays in my ears and does not come out like cheaper models,B01G8JO5F2
Would charge for a few seconds then quit. I'm not the first to experience this. Dont bother.,B01G8JO5F2
These headphones are every bit as good as those that cost 3 or 4 times as much. Excellent product at a reasonable price.,B01G8JO5F2
"I've used these for over a year with no problems.  I paid so little for them I didn't expect much quality and, frankly, didn't wear them except to try them out to see if they worked.  I continued using my corded Bose earbuds without really giving these a chance.  I finally tired of the cord flopping around and used these - blown away.  I didn't know I could use them for phone calls and stumbled over that when I received one.  They work great and people on the phone don't seem to realize I'm on a headset.  I have a lot of items that use Bluetooth and my phone is normally connected to something - a car, a speaker, or a camera, etc., so I have to go through a connection process if I put them on in my house, but if I turn them on while on my driveway they automatically connect.  That  problem results from using a point-to-point technology with multiple items and isn't the earbuds' problem.",B01G8JO5F2
"LOVED the fit and sound, but they suddenly stopped syncing with bluetooth, even though the voice said ""you are connected.""  Have to return them...........",B01G8JO5F2
perry good headphones would recommend buying,B01G8JO5F2
I use these earbuds when I mountain bike. They sound great and feel comfortable!,B01G8JO5F2
""" Good Quality sound even at low volume, very happy with this purchase,""",B01G8JO5F2
perfect sound,B01G8JO5F2
Comfortable and noise canceling to hear,B01G8JO5F2
It's good. Battery long is amazing.,B01G8JO5F2
I love these head phones. I have smaller ears and the buds are just the right size and the over ear arms are comfortable and easy to adjust.,B01G8JO5F2
"The Headphones sometimes don't connect to my phone and need to be shut off and turned on automatically. No big deal really, only happens on occasion and I have an old iPhone so what can you expect. Also, the button is hard to push to turn on and off and pause and play. Overall the sound quality is there and if you use the included job site earplugs, you will see monster base yet still good quality. I would buy these again and recommend to a friend. Not without its flaws, but for the price, I would buy them again they are such a good deal.",B01G8JO5F2
"No issues connecting to phone.  Quality relative to price is very good.  Only had a short time, bought for the wife and these are her ratings I put on the product, since she is using the product.",B01G8JO5F2
"Bought these for my grandson and they met with his approval, meaning another great SENSO product.",B01G8JO5F2
Don’t buy these. I’ve tried them twice and have been greatly disappointed both times. They DO NOT KEEP A CONNECTION. This is incredibly frustrating when you are using them for exercise which is for what they advertise them to be used. Total crap.,B01G8JO5F2
I like every thing about the sensor Bluetooth headset,B01G8JO5F2
It’s a good product for people working out!,B01G8JO5F2
In less than one month the right earbud fall off and I contact senso and they assuming that was broke by accident I rarely write review on amazon but I don’t recommend this headset to be use for working out I will prefer to buy something else,B01G8JO5F2
the battery wouldn't take a charge after 18 months,B01G8JO5F2
"I really like my headphones--they fit easily in my ears and don't hurt. I still think the quietest setting is too loud, but that's a complaint I've had about every pair of wireless headphones I've owned.",B01G8JO5F2
"The first one I received worked great for two weeks and then stopped working. It was replaced and the 2nd one would charge but wouldn't speak or pair with my device. A shame since when it worked, it was just what I wanted.",B01G8JO5F2
"Everythign works great, sound is great, do not care for the cord.",B01G8JO5F2
My friend had a pair and I loved them. So I bought two pairs. One for myself and one for my daughter.,B01G8JO5F2
I had the previous version of these and they lasted almost two years...this version lasted one month.,B01G8JO5F2
Great ear buds for the cost. Easy to setup and sound quality is very good<br />Would buy them again.,B01G8JO5F2
Good sound. Fits well around my ear.,B01G8JO5F2
The power button was pushed all the way in when I got it Tuesday so I couldn't pair it or turn it on my feeling was really hurt I was looking forward to these head phone's,B01G8JO5F2
"Just got these today to listen to music, podcasts and Netflix at the gym. I've had wired headsets that keep getting caught on the gym equipment- what a pain. I'm using the foam ear pieces and they feel very comfortable and don't fall out.<br />So- just charged these up and am blown away by the sound quality sound. Nicely balanced base, mid-range and high end. Not perfect but way better than what I expected for a $20 pair of earbuds. I was going to buy the Beats but no way are they 10X better.<br />Off to listen to more music and a workout.",B01G8JO5F2
Compré 3 auriculares el 04/02/2020. Los hemos usado diariamente unas 2horas al día solo a la noche sin tenerlos en movimiento. A los 6 meses uno de ellos comenzó con un falso contacto en el cable del lado izquierdo y dejó de emitir sonido de ese lado. Hace unos días volvió a pasar lo mismo con otro auricular. De la tienda me dijeron que estaba en garantía pero aún no me ofrecieron una solución. Ya no estoy ubicado en usa. Espero poder reemplazarlos por otros de mejor calidad ya que la durabilidad de estos fue pésima. ¿Cuál hubiera sido su vida útil si los hubiera utilizado para correr como dice la descripción del artículo?,B01G8JO5F2
"This product worked fine the two months that it was functional. Then it just inexplicably broke, as other reviewers have noted below. I only used it when I went to the gym about three times a week and never mishandled it and just left it on my desk. It says it’s fully charged but won’t turn on. Absolutely horrible product. Beware and do not buy!",B01G8JO5F2
I have owned these headphones for less than a year and they already do not work. I used the headphones about twice a week. The headphones will not turn on even though they indicate they are fully charged. Very disappointing. Do not recommend.,B01G8JO5F2
"I love these headphones better than my airpods. Battery life, skip and rewind, volume control. All excellent",B01G8JO5F2
"i have a problem losing head phones so i buy a pair of they every couple years. they work great, charge fast and are decently comfortable! defiantly worth the price.",B01G8JO5F2
"Used for long distance running, lasts long.",B01G8JO5F2
Great product,B01G8JO5F2
"I really like  it  , it works really  good",B01G8JO5F2
Good love them,B01G8JO5F2
"Connected easily to my devices, fits well during my workout, great sound!",B01G8JO5F2
Really neat features. Light weight and just what I wanted.,B01G8JO5F2
Second pair of them since I wore the first ones out. They’re great!,B01G8JO5F2
I have had these headphones for several months now and they are great. The sound quality is pretty good and battery life last a long while. Would recommend purchasing!,B01G8JO5F2
"They started off great, sound quality is impressive for the price. However, they stopped charging after a few months of use. It's unfortunate that I haven't been able to get atleast a years worth of time out of them.",B01G8JO5F2
"It took about 5 sec to response after I pressed on/off button. The charger port was broken after 3 month use. I contacted the seller. Although they agreed to send me a replacement, I have not received over one month. Super irresponsible. Never buy this product from this seller again.",B01G8JO5F2
The best headphones ever bought,B01G8JO5F2
I like everything about the earphones,B01G8JO5F2
Awesome headphones!!,B01G8JO5F2
"Bought a pair for myself and thought they met the mark for an introductory pair of Bluetooth headphones, so I bought a second pair to give as a gift. The sound quality is very good and the battery works for a long time, but it is impossible to un-kink the strap after you take them out of the box- it is also a little too long and can get caught in your shirt/ponytail. For a relatively inexpensive pair of headphones, these work quite well- just know what you're paying for!",B01G8JO5F2
Very comfortable but has a tendency for cutting out when bounced around.  Not sure if it's the headphones or my phone though but fir the price I can't complain,B01G8JO5F2
One of the earpieces stopped working after a month of use,B01G8JO5F2
Early use of this item are rave reviews. Sound quality and fit is excellent,B01G8JO5F2
I bought these about a year ago. The sound quality is decent but no bass and now power to it. They are a budget set of headphones. If you aren't willing to pay 100 plus for quality headphones then these can be a decent set for running and what not.. Anyway they are pretty cheaply made. I am writing this review because I just pulled them out of my pocket the other day and the power button somehow got pushed in and stuck. I tried to carefully pulled back out and all the innards came with it. TOAST!! What the heck happened to 30 dollar pairs of head phones that had great sound quality and lasted longer than you wanted?? There was a time.  But No more!!  It's either cheap shit or spend 150 dollars for quality. Just my two cents.,B01G8JO5F2
I use the headphones while at the gym and I love them. They are easy to use and stay perfect in place.,B01G8JO5F2
Arrived just in time. I liked the other accessories incl. Like the magnet/fone holder. Pretty good sound. The earplugs are good 4 ppl w/tiny ears & can be adjusted so they sit snug on your ears.,B01G8JO5F2
The sound quality is amazing.,B01G8JO5F2
"These headphones are amazing. Pros: amazing sound and light weight; battery life was great (all day use and still at 90% - not sure how); easy to connect to my phone - no code needed; clear voice quality when using with phone (initial issue with background noise, tried again with another call and it was great). Cons: will not stay in my ear eventhough I tried all the ear buds (I think is  a personal issue for that I had issues with other ear buds) But that's my issue not the products.; problem staying connected eventhough my phone was in my hand or back pocket.",B01G8JO5F2
For the price these are great little headsets. I was amazed at how clear and concise both music and conversations come through.  Love them!,B01G8JO5F2
Solid quality at a very low price.,B01G8JO5F2
"These are amazing for the price.  Good bass and sound.  I have bought 3 of these over the past few years.  Considering what I put them through, they are pretty durable.  I bought  $200 plus headphones that weren't this good.",B01G8JO5F2
i dont know. i lost it in less than 24 hrs....,B01G8JO5F2
Good sound quality and the controls are easy to learn,B01G8JO5F2
"I liked my last set of headphones of this style,  but I hate these. Even with the biggest size of them, they fall out and off of my ears. The connection is wonky and I have had issues where I couldn’t pair them, but also it was on and refusing to let me restart them. They also travel way too far down the ear and are very uncomfortable. I’m so sad these didn’t work out.",B01G8JO5F2
"I love these headphones, they are great, good quality for the price, i will absolutely buy again...",B01G8JO5F2
Great for the price and very comfortable.  Sound quality is great.,B01G8JO5F2
Sir/Madam:<br /><br />In December 2019 I bought two pair of ear buds... and kept one in reserve ... to use when the first pair burnt out.<br /><br />I  used the first pair ... but when tried out the second pair ... I found that the wiring is bad in them...and  the  earbuds lost contact with the  device I was using.<br /><br />Would you allow me to  mail the bad pair back to you?? Mostly you could repair them??<br /><br />Thank you<br /><br />Victor,B01G8JO5F2
The headphones work excellently. Sometimes it doesn't connect correctly. But not too often.,B01G8JO5F2
"PROS<br /><br />I used the headphones while jumping rope, lifting weights, and running on the treadmill, and on the train. I sweat a lot during workouts and had no issues with it slipping off. Can’t hear background noises on the train<br /><br /> I’ve only been using the headphones for two days but so far so good. The headphones are also light weight.<br /><br />Carrying case is genius<br /><br />CON<br /><br />You are able to talk on the phone but my friends heard an echo or a lot of background noise.<br /><br />Some of the songs I listened too off of Apple Music had better quality than others.",B01G8JO5F2
Great for the price. Too bad I left them in the gym :( at least I wasn’t hundreds of dollars in the hole. Plan on getting another pair.,B01G8JO5F2
I just bought my 3rd one. Love this brand and style.,B01G8JO5F2
Comfortable!,B01G8JO5F2
Excellent.,B01G8JO5F2
Product is more then worth the price sound is excellent for the price,B01G8JO5F2
These are great headphones! The fit took a few seconds to get used to but the sound quality is really good. Easy to install and they were playing music within seconds. And it comes with some additional goodies I was not expecting.,B01G8JO5F2
"I work out in noisy gyms and walk near noisy traffic. These are my first Bluetooth headphones. They paired right away, sound great, overcome the noise, the battery lasts . . . Great deal, especially for the price",B01G8JO5F2
"Going on 7 months I use them 2-4 times a week at the gym, better than more expensive brands IMO",B01G8JO5F2
"Great headphones, the hooks keep them in my ears even when I'm working out. Also, noice cancelation is great with the supplied foam buds. Some people may be turned off that they still have a cord connecting them, but this hasn't been an issue and allows you to take one out and let it hang for conversation.",B01G8JO5F2
Good for listening to music,B01G8JO5F2
"Easy to use, good sound quality, and competitive price.",B01G8JO5F2
Sound is so loud. Amazing for the price,B01G8JO5F2
"It's hard to tell how good the sound quality is--these earphones don't fit in my ears. The design is horrible. I can only imagine they tested them with one subject--an elephant named, Dumbo! These things are gigantic and unwieldy.  I do not recommend purchasing them.",B01G8JO5F2
Dollar for dollar it is a great product.,B01G8JO5F2
"I really like these headphones and they have been very reliable. I have recommended them to 4 other people on my team. Unfortunately, they only have a lifespan of about 1.5 years, which is good, but I wish they hadn't just gone out on me! All of a sudden they have stopped working and shut off while  I'm listening, even though they are fully charged. Huge bummer.",B01G8JO5F2
"this is the best headphone i ever owned ... and I had a lot<br />robust Bluetooth . great fit , leather light , good sound quality ,,,, durable like a crocks .... and the best thing , is accurate controls , as opposed to other headsets that are VERY complicated ... highly recommended",B01G8JO5F2
Me encanto!!!!,B01G8JO5F2
The glue are weak,B01G8JO5F2
"The wrap-around ear pieces are so malleable that they don’t hold the earpieces in; since these earpieces are relatively heavy, not holding them firmly in place is a major design flaw.  Sound quality is passable,  but I really couldn’t get an idea of how good it is simply because the earpieces would not stay in place.  This device is sold under multiple different brand names; I had two others, both of which work adequately, but avoid the Senso brand. The other ones of this particular style are okay",B01G8JO5F2
"Although the headset had good sound quality, in nine days time they developed static and within 10 day I noticed one side no longer functioned at all.  Very poor quality product.  I would suggest you pass on this purchase.",B01G8JO5F2
"So far, I really like them. Very clear. Loud volume. Better than my Lg that I paid 100.00 for. Only had them a couple days. We will see",B01G8JO5F2
"Out of the box not great do these few tips and they will sound like $200 pair,if you like a more treble sounding music use smaller ear bud if you like more bass use bigger ones,adjust eq on your phone to your liking,if you are using a streaming app like spotify use there custom eq ,if u do these few things you will have a great sounding ear buds at a cheap price",B01G8JO5F2
"I have had two pairs of these headphones, love them for workin out and have even bought a pair for a runner in the family. When my headphones unexpectedly stopped working, I contacted the seller. They provided clear troubleshooting steps and when the issue was still not resolved they sent a new replacement set out for me. Thanks for the excellent service!",B01G8JO5F2
"I like the sound quality, but the headphones seem to lose connection with my iPhone and the sound regularly cuts in and out.",B01G8JO5F2
"These headphones do not stay in your ear and always have the feeling they are falling out.  I have used both large and small earplugs and continually adjust, real fun running on a treadmill.  I have gone back to my IPod.",B01G8JO5F2
"I've given 5 starts all around because my first time had been a great experience,  today I will be exercising with them for the first time.  Let's see how it goes",B01G8JO5F2
"I bought a replacement pair recently after I broke my old pair, and as soon as I took them out of the box I could tell there was a difference. The new pair just felt....cheaper. The plastic felt cheaper, the buttons made a clicking sound when you touched them since they were so loose, but the worst part was the ear hooks. I usually have problems with keeping earbuds in due to my inner ear canal shape, but the thing that I loved (loved as in past tense) about these earbuds was the ear hooks. I could do practically anything wearing them and they'd comfortably stay in.<br /><br />With the replacement pair, however, the hooks were just rubber pieces that couldn't be shaped. The hooks on the old pair had a piece of wire inside of them that allowed you to bend and shape them, thus the universal fit. But as soon as I put on the new pair I could almost instantly feel them sliding out of my ears, and of course the hooks did absolutely nothing because you couldn't bend and shape them! What's even the point! Seriously, they're just pieces of rubber that do absolutely nothing unless you just so happen to have extra large ears.<br /><br />To be fair, they still sound pretty much as good as they did before, but what's the point if they won't stay in? I even tried using the larger foam tips they came with, but they always would just fall out. I'm not even running or anything like that, I'm just walking and these things won't even stay in. It's extremely frustrating to have to push them back in every 15 seconds.<br /><br />I blame it all on cheaper manufacturing. Like I said before, the difference was instantly noticeable. It's such a shame that Senso has gone down the path of so many other corporate institutions that think they can cheapen their products and people will just be ok with it. I threw these things in the garbage rather than try to have Senso replace them with another pair that more than likely will still be just as cheap. Maybe I just got a bad pair, but I highly doubt it. More than likely this is just greedy capitalism at play: cut costs and make more money. Except in this case, where I'm gonna buy my replacement pair from somewhere else.",B01G8JO5F2
"Easy to set up and use. I charged the headset for 2 hours the first time and after 10 days, it is still going strong. I use it about 30-45 min each day.",B01G8JO5F2
"I use my new Senso Bluetooth Headphones while exercising, while sitting at my desk during work hours, and sometimes when I am at home.  They are very easy to use and the sound quality is very good.  They connect/disconnect from my phone very quickly and efficiently.",B01G8JO5F2
"Not the best sound quality. too much treble not enough bass.  Ear loops have a wire inside the rubber that is annoying.  They lose their shape often and need  frequent adjustments.  Pulling them out of my pocket and they really get deformed.  Functionally, the units controls are well done and pairing was easy.",B01G8JO5F2
"Ordered two sets and liked so well, ordered an additional set. Great value!",B01G8JO5F2
I ordered the headphones and they arrived in perfect time before my important virtual meetings. The sound is clear and sounds great when I play my music nice and loud.<br /><br />Monique,B01G8JO5F2
The product is to use and has a long battery life.  Fits in my ears without falling out and has excellent sound quality.,B01G8JO5F2
They are light weight and great for running. Also the air vent holder for the car is great and works perfectly for my phone that previously didn't fit in any.,B01G8JO5F2
"Didnt have the highest expectations, just wanted headphones that wouldn't fall off while i was on the treadmill. Kinda crappy sound quality but way better and more convenient than some of the other options",B01G8JO5F2
"Only had them a couple of days but work well, hopefully that continues!",B01G8JO5F2
Mine stopped working after a month BUT!!! they sent me a new one and worked perfectly! Thank you!,B01G8JO5F2
"The sound quality was really good but the usb cover was a bit challenging to open.  Had to basically tear it off so I could get easy access to it.  That worked fine but then it became finicky on what usb charger I could use (I always kept it clean and in a case).  I no longer could charge it.  Too bad, I really liked it.",B01G8JO5F2
These head phones are awesome  I just worked a 12 hour day and I plugged them in on my 30 mins lunch and they lasted all day at work and also I've never had a pair the connect to my phone as son as I turn them on and the show is awesome best 20 dollar head phones ever ... I'm a mig welder and these work great for me and dont have to turn them all the way up to have good sound ether and the pieces that are behide the ear doesn't bother with my safely glasses km and my hood ... now it's just to see how long they last in my line of work,B01G8JO5F2
Nice headset,B01G8JO5F2
"I got these headphones as a gift, and they work perfectly apart from the issues with the bass. If any song has too much bass in it, the entire song seems to turn into background static with some lyrics (even within a foot of my phone). I have to listen to podcasts or youtube videos to actually be 100% satisfied with this product. It could be much improved.",B01G8JO5F2
"Stopped charging after 7 month,now I need contact seller for warranty.",B01G8JO5F2
"easy to charge, nice accessories (carrying case, extra silicone earbuds, etc.), and good quality sound. Looking foward to using them more.",B01G8JO5F2
Good while they lasted...,B01G8JO5F2
Stopped working after about 15 months,B01G8JO5F2
"I had a friend swear by these and state how great they are, but I found better brands and products that preform far better than this one. The sound quality is fine and the overall build quality isn't bad, but the piece that goes over the ear is super flimsy and cheap. The worst part is the microphone; you are literally unidentifiable by anyone on the other end of a phone call. I even listened to myself in a voice message and holy cow, sounds like I was talking through the lowest quality 1920's radio.<br /><br />If you're just looking for attached, bluetooth headphones for music these will get the job done, but honestly there are far better brands out there for the same price or $5 more!",B01G8JO5F2
Have to admit pretty good quality for the price,B01G8JO5F2
My favorite pair of headphones. Have lasted a long time,B01G8JO5F2
"There are several things I like about this product. To name a few: long lasting battery, cheap, good sound quality, different ear tip attachments, and easy to use. The come with a 1 year warranty as well incase anything does go wrong. They are quick to respond if anything does go wrong and replace head phones as soon as you do your part of the process. I will be buying these headphones again in the future if the current ones I have ever fail me and suggesting to friends as well.",B01G8JO5F2
These Senso headphones have excellent sound quality for the price. The controls are simple and easy to use. Highly recommend.,B01G8JO5F2
"I bought this product awhile back and wanted to just quickly write a review.<br /><br />I would highly suggest looking elsewhere for a product, the cheap Beats I would recommend.<br /><br />These put some pressure on your ears and are uncomfortable after just 10 minutes of wearing them. The sound quality on these is also not very good. After buying them I never used them again.",B01G8JO5F2
I’ve had these for a year now and still no issues. I love them. The bass heavy songs aren’t the greatest but they are still nice,B01G8JO5F2
Works well with my iPhone exactly as described. Sound quality is good.,B01G8JO5F2
"I bought 3 different brands(yet similar looking) Bluetooth headphones. This one lasted the longest. The other 2 died after 6 months to a year, this I have for 1 year and 3 months. BUT, I bought 2 of this, one for me, one for my gf- my gf's died after 3 months. So I guess it is a hit or miss. If it works, it works great. If not, well... Amazon did refund me.<br /><br />Battery life is around 4-5 hours.",B01G8JO5F2
"not made very well.the hooks break off very Quickly. Warranties pretty good. Would I buy another maybe for my child but not if you want to work out.and ,be active",B01G8JO5F2
hard to fit on the ear.,B01G8JO5F2
"Absolutely in love with them!!! Amazing stereo sound, inexpensive, and overall very comfortable!!! I am completely satisfied with them!!! Battery life, so far, is awesome!!! Will definitely recommend anyone to give these babies a try!!!",B01G8JO5F2
"Using these for running, walking and general use. The over-the-ear loop helps hold them in place and the in-ear is comfortable. The volume gets very loud so I don't turn them all the way up often. Battery life is 8 hours +/- or about a week most of the time. I would buy these again.",B01G8JO5F2
"Overall product was fine. sound quality, comfort were all decent.  I tried these hoping they would be more durable.  However the left speaker went out after approximately 3 months.  similar to the length of time a pair of corded headphones seem to last. :(",B01G8JO5F2
The best head phones I've ever had I get about 10 hrs of straight listening time  sound is good the noise cancellation is good the controls are easy the ear piece is esaly adjustable and for the price and all the extra things you get included you can't beat it  plus they have a 1 year warranty so if something goes wrong between now and then I just send them back and get another pair,B01G8JO5F2
"I sweat pretty heavily, so I shy away from the more expensive models of headphones to use for running.  So far these headphones are doing very well.  The sound is the best so far for a lower priced model.  The big test will be the controls once they get wet.  I have learned not to mess too much with the controls when they are wet.  Just wait until everything dries thoroughly before charging, etc.",B01G8JO5F2
There is literally nothing positive I can say about these earphones.  The bluetooth receiver is so weak that I would have connection issues with my phone being only as far as my back pocket.<br /><br />Pure Junk.,B01G8JO5F2
The sound quality was decent nothing special at all. Noice canceling sucks.<br />And I’m never using them again lol. That’s it.,B01G8JO5F2
I do not like that,B01G8JO5F2
Terrible noise quality. Also does not hold well with the rubber support.,B01G8JO5F2
These are to big for my ears. They kept falling off when i tried to wear them while washing dishes. Not the best if you have small ears. You are not able to adjust them around the ear.,B01G8JO5F2
I am using my headphone during my work hours when my hands are busy.  I am enjoying its clear voice and convenience of multi-tasking.,B01G8JO5F2
"These headphones are great and they turly are noise canceling. They are perfect for folks that workout wether it’s cardio or leg day these stay in place! The great part is, the part that wraps around your ear to hold them in place is adjustable!!!! Overall great product and my boyfriend also just purchased a pair!😉🤪 Definitely worth the hard earned coins!!",B01G8JO5F2
Bought in November.  Stopped pairing in February.  I recommend you look elsewhere.,B01G8JO5F2
Personal use and they are great,B01G8JO5F2
The sound quality is fine for anything without any base. But even a slight bit causes it to cut in and out and distorts audio. Its fine for podcasts but not music.,B01G8JO5F2
"Has a really good sound quality, well built, and feels comfortable around you ears. Deep bass and clear sound. Pretty good headphones for the price.",B01G8JO5F2
"Works very well. Easy to pair. Long battery life. Comfortable. All in all, a great product.",B01G8JO5F2
"Purchased for my son as Xmas present...returned as we received s lemon, but replaced and all good...my son loves it because he likes the waterproof since he works out every day",B01G8JO5F2
3 years in and let me tell you they still sound amazing after all the heavy use and especially for exercise. The only reason im giving it a 4 is because the last months the cable cover has but slowly tearing apart and exposing the cables. Hasn't affected its performance but I fear a cable might break in the next 2 years.,B01G8JO5F2
"Sounds great for price, battery life is very good and quality is fine. I don’t like the cord around the back of head as it catches and pulls earphones out.",B01G8JO5F2
"One side just stopped working. I used them for 4 ~ 6 hours a day for a month. No idea why, but one side just stopped outputting sound.",B01G8JO5F2
Sound quality is fine but it cuts out way too often,B01G8JO5F2
"The sound quality was very poor. Lot's of crackling. I was very surprised, considering all the positive reviews.",B01G8JO5F2
the best earphones for working outside in the heat all day.  great sound,B01G8JO5F2
"Not bad, but the over ear part just broke, so I cant rely on it staying in the ear. It simply broke while i was putting it on; it seemed flexible, but it broke. I havent used them much.",B01G8JO5F2
I accidentally left mine in water overnight and they still were coming on over after a year of having them. After a day or so they work perfectly fine. I'm still using them today.,B01G8JO5F2
Stopped working after 6 times,B01G8JO5F2
No good!!!,B01G8JO5F2
"While the sound quality is pretty good, the range on these head phones is VERY limited, (like 6 feet from source).<br />Also, it is very touchy about where the connected wire is: if I hung the wire in front of my chin; good reception. If I hung the wire behind my head, I seemed to lose reception...",B01G8JO5F2
Nice Headphones. They were easy to set up and sound very good. I'm taking a long trip soon and I will really put them to the test.,B01G8JO5F2
""" Excellent set of wireless headphones that sit comfortably and snuggly in and around my ears Nice sound.Unfortunately, they stopped working after 2 months (wouldn’t charge). Still giving the company and the headphones 5 stars as I got sent a new pair within 2 days of contacting them! Anyone can have a defective product-it’s how you handle it that matters-and this company has excellent customer service!""<br /> , adjustable fit around the outer ear - perfect for running as the headphones cannot fall out of your ears like they can on other models. Excellent customer service!",B01G8JO5F2
Really good price-quality ratio. Will by again if I lose these or something.,B01G8JO5F2
Working out,B01G8JO5F2
"I thought with such and inexpensive head phones many problems would arise.Not so. For all the cost, they are amazing efficient. Sound is excellent and they a comfortable. I've only used  them  a  short while, so if performance changes, I'll repost.Right now, they are surprisingly good.",B01G8JO5F2
"They work nice and smoothly, they are a great deal for it's price , just the quality of the case and the general design could be better but definitely they are a great product that would not disappoint anyone",B01G8JO5F2
"I use my head phones at the gym, during yard work, etc!",B01G8JO5F2
"They sound good for the price - but both stopped working on me, the first within a few months, the second within a couple of weeks.  The sound isolating earbuds have a tendency to pop off - and there aren't spares provided, just alternative silicon earbuds which don't isolate the sound very well. NIce carrying case.",B01G8JO5F2
Great Product,B01G8JO5F2
Good quality earphones they do not slip. Only lasted one year and I took very good care of them,B01G8JO5F2
"Really good Bluetooth, comfortable and clear. Keep on and make a lot of business!!",B01G8JO5F2
I have had my senso headphones for at least a year now. They have great sound and stay in place even when I jump rope. They connect easily and the volume button is super easy access. Get these ones for sure! We have two pairs in our household.,B01G8JO5F2
"Great Headset, Use It To Workout At The Gym With No Problems, Great Battery Life.",B01G8JO5F2
I love the earbuds but I wear glasses and they don’t fit quite right around my ears at times. The sound quality is good. I would order again.,B01G8JO5F2
"It’s unbelievable headphones by this price !!!<br />I can’t believe that , amazing battery life , bass and amazing noise cancellation,, I’m so excited with it",B01G8JO5F2
"They don't have the highest quality sound for music, but I did used to wear them in the gym and they were adequate. Now I use them at my desk for Zoom meetings and they are perfect. Cuts out all the background noise in the office and the microphone works great too. During meetings I can turn my camera off, get up and go stretch a little, get a cup of tea in the kitchen, stand on the back steps of the building, all without losing the conversation. I've just bought a second pair for my daughter as mine are still going strong after 3 years!",B01G8JO5F2
I needed a new headset for working out at the gym. First I purchased an armband to hold my s9 so I wouldn't loose it. My next step was a headset. The Senso was supposed to be one of the top 5 price wise. I agree!!,B01G8JO5F2
"I did not want noise cancelling so not a problem,  when outside if windy there is noise which makes it difficult to hear but I do like them overall",B01G8JO5F2
Used with iPhone 7s+...perfect combo!,B01G8JO5F2
"Item arrived very quickly. have only used 1 time, it was easy to bluetooth connect. Sound is fine for me. Besides the headphones, it also came with a phone holder for your car and a credit card holder that you attach to the back of your phone case.""",B01G8JO5F2
"Sometimes it works, It must be the connection problem.",B01G8JO5F2
"I really liked the head phones while they lasted. Sound quality is good, they fit well and stayed in my ears, charged quickly and lasted a while. However the charger port in the R ear piece broke loose inside the unit at only 2 months old making them unable to be charged. I do use them 4 days a week in the gym, at work, and for hands free talking while driving, and changing every night, guess they just could hold up to the heavy use.",B01G8JO5F2
Great product. Reasons noted above,B01G8JO5F2
I would have given these a 5 star but the blue tooth connection keeps disconnecting and reconnecting. Its annoying.<br />The sound quality is good for the price.,B01G8JO5F2
"Me gusta mucho el sonido, y que se conecta rápido",B01G8JO5F2
Ear buds a little large.,B01G8JO5F2
"Its a great deal, and these are very comfortable to wear unfortunately the battery life pooped out after one week. The car charger that is included has been very handy, I was charging them on my way to the gym. It got to the point where they wouldn't turn on unless I pulled them in, even for a few minutes. Now, the blue light will indicate a full charge however, they won't even turn on. I have tried resetting them several times. I dealt with the poor battery life for quite some time, but it times for me to move on to a different product. For the price, there is a lot included with these ear buds, but be prepare for them to not last very long.",B01G8JO5F2
"I'm really quite impressed with the headphones. The sound is nice, the noise cancellation is quite good. The only minor complaint I have (and it's very small) is that I wish the cord connecting the two headphones was an inch, maybe two, longer. I have a big head, doncha know. ;) (And even that probably isn't a real problem - it may just be the fact that I haven't used the cord enough for it to straighten out from when it was in the packaging.) Definitely a product worth purchasing.",B01G8JO5F2
"I love these ear buds. They are everything they described in the description. They fit nicely in my ears and I can adjust them with ease. Although, I could not get them to pair on one of my devices,  believe it was my phone not being compatible with the ear buds but they were on my new phone. I just love them!",B01G8JO5F2
"Great for general use. Mowing, running, driving and working. A very cost effective option for anyone who doesn't require an expensive name brand product.<br /><br />Microphone works well for calls and the buttons all integrated fine with android. No complaints for a product around the twenty dollar range.",B01G8JO5F2
"I ordered 2 pair in the past and my kids inherited them. Being they work great for them, I ordered 2 pair for my wife and me.",B01G8JO5F2
This product was great 3 years ago when I purchased it last. The first pair died so I purchased another. Sadly the quality went really down hill. It has trouble connecting and randomly shuts off. Extremely frustrating.,B01G8JO5F2
"They did what I wanted them to do, which was to listen to audible books. I like them so much when my dog chewed off the ear buds, I bought another set. Pairing was also very easy once I read the directions.",B01G8JO5F2
"The headphones are good, I enjoyed it and they are also cheap in quality",B01G8JO5F2
Use the headphones at the gym.  They are great!!,B01G8JO5F2
I like everything about senso.,B01G8JO5F2
It died after getting wet. I bought them because they were water proof and they dont work anymore.,B01G8JO5F2
"I ordered this as a gift for a friend who goes to the gym almost daily. At the time he received it, he was still using a standard wired pair of earbuds, and I noticed how tangled they would get during his workouts. Ever since he received this product, he hasn’t used anything else. It stays out of sight and out of mind while he’s lifting, and is a great value for the price.",B01G8JO5F2
Noise cancelation is GREAT!<br />I can’t hear a word my wife is saying...,B01G8JO5F2
Good quality headphone,B01G8JO5F2
"I am using the headphones to listen to podcasts in Spanish as part of my language learning experience. The headphones allow me to hear clearly, even over a lot of noise - such as when I am mowing the lawn.",B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these for my boyfriend to workout with and he is beyond happy, and satisfied with this product!",B01G8JO5F2
This is the second and last one I buy. The first one lasted 3 years then the charger plug broke inside and now the second one I purchased in October broke in the same place within 2 months.,B01G8JO5F2
"I bought a pair of these about four years ago, used them weekly if not daily. Very water resident, battery life was amazing, sound was awesome; plenty of bass and treble. Range was great, connection, atmospheric noise reduction was great. All of a sudden they were gone. Don’t know what happened to them, must have set them down at the gym or dropped out my bag, I don’t know. Ordered another pair because I had such a good experience with the first pair. Quality in hand was greatly inferior. Just felt like cheap plastic. Not nearly as much bass and max volume was less. Battery life seemed to be lacking. Then, all of a sudden, the charger port came lose in the earpiece and couldn’t be charged anymore. So, ordered another pair thinking maybe I just got a fluke crap pair. New pair is here. Feels about the same as broken pair, sound is the same, seems to stop charging before it’s done charging, reception/connection to device is garbage. I lose connection to my phone while it’s in my pocket when I used to be able to basically mow my lawn while my phone was in the house.",B01G8JO5F2
"I like that they are wireless,  great sound. I was a little concerned at first because the ear loops seemed large, but it appears they will decrease to my ear size",B01G8JO5F2
"It was a good deal! Good battery life. High quality sound. Also, it comes in a full package with two other accessories and more! It is really a complete package. I loved it!",B01G8JO5F2
Good stuff. No issues.,B01G8JO5F2
Did not serve my purpose for buying them. You are definitely getting what you pay for. Not great quality!,B01G8JO5F2
amazing quality for the price,B01G8JO5F2
Great for a quick run or trip to the gym good value,B01G8JO5F2
Recommend it,B01G8JO5F2
Battery life only about 3 hrs,B01G8JO5F2
"loved these. They work, sound incredible and ccx easy to connect",B01G8JO5F2
"I was hoping that these would work under my motorcycle helmet, but they stick out too far to fit.<br /><br />The zipper on the case broke on day 2.<br /><br />On the plus side, the pairing was simple, the fit is comfortable and the sound is not bad for earbuds.  Full sound, maybe a little bass heavy to convince people that they're better than they are, but overall Im impressed with the quality.",B01G8JO5F2
Bluetooth headset sounds amazing. Everyone can hear me with clarity and the music quality is out of this world!,B01G8JO5F2
I bought  them  a while  ago. Then wanted to use them and nothing . Won't charge. Just nothing,B01G8JO5F2
Bought this to replace a lost pair definitely worth the price its a great deal,B01G8JO5F2
I used it for few days. Battery life is good. Sound quality is not that good. I feel right earbud has better sound than left.  Very delicate...ear piece broke after using few times,B01G8JO5F2
Great product . Very satisfied!,B01G8JO5F2
"Great quality, I also like the way it fits in the ears comfortably",B01G8JO5F2
"I've only one issue it seems the right 'foam' ear piece is easy to come off its setting.  Sound is great, I really like the fully adjustable over the ear fasteners.",B01G8JO5F2
AMAZING product,B01G8JO5F2
Great earbuds for the price.  Pair easily and good sound quality.,B01G8JO5F2
"Why you should buy these?<br />I bought 7 of them in total! For me , friends and family. Used them for 2 years. Pretty rough usage. In the bag. In the helmet. In the gym and where not! Still survived for a good two years before one year stopped working. I mean, what more can one expect! Absolutely amazing earphones and even better service! They quickly and promptly respond and resolve anything which they can ASAP! They sent me a replacement the moment I informed them that one ear had stopped working for a 6 month old earphone! I'm a senso guy now! I just keep buying and will keep buying these!",B01G8JO5F2
"CONS<br />They are constantly unpairing and repairing, so you miss sound and get the obnoxious “pairing” voice all the time. The microphone quality is poor - it sounds like you’re in a cave. They are not comfortable to wear for extended periods. My husband refuses to wear them, they are so uncomfortable.<br /><br />PROS<br />They stay in your ears even when upside down in a yoga pose. The sound quality is good. They hold a charge.",B01G8JO5F2
Nothing! I love it!,B01G8JO5F2
"We purchased these earphones almost 2 years ago. After ten months of use the button malfunctioned and the earphones were useless, I contacted the manufacturer and they were very helpful. All I had to provide was the order info and a picture to show the damaged earphones. They honored the 1 year warranty and we received a replacement within a few days. The headphones are great for anyone who needs handsfree communication or listening to music, good quality at an affordable price.",B01G8JO5F2
The ear hooks are CHEAP - one stopped working and the bud won't stay in my ear when I move (the wire inside the hook broke).  The headphones are less than 2 months old and I used them very normally and carefully.  I called the company and sent in an email with photos (as instructed) and they told me I broke it so it was not covered by warranty.  Really????  I've own many other brands in the past many years - never had a problem (these were a gift for Christmas).  AWFUL customer service and AWFUL product.,B01G8JO5F2
Great product!!!,B01G8JO5F2
"UPDATE#3: Replaced pair having major connectivity issues (cutting in an out of sound with phone 1ft distance) and customer service is unresponsive. I bought another kind of the same headphones and those have stopped working as well, both in less than a year. With the amount of money I spent on these different pairs I could have put it towards better headphones which I'll have to buy anyway.<br /><br />UPDATE#2:<br />registered the product on the Senso website and contacted them regarding the issue and the 1-year warranty. They were very quick to respond and asked for pictures of the damage, and info. they sent a new pair in a manila envelope with no headphone packaging. a bit odd to package it, but so far they work well. We'll see how long these last...<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />9 Months after I purchased these headphones, they broke. The section connecting the earpiece to the rest of the ear set broke. Now I have to push them back together before using. After a few uses it comes out again and I have to push it back in again.<br /><br />OLD REVIEW:<br /><br />Overall this brand has lost quality over time.<br /><br />SHORT REVIEW:<br />-Bluetooth connection spotty<br />-Adjustable over earpiece is a mess<br />-Microphone overall terrible, and unusable if any noise is present<br />-Sound quality and battery life is decent<br /><br />MORE DETAILED REVIEW:<br /> I had a pair that lasted 3 years, set in place over the earpiece, and good Bluetooth connection (sometimes I would leave the room and return with the connection still intact). The microphone was not great so I would use it mainly inside, but the overall sound quality was decent enough that it made the headphones decent to use. One day one ear stopped working, so I decided to get a new pair.<br /><br />Bought this pair and have had them for 8 months now. When I got them I immediately noticed 'adjustable' over earpiece was a mess, I have to adjust it pretty much every time it goes over my ear. The Bluetooth connection also isn't very great. Sometimes I turn my head with my phone in my pocket and the sound cuts in and out. This happens often, especially when I'm walking on the street. I have to press down more than once sometimes to get it to turn on as well.<br /><br />I still use the headphones but am seriously looking for a better quality option. If you need quick cheaper headphones this might be good but, but definitely not a long term solution.",B01G8JO5F2
"Really enjoyed using these headphones while doing yard work but after a few months of use, the charging port would no longer accept the cable to charge.  I'm assuming something is bent inside but I can't see it.  I felt they were comfortable, held a good charge and the sound quality was acceptable for what I used them for.  However, due to the charging port issue, I would not purchase again.",B01G8JO5F2
Wireless must I say more,B01G8JO5F2
"It was a good product and it exceeded my expectations. Small issue i faced with the Bluetooth connection, as it breaks up sometimes i am not able to hear the song properly while i am doing the running.<br /><br />Overall, i am happy with the product and I bought another one for my friend as well.",B01G8JO5F2
I would highly recommend these for someone that wants some good sound quality and also lives somewhere where it rains a lot (since they're water proof).,B01G8JO5F2
"I've owned a few pair (Over the ear and in the ear) BT headphones over the last 10 years.  These are the best I've owned so far because of the sound, size and cost.  The ONLY con for me would be the battery life.  I can only get about 2 days (avg 5 hours per day).  I use them when I ride, my bike or catch the train into work and while at work.  I don't use them at home because there's no need to.  The buyer would like these.  I didn't buy the ear plugs because I'm too afraid of loosing them (1 or both)..",B01G8JO5F2
"I go through wireless earbuds about twice a year.  These were good when they worked.  About 9 months of use and I had to get a replacement under warranty.  Second d set lated a little longer.  A little better longevity then other brands.  However, I still think these should things should last longer.",B01G8JO5F2
Very good ear buds. Fit good and sound good.,B01G8JO5F2
"We have bought these twice now. My husband loves them and uses them all the time. They last for a good while and for the price, you can't beat it!",B01G8JO5F2
"I have previously purchased a pair of these headphones, and was very happy.  Unfortunately, I ended up losing them, and so decided to repurchase them.  Something has changed.  The ear-hooks are now so weak, they don't effective work as a ""hook"".  They too easily just bend out of shape.  I used to have no problem running with my old pair... but with this new pair, I can't even keep them in my ears while working out on a bench.  Additionally, with this new pair, I have to charge them much more frequently.  Right now, I have to charge them about every other day.",B01G8JO5F2
"These don't stay in my left ear, even with the smallest ear piece. I've tried every angle and cannot get them to stay in.",B01G8JO5F2
"Great sound for the price, highly recommend !",B01G8JO5F2
They will not hold a charge.  Once you charge and put in storage case.  The charge will not last!,B01G8JO5F2
"So generally, I have to say I really like these headphones, especially for the incredibly affordable price I paid for them. The sound is great, with the caveat that they really have to be right in your ear to get the good sound, otherwise it sounds a bit hollow. This might just be a me problem as when I've gone to try to purchase more expensive wireless headphones in the past, I always have to tell the retailer that my ears are small and shaped much differently than the ""standard"" ear. They never believe me, and then are surprised when it falls off. The hook on these headphones helps mitigate that issue, but it's still a bit of a problem for me. The hooks can adjust, but are too big for my ears. Nevertheless, they do the job. Hold charge for a few days and work for what I need.",B01G8JO5F2
Great sweat-proof earbuds for my daily runs.  The battery life is pretty good too!,B01G8JO5F2
"When first bought these headphones, I loved them (good sound, easy to use, decently long charge).  My first set last almost a year, which, for the price seemed reasonable. However, subsequent purchases have lasted less long (the next two lasted six months each, and my most recent set lasted only a couple of months). The problem is that the earphones stop working, and/or die early (despite being recently charged) and/or the functions (pause, skip track, turn on/off) stop working.  I'm sad, as I really liked these, but the short life is becoming frustrating and I will be buying another brand.",B01G8JO5F2
Best $23 I've spent in a long time!,B01G8JO5F2
I love these headphones. Sound quality is way better than I expected. I can use them 4 or 5 times at the gym before recharging.,B01G8JO5F2
Great headphones for a great price. Highly recommended.,B01G8JO5F2
"I think this product is wonderful. It's sturdy, price is fair and the sound quality is outstanding.",B01G8JO5F2
They are perfect for my needs,B01G8JO5F2
Bought two for my wife and I over two years ago to use while exercising in the gym.  Use them for ~1 hr 5-7x/week.  No problems so far.  Connects quickly and sounds ok to us.  I like that they are secure on our ears unlike ear buds which we cannot stand. We are not audiophiles just looking for a quality sound for a reasonable price.  Recommend.,B01G8JO5F2
"This is my 7th pair of bluetooth headsets,  give or take.  These are definitely of better quality and have been working great thus far. Im very excited to see how they hold up over time!",B01G8JO5F2
very good sound quality.,B01G8JO5F2
"This newer headset is awesome. Long battery life. I use it on my phone, TV and entertainment center.",B01G8JO5F2
Great sound but battery life is a bit low. 4hrs aprox.,B01G8JO5F2
None,B01G8JO5F2
"I ordered  this one and the anger sound core, this senso had the best sound vs anker. This is audible at a distance of 27 ft and then drops further. Anker was good upto 65 ft of distance but even with loudest volume it was hard to hear from the anker. Conclusion I tested both the headphones and senso this model was a he best in sound quality, nice cancellling. I would definitely recommend this one. It is 5 days of use since I bought and I am happy so far.",B01G8JO5F2
"Been buying these since they first came out, I wear them to workout, to run (including running in the rain), and at work.  Sound quality is good enough, not great but I'm okay with it.",B01G8JO5F2
"These headphones worked fine in the beginning. The main problem I had with these were sweating. As soon as I started sweating (in the gym) one side was constantly slipping off. It was extremely frustrating. Then there were a few times when the sound didn't work. Again, they worked well in the beginning but over time some flaws were revealed. I feel like the classic big headphones are the only thing that would work best for me in the gym.",B01G8JO5F2
"I specifically bought these headphones because they are meant to be waterproof. I used them once, and they died before I finished my first lap. Unrelated, I didn’t think they were very comfortable. On the plus side, if you’re not intending to use in/around water, sound quality was decent for the price.",B01G8JO5F2
I've been using these for about a week now.  The sound quality is good and they connect immediately to my phone.  Both factors are vary important to me.  The noise cancelling effect is okay too.,B01G8JO5F2
"The product is fantastic. Great price. It has exceeded my expectations. Great battery life, and really good sound quality.<br />Seller was also very great. Item was quickly shipped and received on time. I would definitely use them again.",B01G8JO5F2
Very pleased with the product. I do not know what Moisture Wicking. I do not comment on that.  Thanks,B01G8JO5F2
"Battery life doesn't last a gym workout,  charging ports defective.",B01G8JO5F2
Had a little snag with my earbuds and senso quickly resolved the problem these earbuds are awesome and customer support is on point and great and I Highly recommend this product. Buy them you won't regret it,B01G8JO5F2
Perfect fit for my teen. Also good sound,B01G8JO5F2
"I have now purchased several of the Senso Headphones.  They sound is great but you need to make sure they are properly seated in your ear to hear the full dynamic range the headphones can produce.  Sound is clear and has plenty of volume.<br />I use them all the time, especially at the gym.  I bought a pair for my wife and she really likes them as well.<br />For the price, it is hard to imagine there is a better pair out there.  Just need to make sure the battery is charged which doesn't take too long.  Usually about 30 minutes to fully charge when the battery is completely drained.  With a full charge, they can last anywhere from 6 to 10 hours.<br /><br />Overall, I am quite happy with the Senso headphones and highly recommend them.",B01G8JO5F2
Loving them so far.,B01G8JO5F2
"This is the second time I've purchased the Senso Bluetooth Headphones.  My first pair lasted 2 years, the second pair lasted less than 5 months.  The headphones started turning off, would restart, but only last a minute before turning off again.  I'll be searching for a better better quality product this time.",B01G8JO5F2
Bought these as a gift. My grandson loved them.,B01G8JO5F2
"The sound quality was like static. Contacted the company to let them know, and they said that maybe it will work better with more use. Then they stopped working all together. All within two months.<br /><br />Update, 1/15/20:<br />After being contacted by SENSO here on amazon, I spent the last few weeks having an email back-and-forth with them, they ultimately gave me a 5% off code if I want to purchase something again. Spoiler, I won't.",B01G8JO5F2
I use these headphones while running. They are comfortable in my ear and I like that I can adjust the ear strap behind my ear where I need it. They are great for someone that enjoys listening to music or podcasts hands free. I like that I can accept and decline calls all from the earpiece as well as control the volume from them. Sound quality is very good and Bluetooth pairing was simple.,B01G8JO5F2
"Sound quality is decent, they are a little bulky and uncomfortable but nothing unbearable. The charger they included did not fit in the charging port but luckily I had one that will fit.",B01G8JO5F2
These are my second pair of these headphones and they are the best for the money hands down. Great distance with the Bluetooth and security around the ears means no problem running with them. Excellent customer service and speedy problem resolution. I highly recommend them.,B01G8JO5F2
"Had a pair of these that lasted me 2 years! They are an awesome, very quality set of earbuds for $30. They are very straight forward and easy to use. I used mine almost everyday for the last 2 years for the gym, and had 2 different, poorly made brands of headphones that barely made it through 6 months of use for 1 1/2 prior to when i got my first pair of Senso’s. Mine only quit working when i packed them too tightly in some luggage and damaged the connecting wire so music only came in from the right earbud. I have no doubt they would have kept trucking along for another year or so if it wasn’t for user-error. Only complaint is the little rubber piece that holds the wires together comes off very easily and is quite hard to find after losing it. Already bought my second pair of Senso’s to replace my damaged ones, highly recommend these.",B01G8JO5F2
"I bought my first pair of these in May 2018, and they were fantastic-- 8 hour battery, good sound quality, snug fit, good price. I then bought a second pair for my wife in 2021, and they are now clearly more cheaply made. The sound quality isn't as good, the housing material is cold hard plastic (the old ones seem to have a softer coating, maybe vinyl?), the button is a bit loose so it clicks loudly, and the voice that announces power on/off and connected/disconnected is now so loud it's literally painful regardless of your volume setting. I can tell when my wife turns them on or off in the other room because the ""power on"" voice is so loud.<br /><br />I would have recommended the pair I got in 2018 to everyone, and I would not recommend the 2021 version to anyone. Unfortunately my 2018 pair just stopped working (it is now 2022, so about 4 years after purchase). The show up as charged 100%, but they immediately shut down after being turned on. I won't be purchasing these again.",B01G8JO5F2
It's a good buy for the price. The sound quality and battery life are ok.,B01G8JO5F2
"Very happy with these. Worked and had great life out of the box. Took a nice long walk without needing a charge, with using them on and off I can get an 8hr day at work and the range is decent i can get over 20 or 30 feet away from my phone using them so I can leave my phone charging and listen to my music or podcasts.",B01G8JO5F2
"It worked well for 10 months or something. Then, first you will see minor problems like button for playing next song is not working. So for few months you will use phone to change song. You will feel its a minor fault and still be happy about it. Then, after few months around a year of buying, you will find now the volume is low. You will think, may be it was not charged well. Next time you charge well and viola volume is back to normal. Now after a year of buying, the volume will be permanently lower and the next song button not working. So, you will have to buy a new one now. Throw the junk, create more electronic garbage every year for lovely planet earth and again you are back to buying another one. May be they want to convey this is what you get in $30.<br /><br />Lesson: Good product if you want to put $30 every year. Or else buy a warranty and keep sending it back and forth. Basically, no peace for someone who wants to use only 1 hour of his day, 4 times a week during workout. I had higher hopes from it as I went for little more expensive one than many other cheaper products that were available. But now I regret my decision. I wouldn't buy it if its available even for $10 now.",B01G8JO5F2
Battery drops from 70 to<br />30% very quick and turns off,B01G8JO5F2
Good headphones.,B01G8JO5F2
Very good product for the price. No complaints.,B01G8JO5F2
"I got these on November of 2018 but within 6 months, my left earphone stopped working. No more sound comes out of that ear. It also is starting to have bad bluetooth connectivity. It takes about a minute for the earphones to connect to my device. While the connection is being made, it will give very scratchy, disconnected sound while my music is trying to play.<br /><br />The first six months were awesome, but for the low price point, i guess i cant expect a long-use  quality product..",B01G8JO5F2
So far they stay on! Always have a problem of them popping out of my ears. Sound is great.  Easy to use!,B01G8JO5F2
These headphones fit really tight in the ear as to create a sound vacuum.  Audio quality depends on how piece fits in ear.  if it doesnt fit right sounds like underwater.  If i had to buy again id spend at least $50 for something like this.,B01G8JO5F2
Great! GF loves them more then my beats,B01G8JO5F2
My first bluetooth headphones and I really like the untethered experience.,B01G8JO5F2
I love these. I've bought three pairs for my family. The base and treble rival my Beats at a fifth of the price.,B01G8JO5F2
I absolutely love these headphones. They are very comfortable to wear and easy to set up. The package comes with everything as described. You can chance up the eartip for an even higher level of comfort. They paired up nicely with my Samsung phone. They were a really good choice. Noise cancellation is top notch.,B01G8JO5F2
Great value for cheap price,B01G8JO5F2
"I really trusted the positive reviews of this headphones and decided to purchase these, because my old headphones died after using them for 3 years. Well, I made the purchase LESS THAN A MONTH AGO and the left side of the headphones DIED. I am very disappointed with this product and will not recommend. Plus, they do not stay on your ears when you are running. Frustrating.",B01G8JO5F2
Liked the headset and used for a few months.  Now they will not charge at all.  If you need a disposable set then these are ok. If you wanted a product for at least a year...look elsewhere.,B01G8JO5F2
"Had to return these.  The design forced wind into the ear, even when walking.",B01G8JO5F2
"This was my first pair of bluetooth headphones so I do not have anything to compare them to. They have excellent audio quality and good battery life. The case and multiple sized ear buds included are nice. My only complaint is that there is sometimes issues with the connectivity. A quick reset usually fixes it but its not exactly ideal. However, for the price these are a very great product and I will gladly put up with the minor issue. 4 stars.",B01G8JO5F2
I paid about $23 for the red button ones I've used for about a week now I give them 3 stars which means they are okay these are the first wireless earphones I use so I can't compare them to any other I like they are light have decent sound and stay connected most of the time. What I would don't like is the battery life they only last about two hours fully charged and that they have a blue light that blinks every five seconds when they are connected haven't used for running yet but I'm sure that it would not be a problem since there a hook that wraps around you ear.,B01G8JO5F2
"I like the headphones.  My only suggest is that the multi function button - power on and off as well as receiving a call - is extremely easy to press when you don't mean to do so.  This is because putting on the head phone is easiest by pushing exactly where that button is.  Even knowing that, I have inadvertently ended a phone call and had to call back several time.<br /><br />Other than that, I am delighted and truly appreciate the one year warranty as well as your followup to assure I am happy with the product.",B01G8JO5F2
"I love the convenience of these headphones. I use them when I am doing chores around the house and appreciate that the button gives me an easy way to pause my podcast when my wife asks me a question. :) The battery life is sufficiently long; I can usually go a little over a week between charges, listening to about an hour of podcasts a day, give or take.",B01G8JO5F2
Works great during training season. A overall great product. Perfect clarity outdoors.,B01G8JO5F2
"Didn’t fit right, sound quality is decent, but don’t fit right and constantly have to adjust. Even after trying all the different size attachments.",B01G8JO5F2
"Customer service is terrible. The sound went out in my headphones while they were still under warranty. Customer service told me to do a reset. When i told them the reset didnt work they just stopped replying to me, and now im stuck with a broken pair of headphones.",B01G8JO5F2
The headset charger didnt fit the headset,B01G8JO5F2
Didn’t like them at all,B01G8JO5F2
"Work well.  Battery lasts a long time.  Comfort is pretty good.  Connection is strong.  Phone operation is so-so.  Overall, a good buy for someone looking for solid and affordable bluetooth headphones.",B01G8JO5F2
Good bass loud long long battery  life,B01G8JO5F2
music,B01G8JO5F2
I like,B01G8JO5F2
"I ordered 2 models of Senso headphones; the A1 and the S-250. Although the appear to be the same model, they sounded completely different. The S-250 sound when playing music was muddy with distorted bass even when I turned the bass EQ down on my iPhone 7 Plus it still sounded bad. I fired up the A1 set and the sound was much more balanced without the distorted bass or muddy mids. I returned the S-250s.<br /><br />I had a change to really give the A1's a workout a few days ago and wore them while working in the yard for hours. I found them to sound great and be very comfortable with no loss of connection to the phone in my pocket. I did find that the wire kept rubbing on my neck and pulled out my left earphone. Next time I plan to use a cinch button to help hold the headphones in place. I also recommend the memory foam tips instead of the silicon tips. They do a better job of sealing the ear canal and help them stay in place. All in all I'm very please!",B01G8JO5F2
"Ear pieces were two different sizes, specifically the silicon loop that is not adjustable which is supposed to fit around your ear. The right one was too large for any person to wear. I doubt Jim Carey would have even been able to fit the loop around his ear and the ear bud in it.",B01G8JO5F2
"Everyday use, sound and feel great. Working great. connected to my bluetooth right off.",B01G8JO5F2
The headphones has a great quality sound but the system to place them around your ears is not the best. It doesn't stay in place. Battery last a long time.,B01G8JO5F2
-Easy to pair<br />-stays charged long enough for my use (gym workouts)<br />-The over the ear piece is easy to form to my ears<br />--They stay on while I run and jump<br />-Audio is good enough for me,B01G8JO5F2
Works but sound is very distorted. You get what you pay for.,B01G8JO5F2
Excelente relación precio calidad,B01G8JO5F2
"So I had a pair of a previous model that lasted two years and I loved them. When they finally broke after one too many falls I bought a new pair.  They are still great but I am not fond of the adjustable earhooks. I can never seem to get them just right and they are always messed up after storage which makes me worry they will break from all the movement. I store them in the carrying case but it doesn't take much for them to snag on any little thing and pull them out of alignment.  But aside from that design issue, I love the way they fit in my ear. The sound quality is great for listening to podcasts and the battery lasts a long time.",B01G8JO5F2
They kinda don't like to stay in ear but they work great,B01G8JO5F2
"Works much better than most of the other brands on Amazon. This is probably the 5th one I've had to purchase and didn't have to return for being defective or having lack luster battery life. The only other company who had one this good was LetsComm but they are longer on Amazon.<br /><br />It's cheap, resists water and oil and sounds decent. Also has a decent amount of range when away from the phone. If it can last atleast a year of abuse will definitely purchase more from this company.",B01G8JO5F2
sound from my phone is clear and understandable even at low volume levels. This headset is surprising comfortable and stays in place as I move about.,B01G8JO5F2
"These are great Bluetooth headphones. This is my second pair as my first were accidentally thrown out. I used the foam ear bud replacements provided with the kit which actually improve sound, cancel outside noise better, and keep everything in place. Great buy. I highly recommend.",B01G8JO5F2
I was concerned that the over-the-ear design might not work with my eyeglasses but no problem.  And they are so much better that my 'stick these in your ears' wired earbuds which I frequently had to adjust to get the best sound.  I use them most while walking the gym's treadmill - a little classic rock encourages the exercise!  A quality product - thanks.,B01G8JO5F2
The headphones are satisfactory. After 6 months of using them the sound in the left earpiece started to fade a bit but for the price I paid the performance was pretty good.,B01G8JO5F2
the battery life is too short.,B01G8JO5F2
I work in an office that is noisy I love these to listen to music and love that they will play all day at least 8 hours on a charge.  Best headphones for this price.,B01G8JO5F2
Perfect headphones!!!,B01G8JO5F2
"Within one year of receiving my headphones, the battery will not charged. I sent three messages to the seller and I only received one response back. Their response is to reset and disconnected my device. After I reset and disconnected my device, the headphones still will not charge.",B01G8JO5F2
Love these,B01G8JO5F2
"Great product but the battery life is misleading. Mine will say 30% and then a few minutes later they'll say battery low and it will be 10% and within 5 minutes, they will die. Can get at least 5 or 6 hours off one charge, just remember to charge them.",B01G8JO5F2
A good earphone for the price and work very well.  I have two pair now.,B01G8JO5F2
Good,B01G8JO5F2
They only last 5 month.,B01G8JO5F2
"""I love this product it doesn't come out or fall they feel good i had to get my cousin some",B01G8JO5F2
"Wear these all the time when working out, love em!!!",B01G8JO5F2
Easy to connect.  Friendly and fit the ears perfect.<br />Good product.,B01G8JO5F2
"Honestly, I'm not normally one to put much effort into rating an amazon item unless it is truly spectacular. I have been happy with these headphones since I purchased them 2 years ago. I haven't written my review until now because about 3 weeks ago I accidentally left them in a pair of shorts that got washed in my washing machine. Thinking I was definitely going to have buy a new pair, I still gave it a long shot chance to dry before purchasing a new pair. Sure enough after 2 days of drying I charged them and they started right up with zero defect. Truly the best purchase I have made on amazon for the little money I had to invest.",B01G8JO5F2
Use them often...good sound quality and versatile.,B01G8JO5F2
These keep a charge very nicely.  They cancel noise very effectively.,B01G8JO5F2
"Good product, great value! They were easy to pair with my phone and have an excellent range. I'm very please!",B01G8JO5F2
"I lost my airpods and needed a replacement, didn't want anything too expensive (I can't trust myself). These are pretty good. They mostly stay on nice and tight while running, need one or two occasional adjustments, but nothing terrible. I think the sound quality is great for a running headphone. You can't go wrong with these!",B01G8JO5F2
Over all good but stopped working not able to charge after  4 months and not the charger is is definitely the head set,B01G8JO5F2
Stopped connecting to Bluetooth after 1 month,B01G8JO5F2
Currently enjoying the headphone,B01G8JO5F2
"It's ugly, clunky (large) but functional.  A lot more awkward than the ones that just drop into the ""pod chargers"", but that also lack the over-ear hook which is what I was trying to get.  Don't think I'd recommend it, but it's been doing what I needed it to do.",B01G8JO5F2
"The sound is fine (not great, but fine), however the quality of the product itself is very very poor. In the one year that I've had these, I have had to order replacements 4 times...the warranty is now up so, that's the end of my run with senso. I can say that their customer service was prompt, and they always sent out replacements without question when my headphones would break. that's worth two stars for sure. i definitely would not reccommend these headphones though",B01G8JO5F2
"I was able to use them literally one time. Call their cs & you get a middle eastern guy that you can't understand who doesn't comprehend anything you're saying. Explained that they were once paired & worked great & now nothing. He asked if I'd like to reorder, I declined & told him I felt it was a waste of money as they're junk. They fit perfectly in my ears unlike the others I've tried so I'm very disappointed. Don't waste your money. You'll get Habib who doesn't think you know how to charge or turn on electronics.",B01G8JO5F2
The noise cancelation isn't good. I got a warrantee and I was unable to get a hold of anyone via email. Headset stopped working at one point working again. But the static noise is awful my customers complain alot they can't hear me.,B01G8JO5F2
DO NOT PURCHASE Item does not last long,B01G8JO5F2
Se desactiva con cualquier moviento del telefono,B01G8JO5F2
They're super uncomfortable they keep falling off my ears.<br />It was missing a part and you havr to have the phone really close or it will disconnect.,B01G8JO5F2
"Just tried them out at the gym today, so far work great, the silicon adjustable fit is really nice because i have big ears and headphones never fit me",B01G8JO5F2
Good product for the price.,B01G8JO5F2
It has been working well thus far. I really liked the additional things it came with like the clip and the phone magnet. The sound quality is decent and when I'm in the gym it's fine.,B01G8JO5F2
"I received my first set as a gift and loved them.  When those went belly up I purchased these.  Identical item by part and model number however, definitely NOT tye same quality. These feel cheaply made.  Material is different.  I'll be surprised if they last as long as my first set did.",B01G8JO5F2
The bendable frame around the ears.,B01G8JO5F2
These were a gift for my son he's really pleased with them he says they work really well and the charge lasts.,B01G8JO5F2
"The only slight issue I had with these headphones was initially the fit took some time to get used to. Other than that zero complaints, great value for money",B01G8JO5F2
These bluetooth headphones are great for working out; the sound quality is very good and they are comfortable and easy to use. Senso offered very good customer support when one of my two pair weren't working properly!,B01G8JO5F2
"These come in handy for working out and listening to a device while walking around even other rooms. I clean the earpieces regularly, so I don't worry about moisture much any more.<br />The volume adjustment is a little hard to deal with, but it works.<br />No pairing issues.<br />They don't hold really tight to the ears. (+/-?)<br />The battery seems to last all day, at least.",B01G8JO5F2
"Amazing sound quality, good battery life, and they truly honor your 1 year warranty for any defects. Best part is that they actually stay in my ear!",B01G8JO5F2
They are great if you don’t plan to move around. I use them to workout outside and i can hear the wind.,B01G8JO5F2
"Lasted a few months past the end of the warranty period. Then the volume buttons, which are also used for pairing, stopped working. Now completely useless and worthless.",B01G8JO5F2
"It is a bit of a distraction to have to keep adjusting them. With the bendable wires that shape how they are positioned, they don't stay in place and need to be occasionally repositioned. Not a deal breaker though. I enjoy them very much. Not such good quality for talking on the phone though. Everyone complains when I would do that and so I stopped.",B01G8JO5F2
I use it when walking for exercise and around the house.  works very well except occasionally when I am on a different floor of the house than the cell phone listening to pandora.,B01G8JO5F2
"You get what you pay for. If you don't mind one earbud not working or just barely working then these are for you. Took them out of the box, charges them and within the first hour of listening to Pandora, the left ear went silent. Not happy",B01G8JO5F2
Great sound quality. Noise cancelling. Comfortable to wear.,B01G8JO5F2
"Product worked fine until a week after the Amazon return window expired, at which point the on/off button broke.<br /><br />Senso were very quick to send me a replacement.... hoping this one works longer!",B01G8JO5F2
Headphones are not working anymore. -.-,B01G8JO5F2
Purchased for my daughter and she loves them.,B01G8JO5F2
Overall a very good product for the price you pay. I have been using it now for 2 months without any problem during my workouts.<br /><br />Sound quality and noise cancellations are not great but still a good bargain product.,B01G8JO5F2
3rd time purchasing this brand and probably my last (insert sad face). The issue I have is with the design. New style has adjustable/flexible ear wraps (the rubber part that goes around the ear) which sounds like a great idea but they are sooo malleable that they easily get bent out of shape and never really sit on my ears well.,B01G8JO5F2
"Pros: as earphones, they are small so you can wear them and still lean your head against something like a pillow.<br />Cons: the audio started to crackle after just a few months of use and the quality degraded quickly until it became simply unusable.",B01G8JO5F2
Not working after 1 week. I had the headphones and used for 4 workouts on my bike and they will not charge. I have tried to contact the company 2 times and there was no reply.,B01G8JO5F2
Great headphones that come with a nice complimentary carrying case and extra ear bud covers. Great quality product. Great sound. The hook that curves around your ear is bendable so it gives a custom fit for who ever is wearing them. Also can use as bluetooth for phone. Would definitely buy again.,B01G8JO5F2
I enjoy them so far. Good customer service and warranty.,B01G8JO5F2
I like the packaging of the headphones very well put together. And I also I like how well they sound and the extra accessories that comes with them.,B01G8JO5F2
No retaining device for cord.,B01G8JO5F2
"Just what my daughter recommended, easy pairing ease of use, good value!",B01G8JO5F2
"They are made of high quality materials. However any amount of interference between the device and the Bluetooth source usually cuts off the music, audio stutters and information is lost. Even just the act of bending down at the waist was enough to consistently disconnect my pairing and the sound would go to shit.  More disappointing is that any objects between you and the device will cut audio. A work desk. Sitting forward. Kneeling down.  The range is terrible, can't hold signal from my head to my pants pocket... garbage..<br />  but when it is connected how ever briefly it sounds pretty good.  Written from phone. Typos",B01G8JO5F2
Pretty good sound and reliable.  Sometimes very seldom the sound cuts out on one side.,B01G8JO5F2
"kept dying and having to return, a bunch of hassle for such mediocre headphones not worth the risk.",B01G8JO5F2
These headphones stopped working 8 months after I purchased them.,B01G8JO5F2
I think it's great ! It's pretty loud (the way I like it) and the packaging is great.,B01G8JO5F2
The headphones stopped pairing with any of my devices after only a couple weeks. Very disappointed that they only lasted this long-I will be switching back to Anker brand as those had much longer lifespan for me.,B01G8JO5F2
"Still getting used to them> So far, so good, except that the ear hooks could be more adjustable. Working on that. So far: solid product and appears to be great product support!",B01G8JO5F2
The Wow product,B01G8JO5F2
Rating is accurate. Headphones off hut in ear I have to take off to hear someone properly.fits well doesn't fall of during a Sprint or other work out movements. These bad boys are definitely water and sweat resistant!,B01G8JO5F2
Works great and good price,B01G8JO5F2
I bought these on March 2nd and they worked great until about two days again when they stopped turning on.  If they would have still worked this review would have been 5 stars. disappointed.,B01G8JO5F2
"Overall happy, you cant get any better for the money.",B01G8JO5F2
"He tenido una experiencia muy gratificante con este producto, tiene buena calidad y es muy practico.",B01G8JO5F2
"Worked for 4 months;  sound became so distorted after that time, the headphones were unusable.  I have reset them according to manufacturer instruction a dozen times, but after 5-20 minutes the distortion makes them non-functional.",B01G8JO5F2
Not as good sound as I expected,B01G8JO5F2
"These are great headphones for the $- they are inexpensive and I primarily bought them so I could listen to Audible books while working out so I thought “How good does that sound really have to be to listen to someone talking”- turns out they are fabulous for listening to music as well- Just as good as my $90 ones that fall out of my ears every 1/4 mile when I’m running or if I move to tie my shoe or pick up a weight.  I also have sort of small ears and I love that the ear hooks are totally moldable to wrap securely around my ears I put the strap in the back and I don’t notice it all- for the price, you really can’t go wrong.",B01G8JO5F2
Excelente más de un 100 padrisimo. Buen sonido,B01G8JO5F2
They were a birthday gift for my husband and he absolutely loves them,B01G8JO5F2
"I've had 5 BT buds..<br />these pair great<br />range great<br />Best battery life ive ever seen by far by far ..I could say 12 hrs no prob..sounds like over hype ..<br />its not..<br />comfortable and hooks are formable and stays how you want,,,great<br />sounds great<br />cable is not annoying ..lays flat,,<br />cable is not on the hook part,,Great<br />nothing I don't like",B01G8JO5F2
Na,B01G8JO5F2
"These fit well, and the sound quality is good. I use them for Netflix while on my bike trainer mostly, so indoors. They stay on firmly which was the main problem with my old earbuds.",B01G8JO5F2
I actually had to put a decent effort into getting these off once I put them on so when you're running or biking or whatever you're doing these things will not abandon you however I haven't tested the longevity of the battery yet but we shall see and they sound great lots of bass,B01G8JO5F2
"This is actually my second pair. I bought my first ones four years ago, and they have been great. The ear stem broke in my luggage somehow so I needed a replacement. No questions asked, I went right back to the Senso earbuds and ordered another pair. They come with different sized ""buds"" for fitting to the inside of your ear more appropriately. Bluetooth connection is strong. Buttons are well placed. Microphone picks up nice and clear.<br /><br />The only qualm I have may not have to do with these earbuds themselves, but sometimes when I don't have these connected to my phone I hear my phone ring and answer it only to realize I can't hear anything. After hanging up I try calling back but can't hear anything. Low an behold, somehow these earbuds have turned on and connected to my phone! So I was getting sound all along through the earbuds in my pocket and therefore couldn't hear anything through the headset itself. How did the earbuds get turned on? Was it automatically, or was the button pressed just right in my pocket?",B01G8JO5F2
Very good for the price ! I like how you can bend the ear loops to really fit your ear .,B01G8JO5F2
I ordered these for my father...because he loved the first pair so much and he loves these just as much...good job!,B01G8JO5F2
I’m new to Bluetooth headphones previously just using your standard earbuds until I just got sick of twisted tangled cords. These are a revelation and the best thing I’ve purchased in a long while. Things don’t stay in my ears well so I like the over the ear hook which is really comfortable. I wear these for 1-11/2 hours at the gym and never notice them. I can’t speak with experience about sound quality except to say they are better than your apple ear buds. Loudness is more than enough and there is some bass effect. For the money I would highly recommend,B01G8JO5F2
"For the summary: I love everything so far. I've been through Hell trying to find a decent pair of wireless ear buds, and I've finally found them.<br /><br />I was recommended these by a work colleague and friend whose advice I trust. So I decided to give these a shot. I've been burned before many times, so I was very happy when I received these and...<br /><br />...they actually worked! For longer than a week, even!<br /><br />Most of the ear buds I've purchased usually short out in a wire, or are riddled with other problems. For example, poor LED visibility; come on, I need to know if it's charged and it shouldn't take an act of God to show me this very basic information. Or, in one case, the ear buds wouldn't even hold a charge - well, I'm certainly gonna get real far with that setup! It's all supremely frustrating when it happens. I'm happy that I've found something that works!<br /><br />I am very impressed with the quality of the wire connector between the two - it looks and feels heavy-duty. The ear configuration is adjustable, and feels pretty good overall. It was weird to figure out at first, but I'm just stupid and after I figured them out it was easy. Charging time is breezy - I haven't had a chance to fully drain them of power yet but the two times I have charged them it's been quite quick at less than hour or so. I can't really remember the times off the top of my head, but  The LED indicator is actually visible and nice in these as well - the last two pairs I've purchased you could not clearly see the LED indicator. It was frustrating because I had to crane at different viewing angles to actually see if they had held a charge. These are quite the opposite.<br /><br />I was also very pleasantly surprised to receive a magnetic sticker, a magnetized base to hook my phone into in the car, a carrying case, and a wallet card holder along with the ear buds. I don't really need the wallet card holder, but I could see the usefulness of it. The case feels nice and is fairly high quality. It's nice for holding the other sized buds, as well as the charging cord. It has a inner mesh which has a good strength to it. However, I've used it sparingly. That is not for a lack of want and it's very nice - you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />The magnetic phone holder, on the other hand, I needed desperately. I am happy to report that that it's wonderful as well. The magnet is actually pretty strong despite its size, both on the base and the sticker that it attaches to on the phone. I was happy to see that there were two different size adjustments. It's designed to go into an air grill in your vehicle, and while I could see that being a problem (it is blocking airflow in one of the car grills), it's a fantastic trade-off and I love that thing about as much as the ear buds. A+++.<br /><br />Extremely content with my purchase. The designers obviously cared for the product and I'm elated I finally found ear buds that aren't lemons. If I need another pair of ear buds in the future, I know who I am turning to. Thank you!",B01G8JO5F2
Good product,B01G8JO5F2
"My headphone lasted about 1 yr and 2 months. It stopped working past week.<br /><br />While it was working, the sound was great, durable for workouts, and no problem with bluetooth connection.<br /><br />If you want something that lasts over time, invest few extra bucks and purchase other one.",B01G8JO5F2
"As soon as you take these outside, they get interference from something and start breaking up constantly.  Totally unusable outside.  I have had the same experience with other inexpensive bluetooth headphones.",B01G8JO5F2
I have run sweat and used these in the grocery store. Sounds great and durable,B01G8JO5F2
"I loved everything about my senso headphones,  i used to have them a couple years ago,now June 2019 decided to buy them again (Old ones i sold them) love the price and quality of them. Honestly they are better then a famous brand named beats by (***) don't go off just the brand.  I give it a 10/10 .",B01G8JO5F2
"They worked well, not perfect, but well enough-especially for the price. Until about 2 weeks ago the left bud stopped working altogether. I've tried resetting them, charging them, etc., but nothing works. The right bud still works fine but the left is silent.",B01G8JO5F2
"Good sound, seems to drown outside noise. Still working with ear tips to find a size that doesn’t fall out of my ear. This is a good value for what I’m getting, but I do not have a lot of control of the phone from your pieces, and they are a little bit prominent when they stick out of my ear. But for this price I can live with that.",B01G8JO5F2
Awesome buy,B01G8JO5F2
My husband love it,B01G8JO5F2
Amazing product and great price,B01G8JO5F2
"The only reason I am giving this product one star is because I can't give it any less. The carelessness of the seller is beyond anything I've seen. I took these out of the box and tried listening to them, and when I tried changing the volume it crashed and stopped working. I thought charging it would help, but it would intermittently lose contact and stop charging. It went straight to the garbage can, didn't even bother wasting my time returning it. For anyone considering, buying, think twice. I've had my fair share of experience with cheap Bluetooth headphones and I can guarantee you at this price it is far better to get wired headphones.",B01G8JO5F2
I bought these Best wireless Sports Earphones for my wife as a Xmas  gift she loves them she goes on a treadmill every morning these Earphones are ideal for her to talk and still have her hands on the treadmill it is also a quality product I would buy this product again I am very happy with my purchase!,B01G8JO5F2
"Worked great at first, but stopped working altogether after about 6 weeks of use",B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these so I could more easily work out. They are really comfortable, I was surprised. I don't know if I can change the settings, but they are plenty loud even at the lowest volume setting. As long as I don't accidentally have it higher it's at a good volume. The sound quality is great too.""",B01G8JO5F2
I just bought the head phones for my workouts and they are doing a great job as of the 3 times I used them so far. The only issue I’ve had is with phones is mild discomfort sometimes and when a song with good base comes on I have to lower the volume a little bit. But all in all not a bad pair of head phones.,B01G8JO5F2
"Really liked these at first. Sound is decent but aren’t noise cancelling. Wore them strictly for gym workouts. Over time the ride side started cutting out until it didn’t work any longer. After that it just went downhill. Budget friendly, but wouldn’t recommend.",B01G8JO5F2
Easy to setup (to bluetooth).,B01G8JO5F2
"...they sound great for my purposes.  They fit well and I can jog, train martial arts, really jump around.  They don't come loose.  Cord is not an inconvenience.  These are a great set of headphones for the price.<br /><br />Only con I have is that the bluetooth range feels more like ten feet before it starts to break up.  30' might be the absolute max range at which you can get a weak signal.  Playing music from my Samsung phone I get about 10'.  That's good enough for most of my purposes.",B01G8JO5F2
Worth every penny.!!! Very impressed!!!,B01G8JO5F2
"I’ve owned several pair of these Senso Blu-Tooth Earbuds with Outstanding results. They have great sound, they’re very comfortable to wear and the company has great customer service. Even after trying other popular blu tooth earbuds that are currently on the market, Hands Down Senso wins the contest with amazing sound, wounderful bass response, secure fit for all activities and especially the Price !!!",B01G8JO5F2
Ordered as a gift and was exactly as expected,B01G8JO5F2
paired quickly to cellphone.  comfortable and good sound quality.,B01G8JO5F2
Initially I loved the product. The sound was excellent and the battery life was so much better than the $100 headphones I bought last year. Then suddenly all I heard was “low battery..low battery.” Now it won’t even take a charge!!!,B01G8JO5F2
Easy to install and operate,B01G8JO5F2
"Fine sound quality with an intuitive and attractive design. Affordable without losing quality. Excellent fit and finish, though YMMV. I would recommend to anyone tired of getting their headphone cord yanked when running.",B01G8JO5F2
I use this product for the gym and can say that i have loved it. pretty good on the sound quality and durability in a busy gym.,B01G8JO5F2
Absolutely love them!,B01G8JO5F2
"They are pretty decent for the price, the bass isn’t as good as I would hope but for price what I expected.",B01G8JO5F2
I had a lot of trouble with the bud falling out and had to buy different pads.  Other than that it works great.,B01G8JO5F2
It has a terrible sound. The base is horrible,B01G8JO5F2
These headphones stay put while you are moving around.  Great sound!,B01G8JO5F2
Overall pretty good headphones. Cancels out most surrounding noise. Sound quality is pretty good. I only use it for working out.,B01G8JO5F2
It’s an ok pair of headphones. The sound is a little worse than standard apple earbuds. These are good for when I’m running tho.,B01G8JO5F2
Bought these and a different brand of Bluetooth wireless earphones called “let’s fit”. About the same price each. There were mixed reviews for both. But I for sure love this brand. You just have to adjust the sound through your phone for your liking. You can adjust the over the ear piece as well which I like about this brand. And they’re comfortable. They’re a little heavy for my liking. But over all sound and style I love them. And they charge super fast and they stay charged. Very nice.,B01G8JO5F2
"Nice sound quality, but it literally stopped charging after two weeks.  Sadly, that seems par for the course with this company as my last set made it approximately two months before the same thing happened.  Also, not much of a battery life.",B01G8JO5F2
My everyday workshop headphones. I have purchased 4 sets of these so far.,B01G8JO5F2
I like the ease of wearing them and the quality of the product for the price,B01G8JO5F2
It’s the older version. Good quality headphones . The s-255 are my fav,B01G8JO5F2
The over the ear loop is not adjustable and it keep falling off my ears when I am running.,B01G8JO5F2
I use them at home a lot.  I also love using them while I play tennis. They stay in my ears the whole time.,B01G8JO5F2
"I’ve been using this brand of headphones for the last six years. They are awesome and durable. My last pair lasted for 3 years and I use them every single day for mountain biking. There was one time when the mic wasn’t working on a new pair that I bought. Customer service was easy to reach, quick to replace it, no questions asked.",B01G8JO5F2
"Had high hopes this would be a great bluetooth headset but it failed.<br />It's supposed to reach 30 feet, but all I could get out of it was 3 feet and then it would get choppy and sometimes even lose connection.  I made sure everything was fully charged.  Reset to factory settings, re-paired with device, still the exact same problem.  Tried multiple times (with multiple devices) following the reset re-pair instructions but it did not help.  Clearly defective.<br /><br />I tried jogging with them and the sound of wind was not cancelled out at all, so not that impressed with the sound canceling claim either.<br /><br />2-star for decent sound and a good price - it would be great if it actually worked as they claimed.",B01G8JO5F2
Used them for a couple years for exercise. Good battery life and totally sweatproof.,B01G8JO5F2
"Long battery life, comfortable on my ears. The over the ear part tends to fall off ear tho",B01G8JO5F2
"I was expecting more from the headphones since they were listed as sport headphones.  They do not grip my ear like i was expecting and do not feel as secure as less expensive models.  I do like the wrap around feature but again, they do not feel as secure as i would like when running.  Good quality sound, extra ear buds nice and the carrying case also nice.  Great for walking!",B01G8JO5F2
I was excited to buy this product. It worked well for a few months and then just stopped working. I would not recommend these.,B01G8JO5F2
I am not confident the warranty dept will stand by their 1 yr warranty on these.  They are 2 months old and used 5 times.  Battery will not charge.  Connection issue or whatever but junk!  DO NOT BUY THIS BRAND!  I will update if they stand by their warranty they claim at 1 Year.,B01G8JO5F2
I got this as a gift for my mom she sad they are very clear stay charged for a long time and very easy to use,B01G8JO5F2
"Loved them, but everytime they say  battery low when they are on Like 60% then they turn off",B01G8JO5F2
"I truly loved these headphones, and on many levels and still would if...<br />They would last for one year.  They do not and will not and I am so disappointed.<br />I bought the first pair in 2018.  Before a year was up the headphones would no longer work.  One side started cutting in am out until that side no longer worked.  Fortunately, they offered a 1 year warranty so I contacted the seller and they sent me a replacement pair.  I registered the new pair on their site for the 1 year warranty and now...9 and a half months later guess what?? The replacement pair continuously cuts itself off every 30 seconds-2minutes.  I have followed the instructions for resetting them, disconnecting them from my device and “forgetting” them and reconnecting.  I have spent a lot of time trying everything to get them to work and they just won’t.  I contacted the seller again, mentioning when I registered the new pair and they said sorry, since it was a replacement pair I wasn’t eligible for the warranty.  They didn’t tell me this when I registered this pair.<br />I won’t be buying again.  I would love if they could have lasted for JUST ONE YEAR, but I guess that’s how they get you.",B01G8JO5F2
very good value for $$$. Owned for a few months and went bad but seller replaced under warranty.,B01G8JO5F2
They work well and are very comfortable. Easy to set up. Would buy again.,B01G8JO5F2
Used for working out for like 2 years now. Never any issue,B01G8JO5F2
Product works great while I exercise.,B01G8JO5F2
Can't say enough about this product it's the best I've went through so many Bluetooth this one 0 problems connect every time and sound is awesome not go wrong for the money cheap price for an expensive sound😊,B01G8JO5F2
"I have been through many sets of earphones used during workouts and had hoped this pair would stand up and last after reading such glowing reviews. WRONG the set initially worked well, paired easily, had good range but as in all others it no longer will accept a charge. Can't someone develop a set of bluetooth headphones that will last more than a couple of months???This pair lasted all of 2.5 months Big disappointment",B01G8JO5F2
"I got this product for use in gym, but I hardly used it 5 times altogether in this 3 month period.  My product support window expired two days back and my product doesn't even charge anymore.  I think they design the product to fail after just the support period.  A costly headphone for 5 time use",B01G8JO5F2
"I don't have anything to compare these to, but they are wonderful for listening to music. I've bought 4 of these over the years and gave them gifts and they were loved by the receivers.",B01G8JO5F2
Headphones are nice but the first time my ears touched pool water they died. After drying out they were not operating. I don't understand how people say they are waterproof. They are if you do not let your ears touch the water!,B01G8JO5F2
decent sound okay product,B01G8JO5F2
"When I first got them, it was great, sound was great, no sound interruptions great bass, etc. I got this end of Jan, and they’ve recently started having sound interruptions. Definitely not something you want when you’re in the groove exercising on the treadmill or something.",B01G8JO5F2
I am very happy with the performance of these headphones it’s my second set after I lost my first set thanks,B01G8JO5F2
"They stay on while I’m moving around.  The sound is great, better than my previous headphones I paid four times more for.  I would definitely recommend these and I do.",B01G8JO5F2
I'm happy with my purchase,B01G8JO5F2
"I love the ease of use, design and utility of the earbuds. This is my third pair, 1 for home, 1 for work, and 1 for my ex partner (his are still going strong after 2 years!).  They are the easy to use (connectivity), great sound quality and button response, light weight, and decent battery life. They are durable and have withstood a lot of abuse and use! I've used them in rainstorms, on the beach/boat, and at amusement parks. Unlike other earbuds, I'm not worried about loosing one or both, as the strap is a life-saver, and the ear holder, helps to keep them in place during activity.  Only downside is the battery life could be better.",B01G8JO5F2
Good sound quality.....very difficult to get them to stay in your ears when running. Constantly adjusting them,B01G8JO5F2
They wouldn't stay on my ears. The overall design is not great. There is a part that bends behind your ear that is adjustable but I would have to keep adjusting it every song or so because they just wouldn't stay put. They turned out to be a big hassle which defeated the purpose of having wireless ear buds. I do not recommend this product personally.,B01G8JO5F2
"You may have better luck than I, but my earbuds broke after 1 month of use. Only used them while walking around town.",B01G8JO5F2
Everything I wanted and more. Thank you,B01G8JO5F2
These are easy to pair and work great!,B01G8JO5F2
They fell apart the fourth time I used them. I was super excited about them and then they broke.,B01G8JO5F2
"Headphones were great for the first couple of months.  Then I had a problem. My first email to support was returned with troubleshooting instructions in 10 minutes (on a Sunday Evening no less).  The instructions didn't solve the problem, so I sent a follow-up.  That email was returned in 5 minutes with an offer to send a replacement.",B01G8JO5F2
Only use it 3 times and then it stop charging. But the sound quality was great if that helps but I wouldn’t waist my money again on these.,B01G8JO5F2
"These were purchased for me as a gift and work wonderfully for running. I am a serious marathoner and use the headphones for running easy, hard workouts, or long runs. The headphones stay seated in my ears and sound great even with all of the movement.  I am very sensitive to changes in my running gear, therefore, I was concerned about the cord irritating and bouncing on my neck and shoulders, but this has not been an issue. I don't even notice the cord when I run.<br /><br />The only reason I gave 4 stars for the material quality is the cord clip to adjust the tightness between the headphones detached and is lost.<br /><br />The battery life is awesome and lasts as long as the manufacturer states.",B01G8JO5F2
Bought it back in 2017 and it still works. Battery holds charge pretty well. Sound quality isn’t comparable to Apple Airpod but it is significantly less. I would buy again if it fails.<br /><br />I did get it replace once. They stand behind their product. I got a replacement without any questions.,B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these for running. They stay in we’ll and fit people with small ears. However, if it’s super windy, it impacts the sound quality considerably. Also, I only used them about 15-20 times and one ear bud stopped working. Disappointed in the overall quality.",B01G8JO5F2
I have only had these for one day but I have to say that I tried many earbuds over the years and these are the only pair I have been able to keep in my ears.  The others always fall out but these are so far so good.,B01G8JO5F2
"I've bought these earbuds on at least 3 separate occasions. The last two times were because I either lost them or an earbud stopped working. The sound quality is decent, great for the price of the earbuds. I cannot compare these with another of the same price range, but I can say they do come with everything you need and some extras like new inserts. Each time I got a new pair of these, they had little differences. My newest pair has over-the-ear hooks that you can mold to your ear. This has caused more problems than solutions, whereas the other hooks that weren't malleable would fit a lot more snug and quicker. However, once you get done fiddling with your earbuds they will stay tightly in place until you have to take them off, making you re-do the process when you put them on again. These earbuds are perfect for the gym, jogs, and just walking around.",B01G8JO5F2
Great product for the cost!,B01G8JO5F2
Probably the best wireless earbuds out I even compared them to my beats and it's only a very slight difference,B01G8JO5F2
Uncomfortable. Too bulky. Don’t fit.,B01G8JO5F2
The sound was as expected. Generally appreciate the quality of the device.,B01G8JO5F2
The volume was barely audible. Likely defective pair. Returning.,B01G8JO5F2
Running my first 1/2 marathon and wanted some music to help pass the time.  My hubby had these so he recommended them.  You have  a 15 minute warning once it says “low battery”.,B01G8JO5F2
"I am in love with this, so good",B01G8JO5F2
Had issues with connectability to my phone and it stopped taking charge after only 1 year! I would not purchase again 👎🏽,B01G8JO5F2
"Terrible fit, won't stay in the ears. Terrible tincan sound! The quality is so low, if you turn your head to the left, with your phone in the back pocket, you'd temporary cut the connection between the headset and your phone.",B01G8JO5F2
I really like the them they work great!,B01G8JO5F2
I just love the sound. They are awesome. I would recommend these to my family and friends.,B01G8JO5F2
"Bought a pair in mid-May, which died on July 1.  Wouldn't recommend these to others.",B01G8JO5F2
"Bought these nearly a year ago and use them 5-6 days a week between work, gym, running and traveling. I keep them in the case to prevent damage when not in use. Only had one issue, I dropped them and they would not connect via bluetooth to any device. I performed a factory reset and they've worked perfectly since. Sound is decent but certainly not Bose quality. All in all these are great and I will purchase another pair when these die.",B01G8JO5F2
I've had these for a month and the battery life is only an hour after a full charge.  Waste of money.,B01G8JO5F2
Piece of CRAP!<br />battery does not recharge.  Used 3-4 times.,B01G8JO5F2
Verry happy,B01G8JO5F2
"Product performs as expected given the price. Does connect multiple devices, however there are minor issues with making this seamless unlike some higher quality tech products. Sizing of the loop around ear doesn't fit snugly but what can you expect with one-size-fits-all $20 headphones. Holds a charge well for now but will able to see any obsolescence over time.",B01G8JO5F2
"Top quality sound, noise canceling earbuds.<br />Only issue is that they are not rechargeable more than once or twice.<br />If you're in the market for really good fidelity earbuds that you plan on throwing away in about six weeks, these are right in your wheel house.  On the other hand, if you'd like something that lasts, maybe two months, steer clear of this product.",B01G8JO5F2
"By far the best and comfortable earphones I’ve purchased. The price is awesome as well. I’ve purchased these repeatedly (I lose them, break them while working-my fault!) and will order a replacement when the time comes.<br />I get 8-10 hours of straight play time.<br /><br />Only two negative things, one is that I wish the Blue LED light was so bright at night. Dark nail polish will fix that!<br />Two, once you determine which soft plastic inserts fit your ear, dab a small amount of super glue so they stay on the plastic ear piece.<br /> Other than that, the sound is great, price is great! Recommended. I love them!",B01G8JO5F2
"I bought 2 pairs of these about 3 years ago, I loved them my daughter just had to stop using one pair just last month they are great but I bought this new pair & theyr not the same, theyr plastic, they start to get hard to hear & full of static when I walk 5 ft away from my phone it takes 2 tries to turn them on or off. I'm so disappointed I won't be buying that brand again",B01G8JO5F2
great headphones,B01G8JO5F2
"These earbuds actually worked really well for a while.  I bought them March 2018, good sound quality and they actually stay in your ear.  But all of a sudden the Bluetooth won't work.  I've tested other Bluetooth devices and they connect quickly to my phone, but the earbuds won't.  So they're basically useless now.  They were nice while they lasted, but I guess you get what you pay for.",B01G8JO5F2
Well worth the money!!!,B01G8JO5F2
"And I didn't have to spend ""Beats"" money for it! Great sound quality, fantastic battery life, and these are the first headphones to manage to stay in my ears through an entire workout! very pleased with purchase. Would recommend.",B01G8JO5F2
They are comfortable sporty like headphones; wireless and sweat proof!,B01G8JO5F2
"The battery won't hold a charge past a day, lots of wind noise when riding a bike and it doesn't fit well.",B01G8JO5F2
Excellent bluetooth on a budget!!!,B01G8JO5F2
Super long battery life. And very sturdy,B01G8JO5F2
"Work great, same if not better then same Style purchased 12-18 months back that I broke cable on.<br /><br />Product was received in about 7 days from purchase which is fast for APO shipping considering it transits USA first before being sent overseas for Military delivery.",B01G8JO5F2
too much hardware to wear around my ears. and they don't seem to stay in. good sound though.,B01G8JO5F2
"Product worked for a month and they would turn off by itself and I would have to turn it on, then it would again die.",B01G8JO5F2
"I am on my second set of headphones, not through any fault of the headphones. I was getting out of the car and they got caught in the door, the charging mechanism was crushed though they did still work until the battery died. They work well and have good battery life. I bought 2 pairs to replace that one so I will have them if I make another mistake. The new ones have a slightly different over ear piece though they are the same model. That being said it seems comfortable and the sound quality is just as good as the last pair!! I would definitely recommend these headphones!",B01G8JO5F2
"Fair sound quality, battery life. Use them while cutting grass and yard work. I would buy again for the price.",B01G8JO5F2
Good,B01G8JO5F2
I bought these after watching a review on YouTube.,B01G8JO5F2
My only complaint is you cant use them while charging. Otherwise good product.,B01G8JO5F2
"I love everything about the earpiece.The headphones work great. I have hearing problems and the still work for me.""<br />It connected to my phone flawlessly, and feels comfortable in my ear.",B01G8JO5F2
work well with my devices and sounds great,B01G8JO5F2
"These work. The battery doesn't last surprisingly short or long. The connection is lost if you walk down a long hallway, but stays connected in a somewhat large room. The only real complaint is that they don't stay in my ears very well even with the little arm that goes behind my ear. The arm is too large and doesn't actively rest on my ear but it is there if they fall out. When I run or doing intense activity where I sweat, they twist forward in my ear and eventually fall out.",B01G8JO5F2
Muy buen sonido me gustan mucho sobre todo la duracion de la batería gracias,B01G8JO5F2
Wireless and Bluetooth is making it a dream when I go running. however it has slipped off mid run but I may not have hooked it right.,B01G8JO5F2
Everytime I have bought these headphones a family member asks to borrow them and end up loving them so I let them keep em & I buy a new pair for myself. These headphones are GREAT!!!!! My entire household has a pair now.,B01G8JO5F2
"The headphones are decent enough. OK sound quality, but given the price I wasn't expecting anything incredible. The only issue is that when the headphones are at a low battery percentage, an annoying voice will repeatedly say that the battery is low, making them unusable. A bit annoying, but overall a decent set of headphones.",B01G8JO5F2
Accidentally washed them in my washing machine... still work no problem!!,B01G8JO5F2
Headphones are good for listening to music or podcasts while biking.  Phone calls don’t work as well as the person on the other end can hear a lot of background noise.,B01G8JO5F2
"Comfortable, easy to use and great sound.",B01G8JO5F2
I bought these for use while exercising. 7 months in and they no longer charge or turn on.,B01G8JO5F2
"Wow! I can't believe the quality for the price. Super impressed. The ear hooks are nice and moldable to your ears, the soft silicone blocks outside noise, and the sound quality is great. I did a lot of research before ordering and then I was down to just a couple and I decided to go with these, I am so glad I did! Haven't had them long enough to test playtime or durability. Hope they last. Update, have had them several months now. Still working perfectly. Charge is nice. Sometimes I don't use them for weeks, go turn them on and wear them for a few hours just fine. Impressed!",B01G8JO5F2
Good quality for a good price,B01G8JO5F2
They work underwater which is why I went with them. I read lots of reviews on a lot of different headsets to find some that actually worked well.,B01G8JO5F2
The sound quality is very good. But that’s the only positive thing about this item. The loops that wrap around your ears are way too big and don’t stay on. And the plastic buttons on the headset are so lose that you hear them clicking as your running. It is very annoying. I am very disappointed with this product.,B01G8JO5F2
"This is the first Amazon review I’ve written but I felt compelled to warn people to stay away. I bought these headphones because I just wanted something to use for an hour a day when I work out. Evidently that’s a hard sell. When you start to sweat, the sound cuts in and out. After 6 months, they totally died. I was still under warranty, so they sent me a new pair. Those ones died shortly after too. Such a disappointment and these 5 star reviews are very deceiving. With two failed pairs in a year, I just can’t see how they are accurate.",B01G8JO5F2
They make a light clicking sound when I run and they don’t fit as snug around my ears as my last pair,B01G8JO5F2
Good value. Bass is a little intense.,B01G8JO5F2
Battery lasts quite a while. Works great for running.,B01G8JO5F2
My wife usually has a hard time getting ear buds to stay on/in her ears. These however work just fine for her,B01G8JO5F2
Didn't really fit my ears but they worked well. Only used for a month or so.,B01G8JO5F2
These headphones are well worth the money !!,B01G8JO5F2
"Well, unfortunately, these didn't work out as great. The earbuds keep dropping from my sync with my phone. Did a reset & still nothing. The worst part is that even still under warranty, the company did not respond to my concerns. Kept being told over & over to do a reset and got ZERO help.",B01G8JO5F2
Used for work excellent choice,B01G8JO5F2
Good product. Noise cancelling is only average. Great sound quality. Cannot honestly report good for workout as I don’t workout vigorously (I am 75 years young) but I do use them for a vigorous strong paced walk. Would recommend highly versus the much higher priced models.,B01G8JO5F2
Great product so far. Love the sound for the price. Don’t think you can beat it. They stay in well no problems what so ever! Prob purchase a few more for family. Taking a call is great while playing music and keeping your hands free. Got my vote 5 stars!,B01G8JO5F2
Im happy with these they work great and keep me listen to music and every thing else that comes throw.,B01G8JO5F2
Great for the price. Good battery life.,B01G8JO5F2
"I’m basically using the headphones for workouts mostly. Sometimes at home for music/podcasts if another is out of charge etc.<br /><br />I like the design and style. They are quite secure with the loop but I guess it could be better in that aspect. I mean I’ve to make sure that they are secure, they don’t snap into place. Maybe im expecting too much :).<br /><br />The sound quality is very good. Im completely satisfied in that aspect. No issues with sweat either.<br /><br />One improvement I can suggest is to add magnetism in both buds so one can wear them securely around neck when not in use.",B01G8JO5F2
"Bought this as a present for my husband to use while working out, he was thrilled and said these were way better than he expected them to be. You really can't beat the price for the quality and amount of extras you receive with this product!",B01G8JO5F2
I love my headset,B01G8JO5F2
I wear these at work and they are great. On my second pair.,B01G8JO5F2
They are almost the same quality and for way less. Great purchase.,B01G8JO5F2
Haven't used the noise cancellation feature yet.  Battery lasted at least 24 hours with all day use.  Sound quality is exceptional!,B01G8JO5F2
"I use this while exercising at home, and wanted something to be able to move freely without being teethered.<br />I decided on this one, but it's larger than the old one that I had, which had no battery life left.<br />Despite trying the different size silicone tips, I find it doesn't stay in my ear super well.  I find I'm always tweaking the shape of the over the ear lobe piece, but it doesn't retain it's shape real well, and no matter what I try it doesn't sit tightly around my ear.",B01G8JO5F2
"Disclaimer: I bought these on my account, not my wife's Amazon account that I'm leaving this review on currently before my wife and I got married and since I haven't used my account in 12 or more months I can't leave the review under the correct account I purchased these under.  Still works but the speakers are both blown from listening to the music too loud. These can't handle repeated sweat, use, and loud listening from me at the gym. Lasted about 3 months before they blew out. These would probably work great for most people but if you push products to the limit like I do, these won't cut it for you.",B01G8JO5F2
The,B01G8JO5F2
"Good wireless headphones, but they did not last long. I purchased these headphones November 2018. They did not even lasted two years before the left-side went out.",B01G8JO5F2
"Used it in 5 work outs, charged them, brought to gym only to find the headphones dead. Completely dead. No amount of charging or holding and pushing power button does anything. Hope your experience is better.",B01G8JO5F2
Good product for a good price!,B01G8JO5F2
"The designers tried to make the ear piece extra flexible for either comfort or conformity to the ear, yet it just ended being ridiculously soft and malleable so that the ear piece falls off with any head movement.",B01G8JO5F2
"for the price, you can't beat the quality!",B01G8JO5F2
Its hurt when I put it on my ear .,B01G8JO5F2
"Used these for over 3 years now when doing some workouts or when travelling. They weren't used every day, or even every week in some cases... But they still work now. For the price I paid, I'm happy and the sound isn't bad.",B01G8JO5F2
"I am writing this review because the majority of reviews are written within the first week and do not reflect the product's performance over a reasonable period of time. These headphones worked moderately well for the first few months (there were some connectivity issues at times, but I figured they were fine enough for the price). However, these are advertised as waterproof, and they certainly did not live up to that standard. In the shower a week after purchase, they immediately cut off. I assumed they were broken, but a day later they turned back on after drying out. This happened another time in the shower, prompting me to not wear them near water anymore. Then, just over 3 months into owning the headphones, they cut out randomly during one of my workouts. Again, a day later, they were restored (maybe they cut out due to the water from sweat?). And finally, last week, they cut out for good. Will not turn back on. I am just outside of the return window, so I have to eat this cost.<br /><br />I know there are a lot of positive reviews. But as consumers, we need to be aware of how companies are manipulating Amazon's review process. They are drowning out the real, authentic experiences, like the one I am documenting here. I recommend against buying these headphones, as you will most likely be replacing them in 3-6 months. Good luck!",B01G8JO5F2
This is awesome will buy again,B01G8JO5F2
Good quality/ hands free,B01G8JO5F2
"For the price, unbeatable!! Sound is not “Bose” quality, but certainly fine for working out, running or anything active! I leave my iPhone in my gym bag....I can wonder pretty far and still get reception!! They are comfortable, stay in place and the battery lasts a long time. I even left them in my car for 3 weeks in sub zero temps....and Viola...turned right on 😀😀<br />I’ve owned these for about one year, and just bought another for a gift 🎁<br />Highly recommend!!",B01G8JO5F2
"I'm not a techie, but more a commuter who needed headphones on the train.  I didn't want to spend too much, but I didn't want to have super crap headphones.  I always had issues with bluetooth headphones and was one of those diehard fan of wired headphones because I hate when someone can't hear you on the phone, or the battery dies and you have nothing to listen to for the rest of your 1 hr train commute.  I love the case, and that they include a charging cord and all the sizes of earpieces so when your ear canal starts aching, you can switch it out to a smaller size, and its all right there in your case!  The battery life has been great so far - I commute up to 4 hrs a day roundtrip on the train.  The one thing is the phone call quality may not be optimal, but who really makes that many phone calls these days?  All in all, great for the price!",B01G8JO5F2
I wish I could give 10 stars. I just love them but I wish there was a wireless set,B01G8JO5F2
Absolutely love them!! Find myself using them even after I’m done at the gym!,B01G8JO5F2
"I was skeptical about these because the price was so cheap. I'm honestly thrilled with them! The sound quality is GREAT, and people can hear me just fine when using them for calls.<br /><br />Just a heads up - if you try to connecting them to more than one device at a time, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. I recommend just doing one device at a time to avoid any frustration :)",B01G8JO5F2
Quiero devolverlo,B01G8JO5F2
They were great in every way but they did not fit my tiny ears. My granddaughter loves them so much. Please make some that itty bitty ears so that I can enjoy my music.,B01G8JO5F2
Overall quality is pretty decent. Ear hooks have great adjustability. There is a bit of maneuvering to get the right fit though.. can’t just pop them on. Only real complaint is that if your looking for something with good bass these are horrible!,B01G8JO5F2
I like it,B01G8JO5F2
Amazing product,B01G8JO5F2
Comfortable headphones,B01G8JO5F2
"Great sound, but lots of wind noise when on a bicycle.",B01G8JO5F2
Barely connects to the phone. The phone cannot be in my pocket. Otherwise great.,B01G8JO5F2
"I've had a pair of these for a little over 2 years, the wires are now exposed near each ear piece, I have to angle the charger to get them to charge, yet they are still kicking.  I've been rough on these too. Catching them in the shoulder portion of a seat belt, ripping them from my head :) still working great. When these die, I'll be ordering another pair. Best sound quality I've found in their price range",B01G8JO5F2
"Great sound, comfortable. Great price.",B01G8JO5F2
They do not work,B01G8JO5F2
This is my 3rd pair I love them,B01G8JO5F2
"I ordered these about six months ago because of the great reviews.  The charging port went bad recently and they would no longer charge, so I opened a support case.  To my surprise they responded very quickly with some troubleshooting tips which unfortunately did not solve the problem.  This happened over a period of only 2-3 days, after which they agreed to replace the unit.  I received the new headphones quickly, and they work perfectly.  Very satisfied",B01G8JO5F2
Too big to fit ears so had to return them,B01G8JO5F2
"As far as I know this product blocks the outside sound / noise, it does not actively cancel it like a Bose Noise Cancellation headphone or their like.<br /><br />This requires a very tight fit of the ear buds, otherwise noise will leak in. I had to experiment with the various sizes of ear buds to get a fit that blocked most of the sound.<br /><br />Perhaps interestingly; I am ~90% deaf with tinnitus. My expensive hearing aids can receive my iPhone's Bluetooth so that I can listen to music, but it sounds terrible, with a annoying tinny quality. However, phone calls' voices are excellent. The SENSO Bluetooth headphones music sounds great, but their iPhone call quality is worse than my hearing aids; too much bass and not enough treble (the exact opposite of the hearing aids).<br /><br />For a normal hearing person, I think you will find the cell phone quality very good.<br /><br />For their price, I doubt they have much competition! Highly recommended!",B01G8JO5F2
Very good wish battery life was better,B01G8JO5F2
Didn’t enjoy these at all. Won’t stay on a small ear.,B01G8JO5F2
Sound and voice quality are wonderful. Couldn't be happier!,B01G8JO5F2
Headphones reliably last for at least eight hours of continuous use and recharge relatively fast (typically two to four hours).,B01G8JO5F2
"These are the best workout earbuds I've ever had.  Tried numerous wired and wireless options over the last decade or so, but these rock!  The over ear design keeps them secure through long runs, or circuit training.  The behind the neck cord stays out of the way.  Battery life must be great, because I can only remember one time that I got a low battery warning in over a year of regular use.  I mostly listen to audio books and the voice quality is great, and is pretty great for music as well.  Highly recommend these",B01G8JO5F2
Excellent product,B01G8JO5F2
"The sound is perfect, light, easy to load, very useful for exercise",B01G8JO5F2
"I have been so happy with these, for the price point. My first pair has lasted 3 years. I use them in low noise areas, like when mowing or running my shop vac. The noise reduction is not great but they are comfortable, and do offer some protection in a noisy environment.",B01G8JO5F2
"I couldn't say. They never worked, I plugged them in charged them a bit. Never kicked in to pairing mode. Lousy brand, they make Woman's shoes. Weird but true. That's like Sony making high heels. Lousy lousy headphones and price is ridiculously high. Dollar tree headphones work better.",B01G8JO5F2
"Great little set with nice, clear sound",B01G8JO5F2
It's what you would expect for the price. Sound quality is trash,B01G8JO5F2
They are the most comfortable headphones I have found! I float in my pool listening to books! The headphones have different size earbuds for comfort.,B01G8JO5F2
"I've been using buds that have no ear hooks or wires, and Ive found this works better now that I wear a mask when I'm out for my walk.  I sometimes have problems with the others falling out.<br /><br />I've used these for 3 years, had to buy another because I misplaced one set, or it may have been stolen...these are a great buy!!",B01G8JO5F2
Great value for Bluetooth headphones. I've ordered these a few times over the years and I'm always happy with them.,B01G8JO5F2
The best part is definitely that the hook around the ear adjusts. So glad!,B01G8JO5F2
The sound quality needs to improve a little more. The rest is very good.,B01G8JO5F2
Bought these to use in the gym and immediately returned them. They are big and bulky and fall off the ears easily. The sound is not that great either. Battery life I never got the chance to judge. Save your money and get a better quality set of headphones.,B01G8JO5F2
Love these headphones for running. The battery lasts longer than my Garmin watch! They stay on pretty good which is nice because I have a hard time with other in ear headphones. My kitten finally got to them and chewed them up so I bought another set to replace them I like them so much!,B01G8JO5F2
Excellent headphones 👍😁👌,B01G8JO5F2
"Culpe con las espectativas, no tuve que gastar $100USD para unos buenos audifonos",B01G8JO5F2
"For the price, these are outstanding.  Disregarding $$, these headphones still provide amazingly good sound.  They work especially well with Apple watch while I'm at the gym.  Stereo sound seems to be coming out of the center of my head!",B01G8JO5F2
Use it for work  battery didn’t last long,B01G8JO5F2
👍🏾,B01G8JO5F2
Sound quality is great.,B01G8JO5F2
"Great headphones! Bought a second pair after losing the first. The first version I got, the over-the-ear hooks didn't move as much, the newer version does. I'm not a big fan of how bendy they are, but they still stay in place even with my glasses on.",B01G8JO5F2
Have had them almost a year and have used them every day still out preforming my Sony and Bose and great sound quality highly recommend,B01G8JO5F2
"I have particularly small ears and always struggle with ear buds no matter the sizes offered. I needed earbuds for cycling and long distance workouts. I also needed Bluetooth because cords pulled my earphones out no matter what. Sound quality was a factor but not first priority...until I got these Senso headphones! Sound is amazing and the Bluetooth range is phenomenal- trying them out, I can walk all over my house without disruption. The headphones stay on well so far but it’s winter so I am only using trainer for rides. For is great so far, though it took some adjusting to make secure. I have high hopes for these headphones! Better than any I have tried and the price makes the trial well with it! Shipping was faster than expected and the case is great size for in my bag & won’t lose them. Extras are fantastic and so appreciated. One charge has lasted three days so far w about 4 hrs of use.<br />Seller was fantastic and easy to order from, packaging was secure and I had nothing but good experience with this Seller and product!",B01G8JO5F2
Excelente lo recomiendo son muy cómodos y prácticos para llevar a todas partes.,B01G8JO5F2
Excellent product and service!,B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these for the first time in March 2019. They worked great (great bass) then they stopped working in August 2019. I didn't want to deal with the warranty process. Since they were such a reasonable price, I decided to just buy them again that same month and hope that they would last the second time around. Again, they were working great and I loved them so much that I even bought my mom a pair (which she loves and is still using).<br /><br />Now, it's January 2020 (exactly five months out like the last time) and they've stopped working again. I'm disappointed because I really loved these headphones. I didn't and don't expect them to last more than a year at $20, but I had hoped to actually reach the one year mark with them.<br /><br />I'll try my best to submit a warranty for these, since I'm still technically within a year, but I don't think I can justify buying these a third time. Hopefully my warranty goes through and I'll have at least another five months of wireless listening to save up for something better.",B01G8JO5F2
nice set just they dont last too long as far as the batteries go.,B01G8JO5F2
i enjoyed these headphones so much but my left bud keeps going out! these are the second pair and having same issues .... anyway to have these replaced since it hasnt been a year. Thank you,B01G8JO5F2
Great,B01G8JO5F2
"Rated a 4 high because of value being high. Better sound quality would make it a 5 at this price level. I’ve owned 3 pairs of beats. 2/3 broke. Both sound adjustable piece broke on beats and one completely stopped working. And the last one barely holds a charge. At the price of the senso it’s no big deal to buy a couple pairs a year, but hope I don’t have to",B01G8JO5F2
Pros:<br />* decent sound for the price<br />Cons:<br />* mic is too weak to use (consider as not working at all)<br />* falls from ears even after adjusting<br />* bulky,B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these as a gift for someone and tested them out when they arrived without any issue on my phone. The sound quality was decent, the depth of the bass was above average I’d say, the treble and middle tons were kind of hollow sounding, not as rich as nicer options but still I was happy with them. The construction seemed okay, the ear loop seemed somewhat flimsy.<br /><br />The biggest issue is THEY NEVER CONNECTED TO ANY PHONE AGAIN. Never detectable on Bluetooth. Read the manual online at least 10 times, followed every step repeatedly. Did the factory reset, turned phones on and off and not one time was the headset detectable. Completely frustrating and embarrassing as a gift.",B01G8JO5F2
"I've purchased ""high end"" wireless earbuds in the past and most worked/sounded pretty good. Now let me say.....these wireless earbuds absolutely rock! The bass hits low, the treble is high and they STAY IN YOUR EARS! For the price you would be hard pressed to find a better sounding,longer lasting battery and to me most importantly, they stay in your ears. Great product! DONT BE FOOLED BY THE PRICE PEOPLE!",B01G8JO5F2
These headphones are comfortable and the sound is excellent.  Recommended!,B01G8JO5F2
"I use them on my commute to work, the gym, with my playstation vita, and other times. They are great.",B01G8JO5F2
"These are great!! They stay in place, have clear sound and are sweat proof. I like that they are cordless and don’t get knocked off by me accidentally pulling the wire. Looking forward to enjoying these for a long time to come!",B01G8JO5F2
Just when your far away from your phone it shuts off,B01G8JO5F2

"These headphone are not made to last , I bought about 3 pairs and was gifted two. I assumed it was my fault because i wore them to the gym and they would get sweaty but now that I haven't been working out and they still keep breaking I know that these are not made to last and their cheaply made",B01G8JO5F2
"Particularly impressed w/ Teketron customer service.  First pair had malfunctioning volume control.  They mailed me new pair immediately, and provided return label to return the malfunctioning one.  Thanks.",B01G8JO5F2
Sound quality is comparable if not better than the $150-$200 Dre Powerbeats.,B01G8JO5F2
these things are great. i dropped the off my bunk-bed onto the tile floor and the case come open but snapped right back together. the sound is great and the battery lasts all day aslong and you didnt use it abunch the day before and didnt charge them. other wireless earbuds i have die withing three hours. i can take these with my to classes and they will still have battery at the end of the day. the over the ear arm is great cause the wont fallout like other earbuds. the cable does drag on my neck but just a quick tug on the side and its fine. because of the arm the cable pulling the earbud slightly wont take it out of your ear either. ive had these for years and theyve outlived all my other earbuds,B01G8JO5F2
I use them to walk the dog and love them! They have great sound and hold a charge well.  They paired very easily.  I wish I had bought them earlier.  They are a good price for what you get.  Even the carrying case is a nice extra!,B01G8JO5F2
These headphones have incredible sound quality. I was also impressed by the battery life. They are very simple to use and are far more convenient than the older wired headphones. Just bought a second set for my wife!,B01G8JO5F2
I can’t answer because are Christmas gifts for my grandsons.,B01G8JO5F2
Update - 1/8/19<br /><br />I am updating my review because Senso saw my review and they immediately contacted me.  We tried to see if we had to reset the headphones and realized they were defected.  They sent me a replacement pair ASAP.<br /><br />Thank you Senso team for caring so much about your customers and the quick turnaround.<br /><br />I’ve only had these headphones for two months and they turn off by themselves. It’s so annoying when I’m working out and they turn off and I turn them back on and they turn off again.  This happens at least every minute,B01G8JO5F2
"Great headphones, I do wish the battery lasted longer though",B01G8JO5F2
They work,B01G8JO5F2
"Sound quality is good but they are very difficult to fit, especially adjusting the ear loops. It is a struggle every time I put them on.",B01G8JO5F2
Good sound quality and when i emailed tech support for an issue they helped me quick and effectively.,B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these earphones because my ears are really small and the normal shape earphones do not fit. At first I bought just to try them out, but I've had them for almost 3 years now and they are really, really good. The sound is clear, they are light and easily adjustable. I wear it at the gym, to run outdoors, for my meetings... I fully recommend it.",B01G8JO5F2
Very light.  I got these for running and they are perfect!,B01G8JO5F2
"The headphones were a good idea, then just broke, the battery is great and the charging time excelent, not that confortable but the quality isnt the best, broke in 2 months as the pictures shows.<br />Came with three adapters that are very usefull for any ear size.<br />The case is great and good quality material, and the car charger started to not work after 3 months.<br />Hope it helps you!",B01G8JO5F2
These headphones were great; I used them for 6 months without a problem. And when there was a problem - the left ear went out unexpectedly - they responded so quickly via customer service and sent a warranty replacement immediately. All around excellent;,B01G8JO5F2
"""For the price this has been a great set of headphones. I have not worked out in them yet to test the waterproof/sweatproof of the ear pieces yet. Sound quality is good and the ear pieces are comfortable.""",B01G8JO5F2
"These are a WIN/WIN! Super quality and doesn't cost an arm and a leg. Plus, I have always had difficulty finding a pair that stays put. Cannot say enough about these!",B01G8JO5F2
"Read before buying--<br />These used to be great headphones for the price.  I recently bought these as a replacement for my previous Senso pair I had used for years without problem.  I expected to receive the same product but I didn't.  They cut a corner on these that significantly affects the comfort the previous pair had.<br /><br />The ear hooks on the previous pair were covered with a nice rubber coating so during prolonged exercise yours ears never hurt and you'd forget they're even there, the ear hooks are now made of hard plastic.  It's painful and uncomfortable from the moment you put them on.  The other design they changed is that the hooks themselves used to be pliable so you could form them exactly to fit your ear, smaller, larger, whatever the case may be.  These do not form, it's just hard plastic and it's way too large to hold snug on your ears.<br /><br />Really disappointed Senso, you had a phenomenal product.  I checked out your newer version and they look like they suffer from the same downgrades.  Here's an idea, cut out the useless excessories (ex: cell phone card holder sleeve?) and focus on bringing the product comfort back to where it used to be.",B01G8JO5F2
"I love these headphones for working out at the gym! Even when running or jumping whole sweaty they stay in my ears and have the best sound quality I've experienced in a wireless earbud. I tried the Tao Tronics for a while but those fall out. The ActiveBuds are great because they have the bendable arms that keep them on your ears, stay charged for longer, and connect faster to my phone. The others had issues with disconnecting. Not these!",B01G8JO5F2
Fits nice in ear. No outside noise gets in.,B01G8JO5F2
"These fit well; I’ve got smaller ears so having headphones fit is always a bit scary. With a bit of bending, these guys fit great. The sound quality is perfect. My only advice is to adhere to the half-full (or half-empty depending your life view) battery symbol. Instead of thinking the headphones have another day or so before you need to charge them, I’d charge them that night.",B01G8JO5F2
Great sound for the price.  Stays put,B01G8JO5F2
Love it!! I work around a lot of loud machines and I can still hear my books or music.,B01G8JO5F2
"Use these for running, they work great for music and staying put, while I run.",B01G8JO5F2
"My second pair in 6 months. I use them a lot outside in the heat. I sweat a lot. For the price even if they only last 6 months, it's well worth it!",B01G8JO5F2
I love these headphones! They are exactly what I was looking for when looking for wireless earbuds. And the quality is great for the price! I also liked the little carrying case and extra bud covers that came with it.  I with the charging cable was longer and came with a biscuit because I'm having to use the biscuit that came with my phone charger to charge my headphones.,B01G8JO5F2
Great Headphones,B01G8JO5F2
Very nice and strong,B01G8JO5F2
Great Headphones,B01G8JO5F2
These are the best headphones i have had. Love the different size choice of covers. The sound quality is amazing and the comfort is so great I often forget they are even in my ears!!,B01G8JO5F2
Minden nagyon jó.,B01G8JO5F2
"They stay in your ears almost no matter what, but they are bulky. The size creates that good bass sound. They draw attention they are so large. Unfortunately one pair I bought has already developed a circuit problem when switched ON. It creates a terrible noise then shuts off right away. Into the trash it went.<br />Now the second pair quit and won’t even turn on. It charged overnight and is shot.<br />Going into the trash again.",B01G8JO5F2
"If you want to know if these really are waterproof, I can confirm they are. I accidently ran them through the washer and dryer after leaving them in my pocket after a workout... I pulled them out and thought for sure they were done. No! They connected just fine and sounded how they always did, which is fantastic.",B01G8JO5F2
"Headphones not only produce quality sound, but come with accessories including:  various sizes of replacement ear buds (which I've had to order separately in the past).  A great deal for less than $30!",B01G8JO5F2
terrible sound,B01G8JO5F2
"Love these headphones!! So nice not having a cord when running or lifting. The battery life lasts pretty long, I can go about a week without having to charge them. My brother and friend both got some after me and they both love them too! Definitely a workout essential!",B01G8JO5F2
Stay put very well,B01G8JO5F2
"Would be okay if it weren't for the fact that they have a spotty connection to devices even on a full charge. I got these on Tuesday. The sound is slightly less bass-y than Sony earbuds from Target for reference, but not bad. I can still enjoy songs when they are not skipping around and disappearing. Is the price worth it? I mean, I am free to jump around as I please while wearing them, but the spottiness does detract and pushes me to never want to purchase earbuds from Amazon again.",B01G8JO5F2
"The design is ok, it does stay on ears but that hook that goes around the ear is too wide and barely touches my ears. The sound quality is horrible !! and that's compared to a 25$ SkullCandy headphones i got from office depot !! its not for music, its for phone calls ... i dont like it overall but i have to live with it. I have tried so many different ones in the same price range and even cheaper, and this by far the worst sound quality.",B01G8JO5F2
My boyfriend loves these!,B01G8JO5F2
value for money,B01G8JO5F2
041919-a couple weeks ago my wife left these on the charger for roughly a week. After she took them off the charger they would not turn back on. She left them alone to see if maybe they need reset or something. She also tried another charger as well. No dice. So now we have a set of ear phones that are worthless and are barely over the 90 day support.<br /><br />011519-I bought these for my wife while she runs and works out. They are great since I have used them once or twice when she is not looking. Only negative is battery life. You have to charge them almost after each use. Of course that means every 4 hours or so I believe.,B01G8JO5F2
"The sound was great and the battery life was great, but after about 9 months they stopped working properly. I’d be using them and they’d just turn off after the first few minutes of using them. That’s why they received 2 stars",B01G8JO5F2
"Update: just went to charge these for the first time and the charger does not stay in.  I tried another one I’ve used before, same problem.  So the cost for this air is down the drain.  Try the charger as soon as you get them.  I didn’t and now can’t return them.<br />This is the 3rd set of these I have owned.  The only reason I replaced them is that I lost the last 2 pairs. I need the over the ear piece because that is the only way the stay in my ears.  The sound quality is excellent, but still allows me to be aware of my surroundings when I am out walking.  I highly recommend these.",B01G8JO5F2
The sound quality was much better than I expected since the price was so good.,B01G8JO5F2
"Great sound and very comfortable! I was very pleasantly surprised with these earphones. The sound is surprisingly good, with good bass response and fidelity. Great deal for the price point!",B01G8JO5F2
Very satisfied with this purchase.  Headphones pair up quickly and easily to iPhone.  Sound quality is excellent and earphones are comfortable and easy to use.  Use them when working out and have no issues with moisture.,B01G8JO5F2
They have good bass and great sound clarity. I use it everyday as my workout headset and they stay in ears fit.,B01G8JO5F2
Happy and satisfied with product. Can workout with no issues,B01G8JO5F2
Excellent quality headphones. I use the for running & the sound is incredible.,B01G8JO5F2
"Used for walking and watching streaming TV, have been excellent for both.",B01G8JO5F2
They are really good .worth the money.Great sound. Easy to use,B01G8JO5F2
Great Product,B01G8JO5F2
"easy connection, great sound, awesome base for amazing price, definitely recommend",B01G8JO5F2
its great for a Bluetooth,B01G8JO5F2
I have a horrible problem of sweating out my headphones- even ones that claim to be water or sweat proof. I work out twice a day and these have already lasted me 2 years with NO ISSUES. They are easy to pair with any device and clearly have stood the test of time. Amazing quality ESPECIALLY for the price.,B01G8JO5F2
"These are as durable as they come! My pair has seen heck; theyve been stepped on and thrown theyve been through rain left outside in the sun, they continue to sound amazing! They fit perfectly and it comes with different size ear buds to fit your needs. Theyre quite possibly the most comfortable pair of headphones I've ever owned, sound quality is there too. It rivals that of 100$ headphones, noise canceling is very effective as well. I highly recommend these babys you wont regret buying em.",B01G8JO5F2
"I use these for working out. Had many other  “waterproof” brands that crapped out on me, but these I’ve had for over a year and they still work great! Sound is very good, not the highest quality but really good if you’re not expecting perfect and for the price point well worth it. By far the best deal out and you get really good quality. Highly recommended.",B01G8JO5F2
These work well with The MIRROR workout system.  Easy pairing through MIRROR App and comfortable if looking for a quiet workout solution!,B01G8JO5F2
I had these headphones for years when I was making less money. They were a great value for the same sound quality as any other high brand headphones. I would recommend if you don’t want to spend big money. They sound quality is just as good!,B01G8JO5F2
They don't fall out!!! That's all I wanted!,B01G8JO5F2
"Listen to audio books, works great unless I am running the vacuum, then it doesn’t quite muffle all the vacuum noise.",B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these as dedicated audible book headphones for my Kindle PaperWhite. The idea was to have a ready device for middle of the night listening on a budget, so I wasn't expecting audiophile quality and to be sure they aren't that, but I have since connected them to my laptop and smartphone with surprising results! The sound quality rivals a pair of Samsung Level-U for which I spent several times more. Battery life could be better, my experience being between 5 and 6 hours depending on volume level. The upside is that recharge occurs in about an hour and a half. Overall I am very pleased with this purchase because of the relative value.",B01G8JO5F2
"Had for quite a while. Use 3x a week when I workout and sometimes at work. Battery lasts nicely, don't have to worry if I forget to charge it for a couple days. Lasts me about 10 hours of use. They've held up well but the piece covering the charge hole did fall out. To be expected imo given the nature of how I use them.",B01G8JO5F2
"I use the product for running, and around the house.  It works really well for music and phone calls.  The cord is a bit floppy and sometimes in the way, but still way better than a fully-corded, non-bluetooth headphone.",B01G8JO5F2
Haven’t had them long and they won’t take a charge. :/,B01G8JO5F2
Issues with the product:<br />  1) Audio quality not that good<br />  2) Did not fit around the ears.  I was always tightening the wrap to keep the speakers in my ear.<br />  3) One side frequently fell out of my ear while working out.<br /><br />I am trying an alternate brand today.,B01G8JO5F2
"These were great headphones most of the time. Good sound quality, complete noise cancellation,  ok fit, decent battery. One side stopped working after 8 months use -no sound whatsoever.  The other side continued to work but the mic became staticky to the listener. The fit isn't great for jogging or exercise... a quick head turn causes the slack to catch and can pull one of the buds out. They also require a frequent wipe down as they get sweaty. Two stars due to early failure with routine use and poor fit.",B01G8JO5F2
These are excellent reasonably priced headphones that function with great sound quality for just listening and for telephone calls!  Love these headphones!,B01G8JO5F2
I like these so much that I ordered a second pair for my hubby.  I like that I don't have to worry about one of the pieces getting lost.  They also come with a nice case.,B01G8JO5F2
"You can't get any better headphones for running or working out, for the money, then these.<br />Exactly what I needed.",B01G8JO5F2
"Pretty good headphones for working out, running, whatever. I've run two half marathons in them and countless other runs and they work well. Occasionally they will get out of place when running and require adjustment. They don't have a great range, but if you carry your phone close it doesn't really matter.",B01G8JO5F2
"After about 1 year if frequent use, the battery was low and they won't recharge when plugged in, so they are unusable now. Very disappointing and would not recommend to purchase.",B01G8JO5F2
"Fits snugly around the ear and they don't have the feeling that they'll pop out with a sneeze like with buds.<br /><br />They don't cancel noise, but that's good if you're running on the beach or anywhere else you need to pay a modicum of attention to your surroundings.<br /><br />They'll last half the day non-stop, which is good enough.  They could probably last longer, but I've never pushed it to the limit.",B01G8JO5F2
These headphones are insanely good for the price. Just connect it with Bluetooth and they fit snugly around my ears while I exercise or if I just want to use them for hands free. This is a must buy for this price and quality!,B01G8JO5F2
"These headphones were great, but stopped working. I bought them only about 6 months ago, which is why I give this product two stars.",B01G8JO5F2
The customer service is great if you run into any problems later. The product comes with a 1 year warranty,B01G8JO5F2
"This is my second pair of these earbuds. I used my first set five days a week, for work shifts lasting 8-9 hours, and they lasted about three years.  Three years!  And they never fell apart and only ever ran out of battery life when going on ten hours.  Charge them up for an hour or two and they'll last you all day.  I've tried other wireless earbuds and keep going back to these because for the price these are unbeatable.  Highly recommend!!!",B01G8JO5F2
Sound is incredible for the price paid.  Have a little trouble keeping them in my ears when I move my head side to side because of the connecting wire that hangs in the back.  Not a big enough deal to impact me buying again.,B01G8JO5F2
Battery lasts for hours and the sound quality is great.  I've worn them in the rain on long runs and still work great.,B01G8JO5F2
"Great,product",B01G8JO5F2
These earphones are great. Easy to use and provide very good sound. The different size ear bud covers are very handy as it turns out I need a different size for each ear! I had a problem with the earphones holding charge so I contacted customer service who advised a factory reset (very simple to do).  After this the problem persisted so I was sent a new pair of earphones as under one year warranty. No quibbling and very responsive to my questions. Great service.,B01G8JO5F2
"I've really enjoyed using these while running during the last few months. I'm pleased with the sound quality and ease of use, and I rather like having the wire connection between ear pieces because if I need to take them out, I just drape them over my neck until I resume my listening. They've lived up to their water proof claim, too: I was caught in a torrential downpour a little while back and my personal soundtrack continued on just fine. My small notes: 1. Even with everything snugly secure in and around each ear, they do feel slightly loose. This lets outside noise in, but for me I'm glad to be more aware of my surroundings. 2. The audio warning that the battery is low comes on maybe five minutes before the battery runs out (at least at my volume level) so occasionally they've died while I'm mid-run. So I try to charge them after three hours of use so I'm not left without my tunes later. Otherwise, I'm pleased with the battery life. It can be easy to lose track of the total usage time per charge, so it would be nice to have an earlier warning. Overall: they're a solid and budget friendly set that I'm quite happy with.",B01G8JO5F2
Best value for the money that I spent on them.  Very clear sound for music. Phone calls could be better but still works great.,B01G8JO5F2
ive had these for a long time and theyre still going.  would buy these again,B01G8JO5F2
"Like other reviews have mentioned the product includes a TON of accessories for the price, but its not useful because the base product was awful.<br /><br />With most headphones there is a little bit of wind noise but these sound like someone has a leaf blower next to your ear. On top of that after an hour run I took out the headphones and my ears ached for several hours after taking them out. I may have had a defective product because the connectivity was awful as well.",B01G8JO5F2
I use them while I mow my yard. They cancel the sound of the mower. As much as you can cancel the sound of a big Zero Turn mower. Now you can destroy your hearing with a little good music.,B01G8JO5F2
"Water rating is wrong, not able to get very wet and continue. Worked for a week.",B01G8JO5F2
I have been through at least six headphone over the last 15 years. This set works great and I hope it continues to do so. Bill E,B01G8JO5F2
"My second pair ordered so When one dies, another is already to go!",B01G8JO5F2
Battery life lasts a longggggg time. Perfect for a week at the gym!,B01G8JO5F2
"Good sound and battery life, especially for the money. The volume up button quit working after about 6 months of relatively light use, so it is now stuck at a barely audible volume. Tried to contact the company, but they stopped responding after any simple fix didn't work. I would recommend avoiding this company due to their poor customer service.",B01G8JO5F2
I use these5 days a week in pool. Works great<br /> Holds a charge.,B01G8JO5F2
I've had other bluetooth headphones that kept falling out of my ears - these stay in place and are comfortable.  Very happy with my purchase and I'd buy them again.,B01G8JO5F2
"Unfortunately, I've had two pair of these, and they were great at first but didn't last more than a year before just suddenly stopping to work properly. The first pair I had only lasted a few months before the button stopped working. The second pair just quit one day without reason while I was using them and will no longer work.",B01G8JO5F2
"I do not like how these new version have adjustable ear loops, I wear them all day at work and when someone speaks and I pull it out the ear loop stretches out and I have to fix it constantly",B01G8JO5F2
"I use my headphones for working out, running and biking. The different size ear pieces make it easy to keep the headphones in my ears and the bendable ear hooks allow for a tight fit (I've had problems with other ear phones falling out to easily, especially when running). I listen to podcasts and books on tape and the quality is clear. Also like the button placement. The sweat proof feature is a plus for me as I look like I've been exploring a tropical rain forest, sweat wise, by the end of a work out. I had a problem with my headphones no longer charging after 7 months and contacted the dealer. They walked me through a couple of possible fixes over the phone and when they solve the problem, they sent a new pair which arrived in a few days. This was a no-hassel replacement process which I greatly appreciated. Would buy again from this dealer.",B01G8JO5F2
"First It didn't fit into my ears and the wire ear-hookers were soft which didn;t keep the ear buds on the position, I wrote to them about this problem, their rep told me to change the ear rubber pieces. I did it , but the hook wires were so soft. Every times I turned my head (I wore prescription glasses), it dropped off many times. I owned many brands, such as Tao, Phaiser, Cowin, ... This is the first product I didn't like it. I wonder the reviews for this product were real. It didn't work for me.",B01G8JO5F2
"I upgraded from an older set of Senso headphones (cat got hungry), the flexible ear wraps are very nice. All in all, great headphones.",B01G8JO5F2
"For around $20 the sound quality and noise cancellation is pretty good and as long as you don’t overcharge the headphones, they’ll last a good while, but don’t expect it to work the day after if you used it all day. Here are the problems:<br /><br />1. Has an annoying volume level glitch where it doesn’t line up with whatever the volume says it’s at.<br />2. Makes an annoying ass “beep” when the volume is brought to 0% or when you use Siri.<br />3. Has a super high volume sensitivity, unnecessarily loud at lower volume levels.<br /><br />Other than these major problems, some minor ones can be:<br /><br />1. Inside of the ear can hurt after wearing it for awhile.<br />2. Can have trouble with sizing with ear cups.<br />3. Wire tie included easily comes off.",B01G8JO5F2
Great product,B01G8JO5F2
Work great,B01G8JO5F2
Gvh,B01G8JO5F2
No comfort at all. Can use more than 10 minutes.,B01G8JO5F2
Fantasic ear buds. I use them eveytime I go running or exercise. Perfect cash for quality of your active,B01G8JO5F2
"The product was not durable at all, lasting less than 6 months under normal use",B01G8JO5F2
"I run with these and love them. I've had them since 2017 and have trained for two half marathons with them. They're simple, the battery lasts forever, and they wrap around your ear securely. I love them so much that even though I  lost a pair and my dog chewed up a second pair, so I'm on my third pair. I would never use other headphones.",B01G8JO5F2
It works well...,B01G8JO5F2
Wicked product! A must buy.,B01G8JO5F2
Used while walking good sound even at low setting.,B01G8JO5F2
Worth it for the price.  No complaints,B01G8JO5F2
so far so good! These are nice wireless headphones. thanks for the fun surprise extras that were sent along with them too!,B01G8JO5F2
These headphones got water damage from sweat within the first week I owned them.,B01G8JO5F2
These earbuds have good sound quality! They do wiggle loose during high impact exercise,B01G8JO5F2
"They have excellent sound quality and the controls are intuitive and easy to use. Unfortunately, after three runs they’re constantly falling off or out of my ears. I would not recommend these for exercise.",B01G8JO5F2
I use it for everyday use. Especially for workingout in the gym. They stay in my ears. Love that the ear hooks bend easily to the shape of your ear. As well as the hands-free calling feature.,B01G8JO5F2
"I loved these earbuds. For the price, they could not be beat. Sound quality was amazing. They were durable. The battery life was still reliable after a year and a half... and then I lost them.<br /><br />I bought the newer version (s255) and the sound quality is comparable. However, I learned that the old s250's did not have adjustable ear hooks, and that made them better than the s255.<br /><br />I came back to the s250 to order what I thought would be a pair just like I bought in 2017. Unfortunately, the new s250 are adjustable and have a different grippier plastic on the ear hooks that gets tangled in my hair 100% of the time I try to use them.<br /><br />People without long hair will most likely see the adjustability and grippiness to be a benefit. For me, it's always a struggle.",B01G8JO5F2
I would buy these over an expensive pair of headphones any day! They fit your ear almost perfectly!,B01G8JO5F2
This is my 5th BT headset and the first one to actually stay connected to the phone (HTC 10) almost regardless of how I move. Every other set stutters often enough if I look around while walking that they all sit unused because that's what I bought them for. Also the included memory foam cushions are awesome.,B01G8JO5F2
These headphones last an entire work shift within a noisy factory. With memory foam (or any ear filling) tips make these an investment worth having for outdoors or indoor activities.,B01G8JO5F2
"I am writing this review a little later as I have owned the Senso wireless headphones for over a year and just recently purchased a pair of Beats Wireless Headphones.  At the price, you can not beat these Senso headphones.  In fact, there are only 3 noticeable areas where Beats are slightly better:<br />1. The quality of the plastic that fits around the ear.  Only wish, it was stronger on the Senso<br />2. The quality of the sound and volume. I found Beats, for all their hype, are only slightly better<br />3. The ability to skip to the next song without using my device. Senso doesn't have it, Beats does<br /><br />I bought my Beats for $99 on Black Friday deal which is a decent savings (normally $199). I will say that at $27 for the Senso vs. the normal price of $199 for Beats ... SENSO wins that price comparison hands down.<br /><br />If you want a pair of good under $30 wireless headphones.  Buy the SENSO!  100% recommend.",B01G8JO5F2
Construction worker defenetly help's jeep unwanted noise out.,B01G8JO5F2
Cord gets tight when I turn my head. Left ear doesn’t play as loud anymore probably due to the cord being pulled as I turn my head. Had to replace these with a wireless set.,B01G8JO5F2
"Love these Headphones.  Second pair I bought.  Had my first pair for almost two years until I left them in a hotel.<br />Sound quality is good. Battery lasts a long time, even after two years (at least on my last pair).  No issues when sweating all over them during a workout.  And they stay on my ears without issues.<br />Would order again and again.  Love them.",B01G8JO5F2
Returned it. Didn't like the feel. Kept falling out during workout. And sound quality wasn't that great either.,B01G8JO5F2
"Great pair of earbuds for the price, worked well for almost a year, connected to just about any devices I wanted. Battery life was ok, not amazing or anything but they did last a good amount of time. Almost never a problem with falling out or off my ears, stayed well and didn't ache or anything after long periods of time. The wire connecting the 2 earbuds together began to tear away about a month ago and has slowly went since. Now only one side works. Great buy until now, if I get a new pair like the description says I will move the rating up but until then, staying at a 3.",B01G8JO5F2
"I really enjoy the product. Been using them for the past 3 years; however they tend to only last between 3-6months. I sweat alot when I run I feel like they're not as water proof as advertised. The warranty support is great, very easy to get a new pair and comes with cool accessories. overall great sound quality. Easy to setup and intuitive functionality for pausing, resuming switching songs and raising/lowering volume without ever reaching for my connected device.",B01G8JO5F2
For the price you you can’t go wrong,B01G8JO5F2
I loved my Senso wireless headphones so much that I decided to get another pair for a friend for Christmas!  I love them.,B01G8JO5F2
"I have not yet found a pair of headphones as good as these even looking for things triple the price. I have had these headphones for about four years now and they have never let me down. First, they sound amazing and have an impressive amount of bass, in my opinion, though it is not overpowering. Second, they actually work really well for isolating of cancelling out noise. I typically can't hear people speaking to me even if they are only a few feet away from me. I have used them on planes and they really get rid of the drone of the engine. I can't say enough how much I love these.",B01G8JO5F2
"I just started using the product for about 1 day now. I have received phone calls, listened to music from my phone and listened to sound from videos on YouTube. So far I am impressed, from the connectivity with my phone to the quality of sound. However, I have not used it long enough to assess the usage time before charging and also the subsequent degradation on that aspect. In the meantime, I am satisfied with the product and I did like the magnetic clip car holder for my phone.",B01G8JO5F2
I loved this product and use it everyday for a run or hike; but it just died right around a year. The light is one and takes charge but wireless doesn't work.,B01G8JO5F2
Muy buen producto Buena calidad de sonido y buena durabilidad de la Batería como al usar,B01G8JO5F2
"I don't like the adjustable ear hook , the first ones i bought in 2017 were the best. Hope they bring back that model.",B01G8JO5F2
El producto ya no me funciona. No se que paso. Tiene la luz que dice que esta cargado pero no logro encenderlo,B01G8JO5F2
"This is my second pair (I accidentally sat on them), and my husband still his a year and a half later. Just purchased for our son.",B01G8JO5F2
I was hesitant to purchase due to the design.  Was pleased to find that the band that goes around the ear is adjustable.,B01G8JO5F2
"Do not buy! Does not work!<br />The headphones will not stay connected to any Bluetooth device—phone, tablet, computer—for longer than 10 seconds, and then it keeps trying to reconnect and then disconnect every 5 - 10 seconds.<br />I reached out to the company by responding to both of their automated post-delivery customer service emails, explaining that the product did not work and they just ignored my emails. So, apparently, they do not actually offer any customer service.<br />Do not buy this product if you ever hope to have a pair of headphones that works, or if you want to actually talk to someone about replacing a dysfunctional product.",B01G8JO5F2
I used these for just a few minutes today. I was very anxious to get these because I wanted to listen to my music while I swam in the pool. They have great sound and they are comfortable. But they don't work when swimming. They constantly loose signal. Even if the phone is on your person. I was so disappointed. I thought this is gonna be cool to listen to my music while I'm getting exercise and enjoying my time in the pool.<br />:-|  it's a no go. Other than that. There good.,B01G8JO5F2
"Overall, I like these earbuds a lot - when they work. I've bought two now  - once in April of this year, they quite pairing and again in July and they quite pairing. I tried all the remedies recommended by the manufacturer (in an Amazon forum) and still doesn't work.<br />Too bad - otherwise I'd have given them a 5 star rating",B01G8JO5F2
"I have small ears and these are able to wrap around them snug. I haven't had them fall out a single time. The Bluetooth seems to not be as strong as advertised, but it works for my use.",B01G8JO5F2
"So far these seem very good. Surprisingly good quality, easy to use, and comfortable.<br />Only had them a week, though, will update if anything changes!",B01G8JO5F2
Great sound quality. Comparable to professional earbuds for a much cheaper price. I would definitely recommend to others.,B01G8JO5F2
Not a perfect fit for my ears.,B01G8JO5F2
I can now listen to audio books,B01G8JO5F2
It’s great use it for work & to listen to music,B01G8JO5F2
This was the 3rd pair I bought. The product quality has seriously gone down hill. Bluetooth range is about 2.5 feet. Battery life maybe 3 hours on standby. Takes a good 45 seconds to turn on or off. Sound quality is just above AM mono. Very sad because this used to be a superb product.,B01G8JO5F2
Great for the price I paid,B01G8JO5F2
"Just quit working. Won’t turn on and won’t won’t light up when they charge. I only use these when I run on the treadmill which isn’t often, probably used 90 days in the last 8 months.",B01G8JO5F2
The price is right and so are these headphones. Purchasing another one for my teenage daughter since she's been using it more than me.. Ha!,B01G8JO5F2
light weight,B01G8JO5F2
"Arrived unable to charge, so D.O.A. and this is the second pair I've received that won't charge",B01G8JO5F2
listening to music and hands free phone answering for my safety,B01G8JO5F2
I have used this product for listening to music while working out on an exercise bike and an elliptical trainer and it has been completely satisfactory.  Be careful adjusting the position in your ear while working out though ... you can unintentionally mute it or change the volume if you touch the right-side earphone in the wrong place.,B01G8JO5F2
These headphones died after just a few times of use. Don't buy these if you  sweat a lot as they will break.,B01G8JO5F2
"I am still getting used to them, learning that is. They seem to be really nice  & I know they will work once I get the hang of them. Thanks🤗",B01G8JO5F2
Had them for two months; one side stopped working. Ugh,B01G8JO5F2
The first set of Senso earbuds I purchased was superior in design and sound quality.  The latest sets purchased were less impressive overall in sound and comfort.,B01G8JO5F2
Noise cancelling is very good. I walk on a treadmill and watch TV or movies while working out. No problem hearing. I actually had to turn down the volume. Very good!,B01G8JO5F2
excellent quality and remarkable performance at a great price.,B01G8JO5F2
Bought these for my grandson for Christmas. He says he really likes them,B01G8JO5F2
"they work great, no complaints as of now. I actually have 3 pair for the family.",B01G8JO5F2
"“B A T T E R Y L O W”<br />“P O W E R O F F”<br />“P O W E R O N”<br /><br />When you advertise “noise cancellation,” do you mean “make these headphones as loud as possible so that our customers can’t hear anything outside of what they’re listening to and then advertise it as noise cancellation?” I only have my volume up a single tick on my iPhone and these headphones blast sound through my ears.<br /><br />I always get caught off guard when the headphone battery gets low. Even though I have a single tick on the volume while using these headphones, when the headphones tell me the battery is low it automatically turns the volume up to max and screams “BATTERY LOW” into my ears. If you like surprise jump scares then this product is for you.<br /><br />When I bought these headphones Amazon advertised this product at 200+ dollars going on sale for 80-90%. I thought I was getting a great deal and buying some top notch headphones for a tenth of the price, but actually the product was worth 20 bucks. Maybe I should’ve known better, but apparently either amazon or SENSO advertised this product as being at an extremely high discount rate to get more sales. False advertising at its finest, or maybe that might be a trend with products sold on amazon in general. How unfortunate.<br /><br />Now to get more into the technical side, the sound quality isn’t good or bad, which is appropriate since these headphones are only 20 dollars. They’ll get the job done. These aren’t a pair of Bose or Beats. However, when you advertise these headphones as 200+ dollars on sale for 80-90% which is the pricing range of Bose or Beats headphones, but in reality this is only a 20 dollar product, you’re expecting much more from these headphones. And obviously, since this is actually a 20 dollar product you just feel ripped off because it was advertised as really expensive.<br />Noise cancellation as stated previously is solved by Senso by blasting sound into your eardrums until you can’t hear your environment anymore. Not noise cancellation, but nice try.<br /><br />tl;dr - these headphones are not as advertised because the noise cancellation is poor and sound quality isn’t good.<br /><br /> I’m buying a new set of headphones. I’m very disappointed, annoyed, and feel cheated.",B01G8JO5F2
Headphones will not turn on. I was hoping that they would have been as good as the first pair I had,B01G8JO5F2
"Best purchase of the year for the money. Solid sound quality, good fit and durable. So happy I found these.",B01G8JO5F2
"""Walking and cutting grass love working in the yard they really fit great """,B01G8JO5F2
I bought 2 for my kids to use in while doing fitness; both works perfect and are ver confortable; holds tight to the ear. Sound is good and they are easy to use. Good for the price!,B01G8JO5F2
"Nice headphone especially for the price ! Battery lasts forever. If you forget these on the plane, your wallet and your pride suffer far less. Nice , carrying case",B01G8JO5F2
"I was really excited to order these headphones after reading such positive reviews. I have ran with these headphones multiple times now. I cannot get the headphones to stay in my ears while I'm running. No matter how much I adjust them, they always slide out. When I have them in and my phone is in my pocket, the sound breaks up terribly to wear I can't understand the podcasts I'm listening to. This has happened every time I wear them. I would not recommend these.",B01G8JO5F2
The headphones worked for about a dozen uses then would not pair with my Bluetooth any longer. Sent back.,B01G8JO5F2
"I purchased these for pool use based on the description of them being  ""waterproof"" but after receiving them and doing further research, I found in the Questions portion that they are not to be used for swimming. I did pair them with my iPhone and liked the sound quality so will keep them for walking and biking.",B01G8JO5F2
Can’t beat the price for entry level Bluetooth headphones.,B01G8JO5F2
"llegaron bien , pero después de dos días dejaron de funcionar, los estaba usando anoche y dejaron de funcionar",B01G8JO5F2
"I've had my senso earbuds for about a week now and I really like them.  They are very comfortable and don't make my ear sore when listening to music all day.  The sound is great, doesn't totally cut out background noise but I can still hear my music without turning up the volume.  Still deciding if I like the flexible ear piece that goes around your ear.  It's nice because you can adjust it to fit your ear but you always have to adjust it each time you put them on which can be annoying but the material is soft and comfortable.  The only con I can think of is it needs a clip because if you only wear one earbud while doing something the other earbud drags down the other side also the clip will secure it to your clothing when they are not in use and are just hanging around your neck but you can buy clips for extra.  I've gone through a lot of earbuds and overall I am very, very happy with these earbuds hopefully they are durable and will last a long time.",B01G8JO5F2
2 years on and the headphones are still going strong.  Last upto 4 days; my gym sessions can be long and the sound quality is still good.  Love love them.....,B01G8JO5F2
Overall a great pair of earbuds for the price. The customer service is excellent.,B01G8JO5F2
Great sound!!,B01G8JO5F2
Light easy connect and good sound,B01G8JO5F2
Great product,B01G8JO5F2
I use them for working out and they are great. I had a charging problem with them recently but the customer service was excellent. They answered all my questions pretty quickly and had my problem solved. One of the best customer service experience I have had. Highly recommend these headphones and brand.,B01G8JO5F2
"First and foremost, impressive product. Have never had any type of earbuds like these. The sound is impeccable. Honestly shockingly good. For the price, this product is a 5 star. Very impressed. Love them, i don't only use them for running, i also use them at work to cancel out noise. Amazing quality. Great job guys. Outstanding.",B01G8JO5F2
The headphones are greatt,B01G8JO5F2
"These headphones are pretty good. However, I bought them on February 2018 and they no longer work. So, they have a life span of about 1.5 years.",B01G8JO5F2
"After my $150 JBL headphones stopped charging, I took a gamble based on reviews and bought these.  I was a little skeptical, but from the minute out of the box to my first workout they over delivered.  I'm not really an audiophile so I can't speak to the sound quality, but for someone that just wants an easy way to listen to music while running or a hands free microphone, these are great.",B01G8JO5F2
"I purchased these, at first they worked so great, but after 3 months of having them, they won’t charge anymore and won’t turn on! The power button stop working. So sad that they did not last long at all.",B01G8JO5F2
"I have very sensitive ears, and appreciate this product can be worn without actual insertion of the earbud. Im no audiophile but do believe sound quality is very good.",B01G8JO5F2
Great for the treadmill,B01G8JO5F2
I love this head set . Senso is a great company. Support is awesome.,B01G8JO5F2
"This is not a paid review. I am a college student who uses this practically all day: on my walk to/from/between classes, when studying, or jogging. That means I use it from 9 AM to around midnight sporadically. It lasts all day and I charge it every night. Great connectivity. This works exactly like it's supposed to and while it is not the best quality it is decent. It gets the job done and for 20$? Dirt cheap. It comes with a card holding thing to stick on your phone and a magnetic car mount as well as a case and charging table.  Best Value you can get in terms of quantity and quality.",B01G8JO5F2
Quality product (just as advertised) and quick shipment.  Totally satisfied,B01G8JO5F2
Does it’s job but does not cancel noise at all.,B01G8JO5F2
"Great headphones at a great price. Only thing negative is when it needs recharged a voice states ""battery low"" then in one minute it turns off.  No bueno if you are already at the gym or out running.",B01G8JO5F2
Loved it so much that when I accidentally lost them I bought another pair.,B01G8JO5F2
"sound is above average and battery life has been 7+hours, very pleased with product thus far.",B01G8JO5F2
"The sound is great. The stay in your ears well and don't bruise surrounding areas. However, the earbuds do not stay on and constantly disappear or stay in your ear, when removing the rest of the device and after 6 months of use, the battery is shot and it shuts off every ten minutes. It also loses connection if your phone is in your back pocket and you squat down 😒. I would not buy again.",B01G8JO5F2
I love these. I seem to need to replace them once a year. This is my 3rd set. I use them almost daily.,B01G8JO5F2
Great sound.  Nice packaging.  Good customer support.,B01G8JO5F2
"The sound quality is solid, but a huge draw back is the adjustable hooks. Every time you take off the earbuds you have to readjust them the next time they go on. Seems little, but the amount of times you take out one for a second and have to waste time putting adjusting them back in place is crazy",B01G8JO5F2
Love these headphones amazing quality fir such a good price,B01G8JO5F2
Very good headphone,B01G8JO5F2
"Not durable - I have owned this item for about 11 months and it has reached a point where even the slightest bump (like normal running) will cause the device to completely power off. Super frustrating! I can now only wear these if I go out for the slowest of slow walks.<br /><br />The wires around each earpiece are now exposed (see photo), which is likely the cause of my issue. Not sure if I received a defective item or if they are all like this.<br /><br />Great while it lasted.",B01G8JO5F2
This is my second pair.  Was thrilled that they were still available to purchase.  I did a lot of research for my first pair and was quite happy with these.,B01G8JO5F2
"Having just received them I can only say that delivery was excellant, the product was of very good quality and equipped with plenty of good accessories. Performance thus far has been very good.`",B01G8JO5F2
the left ear bud already quit working I only started using them &/24/19,B01G8JO5F2
Lightweight & easy to use.,B01G8JO5F2
APARECE ENTREGADO EL PRODUCTO PERO NO LO HE RECIBIDO.,B01G8JO5F2
Liked these to start with but after having them for only 3 months they won’t charge nor hold a charge now.,B01G8JO5F2
I purchased these for my 22 year old daughter. She loves them. Would recommend to anyone.,B01G8JO5F2
The headphones are very comfortable and they have a very long battery life.,B01G8JO5F2
These headphones are far from long lasting. I’ve owned a few pairs and they've all petered out after as few as three months (longest was 7).,B01G8JO5F2
good battery like and easy set up,B01G8JO5F2
These bluetooth earphones fit well and work great with my phone.,B01G8JO5F2
I have used it twice and I get a lot of static and some disruption in the seed when I'm listening to music it's either fades in and out a bit or speed up or down,B01G8JO5F2
Always,B01G8JO5F2
"This is my 2nd pair.  I bought my first pair 3 yrs ago and they finally died, but for less than $20 you can't beat these for the easy pairing with an Iphone and they are very comfortable with great sound!",B01G8JO5F2
i do love the quality of the sound and materiel,B01G8JO5F2
"Product seems to be good quality. A little bulky to wear. A slimmer unit perhaps more tapered would be an improvement. Bass could be stronger as well. Overall, it seems to be a good purchase. Pairing was very nice.",B01G8JO5F2
Love these work great at the gym and hold up even in the sauna .,B01G8JO5F2
Dont have to worry about it falling off when im on my 3 mile run every night.!,B01G8JO5F2
This thing lasts for like 3 months. Ive gotten it three times. Its cheaper to just buy good bluetooth headphones than go through 4 of these per year,B01G8JO5F2
Great for the price,B01G8JO5F2
It is hard to get these to fit right.  They won't work well with sunglasses or bike helmet.,B01G8JO5F2
I like it and I am very satisfied.,B01G8JO5F2
They have been super convenient. Always easy switching between my computer and phone for calls and music.,B01G8JO5F2
"Had purchased to pairs of these previously they worked well. But the last pair I bought within two days it started malfunctioning disconnecting from bluetooth, spotty service, specially when on the phone and losing a call bc it transferred back to the phone.",B01G8JO5F2
"I like the quality of this product (for its price). It doesn't always connect automatically after being paired though. Also, it would be good if the volume buttons could be switched around in future releases of the product. Other than that, it's great.",B01G8JO5F2
Good quality product. Glad to have it.,B01G8JO5F2
"First time using them at the gym. (Received on 6/13/19). I got these because like many of other reviewers , my Powerbeats 3 stopped working only after only 8 months. I sweat a lot When I am at the gym so I needed something that would actually be sweatproof and not just claim to be. I must say I like these a lot so far. Pretty similar to the beats but ofc not identical. I did however experience some static interference at the gym ( the kind you encounter when you are too far from your phone and connected to the earphones ) even though my phone was right next to me. I’m hoping it was just a glitch and won’t happen again but we will see. So far for the price point I can’t complain.",B01G8JO5F2
"I bought this second one for my wife after having good experience with what I call the ""original"" black version. However, it seems this version is a little cheaper made - at least evidenced by the little charger flap that won't stay in place. Suggests to me lower material quality.<br />The fit into the ear is a little different - not sure if I like it as well, but I didn't try it extensively<br />So overall a little disappointed that this new model didn't do at least as well as old one, or even better, assuming that the manufacturer was really into improved quality",B01G8JO5F2
"The charging port came loose inside the device in less than a month.  Amazon told us the manufacturer would get in touch with us, but have not received any contact from manufacturer.",B01G8JO5F2
"Worked fine until it didn't.  I used it to work out, so perhaps the sweat took it toll.",B01G8JO5F2
I like how they go over my ears and stay in place.,B01G8JO5F2
"6 months after I purchased this Senso headphones, it stopped working without any damage to it. It does not turn on anymore! not recommended",B01G8JO5F2
"I like the headphones stay in my ears, comfortably, without fighting with them.  Good sound quality for audio books and music.",B01G8JO5F2
they have very little volume and when I use them to exercise they pop out of my ears. I think you can't ask for more for the price,B01G8JO5F2
I bought this for my teenage child as a gift.  They work wonderfully and she loves them.<br />The sound is awesome and they are sturdy!  The case is well made too!,B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these just for personal, listening to music use.  The sound quality is great and they are comfortable.",B01G8JO5F2
The sound quality and comfort is amazing. They’re perfect for bike rides!,B01G8JO5F2
I didn't get all the items that said came with this. No adjustable piece for the headphone wires.,B01G8JO5F2
"Like the earclip, stops the headphones from slipping out of my ear.",B01G8JO5F2
very light and comfortable earbud and the battery life is as advertised!,B01G8JO5F2
"Great buds, easy sync",B01G8JO5F2
My absolute favorite pair of headphones. They are comfortable and helpful when I want to listen to music but have to charge my phone.,B01G8JO5F2
"This product is a tremendous value, performance every bit as good as any I have has in the past. Every bit as good as my $250 Apple Buds. At this price I will be buying one or two more sets as gifts.",B01G8JO5F2
"almost perfect besides the fact at least once every time i use it, the sounds gets muffled and after an hour or so it really hurts my ears, even with the smaller covers. other then that they are a great pair of earbuds💞",B01G8JO5F2
Great headphones for the price.,B01G8JO5F2
"I've had a number of Bluetooth sports headphones and I have to say that this is the worst of the bunch. Right out of the box, after a full charge I had sound problems. Lots of crackling and the sound, when I could hear it was like it came out of an echo chamber. Save your hard earned money and buy a different brand.",B01G8JO5F2
Incredible and affordable!!!,B01G8JO5F2
I like these earbuds but when I check the battery life my phone tells me there is 70% left and then they die shortly after so I have to make sure I recharge them at about 80%.  I probably get 3-4 hours to a charge.,B01G8JO5F2
"Great sound, long life battery, easy bluethoot pairing. Best choice at best price",B01G8JO5F2
Design and fits well to ears.,B01G8JO5F2
Not working will not connect to my devices,B01G8JO5F2
These are the best headphones for the buck. Amazing sound quality,B01G8JO5F2
My husband loves them very happy,B01G8JO5F2
I read up on other reviews and it seems it isn't just me having issues with these headphones. The first time I bought this product they worked for a little over 2 months. They wouldn't turn back on even after being fully charged. I contacted Amazon (who were really nice about the whole process) and helped me get new headphones. One month later while I'm using them they shut off. I figured they needed to be charged but they became fully charged after a couple minutes. I now have the SAME original problem in a shorter time period. Unfortunately I don't believe I will be using this product again,B01G8JO5F2
I am using my headphones while I walk everyday. I love that I don't get tangled in earbud wires. I can move freely and know that I won't pull them from my ears as I excercise.,B01G8JO5F2
I have had these ear buds almost two years and they still work great. I use them to both run and cycle with. I did get caught in a heavy rain once and had no issues. I used them on a road trip once and got 12 hours of listening on a single charge.  For the money they are a bargain.,B01G8JO5F2
There are literally hundreds of choices in light weight blu-tooth headphones.  The Senso model is a good overall choice.  The sound is EXCELLENT and they pair up with both IPhone and Kindle quickly and easily.  My only complaint is that I cannot keep them in my ears when I bend down to do things.  This is especially annoying when walking our Chihuahuas.,B01G8JO5F2
"This is my second pair. The first pair gave me two great years of service, but I suspect the battery finally gave up.mthe second pair are pretty much the same, but they did include a magnet to mount my phone in the car. I’m not sure I’ll use it, but I may.mthey are comfortable, reliable, and easily “learned.”",B01G8JO5F2
I was too cheap to buy AirPods for $200 so I thought a $20 pair would work. I kinda bought them thinking they were a cheap pair I could wear to the gym and not worry. Turns out they are a great pair and are perfect for wearing at the gym,B01G8JO5F2
"These are the best buds I've found , excellent battery life,  and sound great . I can get almost 2 days out of one charge.  I bought a second pair so I don't have to wait for them to charge . I highly recommend these . I never had any problems with them and I sweat a lot",B01G8JO5F2
"Great buds, but somehow died from lack of use.  Stood behind warranty and replaced after 10 months.",B01G8JO5F2
never fall off!,B01G8JO5F2
I go through set headphones every three months so I can 100% tell you this is some of the best quality I have had in a while. The battery life and sound quality is awesome.,B01G8JO5F2
great product,B01G8JO5F2
I'm going to buy another pair for my father. Customer service is marvelous. Thanks for everything.,B01G8JO5F2
The ear buds are great. I am still adjusting for the best fit. I also think I need to change the size of the buds to a smaller insert.,B01G8JO5F2
"These headphones are very good ! I have really enjoyed the great sound and the silicon ear plugs are the most comfortable I have had.I definitely, highly recommend them to anyone as a high quality product and I would definitely purchase again !",B01G8JO5F2
"Ok. I love these headphones in theory because I am a runner and these stay on and they are comfortable and not too expensive.  I have had one pair that lasted almost 2 years until one side died and I decided to order another pair since it was no longer in stereo.  Here is where the 1 star comes in.  These headphones are really hit and miss. I have ordered 4 different pairs of these and 3 out of the 4 died or were defective within the first month.  Since I had one pair that lasted awhile, I really wanted to believe these were flukes and people were asking me why I would order these so many times—-nope.  Time and again these died and I don’t mean the battery died and had to be recharged. Something in the wiring makes these really sensitive and they just don’t work.  Won’t turn on. Charge them fully and still nothing.  I even tried not letting them sit on the charger too long. I tried not charging them until the battery was completely dead...to make a long story short.  I am now going to reluctantly look for a different brand.  The one pair I had that worked for almost 2 years was the fluke.  Don’t waste your money.",B01G8JO5F2
going to the gym,B01G8JO5F2
Theae headphones are surprisingly good. They sound good to me and come with lots of extras! Definitely would buy again,B01G8JO5F2
"Surprisingly great value for the price. Battery is great as is the quality of the sound. The red ear inserts are pretty much earplugs and do a great job of passively blocking outside noise.<br /><br />Surprisingly amazing Bass (I’m a SVS home theater dude) for theses little earphones. But they keep falling out of my ears a little  when lying back to do sit-ups or running. They stay in your ear, but the sound drops in that ear and the bass goes away leaving an irritating un-balance of the music  between each ear.",B01G8JO5F2
I purchased these for the gym and they work great. The battery life usually lasts two workouts before I need to recharge and Sound is decent. My only complaint is the prices that go over your ear are not adjustable so they don’t fit as snugly as I would like.,B01G8JO5F2
"Great headphones at a great price. I have bought multiple pairs of these and they all performed stellar. Had a small issue with one set, and Senso Support took care of me right away.<br /><br />These sound as good as products that cost 5x as much, and are quite durable. If you're purchasing bluetooth headphones for less than $100, these are for you.",B01G8JO5F2
"I have owned the Senso bluetooth Headphones for only a few months and the battery dies with in 40 min of usage even on a full battery charge. Unfortunately, it is not a fluke with this pair. It now happens everyday I pass 40 min of usage it dies.  very disappointed. Otherwise, it was a good earphone system for working out",B01G8JO5F2
I loved these... Until they only lasted about a year and 3 months.  Now they just randomly turn off and won't reconnect without a struggle!,B01G8JO5F2
"so I bot these to swim...not submerged much though they claim they are fine doing so.  Bot one pair, died on 2nd swim.  they were decent about replacing..  2nd pair just as bad...  1 swim, no longer charges.  DO NOT buy if you plan on being near water, ok for running, etc",B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these primarily for use in the gym, I was forever snagging the cord of regular earphones on equipment.  First use yesterday... Easy to set up, paired with the phone instantly.<br />Comfortable to wear and the controls seem easy to use.  Can’t comment on battery life.... Yet.",B01G8JO5F2
I use this product for enjoy my tv show on iPod.,B01G8JO5F2
"Sound quality is average, battery life is tolerable, noise cancellation is kinda there.<br /><br />Now for the important but, Bluetooth strength, yeah this shit starts getting choppy at at 4 feet. Phone on your left hand side? Nope not if you want a connection, phone more then 3 feet away, better be prepared for to start losing connection..<br /><br />Maybe they're actually waterproof I dunno, bout to find out but I honestly doubt it at this point",B01G8JO5F2
I love Bluetooth headphone. They charged very fast.,B01G8JO5F2
Love this product. Just dislike how evertime you go to adjust them the power button is located in area where you turn them off evrytime.,B01G8JO5F2
I was really excited about these but was disappointed firstly with the size of these and they really dont fit well in my ear.,B01G8JO5F2
"Good sound quality, perfect in ears. I will recommend this to my friends.",B01G8JO5F2
I like them,B01G8JO5F2
"If you are looking for a pair of headphones with a spotty Bluetooth connection and that crap out in the middle of running a marathon, you’ve come to the right place. When I first received these headphones as a gift, the connection was spotty but I chalked that up to my phone being a little older. When I got a new phone, the connection improved... but not by much.<br /><br />This past April, I ran the Boston Marathon. The night before, I made sure that these were fully charged and ready to go only to have them totally crap out at about mile 10 (about a hour and 20 min into the race). Thankfully, I packed my apple headphones as a backup and was able to switch. If it weren’t for the decent sound quality, I would’ve given these headphones 1 star.<br /><br />Save your money and spend them on higher quality headphones.",B01G8JO5F2
I was worried that these would hurt my ears or fall out with movement. I was pleasantly surprised as the piece that goes behind your ear is silicon and adjustable and makes for a good comfortable fit. Overall a great product for an active lifestyle.,B01G8JO5F2
Excellent product,B01G8JO5F2
I bought it in Sep 2018. Now it died in Dec 2019. Almost 1 year and 3 months. Bad quality.,B01G8JO5F2
The headphones broke after less than two months. Never buying these headphones again.,B01G8JO5F2
Pretty good headset for the prise,B01G8JO5F2
I purchase the earbud because my old one stop working but I'm very impressed with the quality and clarity of this Senco ear bud. I have already recommended these to a family member. I'm very please with my purchase.,B01G8JO5F2
"Why is there a continuous blinking light on at all times? I use these primarily in a darker setting and the blinking blue led is ridiculously obnoxious. I've put electrical tape over it. All the blinking is completely unnecessary. Otherwise, they do the job. I've had them for almost 2 years now and they're still going strong so that says something.",B01G8JO5F2
Can’t say excellent ones but okay with the price,B01G8JO5F2
"I had them just over a year. Use them primarily for the gym. I always put them back in their case after use, but recently a wire has started poking through the wire sleeve. Going to pick a different brand as a replacement.<br /><br />Pros<br />-connects easily via bluetooth<br />-sound quality is good enough (primarily listen to edm and rap)<br />-no issues with battery life<br /><br />Con<br />-for some reason the ear ring is extremely large and won’t fit<br />-broke after a year<br />-the sound can be too loud and unable to turn it down any lower",B01G8JO5F2
Stop working first day.,B01G8JO5F2
"Sound, fit, messages and battery are very good.  Ordered one for my wife so she doesn't have wires hanging out of her IPHONE when she takes her walk.  Most of the time I run listening to music coming from my IPhone.<br />Rob & Cathy",B01G8JO5F2
Very comfortable and easy to use.,B01G8JO5F2
"I’m on my second pair because my dog chewed up my first and I could not live without these things!!! The noise cancellation is pretty good for the price, though it’s certainly not like those headphones that block out everything. But the sound quality is amazing, and it comes with multiple bud sizes to fit your ear! These things do not fall out during a nice hard workout or even during a nap.<br /><br />Cannot recommend them enough for the price!!!",B01G8JO5F2
I will never go without wireless again! Life changer,B01G8JO5F2
"These headphones were definitely great for the months that I could use them.<br />However, they stopped charging after a while of use. Be careful during workouts, I think some sweat might have got caught in in the actual headphone and disrupted the internal components.",B01G8JO5F2
Excellent quality fit and sound.  Buds stay in place.  Great battery life.  Disposable buds not tried.,B01G8JO5F2
"I cannot mention noise canceling because I only use them in a quiet environment, but otherwise they are wonderful. Comfortable, they stay on my ears where they should, different sized tips give me choice, the sound is great, they connect every time. Highly recommended",B01G8JO5F2
Se dano rapido,B01G8JO5F2
"Lasted about 2 months, then stopped pairing with any devices.",B01G8JO5F2
"Great product, earbuds are comfortable to wear and they sound great.",B01G8JO5F2
absolutely phenomenal sound. Tremendous value for the price.,B01G8JO5F2
Muy bueno todo pero al final los cables se rompen,B01G8JO5F2
"Bought these for long distance runs. Durable and gets the job done. For the price point, well worth the investment!",B01G8JO5F2
"Hey guys. I've had these earbuds for 2+ years and they're still kickin.<br />They work but *the usb cord wears out after awhile!* so you may want to replace it or use a different cord.<br />I've been frustrated numerous times because it won't turn on or it won't charge....<br />Until I realize it's not the earbuds, it's the cord. Now, I use my JBL Bluetooth Speaker charging cord to charge, and they're charging as I type this!<br />Totally a great product for a cheap price, but just heads up about the cord.<br />Peace & love, and happy exercising! #GoVegan",B01G8JO5F2
"Pretty standard Bluetooth ear buds. The only remarkable feature is that the over the ear part is wire, so you can form it you your ear, unlike others where that part is a soft plastic.",B01G8JO5F2
"This is my second pair... First pair lasted for 2 years and final wore out from pretty much continuous use.  Unfortunately, in my new pair the charging port broke after minimal use.  Not sure if it was defective or not but now they can no longer be charged.",B01G8JO5F2
"Apparently I have small ears, as the over-the-ear loop keeps falling off.  This is not a matter of the size of the ear bud.  I bought a second pair of these headphones because I adored the pair I bought a few years ago (and recently lost).  But for the too-large ear loops, these are great.",B01G8JO5F2
The headphones worked for a little over 1 year and then the left headphone stopped producing sound. I called to see of they could be replaced but the warranty only lasts for a year and I was over by a few months therefore they would not replace them. I understand that the product I received may be defective but they should at least last longer than 1 year.,B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these for my son so he could lift weights without having to deal with wire earbuds. Not even six months and they are broken. He charges it all night and the buds don't even respond. He doesn't use them for sleeping and told me that they don't even start. Who knows, to be objective, I have one that has lasted for almost a year. But it seems too late to return for an exchange. Next time, I will get him a better pair.",B01G8JO5F2
- Bluetooth works well and connects quickly<br />- very good sound and volume<br />- fit is fine,B01G8JO5F2
These are good headphones... they served me well for a solid years then pooped out on me ... I’d buy them again!,B01G8JO5F2
"I didn't expect much for the low price, just needed a wireless earbud  that would wrap around the ear so it wouldn't fall off.. They were louder than I expected with pretty good sound to boot. I mainly use it when doing yardwork, and this is exactly what I wanted. Also, I have read reviews about the wire slack flopping around, well this one came with a wire tie! looks like these guys really listen to what customers want, Great job!<br />Thanks Senso!",B01G8JO5F2
Works great for running and everything I need.,B01G8JO5F2
"Perfect, and exactly what I was looking for. Great battery life, easy setup, really good buy and product. Thank you Senso",B01G8JO5F2
"For the price that your paying, this is the best. They do the job and more. I bought four for family and they love it. I workout alot and sweat alot and they still work like if they were brand new!",B01G8JO5F2
"I bought a blue pair of these when they went on sale in the amazon day deals almost 3 years ago. I’ve used them regularly through out the years for working out at the gym, running, and cleaning around the house! For the price they are awesome! My blue pair have finally given out so today I am purchasing my second pair but in red! Hopefully there is some consistency in the making of this product!",B01G8JO5F2
Good,B01G8JO5F2
"I never leave reviews on products, but I will gladly make an exception for these. I realized I had these for almost 2 years now and just lost my pair recently. Super sad. I did not realize how much I loved them until they were gone! As a college student, $200 target headphones are not an option. When I unfortunately couldn't find mine, I got on here and purchased another. I may have paid the extra just to have them delivered the next day. My right hand, my go to. These are GREAT quality for an awesome price. I use them to work out every day. I noticed some upgrades on my new pair, easier opening to charging port (yay), faster charge, AND even seem better quality. Thank you, thank you, thank you!",B01G8JO5F2
"I like the headphones, its sound, its price. But I do not like when the sound keeps going up. I have to keep turning them done and they go back up during the same usage.",B01G8JO5F2
Light weight and personal use,B01G8JO5F2
"I've been using these for more than 3 years, and I haven't found a better pair! For the price you pay, it's a great deal. Great sound quality, pairs easily, good battery life and device lifetime. I'm actually going to buy another pair now, and decided to review them after having such good use over the last 3 years. One slight minus is that the chord is a little long and the right ear fitting doesn't seem to be as good as the left ear (but maybe that's because of my ear, and not the device?) . Regardless, still an amazing purchase and good value for money!",B01G8JO5F2
This product is now not working. It is terrible that the product life cycle is so short --I would think it should at least work for a year -- I need a refund or something,B01G8JO5F2
I like how they fit and easy to adjust around my eara,B01G8JO5F2
"Great sound ,decent battery, wish it was a bit smaller",B01G8JO5F2
Good fit. Good sound. Good value.,B01G8JO5F2
"My wife and I both use these and have tried both the red and the blue. Sound is decent and controls are easy enough to use. But they don't last very long. Between the 2 of use we are on our 3rd set each in 4 years. Each set progressively lasted less time then the previous set. Different issues with each one. Wouldn't turn on, sound cut in and out, powered off randomly on its own, range suddenly got very short. On our last sets the voice that would tell you if you were connected was very loud and unpleasant. We keep getting these because reading reviews of other products doesn't sound like we would have better luck with something else in this price range. Also doesn't sound like if we paid more for something else that it would last longer.",B01G8JO5F2
"I'm actually very happy with these headphones the sound quality is great, with a long lasting battery, I could use it during the day to answer calls from my clients and then head straight for a workout with music playing and still not have fully drained the battery. And when one side stopped working they promptly sent me a new headset that's on its way because I was still within the year warranty.",B01G8JO5F2
"The earphones use a combination of over-the-ear loops and insert-able ear buds.  Though they are not officially noise-canceling, they do keep out a lot of extraneous ambient sound when I use them.  Another feature that I like is that as soon as I power them on, they connect with my phone and are ready to use - no repairing or reconnecting required as with other bluetooth products.",B01G8JO5F2
I love it being cheap great sound and good quality on phone calls,B01G8JO5F2
Very nice.  Although you should note that the ear clips are bendable lol.  Sound is really goid,B01G8JO5F2
"Got this almost 2 years ago and it had worked well. Sounds nice, good battery life and a sufficient amount of ear pieces. I don't use it too much and I'm pretty gentle with all my headphones. However, right before hitting the 2 year mark, the wires started peeling off right where they connect to the buds on both sides. I've wrapped a tape around them for now until I find a new one, but it won't be another Senso, that's for sure.",B01G8JO5F2
"I like them, they connect easily, good sound",B01G8JO5F2
One size ear does not fit all. The earpieces need to be adjustable. Was not a snug fit and was loose while running. Sound was ok but not much bass.,B01G8JO5F2
Good for listening to music but not good to use for phone calls.,B01G8JO5F2
always connects via bluetooth - nice sound - good buds  and controls - no bulky inline pieces - very light. great price.,B01G8JO5F2
"Bought these for my runs. They initially sounded great; very loud with a great EQ mix. Unfortunately, the started having problems on my first run with them. Firstly, they don't stay in the ear. I had to adjust them a few times a minute, which is annoying. Then, after about an hour of use, they started cutting out (sound would waver in and out). Additionally, after further use, the right headphone began to lose volume when compared to the left. I think the sweat played a role in this, which is lame because they claim to be waterproof. After a couple more days, the on/off button became permanently pushed in, so it's very difficult to even turn them on now. Wouldn't recommend for running/exercising/sweating in. Might be a good choice for daily use at home or in an office setting.",B01G8JO5F2
The best I have ever gotten work far better than I anticipated. Bye far the best Product for the money,B01G8JO5F2
The ear tips fit me very well. I was surprised at how clear and good the sound is. It's great to not have to plug into my phone. All at an affordable price,B01G8JO5F2
"Sound quality is little deep for my taste. But good for the price. Has a little fuzziness but they work for working out and casual listening. Would not recommend if you're a headphone snob, music junkie or DJ. But it works for me and my boyfriend.",B01G8JO5F2
"These headphones are wonderful! Especially for the price. I bought two sets one for my boyfriend and one for myself. I mostly use them to listen to music but occasionally to chat on the phone. The only downside to these is that people on the other end of my phone conversation have a hard time understanding me. I have attempted to reset via the manufacturers directions but nothing changes. Aside from that the sound quality for music is wonder and they are great to have in the gym instead of my plug in ones that get wrapped up in the gym equipment. My boyfriends gave out almost a year after purchase, but he used his every single day so I am impressed.",B01G8JO5F2
"I use these for exercise, they are the first blue tooth headphones I've used and I have been very happy with how well they are working for the price.",B01G8JO5F2
This is a Christmas present has not been used yet,B01G8JO5F2
These worked for 2-3 weeks then wouldn’t connect/ please contact me Re / options for return<br />R Starr,B01G8JO5F2
"The product is fairly decent. The price isn't much, the noise cancelation could be better, they're comfortable, but the volume range is pretty limited. Overall, it is a good set of headphones to have at the gym when you don't want to risk damaging something expensive.",B01G8JO5F2
"This is the 2nd time I’ve purchased these. The first pair lasted less than a year & just stopped recharging and the most recent pair has lasted 6 months and the place where they plug in for recharging actually MELTED. The sound quality is great, but they don’t last long enough to be worth the money.",B01G8JO5F2
Sound quality,B01G8JO5F2
"I chose this product to replace the one I had purchased two years ago that served me well until I closed my car door on it. I replaced it with the same model however upon receiving the newer version, it did not voice dial. I thought that was poor marketing. They were both the same S250 model. I have since then sent it back for a refund and bought a more advanced model.",B01G8JO5F2
"Purchased these about 8 months ago and they suddenly would no longer charge. It's not that they wouldn't hold a charge, it's that they would not charge period. I ended up calling their 24/7 365 tech support and they walked me through a few steps before confirming that they needed to send me a new pair. While I wasn't happy about the fact that they failed in less than a year, I WAS happy the customer support experience an treatment I received and that they were without question, honoring the 1-year warranty. Hopefully, these will last a bit longer than the first pair.",B01G8JO5F2
"Connection time is ok. Battery duration, even after the low.bateryy announcement, is enough. Hardware is enough. I even took a shower with them . Price is.even better",B01G8JO5F2
Have only used them once but they are definitely the best I’ve ever purchased. I never touched them once during my 12 mile run because they didn’t budge. Also very comfortable and the Bluetooth connection was great! I’m hoping to have these around for a long time. The last two pairs I had either quit completely or wouldn’t charge after 3 months of purchase and I spent double on them. I’ll never buy an expensive pair again.,B01G8JO5F2
Have had two sets first set lasted years were great. Bought second set a few months ago seem a little lighter on the quality but so far great. Would recommend for gym and cardio.,B01G8JO5F2
"These were fine especially for the price.  The right earphone slipped out of place constantly no matter which size earpiece I used.  They stopped working on June 19, less that a year after I bought them.  Used them on the 17th and then they wouldn't charge or turn on.",B01G8JO5F2
Didnt have any problem so far,B01G8JO5F2
"I purchased these in February 2017. This week (May 2020) they finally started dying after only one run, I’m assuming that’s because the battery is just worn out.  I’m going to buy another pair, they lasted over 3 years so I count that as a huge win! Highly recommend these - good base, comfortable, and I never have to worry about them falling out.",B01G8JO5F2
"Not liking at all how they fit. I have tried 3 different size ear cushions and they do not stay in. It may be because the ear loops are not stable, too maleable(?) And they run up against my glasses. Just not digging them.",B01G8JO5F2
Works great,B01G8JO5F2
Only had them a week but the sound is great and they stay in my ears while I am on the elliptical.  Paired with my I phone easily.,B01G8JO5F2
This is the 5th time I am buying this product. I love it. The last two times(including my most recent purchase) have been a bad experiences. The earphones stop working all of a sudden. The current one I have is less than a month old and it is just my 4th run with them and they stopped working. They dont switch on.,B01G8JO5F2
Adjustable ear bands makes it easy to conform to anyone’s ear size.,B01G8JO5F2
Work up a sweat and they short out. POS.,B01G8JO5F2
As the headline says the second headset (bought it in December) failed in about 3 months. I also did not like the over the ear hangers of the second set. The material is softer (comparing to the first one) and wasn't holding its shape.,B01G8JO5F2
"I like that the piece that goes around the ears is bendable, so I could secure them around my ears. Very comfortable and responsive buttons. Found them simple to pare with my devices. Wish they could be pared with multiple devices simultaneously, but they get the job done, so not too concerned. Wore them during my 5K this morning and never had to mess with them at all during the run. I like the case that came with them too.",B01G8JO5F2
"Still going strong after a year of almost daily use. Stood next to a beach bongo player and only heard my music. Battery life has faded only a bit, so very good for basic headphones.",B01G8JO5F2
"Its really good. Used it on my morning runs, d only slight snag is getting it comfortably around ur ears but sound quality n blue tooth connection is on point. Comparing it to MPOW i wasted a whole $45 or so on, dis is good stuff",B01G8JO5F2
For the price you can't beat these headphones. Comfortable with plenty of earpiece options. The case they come with is nice and seems like it will do a great job protecting them while not in use. They have really good sound quality with plenty of bass. Comparable to many more expensive options through popular name brand headphones.,B01G8JO5F2
I use them with my tablet to listen to music while I work around the house.,B01G8JO5F2
"I bought a lot of other companies and a lot of expensive, but I came back from these earphones, thank you",B01G8JO5F2
They stopped charging 2 weeks after I bought them.,B01G8JO5F2
Have used them twice. They sound good and don’t hurt my ears.,B01G8JO5F2
"I’ve had three pairs of these now.  Each stopped holding a charge at about the six month mark.  Unfortunately, there was almost no indication the failure was coming, so they’ve died on me out on a long run (while traveling no less) and in the middle of workouts each time.  Obviously, I’ve kept buying them.  At the price, it was a bit simpler to just get another pair vs. taking a chance on a set multiple times the price with questionable reliability.  However, the third pair is my last – time to give something else a shot.<br /><br />In fairness, for a little over $20, quickly shipped to your door, you get a decently usable set of headphones and a useful magnet mount phone accessory.  For what it is, it’s crazy cheap.  But with that, it will eventually fail on you.  Just know what you are getting and have some kind of backup (e.g. wired headphones).",B01G8JO5F2
very compact package for so many components. I think it is a great gift option to go with.I use this head phone mainly for excercise . The bending strap allow me to adjust the constraint on my ear . So it is more comfortable compared to other headphones,B01G8JO5F2
I have smaller ears and this is my third style/brand of wireless earbuds I've tried in the past few months. I returned the first two brands because they wouldn't stay in my ears. I LOVE THE SENSO buds. The fit AND sound are awesome and they are waaaaaay less expensive than the other two brands I tried. (Those were Bose and Plantronic.),B01G8JO5F2
Excelente,B01G8JO5F2
"The sound quality is excellent , i used so many Bluetooth headphone but these headphone sound quality is much better than other in these price.",B01G8JO5F2
Great for the price,B01G8JO5F2
I use this product for my daily running routine and it feels great. This is my second time purchasing the same item and I super love it! Defitinaly would keep buying it. Keep it up!,B01G8JO5F2
Love these. Work great for listening to music while exercising and answering the phone.,B01G8JO5F2
They were great for a about month and then they stop working..they connect and like 10 second later disconnect... I'm just disappointed it. And now I can even return them..,B01G8JO5F2
"I liked them, they worked well, and they were priced right.<br /><br />Mine died after a year. I suspect it was from getting repeatedly snagged on items in my work bag.<br /><br />If you buy these, it comes with a case. Use the case, when not in use, and they will last way longer.",B01G8JO5F2
"The sound quality was good, I have no problem with it. However, the battery life is a little short, average about 4 hrs of listening time. I used it for like 2 years, and then switched to another product because the battery life is a little short, and most importantly, it is not recording any sounds anymore. I can only use it for listening music, for like 4 hrs. I bought it for 37 dollars, and I was expecting a longer life time and battery, but I might just got a defected product, and I guess the price for this now is much cheaper.",B01G8JO5F2
Every time I tried to work out in these earbuds they would work for about a half hour until they got some sweat on them. Then they would make a funny noise like they were shorting out and then turn off. After a few days (of drying out) they would work again until they got a little sweat on them again and then same thing. Finally they stopped working altogether. When I contacted the company they said the warranty had expired. What a waste of money.,B01G8JO5F2
"First pair stopped charging within 5 months. Sebastian at Senso as many ppl have mentioned in their reviews was great and they replaced the unit after weeks of waiting. Those burned while charging. I thought it was my wife who was cooking on the stove  too close to them.. assuming it could have been human error I ordered them again because you can’t beat the sound volume and charge time for 20 bucks. This new pair lasted one charge that they came with and then one more charge at home. As soon as the battery was dying I charged them again and when I went to use them again they had not charged nor could not be charged. Completely dead. Tried everything. I contacted amazon who listened to my experience and are shipping me a new pair overnight even though I’m passed the 30 day return and I told them that Senso take weeks to replace them.... i get it... 20 bucks or so is not that much and so we can only expect so much, but now every pair so far has stopped working well within the first 6 months... it would be better to just advertise them as the 20 buck Bluetooth headphones - you will most likely get your 20 bucks worth.... it’s crazy how many they have sold and how many reviews there are .... I assumed that so many positive reviews and qtys sold they would work and would be happy to buy a pair annually as I use them for the peloton only... it’s a sad world that all this fancy marketing and the amazon algorithm creates false value. They are just junk guys.... so what’s the answer? Spend 50 bucks, spend 70 bucks or spend 150 to 200 and get a branded name to which there are too many to list.... I don’t want to damage my AirPod pros or lose them while riding outdoors but will a pair that costs somewhere in the middle last longer than these ones? In the end rather attempt to find out with a slightly more expensive pair than this because as much as I want to see these work on the 4th pair something tells me they won’t.... you get what you pay for.... simple as that....",B01G8JO5F2
"I love the high volume, specially when I'm running now the problem is the adjustable earpieces, its so weak, it keeps falling. I have to keep stopping my cardio session to adjust them back to my ears.<br />I'm not sure about the noise cancellation because my family always complains the noises and I hear it as well.",B01G8JO5F2
"The sound is excellent for the price, no lag, fit well.  I would recommend these for those who want a great set of ear plugs for a down-to-earth price.",B01G8JO5F2
I love them,B01G8JO5F2
Perfect!,B01G8JO5F2
"These headphones are a good deal for the money. They pair easily, the sound quality is good and they hold a charge for a really long time. I didn't think I'd like the noise cancellation initially as I use them for running outside and it doesn't seem super safe to not be able to hear what's going on in your surroundings, but that isn't the case. I am still able to hear enough to feel safe but it blocks some of the sound that would make it hard to hear my music. Overall a win in my book.",B01G8JO5F2
"Great headphones, I am pleased that they sent along spare, and different size replacement ear buds.<br />I purchased these headphones to see if I could use them in and near water.  I tried them in the shower to test them out.<br />I am  Very happy to say that the sound quality was excellant.  The volumn control worked well.  Although they got wet, inside and out of my ear, they continued to work and stayed on/in my ears very well.  I read that ""direct spray"" might be a problem, so i kept them out of direct spray as much as possible.  All in all, I am extremely pleased with the Senso Bluetooth WATERPROFF headphones.  Buy them, You will love them too.",B01G8JO5F2
"This is the second set I have purchased. I am on airplanes a lot and I use these to listen to music, watch movies and sometimes just to shut off the world so I can relax. These are awesome sounding bluetooth headsets. I get about 6 hours continuous usage between charging. I really did not understand how good these really were until I accidentally left them in a pocket, while machine washing and machine drying my pants, and they still worked afterwards! They have included a nice unexpected bonus in each purchase. My first set included a car power adapter. The latest set included a high quality car vent magnetic phone holder. I paid around $40 for my first set on a lightning deal which was about half off. This latest set was $21.95 list price so the decision was easy.",B01G8JO5F2
Loved them. But if you workout too hard and sweat too much they'll cut off on you and not reconnect without being reset and that's even more of a pain.,B01G8JO5F2
"I have had this product for over a month now and I have had no problems at all. The sound quality is great, they stay in my ears, and it comes with a little rubber piece that restricts the extra slack so it is not in the way. I use these when weight lifting and while running.",B01G8JO5F2
This is the second pair I purchased. Good quality and value. This pair is for my wife. I have had the same earbuds for over four years with no issues.,B01G8JO5F2
"Worst pair of earphones ever.  No base, design is terrible.  Cheaply made.",B01G8JO5F2
"This was my second pair, I loved the first pair only disappointed in the distance I could get from sound source. I found these to be the same and they broke while replacing ear buds, so I sent them back",B01G8JO5F2
"Sweat proof, sound is amazing what more do I need.",B01G8JO5F2
Can't beat the price and quality of my Senso earbuds. We own several sets.,B01G8JO5F2
EN EL AUDIFONO DE ENSENDIDO SE LE VA EL SONIDO MUY MAL PRODUCTO,B01G8JO5F2
"The good thing is the sound quality.<br />But the bad outweigh the good. Even with the smallest earpieces, the design doesn't allow them to stay on your ears. the hook is bendable to hold them on place, but it is till to large and doesn't keep them secure. they constantly fall out. When the are n, they feel awkward and uncomfortable.<br /><br />You may not pair them to more than 1 device.",B01G8JO5F2
The noise cancellation are better for workout it mostly cancels the noise when u are getting annoyed by people etc,B01G8JO5F2
My only complaint with these is that the piece that wraps around the ear actually routed sweat into my ears when I would run with them and I did have to resecure them somewhat frequently.,B01G8JO5F2
Unhappy with this product I bought. Headphones worked great when I first received them. Then stopped working after 2 months. Unhappy with amazon allowing this seller to sell products that don’t work. Would not recommend.,B01G8JO5F2
"Good product,  but it didn't last much.",B01G8JO5F2
Cheap and effective! I,B01G8JO5F2
These are the second pair I’ve purchased. The first were great but the second pair I purchased for my husband have this clicking noise that sounds like a record skipping. Since he never complains I’m only learning about it because I had to borrow them.,B01G8JO5F2
Good buy,B01G8JO5F2
Unhappy with this product I bought. Headphones worked great when I first received them. Then stopped working after 2 months. Unhappy with amazon allowing this seller to sell products that don’t work. Would not recommend.,B01G8JO5F2
"It was a toss up as to whether I would replace my iPhone's cabled earbuds or whether I would venture into the world of cableless bluetooth. I'm glad that I did. The SENSO Bluetooth Headphones paired easily and quickly with my iPhone 7. I'd read that after market , non-Apple headphones and earbuds sometimes have trouble pairing with the iPhone. Not a hitch. I was quickly impressed with the sound of these little things. I'm much happier than I was with the original equipment that came with the iPhone.",B01G8JO5F2
"no issues, fit well, sweat/ moisture not an issue. I have two, after years of use with the previous model, it's now my spare.<br />I'm a sweathog on the treadmill, I'm in my own world wearing these..<br />it would be nice if this has a charging case option. I'd buy that too.",B01G8JO5F2
Love the sound quality. Ear hooks are a little difficult to adjust to get a comfortable fit,B01G8JO5F2
They are not very comfortable. They do not stay in place when working out. They do not have as good of quality as I hoped but for the price they work fine.,B01G8JO5F2
Great sound. Deep powerful bass.,B01G8JO5F2
"Look. They sound great, are comfortable and are inexpensive, but they don’t last. I actually have went through many more pairs of these then the three in the picture as these broke after the warranty period so I couldn’t exchange them. I just spent the money and upgraded to AirPods. That all said, I do sweat a lot.",B01G8JO5F2
I have a pair of these headphones for myself that I absolutely love. I have even broke an old pair of these headphones (my fault completely) and didn't hesitate to buy another pair. So when my mom needed a new pair of headphones I automatically bought them for her! She already loves them and is using them on a daily basis.<br />I highly recommend them! Great quality headphones for a great price!,B01G8JO5F2
"I use these when I run outside. They stay in my ears really well. The sound quality is good and they do a pretty good job at blocking any ambient sound. The only thing that I don't like is that when it's windy, there is a lot of background wind noise.",B01G8JO5F2
I use these headphones around the house and backyard while doing hobbies and activities. I also use these while at the gym.,B01G8JO5F2
"I PURCHASED MY FIRST SET OF SENSO HEADPHONES IN 2018 AND OMG I WAS IN LOVE!!! THESE ARE NOT THE SAME QUALITY!!! I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THEY'RE LOSING MONEY ON ALL THE RETURNS THEY'RE GETTING?? PROBABLY COULD HAVE JUST NOT SLACKED ON QUALITY AND HAD A LOT MORE HAPPY RETURN CUSTOMERS WHO DO NOT RETURN THEIR ""NEW AND IMPROVED HEADPHONES""<br /><br />*****TLDR: DO NOT BUY!!! ****<br /><br />THEY RECENTLY QUIT WORKING AND CUSTOMER SERVICE TOLD ME THEY WOULD BE FIXED IF I FACTORY RESET THEM...WELL...IT DIDN'T WORK.<br /><br />SO I REORDERED THE SAME HEADPHONES, OR SO I THOUGHT... THESE ARE NOT THE SAME, THEY'RE SO CHEAP, AND THE EARHOOKS ARE NO LONGER ADJUSTABLE - SENSO SAYS, ""THEY DON'T MAKE THE ADJUSTABLE EARHOOKS ANYMORE BECAUSE THEIR CUSTOMERS PREFER THEM FLEXIBLE SO NOW THEY'RE JUST FLEXIBLE"". I ASKED IF THEY HAVE ANY HEADPHONE WITH FLEXIBLE EARHOOKS, THEY SAID NO.<br /><br />SO ALL OF THIS TO SAY, THE EAR HOOKS DON'T EVEN HOOK MY EAR, THEY'RE TOO BIG AND DO NOT CONFORM TO THE EAR.<br /><br />IF YOU ONCE LOVED SENSO AND EXPECT THE SAME QUALITY....STEER CLEAR!! I'M NOW ON THE HUNT FOR A PAIR OF HEADPHONES THAT JUST DON'T EXIST ANYMORE :(",B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these to wear at several running events and they failed on me after the second run. I called to have them replaced and the customer support staff at Senso told me on two occasions that (over 3 months) that the replacement headphones were on their way. When I called again after 5 months to check on my replacement order, they told me I was beyond my warranty and would have to submit my complaint via email with the details that I had already provided via the phone 3 times. Click off of this page now and find more a reliable product with decent customer service.",B01G8JO5F2
My ears hurt after used couple hours.,B01G8JO5F2
Good sound clarity. Does not fall off ear.,B01G8JO5F2
Amazing! I have tried multiple others and the KEY thing with these is the 100% flexible and moldable silicone ear hooks!! Super important - they are soft and moldable so you can make them fit your ear. Others headphones seem to have mostly non-flexible hooks so they fall out of my ears. These are the best!,B01G8JO5F2
Works great quality sound and comfortable. Nice packaging,B01G8JO5F2
Got them for him as a Christmas gift and he was blown away by the quality of sound and the depth of the bass. Super impressed.,B01G8JO5F2
I’m a sweater and the earpieces still pop out. I’ve tried every size. Still haven’t taken them to the pool but I lose connectivity with in 10 ft so I doubt going 25 meters away from my phone will allow it to work.,B01G8JO5F2
My husband has ordered three pairs now.  Both my husband and 11 year old son love how comfortable they are.,B01G8JO5F2
I bought two sets of these useless earbuds. These cutout constantly when used with my iPhone (8+); it's as if I'm listening to some radio broadcast across the ocean in 1946. What a genuine waste of my money.,B01G8JO5F2
Great headphones great customer service brought two pair. Then did have a issue with the left ear but thank you for the warranty it was fixed.,B01G8JO5F2
"Excelente product, highly recommended",B01G8JO5F2
"I'm enjoying my new Senso wireless Headset  , it pairs up with my Galaxy 6 and music sounds and hear it very clear and in coming call have great reception, noise cancellation is perfect, clear and ear loops are flexible and easy to adjust them. Making a stand out headset",B01G8JO5F2
"Very happy with the product, easy set up to get them up and running,  great item I would definitely recommend",B01G8JO5F2
I like them.  They stay out of the way while I’m at the gym.,B01G8JO5F2
"I loved the price point. I was so pleasantly surprised buy the very good sound quality. I’m a vocalist and an avid listener of music, Jazz, Country, Classical and Pop. So full sound is important to me. I have already recommended them to others in the market. I use them as my hands free device and I’ve not heard any complaints from anyone on the other side of the call. They are also comfortable in my ear. The iPhone ear buds are not. I Have tried other name brands and have returned them all because of poor sound and material quality. Thanks for this product. I would like just a little more bass. I will definitely make you my go to company for ear sound devices.",B01G8JO5F2
Love these!,B01G8JO5F2
Bought these for my husband and he loves them!  Works out everyday with them.,B01G8JO5F2
"These headphones stay in my ears well, are fairly comfortable, and the battery lasts for several days for me.",B01G8JO5F2
I use these while walking on my treadmill and the sound is better than the more expensive sets I've had.,B01G8JO5F2
 ,B01G8JO5F2
The hard plastic shell is very uncomfortable.,B01G8JO5F2
"Pros: These sound good. They pair easily.<br />Cons: After 3 years of light use the connecting cable started to fall apart. Don't buy if you need durablity. It's a shame, because I relly liked them.",B01G8JO5F2
I have hearing loss and these make my exercise great by allowing clear music and podcasts. Easy-holds charge well-good clarity,B01G8JO5F2
Works and sounds good.,B01G8JO5F2
Great sound and rear fit. The flexibility ox the around rear piece is cumbersome to maintain continuous fit.<br />LOve the memory foam pair of buds.,B01G8JO5F2
"One of the best headphones I’ve ever owned, you won’t regret it.",B01G8JO5F2
"This is my second set as the first set was stolen. As with the last pair, I like the quality for the price. I really have no complaints. Granted I only had the last pair for about a year before they were stolen but up until that I had no issues with them. I sweat a a lot during workouts and I wore them 99% of the time  and never had an issue with sweat. So we will see how long these last.",B01G8JO5F2
"They are very durable.  I like that the are waterproof since some of my runs are in rain.  They can irritate my ear on occasion during long runs, but sometimes I can minimize that by swapping ear covers.  Very good ear buds for the price!  This is my 3rd pair.  My 1st pair stopped working about 4 months in, but customer service shipped me new ones right away!  The 2nd pair lasted about 1.5 years before the Bluetooth module stopped working.  Worth the money for both quality of audio and amount of the they last.",B01G8JO5F2
"They are loud, clear, and aside from coming loose from my ear during workouts (but don't fall out), they're great",B01G8JO5F2
These work great but depending on the device you may experience jitter and connectivity issues.  The jitter usually happens when using it along with another app that uses wifi or gps like a run tracker.  Also the pairing can be iffy but nothing that isn't easily troubleshooted and fixed with a reset or power cycle.,B01G8JO5F2
I'll come back here if they disappoint me. But they're pretty great right now.,B01G8JO5F2
"I liked that it was wireless, and durable. Though it arrived and I charged it for an hour. I attempted to test it using the instructions. The battery only worked while plugged in. Headphones don't work while plugged into a power source. Look and feel cool though. Too bad they arrived defective. Still have them as paperweight, not worth the effort to return.",B01G8JO5F2
Me encanta,B01G8JO5F2
I love them...the sound is great!,B01G8JO5F2
Why spend a ton of money when these work perfectly.,B01G8JO5F2
"Best one I owned..I had the beats wireless which died because of my sweat within 6month, the pantronics from costco, same thing in 8 months...those were the cheapest and i had them for over 1 year, still working",B01G8JO5F2
"Positives:<br />The sound is EXCELLENT, the BEST of the many different brands I've tried around this price point, including some costing much more. VERY good bass and clear treble; if you're an audiophile, as I am, you might find it's not quite as crisp in the mid-range, but you'd have to pay multiples of this price to do meaningfully better.<br />Note that they are not truly ""noise canceling"" but when the buds are snug in your ear they do a good job of keeping most of the ambient sound out (bonus: you're less likely to get run over if you're crossing the street!). I use these mostly for workouts and they more than meet my needs.<br /><br />Less great:  They don't  transmit my voice on calls as well as some others I've had, mostly when outdoors. I also prefer an in-ear anchor rather than  over-ear loops, but that said, they stay in my ears even during hard workouts. If I'm sweating I occasionally have to push them back in to get a snug fit. But not many others have in-ear anchors, and the ones I've tried have inferior sound to these.<br /><br />ADDENDA<br />03/03/21-The replacement also stopped charging after about 5 months, though it did not overheat this time. And once again they cheerfully replaced the earphones. They say they don't get many complaints of this kind, so I'm not sure it there's something strange about my charging cable. I'm going to switch and see. In any case, I stand by my review. At this price you could replace them twice a year, even if you had to pay for both, and still come out ahead!<br />5/4/20: after close to six months of great performance, the charging port overheated and melted while charging. I contacted the company and was completely delighted with their response-concern and an immediate offer to replace the earbuds, which they did. This company deserves your business and the product overall is terrific. I tried a few others in the interim and always come back to this side. Again, for the money, I cannot find anything else that comes close.",B01G8JO5F2
Not very excited about this order.,B01G8JO5F2
Ear hooks are too flimsy.. constantly had to adjust. The connection cuts off (in and out) while running. This is my second one ..the first one lost sound on left side.,B01G8JO5F2
Charged headset after I received but it never powered on.,B01G8JO5F2
"Great noise cancelling, good battery life but just stopped staying on for no reason so now they are no good",B01G8JO5F2
"So, first off, for the price, the sound is great and the range is amazing!  I can walk 45 feet from my phone with these in my 1949 (thick walls) home and I still have reception.  But the battery life is funky.  You hold the side button on the right earbud to turn on and off, and a voice comes on and says ""power on"" or ""power off.""  Fine.  But I've found when I clearly turn them off, and I've charged them relatively soon beforehand, they still go dead very fast.  So it seems the ""power off"" really isn't turning it off, and it's draining battery life.  The red or blue light on the side of the right earbud tells you whether it's powered or not, and it's tiny--which is good overall, so there's not some annoying light coming from your ear if you're in a dark space or a library--so that's not the issue.  It just seems to drain battery charge, even when it's supposedly not on.  Upshot:  I'm always charging these things, which is a bit of a pain.  I need to start doing this the way I charge my computer--just plug them in every night.  So if you don't mind charging all the time, these are terrific.  And they STAY ON.  The wrap-around ear band is wet-noodle-y flexible, and once you get used to that, it's a terrific feature, because they don't bind or pinch.  And for folks like me who have trouble getting earbuds to stay in, these REALLY DO.  Good luck!",B01G8JO5F2
"I love these things.  I use them for work, for workouts, and for leisure.  Battery life is pretty good.  The one thing that bothers me is that the piece that ties the two earphones together.  Sometimes this will get caught awkwardly on my neck which can cause one of the earphones to get pulled out of my ears.  Happens more in active situations like running.",B01G8JO5F2
I had the product for 14 days. I did 10 workouts. I sweat through them. Not a good product.,B01G8JO5F2
Lightweight great for exercising !,B01G8JO5F2
"These headphones are amazing. Better than a lot of brandname ones. They definitely hold their charge since I’ve gone over a week without charging them and they still work. Pretty water resistant too as I only use them when I’m working out and have sweated all over them. The accessories they come with are great too, so that’s a nice bonus.",B01G8JO5F2
I already wrote a review for this so I am not sure why I am getting asked to write another>?,B01G8JO5F2
"For whatever reason, I was unable to charge these headphones after 7 months of using them.  Now, they are useless.  Save your $ and buy elsewhere.",B01G8JO5F2
"Purchased these April of 2018 and they died Jan 2020, it stopped charging. Lasted a decent amount of time, hooked up seamlessly and was decently loud.",B01G8JO5F2
Excellent performance,B01G8JO5F2
These are reliable and well made... but way too bassy. If they can fix the equalization on these they'd be perfect.,B01G8JO5F2
"I've had these headphones for over a year now and I'm incredibly pleased. I feel the battery life (about 6-8 hours) is comparable to any other similar product. The sound is actually really good. These headphones don't have the tinny sound that other similar products have had. The bass is clear and deep. Honestly, I wouldn't probably spend $150 for other brands when you can get a really amazing product for this price.<br /><br />Cons: they require adjustment every 15-30 minutes if you want them to sit just right. No fast charge option. The wire does get caught on my shirt and tug at the headphones occasionally.<br /><br />Pros: incredible sound, no ear fatigue (I can wear these for about two hours with little to no pain in my ears you can sometimes get), and great battery life for the price.",B01G8JO5F2
"I've just bought my 2nd pair. I used the first 8-10 hours a day every single day. They finally just wore out. They are perfect for the money. Casual listing in any normal environment they work perfect. I had a pair of $100 before these. The expensive ones were a bit nicer, but not $80 nicer.",B01G8JO5F2
"The battery lasted well past the 3.5 hour flight time. The sound quality was all I expected for the price. They are a little larger than I expected, but they were comfortable enough when I changed to the correct size ear pads which were included.",B01G8JO5F2
Love to listen to music when I'm working.,B01G8JO5F2
Sound is awesome,B01G8JO5F2
They lasted a little over a year then quit charging. That’s pretty good for my usage. Seems like that’s as long as I can make them last as this was my second pair purchased that lasted about that long. I wish they would have lasted longer but for the price can’t really complain too much. Probably will buy again and expect 1 more year of service.,B01G8JO5F2
Thanks for you,B01G8JO5F2
"I’m a musician (a bass player).  When I got these, I started with the plastic eartips that come already on the ear buds.  The sound had WAY much bass.  It overpowered the music and I was really disappointed.  Someone said on another review to swap out the eartips with the foam ones that come with the ear buds so I gave it a try.  WOW!  Fixed the sound instantly!  I have had other earbuds that have the plastic eartips like these come with and the sound is fine.  Not sure why these plastic ones suck but TRUST ME, swap them out.  The sound quality on these with the foam tips is INCREDIBLE!  My only thought is that the plastic tips somehow muffle the sound and create more bass.",B01G8JO5F2
I use these headphones while I lift weights. They offer great sound and they don't fall out of my ears. The battery last a long time with no interruption in the connection.,B01G8JO5F2
The best ones I had so far,B01G8JO5F2
Stopped working after 4 months! Disappointed.,B01G8JO5F2
"Great product at a great price. Comes  in a convenient storage box. Excellent sound, noise cx and battery life.",B01G8JO5F2
I like the over the ear style and there are a few different ear pieces one of which was perfect.<br />Working in the yard or cleaning inside they work fine.I gave the first set to my son and bought a second set!,B01G8JO5F2
Great sound quality.  Easily molds around ear. Have had for 2 years and still going strong.  First pair were defective but were were replaced immediately with no issues.  I live the connecting cord in case one comes out they don't get lost.  I wear during water aerobics and there's lots of splashing.  Good range from music source.  I can actually think of no negatives.,B01G8JO5F2
It was a gift and I assume they were happy with it,B01G8JO5F2
They are great! Two years later they still work fine!,B01G8JO5F2
Wife says they work great so I have ordered another set.,B01G8JO5F2
Look these are worth it. None of the other nonsense works for this price. You want a cheap pair of bluetooth headphones for casual use. Boom,B01G8JO5F2
"I love these things, don't be fooled by the price, they are great!",B01G8JO5F2
Honestly it’s amazing for me. It’s my first Bluetooth set of buds but they’re honestly quite amazing and for a good price. I accidentally put them through the wash as well but they survived and work perfectly fine. Won’t do that again.,B01G8JO5F2
These are are great for the gym ! Stay in & great noise cancellation .,B01G8JO5F2
The only issue I have is they fall off my ears and there's no way to adjust them,B01G8JO5F2
These wireless earbuds with the “loop” around the ears make sure they don’t fall out during a workout!,B01G8JO5F2
This is my second set of these headphones. The first pair last for several years. Good purchase.,B01G8JO5F2
This headphone didnt charge,B01G8JO5F2
good headphones,B01G8JO5F2
"While I gave it a good review for quality, etc; the fit in the ears isn't very comfortable even after several ear plug exchanges.",B01G8JO5F2
My favorite headphones ever. This is my 3rd purchase not because the broke but because I’ve lost them!! I’ve gotten other people hooked on these. If you are looking for reliable headphones that won’t break with sweat buy these. The sound quality is nice and they are long lasting.,B01G8JO5F2
"Great sound, excelente battery life. I dont think these are noise cancelling headphones.<br />Mic never worked on mine, only useful for music.<br />Never had issues with Bluetooth",B01G8JO5F2
Easy to use and comfortable. Sound quality is better than expected!,B01G8JO5F2
"Excellent sound quality, ear buds are comfortable.",B01G8JO5F2
"I wish I could write a good review but I can’t. I went through two pairs with the same issues. First is an incessant beeping, one beep about every ten seconds. The issue seems to be with the Bluetooth connection with my IPhone. I could have lived with that for a $20 product, but more important is that they constantly disconnect and turn off. This can happen after a couple of minutes of use, making them useless. Th3 company was good about replacing the first pair but I won’t bother with pair number two. I will look for something better.",B01G8JO5F2
Great,B01G8JO5F2
I found the sound quality and volume to be excellent and the fit to be very comfortable. Very good st this price point.,B01G8JO5F2
WOULD BUY AGAIN,B01G8JO5F2
I ran a half marathon wearing these and they lasted and did not fall from my ears.,B01G8JO5F2
"Wish I could give these a better rating but no can do. Sound gets cut off randomly when riding my bike or sometimes even when walking. I've owned them for about 4 months now. They worked well at first but over the past month the sound has been getting worse especially in the left earpiece, as it has progressively gotten quieter leading me to have to play my music louder. To cap things off, the left earpiece has now completely gone bad to the point where I could barely hear any sound coming out of it if any at all. Tried resetting but didn't help. Having owned multiple different bluetooth earbuds like this, these have so far had one of the shortest lifetimes, in terms of how long I've owned and used them for, before they stopped working properly.",B01G8JO5F2
"These are a gift, they look nice",B01G8JO5F2
To many wires,B01G8JO5F2
I use these for eveything when it comes to activities and music. Durable also,B01G8JO5F2
"I've been using these headphones 3-4 times a week in the gym and the sauna for almost two years with no real problems. Really surprised with these given their reasonable price. It can, sometimes, be a little hard to get them to stay in place in your ear once they get a little wet but the sound quality, battery life and overall lifespan of these little guys have been more than satisfactory for me and I'll definitely be purchasing them again.",B01G8JO5F2
"Very bad experience as I just bought this headset less then 2 months ago, every single person is complaining about the sound and the noise cancellation thing is BS.<br />And in addition to that the headset is too bulky and ugly.",B01G8JO5F2
"Maybe it’s my ears, but the sound is much better when I push the plugs into the ears deeper and I get more base response. Love the wireless with no restrictive cord, and the plastic that wraps around the ears.",B01G8JO5F2
There is absolutely no comfortability. They keep falling out of my ears. I’ve tried different sizes of the ear cushions. Nothing works. I should’ve know considering how cheap they are. They’re practically impossible to use.,B01G8JO5F2
So far it has worked pretty well.,B01G8JO5F2
"The sound is good, the blue tooth works great, I haven’t worn them enough to commit on the long term use but. For the money there great.",B01G8JO5F2
Very nice head phone. It is connects to my forerunner 645 watch and I used it for running.,B01G8JO5F2
"Edit 3/9: After Senso support reached out, I tried using a different cable and it started charging - so it was the cable, not the headphones, that was at fault. The charging cable was also heating up, so definitely needs to be replaced.<br />They seem ok for the price, but did not expect them to stop working so soon! In less than 3 months of intermittent usage they have now stopped charging. When I plug them in to charge, the red/blue light does not come up and even after keeping them plugged in for couple hours it's always saying ""battery low""! Completely useless. And of course Amazon will not take it back as it's been over a month, but come on.. less than 3 months is too short of a life for headphones - I'd expect at least a year.",B01G8JO5F2
"I just bought my second pair of headphones because the quality and sound are very good for the price. I put these headphones through a lot, as I workout every day hard. The battery usually lasts 2-3 workouts about 2 hours each. Ultimately it’s a good buy for the price and quality",B01G8JO5F2
"I love these earbuds. I've had the first pair since 2017!! Just ordered another only because I stripped the wires on one side. They still work awesome. Almost 4 years of abuse sleeping with them and mowing, weed eating, leaf blowing. Couldn't hear anything but my music. Excellent sound, loud!! Clear and no problems with pairing to 4 devices. The instantly connect. They do keep sound out and music in. Definitely a great deal!",B01G8JO5F2
"I had a previous pair that lasted a couple years and through alot of runs. When they quit, I bought a second pair which turned out to be not so good. Sound and all was good, however after a short while the button to push to pair up with my music stopped working. Since I can't turn them on, I can't use them. They are of no use to me now",B01G8JO5F2
These headphones are perfect. Great sound quality and stay on ears without problem. Perfect for my workouts.,B01G8JO5F2
"I used these head phones a lot to work out. They are good, and they stay in your ear very good but they are not durable at all. The first pair I ordered stopped working in less than a year, but I was able to get a new pair under warranty. The most recent pair now only works in the right ear. The left ear stopped working. For the price, they are not bad...but don't expect them to last more than a year before needing to be replaced.",B01G8JO5F2
"The sound is great, but the quality is cheap",B01G8JO5F2
The headphones are great. They don’t slip out of my ears when running or sweating. The sound quality is excellent. I love how I can adjust the volume right from the headphones.,B01G8JO5F2
"The sound quality is great, this is my second pair. Recently ordered earbuds and comparitiby disappointing, so i ordered these for the second time. Also recommended for both of parents who ordered and love these too. Recommended !",B01G8JO5F2
"There are a great product, Though if you want good bass buy other ones but they may be more expensive. The battery is really good and they don't have a voice tell you if they are low battery etc. . If you want earbuds that are good and don't<br />want to spend a lot of money buy these.",B01G8JO5F2
I loved this until the part where u plug it in to charge broke then I couldn't charge it anymore to use it,B01G8JO5F2
"Welp.  Got these in July and now 5 months later, they won’t charge.  Got nothin’ for tomorrow morning’s run so that sucks.  Didn’t expect a Bose level quality but thus isn’t acceptable either.",B01G8JO5F2
"I've had these for over a year and use them 4 days a week on the treadmill at the gym. The music at the gym is always so loud and these headphones absolutely cancel it out!! They are easy to wear, easy to charge (comes with its own charger) and the sound quality is phenomenal. They also come with several different sizes of silicone ear plugs and they stay in place over the ears. I highly recommend them and do to everyone I know.",B01G8JO5F2
"Love the product, however, I have noticed that once I get to the year mark it stops working.",B01G8JO5F2
"Now after a full 24 hour charge it says battery low after about 2 min. Shame, as I did really like these headphones, and they had great reviews. Maybe I just got a bad one?",B01G8JO5F2
Everyone complains about how I sound when I talk to them and everything cuts in and out. Didn’t last more then a few months.,B01G8JO5F2
The ear piece fits well and can be adjusted to ear size. Very comfortable when walking  and listening to music or audiobooks.,B01G8JO5F2
Surprisingly bad connection when your phone is in your pocket. Battery life sucks,B01G8JO5F2
I enjoy using them during my workouts.  Great not being tethered to my phone.,B01G8JO5F2
These headphones  are great especially for active people. They are waterproof and work well. The sound quality is amazing and the noise cancellation is excellent.<br /><br />The problem lies within the engineering of the earplugs themselves. After 4 months of owning these there was a shortage in the wiring. After receiving a replacement there was a problem with charging them. The light wouldnt turn on so I was unaware when they were fully charged.<br /><br />This company has received over $35 of mine. If I don’t receive my new replacement than I’m moving on to give another company business.,B01G8JO5F2
I buy these all the time ... but this time the left side was defective... 🥺,B01G8JO5F2
excellent for the price,B01G8JO5F2
"Easy to setup, perfect volume, long lasting battery.",B01G8JO5F2
This is my second pair. I purchased this item last year and they still sound amazing to me. I then recently bought a second pair for my wife. She loves them.,B01G8JO5F2
The sound cuts out frequently no matter how close the phone is.,B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these for working out, so I don't need top of the line sound quality. These are ok... the bass is muddy sometimes, and they seem to be heavier on the higher frequencies, but they're not bad at all for $30 headphones. My biggest issue is that they keep falling out of my ears. The loop that keeps them in your ears is adjustable, but no matter what I try, they start coming loose after a few minutes of running. I've tried practically curling the loop part completely around my ear, and after a few minutes, they're loose again. Very annoying. My old headphones just had a rubber loop that wasn't adjustable, and they stayed in just fine, so even though it seems like the ability to adjust them should make them even better, I just can't get them to stay in.",B01G8JO5F2
Great product for the price point. Still using these Bluetooth headphones a couple years after purchase,B01G8JO5F2
"I really was happy with these headphones until they stopped working after 3 1/2 months.  I have had much more expensive headsets but for the money these were a good fit.  Unfortunately,  they only lasted 3 1/2 months of use for working out 3-4 hours per week.",B01G8JO5F2
Great product better than my bose earpiece love it and battery last long too.,B01G8JO5F2
Easy set up. Stay on your ears. Comfortable. Look bulky but don’t feel bulky. Great price.,B01G8JO5F2
"Could not get them to fit my ears snugly, so sound quality and noise cancellation would have been horrible.  BUT, I never got the chance to find out.  Right out of the box, they appeared to charge properly (red LED lit at start, blue LED lit at end), but they would not power up.  After that, they completely died.  No LEDs light when trying to power up, nor when attempting to charge them.  Too bad.  With all the great reviews....",B01G8JO5F2
I really enjoyed these headphones but after a year or so they stopped working so I reordered. This new pair has not lasted me three months. Really disappointed by this product. I have tried all the resets for the product that are online. I used to be a big supporter of this of this product because of my pervious experience however I would not recommend them.,B01G8JO5F2
"Has not failed me yet. Good packaging, nice that they included several sized ear buds. Great value for cost",B01G8JO5F2
Bought 2 and they both died after moderate use in 4 months. Waste of money. And the customer service number listed on the packaging is disconnected. Total scam.,B01G8JO5F2
"Originally I had bought a lightning connector adaptor to use my earbuds with my iPhone XR, during workouts at the gym the cord was just a hassle and I decided I would look into some inexpensive wireless blue tooth headphone options. Did not want to invest a crazy amount for what were going to be basically gym wear and found the SENSO's got good ratings and for the price $20.00 bucks I took a chance. I got the red one's and they have very good sound, great battery life and easy to use buttons to control volume, skip songs and have been a pleasant surprise and I recommend these for a alternative to the higher priced ones if your looking for something for the gym that won't fall out, hold in place on the tread mill or while lifting these won't let you down.",B01G8JO5F2
"I tried these right out of the box and was instantly happy.  They fit my ear well, which is not always the case with ear buds.  I purchased them to be able to listen to books on tape or podcasts while I'm exercising.  I think they will work out great!<br /><br />And, like other reviewers, I'm very happy with the accessories that came with them.",B01G8JO5F2
I have had these for quite some time and I love them! The charge holds for quite some time and I havent had any issues! Highly recommended!,B01G8JO5F2
I purchased the 2nd one since I like it very much. Good earbuds with reasonable price,B01G8JO5F2
Hard to keep on ear. Hop day are much better. Senso can only connect to one device Hop Day can connect to two devices at the same time. Do you not sell Hop Day anymore,B01G8JO5F2
"They came so fast ! In a carry case and other extra surprises , I will be buying more I am sure<br /> Great headphones for a decent price",B01G8JO5F2
I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He loves them. They are amazing. He said it's the best gift he's ever received.,B01G8JO5F2
I just received these the other day so I haven't had much time to use them. Though I did try them out and the sound quality seems to be really good. And the pairing process was really easy compared to the last set of bluetooth earbuds. I really like the adjustable ear pieces.,B01G8JO5F2
I can hear wind blowing,B01G8JO5F2
Ok zipper on case broken,B01G8JO5F2
"Exactly a month and a day after receiving these headphones, they broke.",B01G8JO5F2
I use ActiveBuds every time I go for a walk. It fits my ear very well and it is very easy to control the buttons. Highly recommend this product!,B01G8JO5F2
I like them.  I have purchased them more than once since i lost them,B01G8JO5F2
Had these for a while but then the sound stopped if the phone was behind me. Can’t seem to figure out why this is happening. Any help or advice is appreciated.,B01G8JO5F2
I really liked these and used them every time I exercised. The only issue was the battery life could be longer and they no longer work after a year... but for the price they are great! Just don’t expect them to last too long.,B01G8JO5F2
Sound quality is excellent. Noise cancelling is okay.,B01G8JO5F2
They work great for the money.,B01G8JO5F2
Ordered 1 pair and loved them. Ordered a 2nd pair and had problems with them and they sent me out a new pair no questions asked,B01G8JO5F2
"This is the third headset by this manufacturer/ brand/ model that I have purchased and it keeps getting better!!! The sound quality is amazing, the receiving quality on the other end is great , and the latest headset allows me to form the earpiece around my ear in lieu of it having a set shape. So, it becomes customized to my ear. Battery will last the day.<br /><br />I listen to a lot of music at work and audiobooks/ YouTube videos in addition to phone calls. You must recharge the battery daily.<br /><br />Bottom line, the best $30 wireless headphones I have purchased (because I have either lost or my kids have eaten the others!)",B01G8JO5F2
"Low battery life, and for myself the ear hooks don't hold that great, but they sound good",B01G8JO5F2
"comfortable, affordable, and they get the job done!",B01G8JO5F2
these are the same quality as beats for 1/4 the cost.,B01G8JO5F2
They aren't very comfortable to wear & the sound quality isn't great.,B01G8JO5F2
loved these so much I bought another pair for my husband!  Great value,B01G8JO5F2
Good,B01G8JO5F2
"Lot of air through it while talking. I bought several senso headphones before, they used to be better. I was so disappointed in the last one.",B01G8JO5F2
Super convenient while taking a good morning run ! They don’t fall out of your ears and the sound quality is dope best inexpensive earphones I’ve had so far!,B01G8JO5F2
I love these headphones I have gotten them for my self a few times and I have gotten them for other people because they are fantastic,B01G8JO5F2
"This product has two issues.  If your ears are underwater, there is no sound.  In water as long as your ears are not submerged, you can get sound.  As you go in and out of the water while swimming, it breaks up the sound.  I was willing to live with this problem because the product was very inexpensive.  After wearing the headphone about 12 to 15 times, it stopped staying charged.  I could charge it and get the blue light but it would immediately lose the charge upon unplugging it.  Note to self: buy a better quality earbud.",B01G8JO5F2
"The sound is a little muffled, but otherwise it works. The bluetooth connection works pretty well.",B01G8JO5F2
"It has been several months since I gave these to my son. He uses them virtually every day and loves them. Very durable, great sound, and better that average battery life. My son is not gentle on these type of products and if they can survive him they are tough. Thanks!!!",B01G8JO5F2
The best! I’ve have these over a year and beat them up but they continue to perform beautifully.,B01G8JO5F2
Had these for like maybe a month and all of a sudden the other day they just stopped accepting a charge (the light wouldn’t even turn on) and just never turned on again. I’ve seen some people comment about the seller being good about refunding them so I certainly hope that is the case this time and I don’t have to fight another amazon seller who’s product is faulty,B01G8JO5F2
Great value for money,B01G8JO5F2
They worked great. They were clear and loud. I used them for mowing and yard work.,B01G8JO5F2
This is my second  one,B01G8JO5F2
"So far they are working great, it sometimes stutters when the headphones are connected via Bluetooth however I turn them on and off again and the problem fixes itself. Overall it's a great product.",B01G8JO5F2
I bought these a little over two years ago and I love them. I use them at the gym every day and the sound quality is great. They’re comfortable and cancel out the noise around me.,B01G8JO5F2
Even . Though . They . Didn't . Send . Me . The . Accessories . This . Headset . Rocks,B01G8JO5F2
Works great for the price,B01G8JO5F2
"Great headset, with extended battery life. Built to last as well.",B01G8JO5F2
"Save your money, bought it 4 months ago and it doesn't work!",B01G8JO5F2
I bought these for my husband and he loves them.They are great quality. the price for the quality was amazing.,B01G8JO5F2
These are the best Bluetooth earbuds I have had to date. Sound is great not too much base but just enough for me. Also keeps outside sound to a minimum. Very comfortable was able to wear for 5 hrs with no problems and battery lasted the whole time. So far very pleased.,B01G8JO5F2
Thoroughly enjoying my SENSO Bluetooth Headphones. They arrived early in secure packaging. I take them to the gym regularly. I’m very pleased with the material and sound quality. Battery life is impressive.  I would recommend these headphones!,B01G8JO5F2
They were working great till the sound started breaking in one bud. The warranty was still in place when the sound went out and the customer service and support team were awesome at solving the issue. I am grateful for their speediness and efficiency.,B01G8JO5F2
"I used these ear buds daily for 20 months. Average use per day 1-2hrs. No issues. They stay in my ears well, except at a dead sprint where one may jiggle lose but rarely fall out. I will be buying another set and have already given one as a gift. They finally won't charge. This far exceeded my expectations!",B01G8JO5F2
The tips really stay on which I like because for some reason I tend to lose these on all the other earbuds.  The wrap around the ear piece is flexible so you can bend into what position you feel is comfortable.  I've never had an issue with the other earbuds wrap around ear pieces even though they were hard but this is a nice feature.  And not something about the earbuds I appreciate the bonus card holder that sticks to your cellphone (handy for those of us that don't always want to carry a wallet as well as a phone).,B01G8JO5F2
"Have had mine for 1 1/2 years last week after a 3hrs bike ride I forgot that they were placed in my back jersey  pocket and they went into the washer....after two days of drying I put them on thinking that they were cooked but they played with no base. I let them dry for another day and the base came back they are functioning normal now. The only caveat I have is be careful when charging make sure you don't bend the cord back too far as it's pretty close to the charging port and you can create a short that can cut out the left speaker, this happened with a previous unit several years ago,",B01G8JO5F2
I am a woman and my ears are small and the buds do not stay in. Good quality otherwise!,B01G8JO5F2
much cheaper material than my prior one.,B01G8JO5F2
Some of the best headphones I've ever owned!,B01G8JO5F2
"I have always had problems with earbuds staying in place. Imagine Dumbo and Yoda having child, those are my ears.<br />When using the memory foam buds these don't budge, whether I'm lifting, running it doesn't matter they stay in place. And the sound is FANTASTIC. They cancel so much noise I have to warn my spouse I'm wearing them so she doesn't sneak up behind me and give me a heart attack. I like the sound so much I re-watch old action movies I've already seen on my phone with these headphones because the sound is so dynamic it actually makes the movie more enjoyable. Highly recommend.",B01G8JO5F2
"I wear headphones most of the day at work, and needed a bluetooth pair because i can't have cords getting in the way.<br /><br />this pair was GREAT for the first few weeks; great sound, controls were easy to use, loved the buttons on the right ear bud for controlling music and answering phone calls. BUT the battery life dropped significantly after just 3-4 weeks of use. The buds were comfortable, easy to use, and exactly what i needed. but the battery went from holding a charge for 6-8 hours of use, to barely holding for an hour.",B01G8JO5F2
Love these headphones!! Feels great and the sound is amazing!! I live the adjustable piece over the ear!! I used them every night at the gym for over an hour in a week and they are still going strong. The battery is wonderful!!,B01G8JO5F2
I have had no issues with linking these up to multiple phones and ipads. I have it synced to my fitbit as well. No issues. Sound is great and they stay on.,B01G8JO5F2
"Excellent headphones to hear music or make and receive calls, love it",B01G8JO5F2
Nice in budget,B01G8JO5F2
"These worked fine for about 6 months and then started to ""crackle"" and switch on and off. Maybe I expected too much from them",B01G8JO5F2
I’ve tried about a half dozen brands of Bluetooth headphones and these are the only ones that continue to have no issue with connecting and the audio quality holds up with no interference. They are comfortable too! Sticking with these.,B01G8JO5F2
"Doesn't stay in ears, wire is annoying on the neck. Ill-fitting. Get real wireless. These are cheap.",B01G8JO5F2
You won’t find a better pair for the same price. Great battery life and solid Audio quality.,B01G8JO5F2
"Great fit, good sound and fairly priced.  Appreciated the storage case too.",B01G8JO5F2
"Pro:<br />Packaging was impressive and fair, as far as the extra materials given for the earphones and case to store the earphones.<br />length of wires were appropriate.  Easy to figure out how to turn it on and Bluetooth to a device.  I didn't read the manual and I was able to connect to my Bluetooth.  Once on, sound quality was fair to good for the everyday person.  I'm sure if your a pro, you can pick up the little differences when compared to others.  At this time, battery life appears to be very good and recharging with a speed charger is great.  The ear bud component that goes into the ear feels very comfortable, and it doesn't feel like its going to slip out when walking around or sitting.  Haven't tested in the gym or jogging.<br /><br />Con: charging cord is very short; loops that go over the ear is toooo big.  It was made for someone with big ears or at least made for men.  The loops can sort of bend back behind your ears but it could have been constructed a little smaller.",B01G8JO5F2
"I've bought these before, and after stepping on my last set (I'm a little on the heavy side...they didn't have a chance) I was glad to see that Amazon still carried them.  Solid connection, good sound, and work great in the gym, working in the yard outside, or even for a walk.  I'll try and be more careful where I leave them...but I'd buy again in a heart-beat.",B01G8JO5F2
"loved the audio quality. charging took longer than expected and never did see the ""blue"" light which denoted fully charged.",B01G8JO5F2
Great Buy,B01G8JO5F2
"These stopped working after 2-3 weeks. I sweat a lot when I run, I live in the South. SENSO was responsive to my email and tried to troubleshoot the issue, and the return was easy. However, I do not trust the water resistance rating on this product.",B01G8JO5F2
"This thing sucks, it does not pair with iphone 6. I'm assuming it doesn't work with any subsequent iphones either. So I couldn't do a proper review of the sound.",B01G8JO5F2
Love these headphones!,B01G8JO5F2
Good fit / durable/ great sound nothing negative to say about them . Use daily at gym,B01G8JO5F2
These earphones are really good. The TV sound is plenty loud and makes the dialog easier to understand. And I like the volume control. Very convenient..,B01G8JO5F2
swimming,B01G8JO5F2
It is good for the price you pay.,B01G8JO5F2
Second pair,B01G8JO5F2
"The earbuds work really well when I'm not moving too much, but when I'm on my bike, it'll cut out sometimes. I noticed it more when I was moving fast downtown. The noise cancellation is decent, the bass is better than I expected, and it pairs easily. The adjustable ear attachment rubber works well, but the housing for the electronics will pick up a lot of wind when moving fast or in windy conditions, and I wouldn't expect any amount of noise cancellation to be able to deal with that.",B01G8JO5F2
"Good sound, fit takes a little work to find the right sized ear bud but you have the choice of several.",B01G8JO5F2
"I previously owned an older set/model of Senso headphones that lasted about 2.5 years. Once they stopped working, I decided to buy another pair of Senso headphones since I liked my old ones. However, this new pair is much larger in sizing with regard to the part that wraps around the ear lobe. So, it is much harder for these headphones to stay on my ears while I am running. This second set stopped working after 6 months.",B01G8JO5F2
I bought it for my sister and she used it for 3 months it works well but after that battery problem started and one side of the bluetooth completely stopped working. Not at all worth to buy. I will never recommend this to anyone.,B01G8JO5F2
"I just love everything about those earphones.<br />I interchangeably use Bose QC (latest), Sony MDX-1000, Apple AirPods, and those. I use mostly the SENSO. Controls same good as MDX-1000, stays in ears good. I changed to included red foam insert. Was doing same with my shure-500, but the sure is wired and I can’t use it anymore.<br />Bottom line - love love it",B01G8JO5F2
This is now my second pair in the past 90 days. Both pairs have stopped holding a charge after a few months of use. I spent about an hour before just giving up and ordering another brand.,B01G8JO5F2
Got laid twice wearing these,B01G8JO5F2
I like the quality of the sound at a very affordable price. Easy to use and that it is waterproof is a big plus!,B01G8JO5F2
"Get these they are wonderful! You can talk on the phone and the sound is great. Perfect for walking the dog and listening to music without worrying about them popping out of your ears. Used them when working out and running and they stay on your ears just fine and not affected by sweat. Great to just drape around your neck when not in use and you wont lose them. The battery lasts for hours when in use and for weeks when not in use. Shows the battery level when you connect to phone so no guessing how much battery is left. Ive had them 5 years and they are still working like new. For the price, I cannot believe how well they've held up. Id give em a 10!",B01G8JO5F2
Even when you fall asleep the chance of losing the headphones is much less than those without the strap,B01G8JO5F2
These are great sounding and stay in place while running.,B01G8JO5F2
Mine worked great for about six months and then it wouldn’t charge. I’d plug it in all night and as soon as I turn it on it tells me the battery is low.  Save yourself the trouble and buy from a reputable brand as you’ll end up having to buy another pair of headphones because these are not made to last.,B01G8JO5F2
I bought these for my wife and she loves them.  She said they have wonderful sound and are very comfortable.  We bought a pair for our daughter one Christmas and she highly recommended them.,B01G8JO5F2
Sound quality is good. Distance reception is over 40 ft. Microphone works great. Overall a really good product.,B01G8JO5F2
Really did not get a chance to wear. It would not stay on my ear.,B01G8JO5F2
I like the fact that they really are noise cancelling. I didn’t hear the gym attendants announce that the gym was closing until someone had to come up to me. It was slightly embarrassing but you really get what you paid for.,B01G8JO5F2
"My earbuds stopped working unfortunately. When I called customer care for support, without even asking any question, they offered me a free replacement!<br />Overall great sound quality and durability",B01G8JO5F2
"Thus product leaves a lot to be desired. Has no rang on the blue tooth have to carry phone with me oh and don't open the refrigeratordoor orbit discountif you don't have a line of sight, battery life sucks, wire between ear buds it way to thick, stiff and just uncomfortable. Lost my others replaced with this. Wow big waste.",B01G8JO5F2
"the product works very well, connected easily to my Apple devices without the use of PIN/Activation codes.<br />the items were also packaged nicely and professionally as to protect the product during shipment.",B01G8JO5F2
100% satisfecho,B01G8JO5F2
These work perfect. Also there are different sized ear tips which is a plus.,B01G8JO5F2
I used these for running all time and they were great for that. I used to have otium but my wife wanted them so I gave them to her and wanted to try something different so got these and the quality of these are better then the otiums but my wifes earbuds still work 3 years after buying then and my do not after almost 2 years of use.,B01G8JO5F2
I ordered after watching a review video comparing them to the beats product. The review was spot on! Excellent sounds without the price!!!,B01G8JO5F2
Right speaker fell off after 6 months and the warranty department is completely useless,B01G8JO5F2
Heavy on base for audio.  Really bad for phone calls. Caller on other end complains echo,B01G8JO5F2
"Worked great until it broke after 2 months of usage, not worth the cheaper price.",B01G8JO5F2
"Quality product, reasonable price",B01G8JO5F2
Stopped working and can’t be charged after 7 months of use. Very disappointing.,B01G8JO5F2
"Excelente presentacion y funcionalidad, el producto es más de lo esperado, calidad y mejoría en el sonido inigualable a los headphone ya utilizados. Muy buen producto.",B01G8JO5F2
"I wanted some bluetooth ear buds so I could get rid of the cord. I listen to audio books while working in the shop and the a dangling cord gets in the way.<br />These ear buds work great. The  connected to my phone with no problem.<br />I like the voice that tells you if they are on or off, no guessing if you hit the button right.<br />Added plus was they have a built in mic. I must have missed that in the ad.<br />With the mic, I can answer the phone<br />Great ear buds.",B01G8JO5F2
The last several I have purchased has been defective. Not turning on at all or not holding a charge. Something has changed with this manufacturer,B01G8JO5F2
Only issue is random skipping of songs on my playlist,B01G8JO5F2
"My ONLY complaint would be regarding the cord that goes between the two earpieces.  I found it a bit annoying.  The material that it is made of is a little ""grabby.""  I wonder if they could use a different material that would slide more easily instead of grabbing against clothing?  Otherwise, everything else about this product is great; certainly an excellent value for the money!",B01G8JO5F2
Very good sound,B01G8JO5F2
"These were the highest rated “waterproof” ear buds.<br />Tremendous value!!!<br />However, having brought them to the pool...<br />They still worked after Getting wet, but you could barely hear them. Once they dried out they appear to be fine.<br /> Now that I know the imitation, they are great quality.<br /><br />PS: I broke the internal on one of the ear loop, through constant fiddling. My bad.<br /><br />I like them well enough to buy a second pair. I would recommend them.",B01G8JO5F2
They would kinda cut in and out as if they were wired or like poor connection but other then that happening a few times it pretty good for the price,B01G8JO5F2
"Not a bad cheap headphone, only issue I have is it will loose BT connection randomly.",B01G8JO5F2
"My wife says they fall out of her ears sometimes, but other than that, the sound is great.",B01G8JO5F2
Wear them to workout,B01G8JO5F2
"SENSO's wireless sports earphones offer a great quality product at a terrific price point.  Too easy to set up and use, even for a non-techie person like me.  I like to security of the ear wrap-arounds and they do not interfere with walking, running or working out at the gym.  Highly recommend SENSO.",B01G8JO5F2
These are great for my workouts because I like to listen to my lectures and podcasts for my college classes while I'm exercising. They work good at canceling out other noise. The battery life is good but it does take a while for them to get a full charge. The bluetooth does have good range as well.,B01G8JO5F2
All as advertised.,B01G8JO5F2
Sound is great.  I ride heavy equals every day and have to be able to answer my phone.  The sound on the phone calls are awesome and the people at the other end say it sounds like I am standing next to them.,B01G8JO5F2
So far the best wireless headphones I have tried at this price level,B01G8JO5F2
"Love them for fitness workouts. Sound great, good noise cancellation, no more tangled wires!",B01G8JO5F2
"They work for what I need. Sometimes have issues with people not hearing, but I mostly use them to listen to music/movies.",B01G8JO5F2
"I use these to work out 5 days a week. They have done well so far. They have about 7 hours of use and charge fast, but the sound is deep. Like they wanted extra base but also added in a cavern. Changing the settings on your phone didn’t add to the quality to me. If you can get past that the case, variety of ear pieces, malleability of the behind the ear parts, and the easy functions make this a good buy.",B01G8JO5F2
"Gave them to wife for her workouts at the gym,  loves them!!!",B01G8JO5F2
"too bad they break so easily. 2 pairs and one is dead. The other? Well, it's been over a month and they are still working. We'll see!",B01G8JO5F2
"I am not the one to leave reviews. However, just received there 3 days after ordering. I am absolutely mindblown. They feel and fit perfectly and  normally I have trouble keeping earbuds in. I have ran with these, workedout with these and havent had one problem. The quality of sound is amazing. I literally have my volume on my phone on the lowest setting before it goes to mute and the sound is perfect. There is absolutely no way you can listen to music with the sound up like with other earbuds. If you are looking for great earbuds then look no further. These are phenomenal.",B01G8JO5F2
"I have no complaints about these headphones. For the price, probably one of the best purchases I have ever made.",B01G8JO5F2
"The product is very ok, for what you can get in $20 budget. The ear pieces keep falling off from the ear, I tried all the three ear buds.<br />One major complaint I have is regarding putting on the ear buds on the ear piece. The openings of the ear buds are too tight/ small to mount on the ear piece, even after a lot of struggle I could not put on the memory foam ear buds on the ear piece and eventually ended up tearing them apart.",B01G8JO5F2
Would buy again if the need ever arises,B01G8JO5F2
Nice and good for training. But for noise canceling it is not as written,B01G8JO5F2
"I love these headphones!!!! I have 3 pair. I originally tried them for myself and then my son tried them, and took them. I like how the arm wraps around the ear. The sound is amazing! And they last all day without having to charge. I use them for music,  for talking on the phone, and watching shows on my phone. Great quality. These are better then the name brand ones I had. I highly recommend them. You won't regret it.",B01G8JO5F2
"This is my third pair of these so I obviously like them.  The design has changed a little, and this pair seems to be a little too heavy on the bass.  I am critical of audio quality having spent thousands of dollars on my home audio speakers.  It seems to me this can be remedied by switching the foam earpiece around.  Other than that I've always liked these.  They get pretty loud, but not so loud they will damage your hearing (I hope).  I like how they fit, and I actually really like that it has a wire connecting the two headphones.  I don't like ""truly wireless"" headphones because I want to be able to hang them around my neck.  Sound quality is probably 3-4 which is important to me, but at this price, VERY easy set of volume and ""skip track"" controls, really good and simple connection to my Android phone, and great water resistance (I sweat like a pig at the gym and have ruined other pairs), these are a real value purchase.",B01G8JO5F2
"I've ordered this at least 4 times and they all have different sound quaities. I'm keeping the last one I ordered, however I'm looking elsewhere for new headphones.",B01G8JO5F2
Perfect Gift,B01G8JO5F2
This headphone is incredible... I thought it wasn't that good.... I like it....,B01G8JO5F2
Lemme tell you something!! These mfs right here are lit asfuq for the price it's def a WIN. IF you looking for a set of ear buds that sounds extra right with allot of bass these are def the way to go. I bought some for $20 last week from a store those sucked ass took them back and ordered these senso's I'm def satisfied. Came with a badas carrying case extra rubber ear inserts and a little magnetic thing to set up on your ac vent in the vehicle. 5 thumbs up!!!!,B01G8JO5F2
These headphones are good quality for the price!!,B01G8JO5F2
Bought it based on the reviews but shouldn’t have. I work out in the pool and the sound cuts off when I turn my head.,B01G8JO5F2
"I purchased their headphones in October 2019, I contacted customer support as my headphones became defective in one ear and after following the directions support offered the product was still defective in one ear bud.  It was still under warranty and for the past month they have ignored multiple attempts to contact them about a replacement or workarounds to get the product working as the product has a one year warranty and still under warranty.  I bought a pair of headphones from them in 2016 and their support was much better than so I repurchased another pair in 2019 and was disappointed with the customer support provided.  I will not be purchasing another pair from them and advise anyone in the future to not expect a response about replacement headphones although they do advertise a one year warranty.  I have read other reviews with the same experience and will not be spending my money with this company again",B01G8JO5F2
"Product came with cool magnet accessory clip for vehicle. Sound is adequate, not great. Little to no noise cancellation. I used comply foam ear tips which helps significantly for comfort. Battery life is fine for my needs (I only use for the gym or running). Overall, prob the best wireless buds in the $20-$30 range. Gonna need to spend more $ to get better sound quality. Am satisfied with my purchase.",B01G8JO5F2
"Very comfortable, light weight and easy to use.",B01G8JO5F2
This is the third pair I’ve bought. Given a pair to a couple of friends as a gift. Consensus is that they are great! I have a pair of Powerbeats 3 and the Sensos are ever bit as good. You get a lot in the box as well. This at a 10th of the price? Outstanding. Highly recommend,B01G8JO5F2
Fits good sounds good,B01G8JO5F2
"So far I’m enjoying them so far, quick and easy to pair",B01G8JO5F2
"The sound quality and all was great! Problem I have, is the part that wraps around your ear is so long, that it will not stay on my ears! Nor my friends. And when I lay back on the bench, it just falls off. Possibly I got a defective pair? I am not sure",B01G8JO5F2
Good product.  Had no problem. Similar to brand name headphones.,B01G8JO5F2
"I like the sound quality of this product. For the price price you pay for them you actually get a great sound. Yes, they need to work a little more on noise cancellation, but they work well. I’m sure that with time they will eventually better this headphones!",B01G8JO5F2
I brought these a little over a month ago and they stop working no longer takes charge now I cannot return it.,B01G8JO5F2
"I gave these headphones 5 stars because I've had them for a year and a half and still work great I use them for my gym workouts they last about 4 hrs and the sound is great. Just like any item if you take care of it, it will last.",B01G8JO5F2
"This headphone sucks, not working after just one year. It is not charging at all. I guess 1 year warranty means buy another one after a year. Will never buy anything sense again.",B01G8JO5F2
"I bought a pair of these headphones almost 2 years ago. I loved them. They replaced the plug-in headphones that I had been using, and I so loved losing the cord. The sound quality was good and the battery lasted long enough between recharges that, unless I forgot to charge them, it was not an issue. However, I loved that pair to death, and when the connection between the two sides died, I asked for and received a new pair as a present.<br /><br />In most ways the new set is as good as the old, but there is now one irritating problem. The new set has different material (they call it ""memory metal"") in the thin, flexible ear-hooks that hold these on your ear. However, the ear hooks are now too flexible. They don't hold their shape well and so the earbuds start to come out. I am constantly having to reach up and try to readjust the earbuds or rebend the ear-hooks to try to hold the earbuds in place better. Now these headphones, rather being something that just does what is needed, have become an constant irritant.",B01G8JO5F2
highly recommend - sound is great; fit is strong for all activities; can't beat the value,B01G8JO5F2
"Overall good product, but its super annoying that it keeps repeatedly  saying “low battery” after 30% and interrupting the music... Also the loud beep when increasing the volume is a little extra too",B01G8JO5F2
Headphones would not charge. Trying to contact manufacturer.,B01G8JO5F2
I was happy that they stood behind the product and am waiting for a replacement,B01G8JO5F2
Great headphones. 3rd time buying these last pair lasted a long time. Worth every cent.,B01G8JO5F2
"These were some of the longer lasting bluetooth headphones I've had.  Sweat will kill them pretty quickly though.  I got about a month of running with them 5 days a week before they died.  Not great, but better than most in the price range.",B01G8JO5F2
"Purchased these originally for myself, and mentioned it to a co-worker who runs, and was looking for a bluetooth that is sports appropriate with good sound quality. After trying it out and really liked it, he ended up taking it...he needed it more than I did.",B01G8JO5F2
"Very clear when making and receiving calls, This blutooth is really water resistant, battery could last longer tho.",B01G8JO5F2
Great for the price,B01G8JO5F2
Horrible sound and doesn’t fit snug as it should be falls out of here very easily I would’ve asked for a refund but I forgot to do so,B01G8JO5F2
"great price, practical,  and can be placed loosely on ears to be aware of surroundings while working;  walking, riding bike through neighborhood or in nature.  Can also be placed to cancel out noise.  Cord does need some improvement. Satisfied especially compared to more expensive types that fail like LG HBS-780, with the frail earbud wires that apparently shorted out.  WORTH THE PRICE (so far)!",B01G8JO5F2
fair,B01G8JO5F2
"This is my third set - I have them situated all over so that I have quick access.  Yes, I know there is a wire running between the earpods but it doesn't bother me.  Great sound, convenient, long lasting . .  Need I say more?",B01G8JO5F2
"I love these Bluetooth ear buds!  They charge quickly, have great sound for music and speech and are light weight! easy to fold up I zippered case.  Great product! 5of 5 stars!",B01G8JO5F2
Easily the worst headphones I’ve had.  They will say connected but won’t connect fully that I can play music on my iPhone. I have to turn them off and on again. And worst part is the constant skipping like it’s buffering or like old CD players used to be.,B01G8JO5F2
"Really great for the price. The 1 issue I had was changing the sizes, I personally had a lot of trouble with that. All around though I would recommend",B01G8JO5F2
"Use when mowing lawn. They stay in my ear, sound great, and are only 20 bucks.",B01G8JO5F2
I need to be contacted by the seller. I have already started looking for new ear buds.,B01G8JO5F2
Bought these for use with Peloton bike. Super easy and quick to connect. Sound quality is excellent. Great noise cancelling. I sweat a lot and it hasn’t caused any issues. I wear them walking the dogs and they’re great too. I end up with the wire in front of me bc sometimes it catches on my neck and then pulls but once I flipped the wire to the front it’s perfect. Would order again. Took me a few times to figure out how to wedge them into my ear canal. I usually keep them down on the bike and will charge them weekly but one week I has forgotten and got 6 hours of use in without charging. Don’t know how long charge lasts but so far so great. Quality of sound is rich and loud which is what I was looking for but there are plenty of lower levels that it sounds good at also.,B01G8JO5F2
Great headphones and great sound. Only small thing that irks me is the minor disturbing interference when pressing the buttons on the earbuds.,B01G8JO5F2
Great,B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these just for the gym thinking if these cheap headphones break soon, no big deal. I have had these for some time, the quality is surprisingly great. Cant believe that for 25 bucks I god such good quality. awesome case, looks like a very expensive pair of head phones. Again I'm was blown away by the sound quality. will definitely buy these as presents.",B01G8JO5F2
Very comfortable and easy to use. They sound great and work well. Price is unbelievable for what you get. Highly recommend these!! Lasts hrs on end and are very durable.,B01G8JO5F2
"I absolutely love these things! I use them primarily in the gym and after 5 months, they are still holding up very well. I sweat like a mad man when I workout, and these have handled it like a champ. Even a couple of trips into the sauna didn't have an adverse affect on them. I haven't tested the claim of being waterproof, but surviving my sweaty workouts is more than good enough for me. The ear hook could fit a little better, but that just may be due to the shape of my ears. For the money I spent verses the usage I have gotten, I am beyond pleased with this product.",B01G8JO5F2
"I love my SENSO bluetooth headphones. Whether I am at home working or traveling, these are the perfect headphones to enjoy music and block noise, and the battery life is outstanding!",B01G8JO5F2
"After 11 months the headphone will no longer stay connected to my phone. They will connect for MAYBE 3 minutes before disconnecting altogether. The headphones are charged to 100% and I've tried some ""troubleshooting"" I've read online but nothing works. Looks like another pair of headphones are going in the trash.<br /><br />I will say that while they were connected the sound quality was great and so was the battery life, which to me is what I look for in a pair of bluetooth headphones. Something that will last all day during work and these worked perfectly for me, until they didnt.",B01G8JO5F2
Thought these were great but the last 2 pairs I have bought were either defective or this pair quit working a couple weeks ago. Reached out and never heard back...,B01G8JO5F2
My husband love it!,B01G8JO5F2
I like it,B01G8JO5F2
"I have bought two sets of these earphones. One as a backup. The overall sound is good but, you must have a tight fit to get  decent sound quality. Especially for the bass. One good thing is that they include a set of foam tips to get a tight fit. I like the hooks which help to keep the earphones in place.",B01G8JO5F2
Pairing was easy. I didn't like the default audio settings treble too tinny. Made adjustments in Control Panel and the audio now is perfect. Glad I bought this product.,B01G8JO5F2
DON’T ORDER! I bought these to use while exercising.  I had decent “luck” with them in the past.  They either failed within a few weeks or lasted 18 months or so.  If they failed in the warranty period I was able to get them replaced.  Sound was decent and if I got 18 months from the product it was worth the price.  However when these failed I called for support was told I would receive an email with instructions.  It never came.  I called again.  Same result although I was promised the device would be replaced.  Family member who had also tried these had similar results.,B01G8JO5F2
"This is the second set purchased for this seller and the experience was a pleasure.  The sound quality is excellent, the adjustability and fit are more than good, and the sellers are genuinely interested in your satisfaction, what more could you ask?",B01G8JO5F2
Good sound and battery life,B01G8JO5F2
"me encanta que se sostienen bien, se escucha impecable",B01G8JO5F2
Awesome!,B01G8JO5F2
after a few months the hooks around the ear is loose and won’t stay in place,B01G8JO5F2
I love these headphones.you can’t go wrong for the price.,B01G8JO5F2
I have never had such an awesome  experience  with bluetooth  ear buds.,B01G8JO5F2
"Used them last night on my tablet and they started throwing sparks. I  disconnected and was unable to turn them off. However, I charged them and the light was Ted and blue then turned blue. Only used them for 2 hours.",B01G8JO5F2
Used these for two months before they started dying at 30% and not holding a charge. 2.5 months now and they’re not working at all. Would have rather paid $100 and gotten the Beats.,B01G8JO5F2
"I have had these for years now, and they are just as good as when I first got them!! I use these daily at the gym, and have had zero issues with them. They are able to get sweaty and get thrown in a gym bag, and are still great!",B01G8JO5F2
Delivery came in early and the sound is GREAT. I use them at the gym for my workouts,B01G8JO5F2
Sound quality is excellent. Great for jogging,B01G8JO5F2
Talk to boyfriend when he is at work. So I can move around the house so I can still do my work.,B01G8JO5F2
The quality is not well! I have used these several times! Now a side can't listen to nothing!,B01G8JO5F2
Works well. The chord gets caught on my collar when I’m wearing a shirt. Not much they can do about that.,B01G8JO5F2
"I like so much, really good",B01G8JO5F2
"They sound very good and they are very, very comfortable",B01G8JO5F2
Headphones worked good for about 4 months. Life of the headphones is terrible.,B01G8JO5F2
Working very well I love it.,B01G8JO5F2
"I love these headphones. They really get you motivated in the gym. To describe the sound quality, I would say they have great bass, the battery life is awesome. These headphones stay in your ears, they have flexibility for your ears. The main thing is these headphones are sweat proof, so I really enjoyed that. I can say don't listen to the other negative reviews. If you want good quality headphones, then I would give these a try.",B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these Bluetooth headphones 1.5 years ago. They did pretty well . But eventually the left headphone stopped working.<br />Pros:<br />- reasonable price.<br />- light weight<br />- holds the charge<br />- charge fast<br />- stays on during workout<br />- customer service were nice, cooperative and tried to help. but due to limitation in the warranty I did not get a replacement.<br /><br />cons:<br />- sometimes they don't connect to the phone right away.<br />- the left piece stopped working<br />- it was uncomfortable at the beginning (it takes time to get used to it)<br />- many other brand have the same features and slightly cheaper so nothing special about senso plus a longer warranty period.",B01G8JO5F2
"Great sound quality, fit and comfort, and battery life is great.<br />Would be nice if, when battery life is low, the sound was not so loud, and would be same volume level as current setting.",B01G8JO5F2
Headphones are great for the gym. I like the way they wrap on your ear so when your working out at the gym they rarely fall. The audio quality is good as well. Battery life is good usually last me a week with a full charge so I don’t need to worry about charging them too often.,B01G8JO5F2
"I have several wireless headphones that I formerly used while at the gym. The others would fall out of my ears will on exercising due to sweating! I have not had an issue of that nature at all, plus the sound is extremely clear! I got them fast after ordering. I charged them up and the charge lasts a long time. I love them and I will order a second pair for emergency gym time.",B01G8JO5F2
"Easy and quick to connect.<br />The fit doesn't work for me, part of the problem must be my large ear-canals, but the hook is too flexible<br />Sound quality is good enough for exercise, but not for muisic. I have bought this headphone for exercise, so not a problem.<br />Biggest problem for me is the wind-noise, which is so loud, I have difficult to hear the voice in this headphone.<br />So, I am not using this headphone anymore.",B01G8JO5F2
these are awesome headphones for workin in for 20 bucks.  the noise cancellation does work for the person you are talkin to. while mowin my friend said he could hear the tractor but could hear me just fine.  love these things.  they could be cheaper if it didnt come with the sticky wallet thing and phone mount for car vent. lol.  great deal for a good pair of heafphones for workin/gym.,B01G8JO5F2
Great headphones for the money.  Just got them and like them a lot.  Excellent battery life.,B01G8JO5F2
"I've bought three pairs of these headsets. Every single one of these has failed and now will not charge - it's very frustrating. They are good priced, and they work well. There has been an issue with the battery, but I reached out to support and they have replaced the defective set.",B01G8JO5F2
"I use it while jogging,cancels surrounding noise quite well.I love the sound quality,price and delivery.I would recommend it to anyone",B01G8JO5F2
Head phones arrived earlier than expected and are as good as I was led to believe. Very happy with my purchase. Don't hesitate to get a pair of these amazing buds.,B01G8JO5F2
I bought specifically for my Peloton bike it is a perfect match. Sound and connection doesn’t diminish when sweat gets into it like more expensive alternatives. Would recommend for any type of workout!,B01G8JO5F2
good pair of headphones. .sound better than beats,B01G8JO5F2
"Bought these because I didn't want to spend the money for apple's bluetooth EarPods. They're a little big, but they connect well, have a very decent range and the battery lasts. Normally, I'll recharge overnight or first thing in the morning and they'll go all day without recharging. The sound quality is pretty awesome. I used to love apple's earbuds quality and normally listen to music, podcasts, youtube, audiobooks, sermons, etc. I'm currently using the red foam inserts rather than the black silicone ones. They seem to seal better for my ears and are more comfortable throughout the day.<br />I'll use these with my phone whether I'm working at my computer, building a shed or mowing the lawn. They work great.",B01G8JO5F2
"Pairs quickly and easily, sound great, waterproof. Great value! One criticism, Bluetooth cuts out intermittently when my phone is in my left hip pocket, which is my usual phone pocket.",B01G8JO5F2
"The fit was not comfortable. They are marketed as waterproof, but stopped working as soon as I wore them in the water. Will no longer charge up and turn on. They were worn for literally 10 minutes and now they are useless.",B01G8JO5F2
"The battery life is strong with this one, I can usually go 4 to 5 days without needing to recharge it (using it ~2 hours a day). Sound quality is amazing for the price that it is. On the other-hand, Bluetooth has its pros and cons. Cons: Audio lag occurs sporadically but it usually fixes itself quickly. Pro: I'm also able to get about a solid 6 feet away from my phone without having connectivity issues.",B01G8JO5F2
"I've had these headphones for a few weeks, and they simply died on me. Not sure what happened. It could be that I received a defective pair, but now they won't charge or turn on.<br /><br />Defectiveness aside, I experienced a lot of the same negatives that other reviewers of these have: the headphones disconnect from blue tooth quite often, and virtually no noise cancellation. Additionally, the power button for these headphones is really sensitive, and if you throw them in a purse or a pocket to bring with you somewhere, oftentimes they will turn on of their own accord, and then run out of battery life when you need to pull them out to use them. Very disappointing.",B01G8JO5F2
"Bought my first pair last year and I was impressed initially. The sound was great and the battery life was awesome. Then, after approximately two months, they just stopped working... wouldn't charge or turn on. Being that they were $23, I purchased another pair on July 17th. They lasted 6 weeks and did the exact same thing. These won't charge or turn on. I know the old saying, you get what you pay for, but this is ridiculous. Look for better deals and stay away from these.",B01G8JO5F2
I would highly recommend these headphones.  They are secure and stay in while exercising and are have good sound quality for the value.,B01G8JO5F2
"...6 months in and I'm having a very difficult time with the Bluetooth remaining connected.<br /><br />This is my 4th purchase since 2017 (the other ones would either get lost or somehow messed up), but I've always enjoyed the quality of music and ready connection to my Android devices. Maybe it's just nearing the end of its shelf life?",B01G8JO5F2
The headphones works great. They last all day. The sound is really good and the bass. I will buy another pair for my wife.,B01G8JO5F2
I purchased these 3 years ago and they are still going strong.  The battery has held up well and they still sound great.,B01G8JO5F2
"When I had them they were good. But they broke after like a month. You can shower with them which is nice and the battery life and the sound quality are both really good. Especially for the price. However, this 1 star review comes because even though I purchased a 3 year warranty on them neither the company or Amazon will give me a replacement for my broken ones.<br /><br />I shouldn't have to be out $30+ (they were more expensive when I bought them compared to what they are now) because they don't want to honor the agreement I paid for. If this wasn't an issue this would be at least 4 stars for the time I had them. But with all the problems I've been having trying to either get my money back or a new replacement pair, 1 star.",B01G8JO5F2
Stopped working a coupke days afo. Not mistreatred. Simply stopped working 5 mo ths later. Too manu similar complaints. Will not buy again. Don't trust them.,B01G8JO5F2
"It's a very good value for the price, very durable, battery life is up to 7/8 hours, but it does suddenly it shows 100% on phone untill it starts giving low battery warning, and turn off within minutes of first warning.",B01G8JO5F2
Absolutely love this brand! The sound is perfect for me!,B01G8JO5F2
"I really like the quality, and they included a Phone attachment for my car to attach the cell phone to my dash at no charge.  A nice extra surprise.",B01G8JO5F2
Poor range. I have a BT 4 set that works better. If you have your phone within 15' then fine and sound good for price.,B01G8JO5F2
The over the ear and bendable structure make them perfect for anyone that hates those insert earbuds that constantly fall out!,B01G8JO5F2
Great for working out and they withstood the heat of my local gym’s sauna.,B01G8JO5F2
Durable battery and great sound,B01G8JO5F2
The headphones arrived on time and worked right out of the box. Easy to pair with all my devices. Too chilly to be out getting sweaty but that will come soon enough,B01G8JO5F2
Just sought these out after my hubby lost his old headphones.  I bought a pair for myself a few months back and they are GREAT for workouts!  He stole mine when his disappeared.  I had no other option.  :),B01G8JO5F2
Good quality for the price,B01G8JO5F2
"Speakers used to be clean and crisp. On par with wired headphones. Now it just sounds like a radio from the early 80s. (Or a children's walkie talkie.)<br /><br />When you buy the same model for over two years, one would expect the quality to improve, not decrease.",B01G8JO5F2
I bought these for my fiancé and she likes them a lot. They get really loud. The battery lasted about 15 hours over the course of about 3-4 weeks of working out coming out of the package. (She just had to charge them) They seem great for the price.,B01G8JO5F2
"They are complicated to figure out how to put on. Only fell off my ear once, though.",B01G8JO5F2
Running. Love how they wrap securely around my ears.,B01G8JO5F2
Finally decided to give up on these headphones.  Unless you are indoors and seated with your phone out of your pocket-- you will not get a good connection.<br />While working outdoors with the paired phone in my back pocket-- bend over to pick something up-- lost the signal and sounds like a distorted call.  Leave it out of the pocket and bend over--same thing.<br />I'll be going to Costco to buy a replacement for these that I can truly count on-- done with this brand and done buying cheap junk from Amazon.,B01G8JO5F2
Stopped working after few days,B01G8JO5F2
"I LOVE 'EM! Great sound, nice and high like I like it, no booming bass but that's okay and I recommend these 'phones for audiophiles like me who want to hear nice CLEAR sound without that overwhelming bass sound I've found in many of today's 'phones. Fit is excellent, the ear hooks bend easily and fit perfectly and are very comfortable., the extra ear pads included help to customize the fit. The 'phones charge up quickly and last a good, long time! Linking with my phone via Bluetooth is easy. I think these SENSO 'phones are the best I've had!",B01G8JO5F2
Battery pretty much died after 16 months. Can only last 30 seconds after fully charged.  How long is this supposed to last anyway?<br /><br />Somehow always get disconnected while going up or down stairs.<br />Okay sound quality.,B01G8JO5F2
This is the first pair of Bluetooth headphones I have owned. I love the sound. I have worn them to workout and do things around my house.,B01G8JO5F2
These are great but after awhile my ears hurt from using them.,B01G8JO5F2
Battery life insufficient and wires kept getting in the way,B01G8JO5F2
"Good headphones, they fit my ears, they sound nice and they work on the shower.",B01G8JO5F2
"when i purchase those, i was expecting just for listening music, but is great that i can answer the phone and talk trough them, the sound quality is not the best, but i think that is good enough, i love my new headphones",B01G8JO5F2
I really like the product. Lost my Beats headphones getting out of the car a few months ago and went to Amazon and bought these as a replacement. I'm very satisfied. I've bought a back-up set and had my father by a set last month. Great value and great product.,B01G8JO5F2
Excellent pair of wireless headphones.,B01G8JO5F2
"So far this is a very good product.  The only thing that I have had a minor problem with is hitting the button accidentally while trying to adjust the buds in my ear.  But it is ok if I am careful.  I really like the changeable ear clips.  You can mold them around your ears.  Not a one size fits all thing. So that if you ears are unorthodox, you can make it work with this product.  I use them now every time that I go to the gym.  The sound quality is excellent.  I also like the case.  I have a lanyard that I attach to the zipper and I can keep my earbuds attached to my belt so as not to lose them.  This is a solid, well made good quality product.  And the price was very reasonable.  I would recommend them to anyone.",B01G8JO5F2
It just stopped working after 6 months. Won’t hold a Bluetooth connection.,B01G8JO5F2
"This is my second set of these headphones. They both lasted an average of 6 months being used about 8 hours a day and the battery life averaged 10-12 hours playtime. The first set failed when the battery stopped accepting a charge, and the second the left earpiece began to cut out and died. The company did honor their warranty though and were pleasant to work with and sent me a new pair (after I filed a claim for the second pair). The sound quality is secondary for my needs because I listen primarily to audiobooks or podcasts, as long as I can hear speech I’m good. I also replaced the plastic buds with foam ones for better noise canceling and comfort. I give the headphones a 3, they’re average but inexpensive, the company is 4.5 to a 5. A little slow to respond, but no hassle. I think once my next pair gives up I’ll probably look for something wireless.  For intermittent use, like for working out or something these would be great.",B01G8JO5F2
"Haven't been able to get a great fit for an earbud yet, but will try more. Connects easily via to phone. Overall happy with them as they are comfortable to wear.",B01G8JO5F2
"These were good the first couple months. I love the way they fit, they aren’t uncomfortable or fall off like other headphones I’ve tried. But now they die almost instantly. I will have them fully charged and less than 30 minutes later they show that the battery is half way or more gone. Due to this they’ve become pretty much useless as I can barely go anywhere without having to be strategic about when I use them.",B01G8JO5F2
For personal use,B01G8JO5F2
Great for the price!,B01G8JO5F2
Cant beat the sound and quality for the price..Will buy gain!,B01G8JO5F2
"I have small ears, so am still working out the fit.  Sound quality is beautiful with music.  Will update if necessary",B01G8JO5F2
"They lasted only 2 weeks worth of workouts and died.  They don't turn on or charge.  Complete garbage.  Spend a little more for something better.  When they did work, they were great.  Don't expect anything amazing on longevity.  Note: I do sweat a lot when working out if that is what killed them.",B01G8JO5F2
"Not a 5 star review, the charger that came with the earbuds  doesn’t even fit the actual earbuds very disappointing.",B01G8JO5F2
"I rarely give something a 1 rating.  Basically they simply do not work.  These connect, I see then in the Bluetooth settings as active.  But no sound.  I've tried multiple apps.  I just threw then away.",B01G8JO5F2
"I loved this product BUT it has stopped working. I received it March 1, 2020, and it failed, quit,  completely kaput May 31, 2020. It no longer syncs with my iPhone. And yes, I've rebooted, etc...<br /><br />I’ve been dithering about trying with another pair because they fit my ears so well, but I don’t want to buy a new pair every 3 or 4 months.",B01G8JO5F2
Still trying to find the proper fit but overall not a bad value,B01G8JO5F2
I got my headphones about a week ago. The battery life amazed me. I worked about 5 hours outside with them on. They were a big blessing and when I checked the battery it said 80% Wow!,B01G8JO5F2
The sound quality was really poor. I was shocked!!,B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these wireless headphones a couple of months ago and I have been regretting it. Let me start by saying that I only use these once every week or so maybe every like 5 days, so I've only worn them less that 15 times total at this point.<br /><br />They are a total pain in the neck! I go for runs with them and one of the ear buds is ALWAYS FALLING OUT, even with the things that curl around your ears which SHOULD HELP keep them in, but barely do. Because I have had them for over a month now I don't have an option in my order history to return these for a refund.  (Keep in mind that when I had gotten to the 1 month mark I wore them maybe 5 times so at that point I didn't think it was that bad)<br /><br />The only nice thing I have to say about these is that the sound is good... But so what, I have 2 year old wired headphones that have great sound and they were less than $10. These are not worth $35 just for Bluetooth and good sound.  Unless your dieing for wireless headphones that are cheap, I would either get better ones that will be more expensive or stick with wired ones that are just as good for half the price.",B01G8JO5F2
I like the clear  and volume of the sound. I support all the reviews. I am a rock & roll guy and you will love them.,B01G8JO5F2
Awesome ear bugs for running!,B01G8JO5F2
"These headphones have never failed me in a couple of years of use.  You won’t get the kind of sound you’d like if you’re listening to music, but to listen to podcasts or any kind of dialogue they work like a charm.  The battery life is also impressive, which is in stark contrast to lots of low battery life headphones on the market.",B01G8JO5F2
"Best feature - Adjustable shape ear loops. The little loops that hook around your ears are adjustable rubber, so you can bend/mold them to your ear/head. Some headphones have stiff loops that point inward and dig into my head a little bit, giving me a headache after a few hours. Not these. Soft rubber loops perfect for any head shape or size.<br /><br />Decent quality sound, battery lasts a long time. Wear them for 8+ hours at work, then the gym afterwards. I charge in my car to/from work, no problems with battery dying on me yet. Takes an hour or 2 to charge to 100%, but I've found that's pretty standard time for these things.<br /><br />They're not noise reducing, but what earbud is? Overall great purchase, will buy again if these ever crap out on me.",B01G8JO5F2
Love these!,B01G8JO5F2
"excellent product I use one my self and bought one for my son.  Good battery life, fits well, easy to use",B01G8JO5F2
Good sound quality,B01G8JO5F2
These lasted about 8 months then said “powering off” and wouldn’t charge again. They’re done. 20 bucks is cheap so you get what you pay for.,B01G8JO5F2
"I've had these headphones for over a year now and I think for under $20 they're fantastic. They charge quickly and provide hours of listening. The sound quality is excellent and has nice, deep base tones. These are also comfortable in the ear. Would recommend and would buy again.",B01G8JO5F2
I use these every day in my job in construction they get wet they get full of dust and most of the day in direct sunlight and they don't quit they work fine.<br /><br />My only complaint is phone call quality specially if is on 50% or less of batery I will fine myself speaking very loud because the person on the other side tells me they hear me at a very low volume.,B01G8JO5F2
it's not very comfortable and always came out...like it was too heavy.,B01G8JO5F2
"The reason I purchased these was to use them for swimming.  However, if any of the headphone is submerged in water the sound stops in the earphone.",B01G8JO5F2
Have these for a year and half and still works and I use it a lot for running. Used to have a Dre beat and I had to call apple to replace it for me almost 5 times. This one blow dre beats out of the water. The price is already a must buy you can't really lose. Tried airpods as well they keep falling off when I run. These ear clip headphones are best for running.,B01G8JO5F2
I love these headphones because they are water proof.  My last pair onlylasted a year and a half!,B01G8JO5F2
"For the price, these headphones often a decent sound. The mic picks up too much surrounding noise to the point that the person on the other end cannot hear my voice very well. The ear clips are too big for my ears and aren't adjustable, so with movement, they eventually fall off my ears.",B01G8JO5F2
Bluetooth randomly but not consistently drops out but overall great quality for price,B01G8JO5F2
This product is worth every penny. I will continue to buy this.  I use this about 12 hours a day for the past 2 years and I have no complaints.,B01G8JO5F2
Decent headphones for the price. Long battery life so far.,B01G8JO5F2
"These headphones are great ! the sound is clear and the battery life is great too, I only have to charge it once -twice a week!",B01G8JO5F2
Excelente estoy feliz,B01G8JO5F2
"I’ve only just set them up. But so far, so good.",B01G8JO5F2
still adjusting to in-ear headphones and thus can't speak to their comfort.  They were easy to pair and have a good bluetooth range.,B01G8JO5F2
Sounds is great and they don’t fall out or come loose like others.,B01G8JO5F2
Had it for a month now and it’s working great!,B01G8JO5F2
Used this mess for awhile loved the company as well had to warranty them out once.,B01G8JO5F2
Good product for the price!,B01G8JO5F2
work good and good battery life.,B01G8JO5F2
This is my second pair of these Bluetooth earbuds… And for some reason these are not fitting as nicely into my ears than the last set I bought two years ago. Otherwise they are still of the same quality and sound.,B01G8JO5F2
"I am pleased with these headphones. I will tell you the first set I received I sent back since they would not charge. HOWEVER, the tech support was great, handled the issue right away and I received the second set the next day. I used these with my computer and with my phone.The charge lasted longer than a previous set of headphones I had (from a different manufacturer). and the pairing was simple. Glad I took the chance on a second set.",B01G8JO5F2
"My previous pair of these finally gave out after years of service.  Unfortunately, whatever the current version is pales in comparison.<br /><br />For one thing, the voice (on/off sound, etc) is unbelievably loud.  My advice is to not have these in your ears when you turn them on and off.  This voice is equally as loud even when the Bluetooth sound is all the way down.<br /><br />Further, I think they’re limiting the volume much more than they used to.  These new ones aren’t as loud as the others.  Additionally, the bass is extremely overbearing and makes the sound quality even worse.<br /><br />Long story short, I would avoid these until they address these issues. There are other wireless earbuds in the same price range that don’t have these issues",B01G8JO5F2
I have bought this product numerous times over the course of two years. The product usually lasted 6 months until it fell apart but I tolerated it because the sound was so good for the price. Unfortunately that is no longer true. The newer earbuds have no bass compared to the older ones. I still have an older one (slightly falling apart but still functioning) went ahead and bought a new pair. And immediately I could tell a big difference in sound quality. I thought it was a fluke and bought another one. Nope the bass just sucks now the music sounds hollow without it. Definitely returning and no longer repurchasing.,B01G8JO5F2
"I use the for working out and stay on even while I do hand stands, skip rope, kicks, and running and muffles out background noise.",B01G8JO5F2
This is my second pair of these headphones and the Bluetooth sound quality is terrible. The first pair that I've had for about a year before I broke the wire was great but this pair is just not good,B01G8JO5F2
Good while they lasted. Had them for about a year before the charge would not hold. Now they don’t work at all. Disappointing to have to replace them after a year of use. I’d recommend them to someone who need some they wouldn’t mind losing. Other than that I’d go with a higher quality option.,B01G8JO5F2
the ear wrao is not rubbery it like wire you bent,B01G8JO5F2
"seems to break frequently, customer service will replace within 1 year",B01G8JO5F2
Love these headphones!,B01G8JO5F2
It had a great sound quality and great noise cancellation. There was little to no noise bleed when at full volume. They were great until they stopped working out of the blue. Bought something similar to these before and the same thing happened. Looks like earbuds like these have a life span of around 6 months.,B01G8JO5F2
"Headphones stopped connecting after a few months. After ~5 min on the phone with customer service, they were able to send a replacement.",B01G8JO5F2
This is my second pair of Senso headphones.  I love them but they seem only to last 1.5 years.  I tend to replace the a little after a year.  My first pair stopped working and my second pair lasted a little over a year and same thing won’t turn on anymore otherwise great quality if they can only last longer that 2 years,B01G8JO5F2
Perfect combination of  sound quality and  battery life.<br />also stick nicely to ear during excises.,B01G8JO5F2
Sound is muffled and is terrible,B01G8JO5F2
very good,B01G8JO5F2
"I received these as a Christmas gift, the sound quality is poor and the connection keeps breaking up even with the phone within 12 inches of the headset. The materials seemed good quality, but definitely would not recommend.",B01G8JO5F2
Great headphones!,B01G8JO5F2
Buttons are easy to use. Holds a charge well.,B01G8JO5F2
"I run daily and rely on wireless head phones.  They were very comfortable, battery life was great and I really liked them.  One day while running they just stopped working.  I thought maybe the battery just died, but it was weird since usually a voice comes up telling you ahead of time that ""battery low.""  After that event I went to recharge them in the car and the light did not come on showing that it was charging.  I tried to charge at home on another adaptor but still no luck.  My biggest mistake was setting them aside and not returning them immediately.  Time passed and by the time I got around to sending them back, the time had passed so I was out a few bucks.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I did try ordering another pair from another company and they were basically the same product with a different logo on them.  I'd say keep away from any of the brands out there that look like this product because that 2nd pair I got did the same thing but only after 1 week.  I was quick to return those though, so I'll get my money back.",B01G8JO5F2
Too large,B01G8JO5F2
"Battery life is great! Lasts almost all day at work! Sound is pretty good, although the stock AMG phones that came with my phone blow these out of the water, but those are corded. Noise cancellation is great, especially when I'm driving and don't want to hear the traffic noise. I have a set of bluetooth full wireless headphones that are good but dont have the battery power these do.",B01G8JO5F2
Love them,B01G8JO5F2
"I bought 2 of these as gifts. Senso earbuds have great sound and comfort. The recipients of the gifts were very impressed with the quality of these sport type, wireless, bluetooth earbuds. Thanks!",B01G8JO5F2
I have these hooked up to the Bluetooth on the phone I keep on the motorcycle. They give me 12 hours of music and it's loud enough I can hear over the wind noise. Easy to use simple and basic. Perfect!,B01G8JO5F2
Set up was very well explained to pair with cell. A hugh plus for a 70+year old  person. Bought these after frustrated attempt to set up another brand.with no success. Sound quality is good even in a  jym.,B01G8JO5F2
"These headphones sounded really good for the few weeks that they actually worked. Unfortunately, both the pairs I had stopped wanting to recharge after 3 -4 weeks of use. Do yourself a favor, and choose something else.",B01G8JO5F2
Fit great. Sound great. Work great. Look great.,B01G8JO5F2
One of my friends thought these were Beats by Dre so that let’s me know that the styling of the headsets are on point. The quality of the sound is way better than expected and the battery life is better than average. I would definitely recommend this product,B01G8JO5F2
I like it.,B01G8JO5F2
I forget to charge these things for weeks and they still work. My ears are shaped weird because they like to fall out sometimes.. but I think that's just me. Great sound quality though.,B01G8JO5F2
My second pair. First pair lasted 4+ years of wearing them almost daily. Very fair price. Excellent quality. Great sound.  Can hear over my lawnmowers. Fits very comfortably in the ear. Excellent product.,B01G8JO5F2
After one month it did not take a charge,B01G8JO5F2
Best Bluetooth ever,B01G8JO5F2
Been thru the washing machine and dryer. Twice. Still work exactly the same. Great!,B01G8JO5F2
"Ease of use, good sound quality. Inexpensive!",B01G8JO5F2
"The power button is flimsy.  I pushed it through easily. The plastic is easily separated to line up the button, but that’s annoying.",B01G8JO5F2
"A very great set of earbuds. Great sound quality, battery life is AMAZING, but there’s some connectivity problems. It’s often hard to get it working and takes some fiddling around with, but it’s definitely worth the low price",B01G8JO5F2
"I've used my pair for other a year now, taking them with me to work every day and using the nearly constantly and consiently, so I can attest that they're quite solid and resilient to normal abuse. They're convenient to use, easy to pause music at a moment's notice and such, and I find that the adjustable ear piece works well for hooking it onto your shirt if you're not comfortable with it sitting on your neck Sadly mine have to be retired after a little over a year. Due to a power issue on the inside (I opened it up and couldn't figure it out so i'm buying a new pair for my gf and I) it is shutting off on its own, but it did last beyond its warranty and for such a low price! I'd recommend this to anyone who doesn't want those singular bluetooth earbuds, and I'll be ordering a new pair pair after I hit the Submit button.",B01G8JO5F2
Works great,B01G8JO5F2
I use them on my daily walk that's 30 to 45 mins long and listen to music.  They are much more comfortable than my old pair which was a different brand...,B01G8JO5F2
They are great,B01G8JO5F2
Simple yet effective,B01G8JO5F2
Awesome quality for the price. Even better than the price. I had to order two pairs!,B01G8JO5F2
Good!,B01G8JO5F2
"I wear my headphones on my daily walks to and from work, and they are great for blocking out the noises of traffic while still providing a great sound.",B01G8JO5F2
I loved everything about this product... the fit.. I just bought my third one and I’m done with this product!!! It’s not waterproof .....after running in a mere sprinkle it quit charging.. same thing happened before but I thought I’d give it another chance!!,B01G8JO5F2
"I was looking for something of good quality but also cheap, around 50-75$ range. I came across these from filtering top rated and I trusted my fellow amazon shoppers and I must say I was not disappointed. Great sound and super comfortable. Wear these to run and lift and I must say if you are reading this to see if they are worth it Im gonna say it right now, Get them!",B01G8JO5F2
I purchased this for my daughter and she loved them so much she purchased a pair for me. My issue is they will not charge for me any longer. I wish they charged still because I really enjoyed them.,B01G8JO5F2
Works as well as the expensive beats ones I had,B01G8JO5F2
Perfect,B01G8JO5F2
sound and work really well,B01G8JO5F2
"We ordered it after seeing so many reviews. First of all this should be used best as a toy. Cheap quality, sound is bad and plastic that goes over the ear is so flimsy that it does not stay on ear while running which is the only purpose you would buy this.<br />Next part, their customer service is horrible. Product that I received was not sealed and when I opened it earbuds seems to be used. Secondly, they advertised lot of bonus accessories like mobile phone wallet and car vent holder that comes with it but I received none of those. When I reached out to their customer service, they asked me to just return the product to Amazon. Easy right. That’s what they business model is. I feel most of the reviews are fake as lot of these companies lure positive reviews by offering customers some freebies. Beware and buy it only if you are ok with using it as occasionally for emergency use only.",B01G8JO5F2
The sound quality is just as good as my beats headphones. They stayed in perfectly for a whole marathon. Battery life is ~4 hours per charge. You don’t get a low battery warning until they’re on their last leg so I’d just recommend charging them every few days if you use them regularly. Would recommend.,B01G8JO5F2
So worth the money! Could not have made a better choice.,B01G8JO5F2
I have owned these for over 2 years now. They have great sound quality and battery life at a fraction of the cost of some of the other name brands of the same type. give these a try and you wont regret it.,B01G8JO5F2
They kept shutting off the first time I used them. I made sure the battery was fully charged and they still wouldn’t work properly.,B01G8JO5F2
Amazing sound! But...<br />The mic is TERRIBLE!! You can't be heard.<br />Sending these back,B01G8JO5F2
This is my 3rd pair of Senso BT headphones. I broke the 2nd pair prematurely as I crushed it when I closed a car door on it. The first pair lasted a very long time too. The sound quality if pretty good. This headphone does not have noise cancelling but does a good job isolating the outside sounds.<br />I use it primarily while I run.,B01G8JO5F2
👏🏻,B01G8JO5F2
They don’t fit your ears good,B01G8JO5F2
Christmas gift so ask after Christmas,B01G8JO5F2
I jog with my headphones 2 miles a day five times a week. If they are not charged then the connection for Pandora is spotty. I have multiple ear piercings and the headphones are sometimes difficult to adjust to my ears. It takes a little bit of effort but just like everybody else says once you get it to the perfect spot the headphones don't fall out. I really appreciate the option to skip or repeat songs with the volume buttons and how easy it is to disconnect and reconnect WHILE jogging without having to stop and look at my phone.,B01G8JO5F2
These headphones work very well.  I use them when I ride my bike to work.  They can be a bit challenging only having one ear in.  The Bluetooth connection is nice and it provides ample sound for the ride.,B01G8JO5F2
Like. Very good sound. Good for the price,B01G8JO5F2
Love these!! I am using them at work in an office space with multiple coworkers and these are perfect.,B01G8JO5F2
Work great,B01G8JO5F2
Amazing sound! But...<br />The mic is TERRIBLE!! You can't be heard.<br />Sending these back,B01G8JO5F2
Amazing,B01G8JO5F2
It worked well for couple of months. Then the sound quality changed and it’s hard to listen to.,B01G8JO5F2
I received this product And it didn’t work!!!!!<br />I was recommended this product by my boyfriend that has used the same earbuds for over a year and I’m extremely disappointed. For the amount of money I spent this is serious no go!,B01G8JO5F2
These have been great headphones for me.  The sound is better than I'd have expected at this price and the battery life is also very good.  I've had them for over a year and still use them 1-4 times a week.  Am so happy to not be tangled in wires anymore!  :),B01G8JO5F2
They were amazing! I used them as my primary headphones. It really shows you don't need to spend $100 for quality.,B01G8JO5F2
Very reasonable price and works great once you figure them out. I had no issues with my phone coming unsynced when in another room even like some reviewers reported. Maybe this has more to do with your signal strength but not sure. I was able to put my phone down on the counter and move around rooms no problem. It only got weaker when I went outside. I love using them when working on projects so I don't get head phone cords wrapped around door handles or stuck in the dishwasher:),B01G8JO5F2
Past the return date and already broke.  Just randomly won't turn on.  Bad.,B01G8JO5F2
"I've been using these for about 6 months now and they _had_ been absolutely wonderful (good audio balance, no rattling buttons while exercising, moisture-wicking, effective ear wraparound) until the battery suddenly died last week.<br /><br />It previously would hold charge for about two or three weeks of daily half-hour use. Out of nowhere, the battery dropped to only lasting a day, and drains to 0 in that short a time whether I use them or not.",B01G8JO5F2
I have a pair and left them on the plane. So these are my replacement pair. I do love him and that’s why I bought the exact same pair.,B01G8JO5F2
"I have had the worst experience with this product. Went from being a good cheap Earphones , to only one side work. Then to  only turning on not connecting to not charging. Negative 5 stars....",B01G8JO5F2
These headphones will not hold a charge anymore. They worked great when they were alive but they're dead now. I've tried different cords for charging and nothing.,B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these for my wife, who wanted to listen to music while she works out at a nearby pool. We were both pleased at how quickly and easily the headphones paired with her iPhone 6, and were very impressed at the quality of sound as well as the bluetooth reach it was capable of. She hasn't had the chance yet to try them at the pool, which is why I'm not able to give it more stars right now. But we both agreed it was a good buy! You've got a good product, Mr. Backstrom.",B01G8JO5F2
Connects to Bluetooth well. Comfortable. Easy to use.,B01G8JO5F2
Easy Sync and loud and clear Sound..,B01G8JO5F2
"I've tried all the different buds it came with, but they still fall out of my ears every 60 seconds or so, so then they just kinda hang by the ear things. Sound quality is fine, but it's super annoying they keep falling out.",B01G8JO5F2
Great sounds lightweight,B01G8JO5F2
Good product,B01G8JO5F2
They are very good headphones just what I was looking for,B01G8JO5F2
"The head phones work very well for the most part. The ear hooks are okay, kind of finiky to fit around your ear at first. Some connectivity problems depending on the device that I am paired with. Overall I like them. sound quality is good and battery life is great. Charges quick too.",B01G8JO5F2
"The materials felt good and the battery life was better than expected.  The sound quality was ok.  The volume jumped in large increments.  At low volume you could hear a low feedback noise.  They stopped working just outside the warranty period which was disappointing.  I know these are not expensive, but I don't like products that break just outside the warranty period.  Going to try another cheap Amazon exclusive brand before I fork up more money from a more reputable manufacturer.",B01G8JO5F2
Super uncomfortable.,B01G8JO5F2
These earbuds are comfortable and easy to use. They are light and fit well.,B01G8JO5F2
"Good sound, great customer service",B01G8JO5F2
Purchased headphones 18 months ago. Used them about a half dozen times throughout that period. Started to use them again and they initially charged without an issue. Once I tried to recharge them again they would not charge. They are out of warranty and I am out of luck. Would never buy again.,B01G8JO5F2
"Sound quality is not good att all ,they get distorted real easy.",B01G8JO5F2
They stop working on me within two months,B01G8JO5F2
nice headphones fit perfect they don't fall out on my bike rides and use with my Fitbit,B01G8JO5F2
Everything (Sound quality and battery) was great for the first few days. Then the battery just stopped charging. Couldn't even do a factory reset. Dead and waste now. I don't recommend this product.,B01G8JO5F2
Great sound very comfortable,B01G8JO5F2
I am so disappointed.  I have been using these for less than 2 weeks and the audio goes in and out.  I have to power down and power up a few times for them to start working again. I am definitely returning them.,B01G8JO5F2
"Husband likes them, they work well and are comfortable",B01G8JO5F2
I bought these headphones four years ago when I was training to run a marathon (they did perfectly for it) and I just found them in an old box after not using them since and they are still fully charged!! I’ve never had any kind of electronic device hold a charge without use for that long and will be using these regularly now. I was looking for them because my AirPods Pro keep falling out of my ears and I never had that problem with these headphones. And for only $24! The sound quality obviously isn’t beats but these are workout headphones and it gets the bass through just fine. LOVE THEM SO MUCH,B01G8JO5F2
Works ok but needs frequent charging. Not like a blade razor shave,B01G8JO5F2
"Best headphones for the price. Easy to use, great connectivity and quality of sound",B01G8JO5F2
Broken<br /><br />I  didn't get to use it I took it from the package to charge<br />And found out it was Broken,B01G8JO5F2
Nice product. Lots of features. Described exactly how product is. A+++. Would buy from again. L,B01G8JO5F2
Great product and customer service,B01G8JO5F2
They don't hold to your ears! They are nothing like the original model.,B01G8JO5F2
For the price these are outstanding. They sound pretty darn good.  The only issue is fit. If you have smaller ears these take some fidgeting to get secured.,B01G8JO5F2
"I have at least 4 pairs of these laying around the house and the car.  They're cheap and decent sound quality.  I can loose these and not freak out, and I can keep extras in the gym bag or whatever.",B01G8JO5F2
"Got these for my husband for work and he says they really block out the ""work"" noise.  Took awhile for him to get used to how they hook on the ear, but he really likes them.",B01G8JO5F2
"I’ve been wearing these for about a month while running and working out. Love them so far, especially for the price!<br /><br />Pros: Stays in your ears even during intense workouts. The sound is pretty good and loud even at a low sound level. Pairs great with Apple Watch! Battery lasts a while.<br /><br />Cons: It REALLY cancels out noise which is a plus but also a minus because you can’t hear your surroundings. I can’t figure out the battery percentage so I never know if they need to be charged or not.",B01G8JO5F2
"Within less than a month these will no longer charge. I only used these about 4 times. I have tried to troubleshoot the chargers,which work for my other headsets so it's not them.",B01G8JO5F2
"My pair worked great for a almost 3 months then started having problems with it holding a charge. Got an immediate response from customer service with instructions to try to remedy the problem. It worked but I continued to have some charging issues. When I contacted customer service again, they quickly responded and sent me out a replacement pair of earbuds. I'm pretty sure the charging issues is uncommon and even so, I would strongly recommend these to anyone!",B01G8JO5F2
Headphones are good quality for a cheap price.,B01G8JO5F2
Obviously bought these one year ago and was really excited about the price vs performance ratio.  Low price and for that low price really nice sound with good base.  The problem?  They completely stopped functioning four days after the warranty expired.  These guys have got built-in functional obsolescence down to a science.,B01G8JO5F2
Very bassy. It’s distracting for listening not during activities. The button on the side turns them on and when double tapped it dials the last number. That’s a little annoying. Call quality is great though. They stay in place quite well. The wire is a little sticky and can start to pull a little. The over ear arms are bendable and really help dial in the fit.,B01G8JO5F2
My rating would be higher but for two factors: 1. I find it hard to keep them in my ears; 2. The battery life is less than I expected but I’m not well educated in this area.,B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these Senso Bluetooth Headphones in January 14, 2020.  This month (August, 2020) they quit working.  At first the functionality to adjust the volume and song selection quit working and then a few days later they completely died, and would not charge or power up.  I called the service phone line (888-683-4941) and they attempted to assist me in resetting the headphones, to no avail.  They recognized that they needed replaced and told me they were referring the problem to the warranty department and I would be contacted in 3 days. . .NOT.  I have called the service line 3 times and sent 3 separate e-mails to the warranty department (2 thru there web interface and 1 directly from my e-mail account) and HAD ZERO RESPONSE TO MY REQUEST FOR REPLACEMENT!<br /><br />If you want a headphone with a warranty DO NOT BUY THESE HEADPHONES!",B01G8JO5F2
"I have owned several different pairs of bluetooth sports headphones but nothing compares to the value, quality, and generosity of these so far.  The price is a good balance - all of the others I bought were way too expensive.  Yet, the quality was the surprise - I thought for the good price I would get poor quality but the care put into the construction of these, the packaging surrounding them, the audio output (including noise cancellation), the carrying case to protect them, the way they seem to be durably made to last a long time, and the extras included, simply blew me away - it was a delight.  Finally, the generosity of the company - providing extras (the car mount, the card holder, and even this arm band) were a total surprise - something I haven't seen a company do in years - I wanted to express how appreciative I am and simply cannot express the surprise and joy it brought me.  Please don't change anything - keep a good balance (so that you earn well but customers save enough), keep working on quality, and don't let accounting folks tell you that delighting people (with extras) will lead to decreased bottom line - it will cause your product to get recommended to others and will continue to be a bestseller, well reviewed, etc.<br /><br />(NOTE: I've owned these five days now - will update this review if any negative experiences or more positive ones arise over time)<br /><br />Update 6/8/2019 - It has been a few more days and I've exhausted the battery first time  - charging now.  The first chink in the armor is found but it is really a design choice.  I got a warning 'low battery' during exercise and was hoping it was like an hour away warning and would happen every ten minutes or so.  The warning was about once every two minutes.  And I was about six to eight minutes away it seems.  Then device shutdown leaving me a little bit miffed.<br />I doubt firmware updates can happen on these - so want to make a suggestion for future batches of this product: Please have it announce battery level much earlier and less often (hour away ideally, every ten minutes).  Add a 'battery about to run out' (or 'battery critical') at the six-eight minutes mark.  And ideally, if possible, have it announce battery level (yes, 'high', 'medium', 'low', 'critically low') at initial power up.  If you make a set with these features, please let us know, I'll gladly buy another set (and will use these as my backup then).<br />Not enough to take any stars away - I'll work around it but would rather not run out of battery via surprise again in the future.",B01G8JO5F2
I am really enjoying these headphones. The sound quality is great. Nice and clear even on low volume. They fit comfortably. They have a good distance to them. So I can leave my phone on the kitchen counter and walk just about anywhere in my house and not lose the connection. Battery life is good so no problems there. Overall I think they are a really good headphones and would recommend them to family and friends.,B01G8JO5F2
"Good product, was a gift for my brother and he loves it.",B01G8JO5F2
Great sound and ease of use,B01G8JO5F2
Super value. Very comfortable. On a full charge these last a long time!,B01G8JO5F2
"I purchased these originally in 2017, and got four good years of heavy usage out of them. I would rate that model at least 4 stars.  When they stopped charging a few months ago, I purchased the same product. I noticed right away they were cheaper, lighter, and much lower quality.  The on/off button was a bit tricky and never worked well, and is now locked inside the unit, and will not work.  I've used these fairly lightly in the last few months, so it's really disappointing to note such a drastic change in the quality of this product.  I've ordered a different brand to replace these.",B01G8JO5F2
"Cyclist review:<br />PROS: These headphones are loud, they seem highly resistant to sweat, and Bluetooth works great. They come with interchangable ear pieces (for small/med/large ear canals). They hold a charge for me for the entire week (~8hr runtime, est.)<br /><br />One Major CON: They really catch the wind and are pretty much useless if you don’t have a skull cap or some sort of fabric covering them. I’m not sure I’ll be able to use them at all in the summer. If you aren’t biking with them, don’t worry about this, they’ll be great.",B01G8JO5F2
"Save your money. Tried to make them work, kept losing the Bluetooth signal during my runs.",B01G8JO5F2
Great,B01G8JO5F2
"I would not buy this product again.  About 2 weeks ago, they stopped working after using for about 6 months.  Product warranty states 1 year.  I contacted them and got a canned response to troubleshoot.  I did what was asked and have attempted to reach out to them with this response and they have yet to respond back to me.",B01G8JO5F2
Great,B01G8JO5F2
"I have used them for 1.5 years almost every day (during work, working out, etc) and they are amazing. Long lasting battery and good sound.",B01G8JO5F2
It’s really easy to use,B01G8JO5F2
"Budget-friendly Bluetooth earbuds, good for working out, but... out of the box the ear hooks were way too big. I think I have average-size ears.  After two or three uses at the gym the right ear hook got loose, breaking the little tension there was to keep the earbud fastened to my ear. I bought these December 2019. Threw them away February 2020. They might have been a defective pair.",B01G8JO5F2
Muy buen producto  aonque puede mejorar,B01G8JO5F2
The BEATs died again. Bought these on Amazon and the rest is history. My wife like them so much bought another pair for me.Now to see if they will withstand the test of time. If they last 3 months that is cost effective for us.,B01G8JO5F2
Great sound. Fits great on my ears.,B01G8JO5F2
"I’ve been working out and researching great gym headphones for over 20 years and every now and then you come across a real deal. These headphones are pound for pound the best overall sounding headphones I’ve owned in the past five years . They are as loud as you like it, clear, good battery life and they stay in my ear where they belong",B01G8JO5F2
These look a lot like the rock sport brand.. but they aren’t.. they came in and did not even turn on I pressed and held the power button for like 10 seconds and nothing.. I charged em and nothing.. I tried turning them on while charging and nothing!!!!! -.- bro don’t even waste your money I’m never buying this again.. thanks for sending something that doesn’t even work smh.,B01G8JO5F2
"I really enjoy these headphones.<br />I workout with them 5 times a week and sit in a sauna for a minimum of 15 minutes as well,,, they are still holding strong!<br />Im recommending this to my fellow athletes and Gym Breasts.",B01G8JO5F2
"Don’t know , was a gift",B01G8JO5F2
Not even sure how it happened but I think I've only used it 2 or 3x since purchasing in July. This doesn't seem repairable and I've lost the return window. There's that. Good luck to others.,B01G8JO5F2
"The title says it all. Way too much stuttering. The only way you can achieve an uninterrupted connection is by placing my iPhone right next to my head. I've trouble shooted in various ways (ie. resetting, recharging, making certain that I'm streaming on ""low"" quality since it isn't ultimately a data issue), but to no avail. I guess you do get what you pay for.",B01G8JO5F2
The headphone are perfect !,B01G8JO5F2
"Senso is an AMAZING company.  They make an incredible product, go over and beyond with customer service support, and throw in extra gifts.  And the price of this wonderful product is so reasonable!  Thank you so much, Senso!",B01G8JO5F2
"Don't buy under the assumption that these are actually waterproof. They had decent sound quality and were pretty durable for at least basic gym wear, but they don't connect consistently to iPhones and my pair broke after initial exposure to water.",B01G8JO5F2
"I didn't expect much for the price, but these are not good headphones. The bass is cranked up beyond what is reasonable. The fit leaves a lot to be desired as I can't even get the buds all the way seated in my ears, which makes the noise cancellation worthless. The power/play button is situated in such a way that when you are trying to insert the earbud you either have to press it or awkwardly grip it as to not push the button. I would not buy these again.",B01G8JO5F2
"Love these.  Wish they were magnetic so they aren't falling off my neck. Music, phone calls and YouTube ready.",B01G8JO5F2
"Pairing and sound works great. Very reliable, use almost daily for work for over a year.",B01G8JO5F2
"I've used these several times since purchasing in 2018, but I used them yesterday (9/04/19) under a full charge while doing yard work. They lasted greater than 2hr45min, stayed in my ear and maintained a great full range sound. I was able to push-mow, weedeat and use my leaf blower and still hear what I was listening to with clarity.",B01G8JO5F2
These are absolutely the best Bluetooth earbuds available. Easy to pair and great sound. Love the foam ear pieces that came in the set. Don’t pay $100 for a set of the other brands when these are better and cost 1/4 the price. I’am going to order another set,B01G8JO5F2
The commands hurts my ears.,B01G8JO5F2
"I liked it, arrived as per mentioned date. Thanks",B01G8JO5F2
I lost the last pair I had so I purchased another. These are the best they they were great and stay on when working out. The price is great I have no complaints and I recommend this product to everyone,B01G8JO5F2
"I had my first pair for 3 years, they spoiled me from anything else. These are the only headphones I'll use now. Super comfortable and lightweight. They come with a ton of different sized ear buds so you can find that perfect fit.",B01G8JO5F2
I have no real complaints except if i purchase another set I would look for the ear buds that have the controls away from the ears to cut down on the bulky look. I do like the wireless part of this technology over the wired earbuds I was using.,B01G8JO5F2
I got an appreciation email after ordering and I didn't have any issues with the order so I never had to contact any further. This is my second pair of these headphones that I got for a friend. They have amazing sound and battery life and the first pair I have is going strong after over a year of use!,B01G8JO5F2
Excelentes .. buena conexión  sonido y nitidez,B01G8JO5F2
"These headphones used to be great when I bought a previous pair and those died on me after 3 years however, the most recent pair was awful. How in 3 years the product went from me giving them a 5 star rating to a 2 is sad and the reason is the battery life is awful, the headphones constantly switch my songs and couldnt handle me sweating on a 10 mile run. Sure they’re cheap but you will be better off getting something that works.",B01G8JO5F2
Really like bvb it but nise cancellation not great.,B01G8JO5F2
I used to love these ~ this is my 2nd pair that just quit working. They will not turn on. 30 bucks isnt that cheap tl have this happen TWICE!  I'm super annoyed!,B01G8JO5F2
Overall ok,B01G8JO5F2
"02-23-2021: Great product.  Have had them for 3 years, but now they will not stay connected, no matter how many troubleshooting processes I have done.  Debating whether to call Senso about this.",B01G8JO5F2
Good product for the price.,B01G8JO5F2
"I weight lift and do HIIT with a lot of jumping, burpees, sprinting, ex and they never fall off or bother me. Love them!",B01G8JO5F2
"I understood that these were nothing compatible to more expensive noise cancelling headphones but, as expected they were what I wanted for the price. I am very happy and will buy them for my kids.",B01G8JO5F2
Nice,B01G8JO5F2
I’ve bought these headphones twice now and both died to my sweat within a year. Product should read sweat RESISTENT not proof.,B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these headphones 2 years ago and they were great.  I accidentally broke them and had to buy a new pair.  Unfortunately the pair, even though they work just as good, the ear piece that goes around the ear to hold on is uncomfortable.  I bend them but they still fall off and they are just simply uncomfortable.",B01G8JO5F2
Great Product,B01G8JO5F2
Ordered 2 sets so far. They both eventually have the same issue- the soldier lets go on the side without controls. They were recommended by a friend and used daily.,B01G8JO5F2
I love these ear buds this is my second pair. I only brought the second pair so I could switch them out. I sound is clear music is outstanding and audio books are crisp.,B01G8JO5F2
"I have had this item for a week and use it over four hours each day. The sound quality is acceptable but not very great. Has a tendency to “buzz” when the volume is turned past 1/4. I have had zero noise cancellation with this item. If that is what you are getting them for, don’t. The battery life is quite good though.",B01G8JO5F2
Excellent product. Great price.,B01G8JO5F2
"After two months of owning them, I keep having problems.  These don't connect well with my device.  Even within just a few feet (from my pants pocket to my head), the connection doesn't work well.  I would return but it's too late for that.",B01G8JO5F2
Amazing for the price!<br />Half the price of my Wireless skullcandies and just as good I am stoked only 20 bucks sounds great comes with lots of extras worth the buy!,B01G8JO5F2
I have had these headphones for about three months. The sound is great for the price and I was really happy until yesterday. I was mid conversation using my headphones and the microphone went out. I have tried multiple times but the microphone just stopped working. I can still use them as headphones but have to take them out and grab the phone anytime I have a phone call which is annoying. I hope this is not a common thing but at least the earbuds still work I guess.,B01G8JO5F2
The ear hooks are too soft.  I bought these to wear while bicycle riding.  The motion of riding shakes the earbuds off/out of my ears - no matter how I bend the hooks.,B01G8JO5F2
Seem to work really well. Fit well even on big ears.,B01G8JO5F2
Great product,B01G8JO5F2
It said it had you bass it had none.,B01G8JO5F2
I used to love this brand! This pair doesn’t charge,B01G8JO5F2
"The headphones worked initially, but the build quality is pretty low. As time goes, the outside plastic started to peel off and became sticky, and (maybe months) after that, the headphones stopped working.",B01G8JO5F2
I've worked out with these a few times now and think they're really great! They do a good job of blocking out other sounds and they are flexible so they can fit anyones ear!,B01G8JO5F2
These buds are amazing. Fit is great and quality is awesome.,B01G8JO5F2
These were awesome,B01G8JO5F2
I've contacted Senso multiple times after my headphones stopped working entirely in the left ear piece but have not received any response.  I registered my product on their site and followed the contact directions.  I'm going to switch to a company that follows through on the warranty.,B01G8JO5F2
"When I first got these, I was so excited.  I hated the corded ear buds I've had in the past when at the gym.  These wireless buds worked, sounded fine, but the battery drains WAY too quickly!  After every use, even if only for a half hour, I have to recharge it or the next time I go to use them, the battery will be drained.  Recently, I had charged them up to full, popped them in my purse, and went on a train.  About an hour into my ride, I pulled them out to listen to a podcast.  And they had NO battery life.<br /><br />If the battery would hold a charge longer, if I didn't have to charge them every single time I use them, then I would most certainly have given them a higher rating.  I never had issues with sound cutting out or connectivity.  They worked fine for that and the sound, while not high quality, certainly wasn't terrible.  But the battery issue - that's a deal breaker for me.",B01G8JO5F2
It does good for the prize.,B01G8JO5F2
"Ive had these for 2 years and use them at the gym. I love these so much! They dont fall off when working out, sound quality is amazing, and battery life is very good. I use these 5 days/week for 1 hour more or so each day. Once fully charged, they are good for the whole week.",B01G8JO5F2
I use the headphones when I am jogging in the morning.  Being able to listen to my music without tangling the cord up is fantastic.,B01G8JO5F2
These headphones are a great value for the money I spent. Good sound quality and long battery life. I use these headphones at the gym and they work great.,B01G8JO5F2
"Only 18 mos, with semi monthly, light use and the socket for the charger has broken inward so the can't be charged... Useless to me now... so like 9-12 uses and they are toast....",B01G8JO5F2
I bought this boothtooth headphones to use while driving for work.  I found that I have to have the volume on 10/10 and it is still hard to hear when talking to someone.  Sucks to have to ask a customer what they said 3 times.,B01G8JO5F2
I wanted loud and I got it.  Way better than my expensive beats.  Thank you for the loudness!!,B01G8JO5F2
"I want to like these headphones, they work well when they work but they don't last. 🙁 My first pair stopped charging after 6 months, my second pair has started frequently disconnecting from my phone.",B01G8JO5F2
Uncomfortable and do not adjust well to ears. No noise cancelling ability.,B01G8JO5F2
"Best I've ever owned! For the price, it can't be beat!...<br /><br />When I opened the packaging I felt like an appreciated customer. Very professional job.<br />Thanks, Bill",B01G8JO5F2
"Secure fit, good sound and battery life.",B01G8JO5F2
"It break too fast, but great sound for the price better then some premium headphone",B01G8JO5F2
Freedom from wired ear buds at last!!,B01G8JO5F2
My family and I have been using senso bluetooth headphones for several years now. These are incredible. The battery lasts at least 8 hours. I use mine as earplugs (because they cancel sounds better than standard ear plugs). I had one issue with mine and the company replaced them for free. We have been very happy with the customer service! Great buy!,B01G8JO5F2
Great product for the price.,B01G8JO5F2
Left side had buzzing sound so the set was returned.  Replacement set had the same issue. Super disappointed!!! I've had at least 5 pair over the years and never had an issue before now.,B01G8JO5F2
I am really happy with them. Very easy to use. Thanks,B01G8JO5F2
Liked the Packing and unexpected stuff inside,B01G8JO5F2
It was amazing,B01G8JO5F2
The blue flash every 5 seconds while paired is very irritating,B01G8JO5F2
Vi una reseña y la verdad está muy bien por el precio,B01G8JO5F2
It was a solid product while it lasted. One speaker died (goes in and out) at about a year though.,B01G8JO5F2
"Muy buenos auriculares, buena calidad de sonido, buen tiempo de carga.",B01G8JO5F2
"It is not comfortable to wear..it keeps falling off. I have tried several sizes, it all keeps falling off.",B01G8JO5F2
"I ordered a pair of these several months ago and enjoyed them while they I had them. I used them about an hour a day, 4-5 days a week at the gym. After about 3 months the right side stopped working entirely. I was bummed but figured I would just buy another set because they are so affordable. I got my new pair and used them about 6 or 7 times and the same exact thing happened. This time on the left side. Im guessing from sweat or something because I use the for exercise only but I took very good care of them. Needless to say , moving forward Im going to be buying something thats more durable.",B01G8JO5F2
I really like them,B01G8JO5F2
"I had purchased these headphones for running and gym workouts and for the price you really cannot beat the quality. I lost my first pair, but was so impressed I decided to repurchase the headphones.<br />The second pair were working great for a few months without issue. However, I left without charge for about 2-3 weeks and at which point when trying to use the headphones would not recharge. I plugged the headphones for days hoping they would charge, but no luck. I have used different chargers without success.<br />When replacing these headphones I would go with a different supplier.",B01G8JO5F2
I have purchased several pair of bluetooth headphones over the years and these are the only ones which have survived daily use and lots of sweat contact.,B01G8JO5F2
"I wore the SENSO Bluetooth Headphones for about 2 hours as I walked and ran some errands. When I went to turn them on again later that day after charging, I unhappily discovered that they had broken. Completely unresponsive to the charger or turning them on. I've had several pairs of wireless Bluetooth earbuds/headphones, and I never had an experience like this. Save your money.",B01G8JO5F2
Ok,B01G8JO5F2
"These were a great investment. They worked perfectly for my workouts for 2.5 years, and I sweat a lot. No issues there. After 2.5 years, they’d no longer charge adequately, so I’m upgrading to the newer model. I can’t complain for the low price compared to quality and length of life.",B01G8JO5F2
Price is right with surprisingly great sound.  Planning to recommend to my friends.,B01G8JO5F2
"Definitely worth it for the sound quality and the battery life,why spend more on known brands,when you can get same quality for a cheaper price.",B01G8JO5F2
"Great sound quality for the price and great battery life, but they are very hard to get to stay in your ears and don't block any sound from coming in, so they aren't the best for ""getting in the zone"" so to speak. Also, they don't get very loud.",B01G8JO5F2
The Pros:<br />Well made material. Easy to set up. Sound was decent.<br /><br />The Cons:<br />Had to adjust the hooks on my ears a few time. Cuts in and out when I using Spotify. Not great on windy days. Not great for jogging. Figuring out if it’s on or off is a bit annoying.<br /><br />Unknown;<br />Didn’t have it long enough to determine the battery life.,B01G8JO5F2
"My first pair lasted me 3 years. I loved them. I bought the newest version, they ended up being trash. I just bought a 3rd pair and they broke within a week. Im buying another pair, but after this im gonna consider that first purchase a fluke",B01G8JO5F2
"Very convenient to use.  Wireless is the way to go,",B01G8JO5F2
I love my new headphones,B01G8JO5F2
These are not great. They do not fit well and have poor battery life. They do not stay situated in the eat well and slip out so much they are not worth the trouble of using,B01G8JO5F2
I bought these about 5 years ago because I read a review that said they were better than beats. I’ve never owned beats but these are way better than any other ear buds I’ve had in the past. The noise canceling is AWSOME and the sound is great. AWSOME customer service as well. Can’t go wrong with these.,B01G8JO5F2
They are awesome.,B01G8JO5F2
Connects easily. Simple to use,B01G8JO5F2
This is the third one that I have purchased and the other two worked great but just wore out from use.  However the one I just received never would take a charge no matter what I did.  The over the ear clips also are much looser than the other two.,B01G8JO5F2
"The earphones are exactly as described.  I have had problems with other similar products, quality wasn’t as nice and earplugs weren’t secure.  This is not the case with the Senso earphones.  They stay secure throughout my workout and I couldn’t be happier.",B01G8JO5F2
"I purchased this product back in August, 2017. They've were great for about a month and randomly started having problems maintaining connection with my phone while playing music. It wouldn't disconnect from bluetooth, but I would get consistent skipping and connection ""buffering"" while walking downtown Chicago as well as in the burbs. I ignored this  awesome new feature as I figured out how to stabilize the connection by placing my phone in a different pocket. No biggie, right? 3 more months go by in this manner. A week ago, the left earbud stopped working entirely.<br />I immediately remembered this product had a year long warranty and reached out to the company to see what they could do for me.....Still no response.",B01G8JO5F2
nice case and earbud variety.  sound is excellent!,B01G8JO5F2
Great for working out.,B01G8JO5F2
Excellent sound quality and durability.,B01G8JO5F2
"i ride my bike and work out with these wireless headphones. i sweat a lot. i tried my best to keep these clear of sweat and water, and i don't know if that was the cause of their demise, but it's the only thing i can think of. my first pair would still turn on, but would never pair with anything. my second pair just stopped turning on completely, even though it would charge.<br /><br />these things are cheap, and probably would be good for light use, like if you're just sitting around in bed or something. they're branded as ""sports earphones"" - but on my bike, the wind rips through these things and it's hard to hear. also, the connection was spotty even though my phone was in my pocket. at the gym, they were fine, although i didn't like the cable bouncing up and down - for the price i was ok with this.<br /><br />the sound quality is pretty good for what you pay for. probably the best thing about the headphones. while support is great and they sent me a replacement set, i think i'm done with these things. i need something more reliable and probably of higher build quality.<br /><br />i'm skeptical of these being ""sweatproof"" because the manual says quite a lot about keeping the device free of sweat and water. if they are - then why did they die after only a few months of use? whatever the reason, it's  probably not worth it if you're interested in wireless headphones for the gym.",B01G8JO5F2
"These lasted about 6 months for me before they stopped holding a charge. Sound quality was better than expected, never had any issues with them falling out of my ears during runs or anything. Would recommend on the whole. Currently trying to see how the 1-year warranty holds up, so I'll update if that turns into anything, but even without it I'd still say this is a good deal for earbuds to do a job.",B01G8JO5F2
"This is the second time I have purchased these (the first time I accidentally left them in my pants that I tossed in the wash, and I am once again highly impressed by the quality of the headphones and all the features you get with it. I have tried several new, even more expensive, headphones since accidentally ruining my first pair of SENSOs. Nothing compared to my SENSO pair that I had, so here I am again ... rebuying the same item I bought about a year ago. This is as good as it gets for $20, and I would say it destroys even more expensive competition. High quality in every way.",B01G8JO5F2
After reading reviews they are pretty much spot on. They bad boys just stop working after a couple months.,B01G8JO5F2
"I can honestly say, I was pretty sceptical about a pair of $20 bluetooth headphones. But I was very surprised!! The overall quality is amazing, they're comfortable, sound great & the battery life is fantastic. I also cant say enough about the customer service experience, they've replaced 2 pairs of headphones for me, even though the first pair was my fault entirely. I highly recommend these headphones!",B01G8JO5F2
They were great for the first few months but they’ve stopped working and only hard a charge for 30 min now,B01G8JO5F2
One of my headphones stopped working after about three weeks to month. It just went out during one of my runs. Wish I would of tried to return sooner because deadline passed smh,B01G8JO5F2
Great BT headphones,B01G8JO5F2
"These are replacements for an identical-looking set I purchased a number of years ago. The sound quality is excellent and the base is true. They are very comfortable to wear in the gym and I find that they are far better sound quality than any of the non wired earbuds.""",B01G8JO5F2
Great Headphones. No issues connecting. Sound is clear and clean. Came with a handy kit with spares and different sizes. My only issue; if I leave the device away from me while I'm a home it works perfectly. But when I'm out and it's in my pocket the sound gets choppy and I end up having to hold it in my hand to keep the sound clear.,B01G8JO5F2
"These headphones are great! Especially for the low price! I've had them for a couple years now, still on my first pair. I've gotten them wet and they still work. I wear them at the gym, at home, on walks, everywhere.<br /><br />These are the best headphones I've ever had. It's lasted longer than any headphones I've ever owned.<br /><br />Sound quality is great for the price. No complaints.",B01G8JO5F2
Have to careful of the charging port. The cord does not fit completely into the port and if you push hard it will come loose.,B01G8JO5F2
Great value for money,B01G8JO5F2
Awesome! So worth the price!,B01G8JO5F2
The sound is pretty good and you cant be the price,B01G8JO5F2
I wear it in my shower,B01G8JO5F2
"I don't use sports earphones a lot, only use for the run, but a few time changes the battery later and battery can't change anymore.",B01G8JO5F2
Fall off uncomfortable the part that goes in your ear doesn't move the only part that moves is the part that goes around your ear... how can anybody jog with these. Sound quality is good that's about it.,B01G8JO5F2
I bought two pairs of these because of the reviews and the price.  I was not disappointed.  They get loud and have very good bass.,B01G8JO5F2
"After using the products for about a week now I had to return them. The only reason I purchased these and not the upgraded one is because the amount of positive reviews customers gave it. Here are my pros and cons for this product.<br />Pros:<br />Good (not great) sound, they look and feel like a good quality product, they stay on your ear when running<br />Cons:<br />They're bulky, the ear-hook and ear pieces start hurting my ears after on an hour of use, they start losing connection after 10 feet not 30 feet (as specified), the cord continuously sways side-to-side when running",B01G8JO5F2
Works great,B01G8JO5F2
lost them,B01G8JO5F2
These headphones were very easy to use and sounded good. They last about six month and then suddenly died. The company honored the warranty with no issues and sent me a new pair.,B01G8JO5F2
For the price these were well worth it. Use for working from home and sound is not perfect but well worth the price.,B01G8JO5F2
Getting the correct fit of the earbuds and keeping them in place during workout is sometimes a challenge.,B01G8JO5F2
I have purchased these 3 times. The first set lasted for a year under extensive use. The next 2 just a few months each. I've moved on to another product.,B01G8JO5F2
"Good audio, having some difficulty in selecting the correct ear channel insert.",B01G8JO5F2
"Not only are these great sounding headphones and easy to set up, but the Senso customer service was outstanding. The head set was around 6 months old when the left channel volume dropped and I could not fix it. I contacted Senso through Amazon and they immediately send a replacement pair out. Great product support!",B01G8JO5F2
This is the only set of ear buds I can keep in my ears while running! The back part bends so you can create your own little structure around your ear. So nice. Love these.,B01G8JO5F2
"I use these at the gym to be cord free. I don't care for the ones that just hook in your ear, they always fall out. I prefer these types that actually attach. The hook on these is flexible and comfortable. They clearly say when your connected and disconnected. The red logo is your on/off/pause button. The sound quality was better than expected with a nice balance of crispness and bass.",B01G8JO5F2
Theses wireles ear buds charge up quickly and the sound is amazing. Used them on a plane trip on chrstmas day and they worked like a charm.,B01G8JO5F2
I had these before but they stopped charging. The new pair seems to work even better. Sounds wonderful and easy to pair with my iPad.,B01G8JO5F2
very short lifespan of the product<br />they promised to replace it....never got the new one! sent in three requests too~,B01G8JO5F2
the order came in super fast!  and the senso headphones are just as great!,B01G8JO5F2
they're very comfortable I don't use them much but it has been great so far,B01G8JO5F2
This is my second pair of Senso and they're working great. Love the upgrades.,B01G8JO5F2
"These headphones are CRAP!!! 😡 They only have one button for all functions. When you try to turn them off they pause, then you have to try to turn them off again. When you do this you get a message in your ear saying ""dialing last phone number called,"" and And you have to scramble to get your phone and cancel the phone call. Then you have to try to turn the headphones off again...and it STILL will not work. It takes on average three tries to turn the headphones off when you’re done with them and on average at least two tries or more to turn them on when you want to use them. Sometimes when the headphones say they’re connected to your phone they’re actually not and music will still play out of your phone.",B01G8JO5F2
Love it,B01G8JO5F2
"The sound is pretty good, connect to your phone fast",B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these after trying a few different pairs of regular headphones for work. I work in a large open automotive shop and the shop equipment generates constant noise. The wired headphones constantly get snagged and caught on tools or parts of a car. My goal was to find a pair that was relatively cheap and was Bluetooth compatible. these pair of senso headphones were ones i chose out of a few different pairs on amazon. After about 1 week of use I am pretty happy with my purchase. these headphones have no problem lasting through a 9 hour work day and i have plugged them in at the end of the day every night. the Bluetooth range is okay, what i expect any pair of wireless headphones to be, I cant leave the building without it cutting out but easily get a good 40 feet of length before cutting out. the sound quality is okay but not great, which should be expected for any pair of earbuds in the $20 price range. The treble of the sound is great, just the low frequencies seem like they are muffled a bit and you can never really great a good bass from the headphones but the sound overall is clear. the noise-cancelling is the reason why I bought these headphones and I believe that they work great after spending some time to properly adjust the earbuds to your own ears. the comfort of these headphones is okay after taking some time to fit them properly, although I feel that comfort is something that is different for everyone and you would really just have to try them for yourself, they come with 3 different sizes of soft ear tips to get them to fit just right. overall I believe that these earbuds are great for anyone looking to reduce noise in a loud work environment and cannot deal with the extra wires on their person.",B01G8JO5F2
I love the product. I'm glad I tried this one first than buying an expensive one.,B01G8JO5F2
"My brother. I have one, and liked it so much, I got one for him.",B01G8JO5F2
I re-ordered these because I loved the first ones. The newest ones have been updated to be bendable ear pieces and don’t hold to my ears very well because the shape doesn’t hold.,B01G8JO5F2
The best headphones I ever owned. During the work they stay on without any problem. Definitely recommended.,B01G8JO5F2
The Senso Bluetooth headphones was a very smart choice for me. The price was low but the features were excellent - adjustable ear pieces with the loop to prevent falling off and a solid 8 hours of playtime. The buttons are easy to use and the Bluetooth setup was a breeze.,B01G8JO5F2
"Had these for about a year and they were great at first. The ear buds are connected by a cable that gets pulled on as you move around. Overtime the left ear bud became less loud. Even though I was gentle with the headphones, the left one has now stopped working completely.",B01G8JO5F2
I returned another brand because they wouldn't charge.  These work well and are very comfortable and well-priced,B01G8JO5F2
"These are pretty good headphones but only if you are 3 feet away from your source or phone. Seriously you can’t set your phone down at a park and workout 10 feet away, it fully cuts out.  They do stay in your ears which is nice, and the battery life is acceptable I’m just super disappointed with the range.",B01G8JO5F2
I was sceptical but glad I bought them cause  i paid 50 dollars for a pair that last bout 3 hrs and these will and have been running 8+ hrs a day,B01G8JO5F2
Great head phones for a low price. Highly recommend for others to purchase that are looking to purchase Bluetooth headphones.,B01G8JO5F2
Don’t waste your time.,B01G8JO5F2
As advertised!,B01G8JO5F2
The headset stays in place while running. Easily connects to my Bluetooth devices.,B01G8JO5F2
"Great sound, battery has a decent life too.",B01G8JO5F2
"Probably doesn't get any better than this for price + quality. I sweat a lot, especially when I run and living in the south. These don't ""wick"" any moisture from my sweaty ears and I'm often pulling them out and wiping them when I can because they slide around when they get sweaty. I wear a hat now when I run so that helps. They cancel noise pretty well, except for the wind ""whooshing"" sound you can sometimes have on a windy day. The sound quality is superb. These aren't Bose or Apple headphones, but I was blown away by how deep and clean the sound was for how much they cost. You're also not paying Bose or Apple prices. Plus, if you're using these to workout/run, you don't need the crispest sound--at least I don't and I'm very picky about audio and headphones.<br />One other thing: My headphones actually stopped charging about a month after buying them. I tried manual restarts and different chargers--everything. So, I contact customer support and within hours they responded, and within days they had shipped me a new pair of headphones that, so far, are working fine. Just be sure to register your headphones on their website.",B01G8JO5F2
"What more could we ask for? decent quality, good sound, easy set up and connection. But 2 or three and share with your friends. Great listening",B01G8JO5F2
I’m really impressed with the value for these headphones. I’ve had 2 different Beats sports headphones and both broke for different reasons. I decided to go a less expensive route and these have kept up with me for over a year of daily workouts. Haven’t noticed a single issue yet. I would definitely recommend these.,B01G8JO5F2
I have only had these headphones for a month but so far I love them! Work perfectly as described and battery lasts a long time.,B01G8JO5F2
Needed something that fit to my ear. Not me trying to fit in it.,B01G8JO5F2
"I received a pair of these as a gift. For about a year, they worked great. I would use them at work to listen to music during the day. They've always had issues staying connected, but sort of expected for a $20 pair of headphones. The sound quality was actually surprisingly good! But now, I can barely get a few minutes out of them before they disconnect and become unresponsive. When they do work, they make a bunch of random beep sounds whenever the volume is low. Not sure if it's a battery issue or outdated technology, but these headphones are now worthless. Glad I didn't pay for them myself!",B01G8JO5F2
The Quality is awesome.,B01G8JO5F2
"Bought a set 6 months ago, lost them on vacation this summer.  Bought another brand at big box retail store for almost 50% higher price.  Noticed a big drop off in sound quality and fit.  I went back to Amazon and ordered another Senso set.  Very glad I did.  This headphone is a tremendous value",B01G8JO5F2
"Sound quality is really good, and they stay in the ears during activities. Volume output is impressive.  The power button is easy to use as a play / pause too. The volume controls are really small, takes some getting used to operate them.  I recommend these connected wireless earbuds, and I’ll likely buy a 2nd set just for backup.",B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these 2 years ago and still use them to this day, Quality sound for earbuds this cheap and quality bass but most importantly the noise canceling is fantastic and even superior compared to others twice as expensive.",B01G8JO5F2
"I just opened and started listening. First I can tell by the packaging that the creators take their product seriously. For then being $20 I expected them to be in a bag or something. Boxed well and came with other goodies I didn’t expect. The sound so far is good, bass is a little weak but they do well. I’ve never owned noise canceling headphones before so I don’t have anything to compare them too but I don’t think I’d hear someone talking next to me with them in.",B01G8JO5F2
this was a gift,B01G8JO5F2
Only right earbud has sound.,B01G8JO5F2
"I like the fit of these headphones a lot, I use them to workout and they stay in my ear unlike a lot of headphones. The noise quality is also good. I am giving it a bad review because they constantly disconnect and reconnect, I have tried to troubleshoot many times but the interruption of sound is pretty annoying.",B01G8JO5F2
Battery live around 6hr not bad,B01G8JO5F2
"These headphones are decently comfortable (could fit my ears better but are fine) and have decent sound especially for the price, but the bluetooth connection is highly annoying.<br /><br />For starters, I'm pairing these with an iPhone 6s running iOS version 12.1.2. Pairing these is relatively easy, which is a good thing. With bluetooth turned on for your phone or iPad, you turn the headphones on my pressing and holding the main button on the right ear bud. They announce ""power on"" through the speakers, then you'll see them as an available bluetooth device on your phone. Push connect and they start working. Battery life is decent (lasts several jogs or long walks before needing another charge) and the sound quality is decent except in windy conditions.<br /><br />So what's the downside, especially for $30? Well, that's the first time you connect and pair the headphones with your device. The second time, the headphones pair automatically with your phone as you power up. Unfortunately, on the second and subsequent pairings, the bluetooth connection drops about every 5 seconds. There will be a soft beep, then the headphones go silent for 2-3 seconds, then another beep and they re-connect and resume playing. That keeps happening over and over. I found that to avoid consistently dropped bluetooth connections I have to go into my phone, find these headphones from my list of bluetooth devices, have my phone ""forget this device"", then re-pair the phone and headphones as if it was a brand new set of headphones. If I delete and re-initialize the headphones before every time I use the headphones, they work great. If I just turn the headphones on and go, they really suck.<br /><br />So... Maybe they work better with Android devices or phones newer than an iPhone 6s, or maybe the next iteration of iOS will fix this bug. I'd likely have given these 4 stars if they didn't have to be re-initialized every time I used them, but I can only give them a single star so long as this defect continues. In the end they work well, especially for the price, but they are super annoying.",B01G8JO5F2
"Doesn't always handle loud bass well, but the high pitch can get really loud!  Very good for the cost.",B01G8JO5F2
"If you are buying this headset to swim, please be aware that customer service advises only to use in the rain or shower, not underwater. I had to return. They shut down within 5 minutes of first swim.",B01G8JO5F2
"One week. So far so good. If they remain good, rating will go up.",B01G8JO5F2
"Pros:<br />1. Won't fall out of your ear when you're active like Apple Airbuds.<br />2. Sound quality is good, but I'm not an expert audiophile. I use them mostly for audiobooks.<br />3. Easy to pair to iPhone (after paired first time).<br />4. Volume controls work well, as well as on/off.<br />5. Has a case for the buds, although it could have been slightly larger. As it is, it fits into pocket or purse easily.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Sometimes won't cling to the ear right away. The ear-hangers are malleable so you can get a grip.<br />2. Everything is black, so don't think of setting these up in a dark room.<br />3. Will work best line-of-sight. Mine would not work well in another room from source.",B01G8JO5F2
"This is my second pair. The first set finally stopped taking a charge after several years of daily use. My son also has a pair.  Very good, especially for the price.",B01G8JO5F2
Decent sound for daily commute. Mic is TOO soft for the receiver. I stop using it for phone calls.<br />Treat this more like a headphone without a mic.,B01G8JO5F2
"nice gadget, works great",B01G8JO5F2
Good sound for price,B01G8JO5F2
"Been using these on my runs for a couple of years now. I have odd-shaped ears that won’t hold in-ear buds, like Apple’s, so I really appreciate the over-the-ear hooks. Never had a problem with them connecting to or maintaining the connection to my phone. The button controls are conveniently located above the right ear. Battery life is good for about three runs before needing to recharge. My only complaint would be, when there is a headwind, there is so much wind noise that gets into my ears. I guess it’s just my weird ears, but the silicone tips don’t seat well enough to block out the wind.",B01G8JO5F2
"I was worried when I first got these because it seemed like my ears were too small for the over the ear pieces and the ear piece. Turns out the over the ear piece bends to makes it smaller and fit on my ears. It comes with smaller ear pieces, so I swapped those out and it fits in my ear like I want now.  I got these so I could watch tv at night and not worry about bothering my neighbor who goes to bed early. I’ve charged these twice since Christmas, but I would consider myself a light user maybe 30 min- hour at a time, so it last because I make sure it’s turned off.",B01G8JO5F2
"This is one of many ear set that I bought, this is the only one that fits , the others slips right out, one ear but fell out while I was bent over to flush the toilet, it went right down the drain",B01G8JO5F2
"The buds are a little hard to change out but that's probably a good thing. It means that they're not likely to fall off. Other than that, I love these.",B01G8JO5F2
"Just got them last week, but so far I like them. The fit comfortably and the sound quality is good.<br />I had a pair of Toshiba earphones and the ""control"" mechanism was on the wire in between the left and right earphone and when I ran it would bounce off my neck. Anyway the Senso earphone have the ""control"" mechanism inside the right earphone so it does not bounce off my neck when I run.<br /><br />So after one week, I'm very happy with them. And if they last over a year with almost daily use then I would buy them again.",B01G8JO5F2
"This purchase replaced an earlier model (purchased Jan2017).  Here are some notes:<br />- earpiece - the current model seems a bit more firm (less squishy) than before.  so far ear comfort after extended wear (>1h) has not been an issues, but i have not yet tested other eartip sized<br />- over the ear tether - the current model is a lot better, feels less flexible, which i think is good as it provides a better anchor around/over the ear during running and other vigorous activities.<br />- sound quality - works well.  i'd say better clarity than previous model i had<br />- connection - seems to have some minor issues with static if my phone is across my body.  Assuming the BT radio is in the right earpiece, I get static and degraded sound quality when the phone is on the left side of my body, whether on an armband, or a waistpack, or in my left hand pocket.<br />- battery - my old one seems to be running out of battery earlier.  not sure if it is the normal degradation of the battery or something else.  With the new one, haven't tested beyond 4h, but have had no issues thus far",B01G8JO5F2
"Fit and function is nice, sounds great., easy to pair and use daily.",B01G8JO5F2
The foam plugs work great but for soem reason already lost one of them. Not sure if I can get a replacement.,B01G8JO5F2
"I’m not a sound expert, but I think the music sounds fine & I have used them for a few phone calls which has worked well. I’d say battery life is around 4 hours constant use? The part that wraps around your ear doesn’t really change sizes to hug around your ear if you try to squeeze/resize it. It’s too big for my ear, but they stay in pretty well while I’m running. I often have a headband on anyway that I put around them & they are a little bulky for that. There was one day the wind was blowing & I didn’t have a headband on & since they’re a little bulky there was a LOT of wind noise. I was a little worried about the cord flopping around as I ran, but I haven’t noticed it.",B01G8JO5F2
"I bought it five months ago and the device was great, but this week the rainy season started, I went cycling and ended up wetting the device.  Now it doesn't work anymore.  It was good while it lasted.  For those who practice outdoor sports, I recommend a waterproof one.",B01G8JO5F2
"This is my second pair of these headphones. I use them daily on the construction site so they’re not necessarily getting an easy life. The first pair I couldn’t have wished for better. Obviously nothing is going to last forever. However, my second pair had issues only a few weeks after receiving them and only lasted 3 months before it became impossible to turn them on anymore. Will there be a 3rd pair? Not without trying something else first.",B01G8JO5F2
"This is the 4th set of these headphones that I’ve bought, and until this one, I’ve been happy. This set has an on/off button that works only part time. Sometimes it turns on the first time, but sometimes it takes 10 or 15 tries, which is very annoying, and shouldn’t happen.  I’ve initiated a refund, and will order again to see if this is a one-time quality control issue, or if this is the case with all their headphones.",B01G8JO5F2
"These headphones worked great for me for several months (mostly used for running - comfortable and good sound quality, they didn't fall out of my ears, and the part that bends over your ear worked fine with my glasses on). Then they stopped working suddenly. I contacted Senso Customer Support and after a factory reset didn't work, they had a new set of headphones on the way to me within hours of my original request for help. I look forward to getting my replacement headphones and getting back to wireless running!",B01G8JO5F2
Wish they could fit better for the e at. When running they slip a little and after awhile they start hurting my inside of the ears.,B01G8JO5F2
"I use these earphones while I run each morning, and love them. They shape to my ears and have a range of ear pieces. They come with a hard case which I love for storing them. Definitely the best earphones I've ever worn.",B01G8JO5F2
They work very well.,B01G8JO5F2
The box arrived opened. No seal whatsoever. The earbuds look old/worn. Poor sound quality. Doesn't even fit properly inside my ears and keep falling. Ignore the positive reviews.,B01G8JO5F2
These headphones are great! They make my life a lot easier. I don't feel like I'm tethered to my devices. The sound quality is really great for phone calls. I really like that the headphones don't fall off of my ears.,B01G8JO5F2
"Awesome earbuds! Sound, battery life, durability, comfort all check out! There could be a redesign on flap that covers the wicking.",B01G8JO5F2
I bought because they advertise an extended battery life. They do...,B01G8JO5F2
"I bought my first pair and they were ok. Paired with macbook pro and iphone just fine. Calls were terrible as described by others, the people on the other end of the phone couldn't hear me at all, so do not use these for calls. Then after a bit the left earbud started buzzing. It was a constant buzzing that was super annoying. I contacted the seller and they were nice and sent me a free replacement. After a few months the right earbud started being super quiet compared to the left. I tried factory resetting it and unpairing and repairing and also fully charging several times. No change. These are just horrible quality earbuds. If you want to get these cheap ones, there are much cheaper options around $10. But just get something nicer or name brand. THESE ARE HORRIBLE",B01G8JO5F2
Good quality,B01G8JO5F2
The ear holders to soft never stays on place,B01G8JO5F2
Excelent sound. Great quality,B01G8JO5F2
"With the new iPhone, you either go Bluetooth or use their flimsy dongle.  These fit well, good battery life, and good sound quality.  Highly recommend.",B01G8JO5F2
My husband asked for these. He said they work just okay.,B01G8JO5F2
Sound quality is great! And the battery last a long time.,B01G8JO5F2
Sound is great. Piece that goes around the ear needs to be smaller,B01G8JO5F2
"We ordered 2 pairs, one broke within first10 days (just stops working) - got replacement which also lasted for week and stopped working. Quality is questionable. These we great few years ago, clean sound, long life, that's why we ordered it again, but the quality changed drastically.",B01G8JO5F2
"these wireless earbuds are amazing for the price. they come with a carrying case multiple different eartips, and it also come with a magnetic phone mount for your car for some reason. the audio qaulity on these is also pretty good, but these are not audiophile quality. i highly reccomend these as they are basically a cheaper version of the Beats",B01G8JO5F2
For my job it works great,B01G8JO5F2
They really don't work very well. I had to replace my first pair after 2 weeks. The second pair stopped working after a month. Poor product.,B01G8JO5F2
"Perfect headphones for running, jogging, biking etc.  Also, works well at home when you want to listen to music or stream movies when the family wants quiet.  Never had a problem.  Charges fine and long battery life if you turn off the power when not in use.  But if you keep it on for the whole entire day without without much use, you can get a good 7 hours.  I once had it on for 5 hrs accidentally and towards the end (at night) streamed videos on Netflix and got a good extra 3 hrs.  Total of 8 hrs.",B01G8JO5F2
"This is my second pair of these. Had to buy a new pair after misplacing my first set. The noise cancellation is better in this newer set than my last. Sounds and battery life are still great.<br /><br />I'm not a leave a review person normally unless there is an issue. However, if you want great wireless head set I'm extremely happy with these. So much so, I even shared the product on my social media post. You can't go wrong for the price. I have had other way more expensive pairs and these are hands down the best reliable bang for your buck.",B01G8JO5F2
Received a gift from my friend and beside the price the quality is excellent. I have them for over a year and I used to buy at least 1 pair for different brand every six month if so! Highly recommend it I run with it and they stay still. Love them best gift ever.,B01G8JO5F2
My kiddos bought these for me to swim with.  It says they are waterproof.  Not true.  Very disappointed.  Couldn’t wait to get to the pool.  So let down.,B01G8JO5F2
Totally hard to use and stay on ear junk junk junk wouldn’t even donate them,B01G8JO5F2
I wear them when I am working around the farm they are great they block out the noise of The tractors,B01G8JO5F2
+Good battery life<br />+Perfect for small ears<br />+Stays in my ears during long runs<br />+Good sound really cancels out sound!<br />The only negative was that I would hear the wind blowing against my headphones on windy days. Other than that they are great.,B01G8JO5F2
to sleep with and cancel out the ringing in my ear,B01G8JO5F2
"I wanted to be able to listen to audiobooks in the shower, so I got an IPX7 headset. Works well for what I got it for.<br />EDIT: I have been informed that IPX7 does NOT cover extended submersion or continuous water discharged under pressure. I have no problems with voiding my warranty, so I'll keep using them, and see how they hold up.",B01G8JO5F2
Great & affordable headphone.  Excellent qualilty without having to deal with a cable.  Love handsfree!!  Had to order a 2nd one because lost my last one on a trip.,B01G8JO5F2
Terrible Bluetooth connection. Always cuts out. Have to have your phone unobstructed.,B01G8JO5F2
Excellent ear buds for the price! Great sound quality! Nice carrying case with belt clip! Sturdy! Looks good! Get one and enjoy!,B01G8JO5F2
Got these for my boyfriend for his birthday and he loves them! They really are noise cancelling too lol..... he can't hear me when I'm trying to get his attention 😂,B01G8JO5F2

These did not last near as long as I thought. Did like at the beginning. Would rather have put money toward the APPLE I PODS. THey are amazing!!!!! just love those and feel they are worth every cent.,B01G8JO5F2
Great product! The battery will last forever.  I use it for times a week and  I only have to charge it every three months. After a couple miles the earbuds do tend to get sweaty as with most products. But they rarely fall out. Good purchase!,B01G8JO5F2
"Just arrived, better quality then expected. Took about an hour to fully charge the headset battery, works very well so far.",B01G8JO5F2
"Amazed by the quality , I like the adjustability of the ear pieces and fitment.",B01G8JO5F2
i love the hearing,B01G8JO5F2
They are extremely uncomfortable,B01G8JO5F2
"The fidelity of these are amazing! I have compared them to many wired earbuds and these blow them away. The musical range is huge and the clarity is excellent. Battery life iong, Bluetooth range about 20 feet depending on location. GREAT stereo separation, which gives them a concert-hall prescence. Highly recommended. AAA+++",B01G8JO5F2
It’s good overall but I wish u can adjust the ear clip u put over the ears..,B01G8JO5F2
Definitley worth the $20.00  I bought them for running and they work great.  Not sure why people would spend hundreds of dollars when you can get these for $20.00.,B01G8JO5F2
On-off switch broke first week,B01G8JO5F2
"Bought these January 5th, it stopped charging in less than 3 months and now it doesn’t even work. Poor quality.",B01G8JO5F2
Very easy to pair,B01G8JO5F2
"I loved my pair. It lasted me a year before it stopped working but to be fair I have a rough job and would wear these all day. Speaking of all day, the battery would last the full 8+ hours. To be fair towards the last few months I would charge it during lunch to make the full shift. Either way it is well worth the price and I will be getting another pair.",B01G8JO5F2
Good battery life and comfortable.,B01G8JO5F2
"I've used these almost every day for nearly two years. They work very well, with good battery life.",B01G8JO5F2
With this cheap price there is really nothing to complain about. The first day of using it has some noise. after fully charged for few hours everything was fine. But still it still has light noise from my left side every time I turn my head around. Might be connection problem but minor.,B01G8JO5F2
"This was my second pair.  The first one was great and lasted about 2 years with no issues, so when it was time for a new pair, I looked no further.<br /><br />The sound quality of the second one is very poor, especially when making phone calls.<br /><br />I just stop working and I’m not replacing it with another one of this brand.",B01G8JO5F2
These work so amazing.  The ear piece fits to your ear.  This is my second pair because I lost my first pair.  I love these and they work great!  Stay charged for about a week at a time or a little more.<br />Great quality and price is unbelievable!,B01G8JO5F2
to listen to music while I work.,B01G8JO5F2
worked fine for a year. but its button jammed up and it does not charge anymore,B01G8JO5F2
"These headphones work great! I wanted a headphone so I didn't need to carry my phone with me everywhere while listening to a pod cast or music and that would also cancel outside noise in the process and these headphones did just that. They came with a stylish case, and charging cable. They also came with some fun accessories which is a nice touch. Easy to use with a variety of ear size adapters which make them easy to fit in your ear. You can also switch them out for others to use them without using your specific ear plug. Nice!",B01G8JO5F2
"When they worked, they were a good product. I bought them 1/28/19 and by yesterday, less than 3 months later, not working at all.",B01G8JO5F2
Charging port broke after 2 months.,B01G8JO5F2
I just tested them and they sound good. Good quality for price,B01G8JO5F2
"These were great starter headphones, but they'll leave you wanting better quality. If you're hard on electronics or just don't expect them to last, then these are perfectly inexpensive.",B01G8JO5F2
Very pleased with the product. The earpiece fits perfect for all my activities and haven't had to worry about it falling. I've done a multitude of workouts to test it's stability and it's worked great!<br /><br />I wish there was a feature to show the battery life because I've forgot how long I've used the device and find out that I need to charge it when I need it.,B01G8JO5F2
"Great headphones, great sound, good battery life, really comfortable to wear, easy delivery process. Would highly recommend",B01G8JO5F2
"Ill-fitting headphones, making fit adjustments and the on/off switch difficult. Sounds is fair, battery life also average.",B01G8JO5F2
"Connected easy, track controls, great deal",B01G8JO5F2
Lasted 2 months. I was going to charge it and then the charger port broke. Tried to contact customer support and no answer. Sound quality was OK.,B01G8JO5F2
Works great for the price!,B01G8JO5F2
I love the freedom it gives me. I'm online listening hours per day.,B01G8JO5F2
I received your product along with 3 of your competitors and tried them all and found that your product was a clear winner in sound quality and comfort for my application.<br />Battery life was also a factor.......<br />I needed an ear bud that would be great in a wind situation that would allow me to hear and not lose them while in movement.<br />The assortment of buds for the ear was crucial in this working and you folks have shown me that quality is not always dictated by price.<br />Other more pricey products were returned and you folks came out the clear winner.<br />Keep doing what you are doing and the consumers will recommend you as I will to others.<br />I will be a return customer as well!<br />Regards William Bell,B01G8JO5F2
"I had another pair of Sensos for about 5 years until they recently stopped taking a charge.  They were never GREAT, but they were cheap and adequate for listening to music or podcasts while working around the house. The old pair also had flexible adjustable ear hooks that I could bend and mold to fit more comfortable over my ears.<br />So, I came back to this product page (which helpfully informed me I had bought the same product 5 years previously) and ordered a new pair to replace the dead ones. The product I received was NOT the same as the one I was replacing.<br />The earpieces are fixed, no longer bendable.  The sound is incredibly tinny and a bit crackly.  The earpieces feel considerably lighter and generally cheaper.<br />I sent them back a few days after receiving them, so I can't speak to their battery life or charging time. At least the return process was painless (brought them to Khol's) and I was refunded the same day I dropped them off.",B01G8JO5F2
When I buy it for the first it was very nice but now material are not good.,B01G8JO5F2
"Bought these as a cheap replacement for workout headphones. They sound great, fit in the ear well, range is pretty impressive. All in all a great pair of cheaper headphones for the gym!",B01G8JO5F2
Using them at production shop job. Like most buds they tend to drop out of my ear don't know why. At least they have a good adjustable behind ear holder. Battery seems to last quite a long time,B01G8JO5F2
"This is my third pair of senso earphones and all of them had weak connection to my iphone even though it was only in my pocket for jogging. The fit for my newest pair bought 1-2 months ago (non red-label) was not that comfortable. Also, all of them are uncomfortable lying down in bed while using them. My initial pair of senso had trouble connecting to my devices as they would show it’s connected but not play to my earphones.",B01G8JO5F2
"As a runner, I got these as a fairly inexpensive option to listen to music but not worry if they got wet during a run and had to be replaced. Not only have I worn them for two years in all temperatures, from -20F to 90F, they’ve been on in snow and rain, and still work. What finally prompted me to come back and write a review is that I accidentally put them through the washer and dryer with my clothes AND THEY STILL WORK. Just wow.<br /><br />Sound quality is good, they stay on well and toggling pause, advance a song, take a phone call etc. is pretty easy to do. I actually had purchased a backup pair for the day they might get wet and stop working, gave the extra to my boyfriend when he was frustrated with the poor battery life on his headphones, and he is happy with them too.",B01G8JO5F2
The sound ease of use and the battery life were all an easy sell but the product you get for the price is phenomenal. My last pair were 2 years old and I broke them or they would still be working. Great product very simple and great sound 👍,B01G8JO5F2
"I have used SENSO Bluetooth headphones for 2-years and love them. I can’t use the iPhone earbuds as they don’t fit my ear canal. The SENSO wraps around the ear and is adjustable. The sound is very good, especially for the price. I wear them exercising, working in the yard and on plane trips. They fit well and are very good with noise canceling. I highly recommend!",B01G8JO5F2
"Everything seems almost perfect with these. I have used them for 2 weeks to run without charging them. Today, it consistently reminded me that the battery was low even though it said it was 30%!!! After a few times, it began disconnecting. I tried multiple times to connect them only for them to disconnect seconds later. They're great but I rather them lose battery quicker and go to 0% than stop working at 30%. Extremely misleading!!!",B01G8JO5F2
Great product and great price.,B01G8JO5F2
Great for the price.  They sync right up.  Bass reflex isn't the greatest but overall decent sounding.  Easy to use for making and receiving phone calls.,B01G8JO5F2
Great product for the Peice you’re paying. I used them for gym and they work wonderfully!,B01G8JO5F2
"I was skeptical at buying them at first but I am so glad that I purchased them. it's the best $20 I have spent, especially on headphones. Great Sound and great quality, especially for the price.",B01G8JO5F2
My husband likes these so much we ordered this new pair after the first ones seemed to be shorting out after several years of hard wear and tear at the gym 3-5 times per week.,B01G8JO5F2
"Sound quality is scratchy and not great. Thought these would be a cheap noise cancelling alternative to bose or song, but the sound quality is not even comparable. Would recommend if you just want eh sound and cheap wireless headphones, but not great for someone who wants bass, clear vocals, and true noise cancellation.",B01G8JO5F2
"I wanted a cheap pair of wireless earphones for the gym.  This is actually my first pair of wireless and I was concerned with the aural/audio quality, but have to tell you these sound great.  The set up process couldn't have been easier.<br /><br />Minor complaints:  Could be easier to identify Left & Right sides, powering on and off is minority clunky, and I wish they came in more color options/accents as I bought two pairs, one for me & one for my wife.<br /><br />These really are nit picks... great product.",B01G8JO5F2
I brought this product for family and friends. Nice packaging and quality for the price!,B01G8JO5F2
Awesome sound,B01G8JO5F2
"These worked well for 9 months, but suddenly I can't charge them anymore. Which means I can't use them. I can't recommend them for this reason.",B01G8JO5F2
Works amazingly and long battery life,B01G8JO5F2
"I got the equivalent Senso earbuds about a year ago and liked those. Since the battery life was getting shorter, I recently bought a competing product at Best Buy. The fit was poor, the controls were clumsy and operation unreliable. I kicked myself and again bought new Senso earbuds, this time with Bluetooth 5.0. They work fine, just like the first pair. Let's see if the battery life is better this time.",B01G8JO5F2
"""It's the second purchase of senso earbuds . I buy it for my family because the quality is excellent",B01G8JO5F2
"I lost these headphones in my closet for over a year. I even bought another pair to replace them. Then over a year later, I found them again still with a 75% charge. epic",B01G8JO5F2
I work outdoors a lot and this way I don't miss phone calls and can listen to the music from my phone.  Does everything I wanted.,B01G8JO5F2
Fantastic headphones for running!!!  Great sound!,B01G8JO5F2
"Pros- Great sound and battery life<br />Cons- they seem to collect moisture in your ear after awhile.  Noise Cancelling should not be listed as a feature, as the only noise they cancel is due to the plug being in your ear muffling sounds- but not a big deal cause who expects these to cancel noise.<br />Unknowns-  waterproof?  never got them wet other then sweat from workouts.",B01G8JO5F2
"I received these headphones as a gift, my grandbaby bit one of the ear pieces and I brought another pair. You can not beat the price!",B01G8JO5F2
"Excellent sound, great features. Everything fine so far. The seller seems to care about customers.",B01G8JO5F2
The headphone to play music broke on the second time I used the headphones.  The bud came out and I can see the wire holding it together. The sound quality is pretty good and you can adjust the ear too bad I got a defective pair.,B01G8JO5F2
I like that they are blue tooth but with the fact that I wear glasses the part that goes around the ear is a pain  in the neck.  So I've only used them twice.  Ended up getting a great pair of wireless bluetooth for Christmas so the end!,B01G8JO5F2
good product for the price,B01G8JO5F2
"My husband is loving his new wireless earphones.  He uses when daily for work.  He is a flooring installer and they work great for his needs.  They stay in place and the sound is amazing.  He has difficult hearing and the sound quality for him is superb. .  He loves that they cancel background noises and he can answer incoming calls easily while listening to his music. Waterproof feature is also good for when it is raining outside.  He only wishes the battery life was a bit longer.  Last for 8 hours for him.  Overall, a great product.  Thank you.",B01G8JO5F2
"The sound is muddy and not great. I feel like I can barely hear the lyrics because the bass is SO high. That being said, I don’t mind that much because they are gym headphones, and they do sort of block out sound.<br /><br />On the plus side, I really like how well they stay on my ears, it’s hard to find gym headphones that stay in my ears because I have a tragus piercing. The hook is flexible, and it comes with an earplug quality earbud. I didn’t have to adjust my headphones once.<br /><br />I’ll keep them because I just need something to listen to at the gym that stays in, but the sound quality isn’t that great.",B01G8JO5F2
it is good,B01G8JO5F2
Sound is very tinny not worth it,B01G8JO5F2
Thumbs up,B01G8JO5F2
"Comfort is excellent and the sound is good. The challenge I have is that I am experiencing signal distortion whenever my exercises (ex: leg stretches, phone in my pocket) put more of my physical body in the way of the direct signal line. For reference, I am about 6’1” and 200lbs. Once I straighten up, the signal strength restores and sound quality is great. Due to this experience, I am convinced that the published distance between device and headphones is drastically overstated.<br />I wish there was a way to send the signal from the headphones to the phone that would skip the song. Currently, I can stop/start the song and adjust volume, but must pull out my phone in order to skip the song.<br /><br />Update: the charge port overheated and melted the plastic frame. Now the charger cannot fit back in to continue charging.",B01G8JO5F2
"I use headphones with distant friends for virtual run/conversation. I would also use for solo runs to listen to music/podcasts. During testing with friends, they said the call quality was not good. Outside sounds like footfalls, cars, even my voice sounded like chipmunks - too squeaky and not clear. After adjusting the headset a few times, I had to abandon using it.<br />Music was good sounding though.",B01G8JO5F2
"They were amazing for the few uses i got, they stopped taking a charge after about a month maybe 25 days. maybe it was something i did. Not Sure.",B01G8JO5F2
The blue connection is not strong. Keeps cutting in and out when I'm right next to it.,B01G8JO5F2
Hooked to bluetooth easily and works very well.  Comfortable earbuds.,B01G8JO5F2
Great for working lut,B01G8JO5F2
Gave this to my daughter for Christmas.  She is excited to try them out at the gym.,B01G8JO5F2
"I really like this product.<br />Great price, different size ear pieces for custom fit and a really great protective case.",B01G8JO5F2
Cheaply made headphones. Broke within a month.,B01G8JO5F2
"I have waited a few months to write this review to see how these puppies hold up. My impressions are overwhelmingly positive. These are the best cheap headphones I've been able to find.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Comfortable, adjustable fit that actually STAYS in your ears unlike a lot of other earbuds I've tried.<br />-Fantastic bass and decent sound isolation.  They're not ""noise canceling"" but they definitely get the job done if you're trying to ignore your mom when she's telling you to do chores.<br />-Actually waterproof. I wouldn't recommend it, but I wore these in the shower a few time and they were totally un-phased. Which means they'll definitely be great for a run on a rainy day...once I decide to start exercising.<br />Solid design - the large central button is easy to find and push even when wearing gloves, allowing you to pause, play, or answer phone calls with ease. Volume buttons are well placed and easy to access.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Though it has excellent bass, the hi frequencies are only so-so. But...you know...twenty bucks.<br />Questionable microphone: Sometimes people on the other end would have great difficulty hearing me even though I hadn't physically changed positions. I'm not sure if this is something that could be improved on my end so I ain't mad.",B01G8JO5F2
"This is the 2nd pair that I've ordered in less than 2 years.  The first pair just stopped working one day and I thought that it was a random thing, so I ordered a 2nd pair.  Today these ones stopped working.  They light up on the charger, but when I remove them, they won't turn on and none of the trouble shooting options are working.",B01G8JO5F2
"I had a pair of these I used for the past two years teaching online video classes and they worked really well.  When my old pair no longer held a charge, I decided to purchase a new pair.  Well, these are nothing like they used to be.  I could tell immediately that the headset is much lighter in weight and feels cheap.  I used this new pair today for the first time and had to stop using them.  My students could not hear me at all, and I just heard a bunch of static in my ears. Too bad.",B01G8JO5F2
Sound was awful and one earbud you could hardly hear out of. I exchanged them and the next pair was exactly the same except they actually fell apart in my ear on the first wear. I’ve bought these several times in the past without issue. Must have changed manufacturers. The voice was different than the past pairs. Very disappointed,B01G8JO5F2
Works great kids love them,B01G8JO5F2
"This is my 3rd set of Senso Bluetooth headphones. The first set lasted a year until I accidentally ripped off one of the ear pieces. It was an earlier version with the non-adjustable ear hooks which I liked. The mic feature never worked for that set and neither did the music control other than play/pause. I also noticed occasional skipping when my phone was in my pocket. Otherwise I was very happy with the product.<br /><br />The second set I got was more or less the same. I actually DO NOT LIKE the adjustable ear hooks. I take them in and out regularly when talking to people directly and then find I have to take time to readjust them in my ear constantly as the hook doesn't seem to hold its shape very well.<br /><br />I got the new model ones to see if they fixed the ear hook annoyance. It does seem a little better though it might be because they are brand new. It does seem they have fixed the skipping issue. So for the price they are great, just wish the ear hooks were even stiffer to stay as you form them better. I loved the original hooks but I understand that they wouldn't be a good fit for everyone.",B01G8JO5F2
"Easy to pair, easy to use, especially it’s a good product for go to gym work out 💪 .",B01G8JO5F2
I had a pair of $150 beats headphones that these look like and the Senso headphones are really good and well priced alternative. I did have and issue with the battery. Fortunately they got back to me quickly about it and are sending out a replacement.,B01G8JO5F2
good fit and sound,B01G8JO5F2
"This is what I tell my husband.<br />This is my second pair of Senso bt headphones. I tossed the first pair recently, after about a year and a half of use, because I lost one of the ear cushions. Now, my husband and I are very careful about budgeting for miscellaneous purchases that are around the $50 or above mark. After I told him I needed a new pair he asked me what would be more important on the Wish list we have going... New running shoes or new headphones. HA!<br />Darling, my headphones cost $20.<br />To which he responds, ""Nooo, you should get the new Apple ones, they're great!""<br /><br />Here's the thing friends... These headphones.. I've never had an issue with them connecting. I've never thought poorly of the sound quality. The new ones I just got, MOLD TO MY TINY EARS. Tiny ear people, hi - I see you. Regardless, until the Apple headphones last as long as my $20 Senso headphones for the same value... i e. When you're $159 headphones last 7.95 years.. and you've never lost them, they've never faulted and something better didnt catch your eye in that time... then Screw Your Apple Headphones... respectfully.",B01G8JO5F2
"Horrible! Sound quality is really terrible, couldn’t use it to answer calls (other person can never hear me) and battery died after 3 gym uses. I’m not even sure why this product got decent reviews .",B01G8JO5F2
"Trash. Right bud is all static. Left ""works"" but sound sucks. Got these for the gym bag but they won't see the front door.",B01G8JO5F2
What I dislike about this product is that it hurts my inner bone of my ear with the plastic around the earbud,B01G8JO5F2
They work great I use mine when I work out at the gym,B01G8JO5F2
"These speakers sounds good for the value. I was using mostly for the phone calls and hardly 4 hours a week. Right after 6 months, it stopped charging and never came back. Tried to contact manufacturer but showing as product support ended where initially mentioned as 1-year manufacturer warranty.",B01G8JO5F2
Use these all the time in my wood shop and cutting grass. They work awesome. 3 hours of battery life and enough bluetooth range I can set my phone down and walk around my garage without losing connection,B01G8JO5F2
I've been looking for the perfect headphone earbuds with hooks on them....for skateboarding and working out at the gym. These are perfect. Excellent volume and clarity....strong durability!,B01G8JO5F2
"They changed the part that goes over your ears. It used to be flexible and would reatin its shape. Now it seems to have a piece of metal in it so you can customize the fit, but its not as comfortable and quickly gets out of shape.",B01G8JO5F2
Received these and used them for a week and they stopped working.  Didn’t have packaging anymore so I was SOL.  Don’t buy.  Pay a few dollars extra for better ones.,B01G8JO5F2
Slow to charge. Only one successful connect with lPhone.,B01G8JO5F2
love it,B01G8JO5F2
If you throw out style then it does what it does but it’s pretty bulky. Try not to lay on you side with the ear phone as it gets really uncomfortable really quick.,B01G8JO5F2
The sound for the money you can't beat,B01G8JO5F2
The sound for the money you can't beat,B01G8JO5F2
Second pair did same thing stop charging after couple of months. Do not buy unless you want to constantly replace,B01G8JO5F2
"Family, these joints are banging..not going to sugar coat it..if you want to hear low hip hop bass and clear mids and highs...unbelievable..can't beat the price ...",B01G8JO5F2
"I have a neurological disorder that makes it hard to hold things like a smart phone much of the time. Having a hands free way of talking on the phone and listening to music not only frees up my hands to do other things, but helps me avoid dropping my phone. The ear buds are comfortable and I have no trouble with reception anywhere in my apartment or even out to my porch no matter where I leave my phone.",B01G8JO5F2
Great durable headphones. Put them through the wash at least 4 times with them still usable! Sound isn't awful and they cancel out majority of background noise.,B01G8JO5F2
"This is the second pair of these Senso headphones ive bought. The first pair came in September of 2017 and i was actually very satisfied, the sound quality on those first pair, the ease of use, fitment, packaging all left a great first impression. Through wear and tear they ended up breaking and thought hell, why not get another. This second pair is NOT of the same quality of those that i purchased a few years back. The sound on these sound muffled, terrible in fact, theres no EQ or anything that can help them either. The physical product is all the same, but unfortunately times have changed and so did the quality of sound on these.",B01G8JO5F2
They broke after a month so time to buy some new ones. I hope I get some value out of the next ones I buy.,B01G8JO5F2
They're definitely a good set of headphones and are very durable.  You will find yourself looking for wireless earbuds.  I very rarely have both headphones in at the same time. As a person that rides bmx and is always in the woods they have been able to hold up for 5 months.  You can be about 20feet tops away from your phone then starts to cut in and out.,B01G8JO5F2
"UPDATE 6/21/2018<br />I want to start off by saying that I meant to do this update for some time now. Okay, here I go.... Unfortunately, I have to say that I am not happy with my replacement headphones (that I paid for with my own money) as, if you read the whole review, I had initially purchased because I thought the first one was broken.  So the very 1st pair that I bought continues to work like a charm.  However, the 2nd pair which I received February 4, 2018 has turned out to be absolute garbage.<br /><br />Even after I received the 2nd pair, I continued to use primarily the 1st one and didn't really use the 2nd one much.  So honestly it took me a awhile to notice that the 2nd pair, whenever I used it, would not work right.  It kept on losing the bluetooth connection.  This is how it would go.  I pair it to my phone, and less than a minute later, it's lost the connection.  I re-pair and the same thing.  However, since I have my original pair I would just go back to that and would chalk it up to maybe I forgot to charge the second pair.  Anyway, it wasn't until I had misplaced the 1st one and had to rely on the 2nd one that I noticed once and for all that it constantly loses its connection, it's not my phone or our home wifi, it's the headphone itself.  So now, I don't even bother using it as it's been nothing but a headache.<br />I hate to have to report this but I have to be honest about my experience.<br />Thus, my conclusion...I still don't regret having originally bought, the 1st pair anyway, which I still use.  However, I am just a little saddened that the backup that I had always planned to purchase is basically useless.  So, that's my 2 cents.<br />Thanks for reading!!!<br />*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************<br /><br />UPDATE:  2/27/2018<br />I purchased these great earbuds back in December 2016 and proceeded to use them all the time.  I even used them in the shower as I had originally stated in my first review.  Well, about a month ago I thought that they had stopped working.  It started after a 2.5 hour jog/walk and of course by the end I was pretty sweaty.  So I had issues with it working properly after that and thought, oh great, my fault, I wasn't careful enough with these babies and decided to go ahead and purchase a second pair.  Well to my absolute delight, as I was waiting to get my second pair, which was a very short wait.  The company is really fast with shipping and they arrived in like 2 days.  Anyhow, I decided to try using my first pair again, I just wasn't ready to part with it even though I knew I had another one coming.  Now here's the delight part, it actually started working again.  Apparently, it just needed to dry out.  That's it.  It's working perfectly again.  So as I had initially intended to purchase a second pair anyway, I am just ecstatic.  These really are the best earbuds I have ever come across and I still continue to use these all the time in favor of other earbuds.  Also, I wanted to add as I hadn't reviewed how they work with phone calls before. I can truly say that they are great on that as well.  The sound quality on calls and the ease with answering and hanging up, such a breeze.  Additionally, pairing is also a breeze with connectivity occurring at around 5-7 seconds.  They charge very quickly as well.  If they are drained it may take about 2 hours or less to fully recharge, but half an hour goes a long way with these too .  Thus, I continue to be extremely happy with this company and this highly recommended, stellar, well made, quality item and I am very thankful to now have two of them.<br />Once again I did not receive a penny for my review.  I gladly spent money out of my own pocket for these and like I said before, money well spent.  Thanks again Tekatron!!!<br /><br />Oh and I almost forgot.  The company, both times reached out to me by email, even one of the owners, just to check in on me and to see if I liked the product.  They made me genuinely feel that they wanted to make sure that, should I have any issues that I could easily contact them.  I truly appreciate their sincerity and I believe anyone reading this will too.  Thanks again, so loving this company!!!<br /><br />*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************<br /><br />First off let me start off by making it absolutely clear that I did not receive anything for my review.  I paid for these out of my own pocket.  Very very happy with my purchase by the way, but I’ll get to that shortly.<br /><br />Okay, let’s begin!  Where have these been all my life or atleast since bluetooth earbuds became a thing? I have never ever ever owned such a boss, primo, whatever word suits you, throw your own in there if you have these already because you know what I am talking about, pair of earbuds.  Earbuds, earbuds, I just cannot believe these are earbuds, these are A..M..A..Z..I..N..G!!!  I honestly resigned myself to simply average earbuds until I found these.  I can do somersaults over here, with them on.  They are so super snug, absolutely no slippage.  I always have trouble with that, always, but not with these.  They have literally become my go to.  I find myself making excuses to wear them.  Phone calls, listening to music (of course), workouts, playing games on my phone, to make it seem like I’m on a call even when I’m not because I am trying to not be bothered.  I even shower with them on, it’s like a spa experience.  No, I do not recommend this, please do not try this and if you do, leave me and the company out of it.  But these are just so good and incredibly comfortable!!!  Plus, the sound quality actually rivals that of some of my headphones.  Not listing any, not an audiophile, but trust me, I’m sure if you gave these a shot you would not be disappointed.  Even the battery life is pretty plentiful at a whopping 8 hours which knocks my Soundpeats out of the water at a supposedly 6 hours (they never really seemed to really last for that amount of time anyway).  Plus, the Peats were much more bulky in comparison to these pretty sleek buds.  And did I mention the bass?  How could I forget that?  That’s one of the main reasons why I am so shocked these are earbuds.  The bass is absolutely killer.  It’s just the right amount, not too heavy, not too low, just perfectly pound-erific bass.  I know pound-erific is not a word.  But these are so great I feel like Willy Wonka, Dr. Seuss, (whichever fits the bill), when I wear them and I can make up words.  I gain magical powers with the freedom and the pleasure that these provide me.  It’s like having a soundtrack to my life.  I obviously wear these a lot.  Please don’t judge me.  But it’s not just about the bass.  I listen to just about everything with these, and the sound is remarkable.  I find myself getting lost in the music, an absolute pleasure to my ears.  Even the packaging is top notch.  It comes with everything you need to get started.  You get not 1 but 2 super quality charging cables with covers.  Like I said top notch!!! You get a car charger, 3 ear tips, a wire tie, and a nice size, actually stylish case.  Also, my buds charged up really fast at only 1.5 hours and I was ready to go.  So very very happy with my purchase especially since I had my eyes on them for awhile and even more so that they ended up being so delightfully, deliciously, spenderificiously, (I know, not an actual word) lovely.  So, basically as I come to the end of my review, if you’ve made it this far, stop, go back to the top of the page and hit the add to cart button.  You deserve a happy purchase.  A happy purchase, what’s that?  Well let’s just say I would have gladly held up one of those signs on the side of the road for businesses trying to advertise, you know the people wearing the Statue of Liberty costume or in regular clothes, some spinning signs trying to get you to stop or go in to see a business.  If this company ever said they were giving these away as a promotion if you do this, even though I already own a pair, I would do it.  I really mean that, the company can hold me to it.<br />Alright, having said that I will, finally, officially, conclude by stating that these were in fact my Christmas gift to myself to block out some holiday chatter.  Let’s just say they worked like a charm.  THANK YOU!!!!  So I say to SENSO, you rock, literally and THANKS so so much.  My life isn’t transformed but I can block more stuff out, they really are that great at noise-canceling.  Didn’t even know they would be great at that, but just another one out of the many great features of this product.  Amazon, THANK you so much for introducing me to SENSO!!!  One of my most happiest purchases, money so well spent that I plan on doing it again, (must have a backup pair or two).  Thanks so much for reading!!!  And finally, depending on where you are, good morning, good day and good night!",B01G8JO5F2
Lovd them until the left side got a short and quit working. I. Was imediatly given a replacemment set as per my protection plan.,B01G8JO5F2
i like it,B01G8JO5F2
It’s ease of use and being comfotable,B01G8JO5F2
"2nd time buying these as I loved them the first time around. I bought my first paid July 2017 and they lasted until the end of February 2019 without any issues. I typically would use them EVERY work day for the full 8 hours with no issue. I believe there was a wiring issue in the old pair as I could hear fine out of the right side but not the left. In my eyes, for the price and the amount of time they lasted, I am absolutely thrilled with this product.",B01G8JO5F2
Great product,B01G8JO5F2
Not sure how great Beats earbuds are but these are exceptional cancels all noise and are very loud,B01G8JO5F2
perfect sound and so comfortable in ears ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,B01G8JO5F2
"Cheap, bulky, can't adjust to my ears, I thought it will be a great product viewing the rating...",B01G8JO5F2
This is my third pair. They don’t last more than three months.  Will not buy again.,B01G8JO5F2
I liked the price and sound,B01G8JO5F2
"I love these headphones! For the gym, they are perfect for the price and sound and quality are great!",B01G8JO5F2
I have used these on 6 marathons and for someone who sweats a ton these are a great value for the buck. They are pretty sturdy and you need to recharge them after about 6 hours of running.<br /><br />The only major issue with the headphones is when you get a low battery notification it notifies you every 30 seconds. The frequency is pretty annoying and makes you want to rip out the head phones,B01G8JO5F2
"Love these!  First set arrived and, while they did work, when charging the red light never came on.  Contacted customer support and they said send 'em back and they would replace them.  Not only did they replace them, but Amazon sent the replacement set before the original had actually returned to them.  Gotta love that kind of support.  New set work perfectly.  I wear them when cutting my lawn.  Sound is great (not much bass, but what can you expect from such small speakers) and I have no issues hearing them over my mower.  I am very happy and would recommend these to anyone in the market for an inexpensive wireless headset solution!",B01G8JO5F2
not fit to the ear,B01G8JO5F2
Comfortable and good value. Good sound quality and long battery life,B01G8JO5F2
Decent headset,B01G8JO5F2
"Pleasantly surprised at the quality of these cost-effective headphones. This brand came recommended by a running friend and they definitely produce quality sound, cancel noises and are stay completely in place while running. I would definitely recommend.",B01G8JO5F2
"Comfortable, and sound is great. The battery life doesn't last long. I have small ears andnthey do bother me after a while..",B01G8JO5F2
"This is my second purchase! I loved them so much, I bought them for my brother for his birthday! They’re great quality!",B01G8JO5F2
The sound quality is great and hardly ever fall out while exercising.,B01G8JO5F2
"About what you would expect for the price, mediocre sound.  Bass is a bit exaggerated, and treble is virtually nonexistent.  But for 20 bucks, really can’t complain.",B01G8JO5F2
"THIRD PAIR in a row that has now broken, within less than a couple years. This last pair was only a couple months old. It made a small beep sound then would not turn on or charge, and is just dead. DO NOT buy these if you want reliable headphones. Big bummer.",B01G8JO5F2
"First Of all,<br />Whats Good.<br />Its sound is good , and battery life is good<br />Whats Bad :<br />Noise reduction in Calls ,, Al most Zero noise reduction.<br />The button that increase and decrease the sound was working at the beginning but now after almost 2 weeks of use they are not working .<br />The main Button by clicking it one time it suppose to stop the video or the sound track , now this function is not working.",B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these to use on the increasing number of video calls and webinars I'm on during the pandemic. They paired easily with my computer. The sound quality and microphone are great. The only drawback is the battery life feels short; unfortunately, monitoring it on Win10 is a pain. I just make a habit of charging them regularly.",B01G8JO5F2
"I bought them for running and functionally they’re just fine.  BUT, the sound quality is very poor.",B01G8JO5F2
"Using while lifting weights and running at the gym.  I like the sound, and they are lightweight and comfortable. No complaints - very satisfied!",B01G8JO5F2
Connectivity is spotty.  but for the price it tolerable,B01G8JO5F2
"Love it, great purchase",B01G8JO5F2
"They keep turning off and disconnecting from my device. Did not work well when swimming, the reason I bought them in the first place. Water interferes with connection. Resets have not worked to solve the problem. Decent sound quality and battery life.",B01G8JO5F2
Easy to use / connect<br />Annoying Chinese voice providing status messages on connect / disconnect<br />Poor sound quality compared to others I have tried at this price point,B01G8JO5F2
I have bought these for a long time and they usually last 6-8 months with steady use.  Most recent pair was shoddy manufacturing and broke in just over a month.  Moving on to another company that has more consistent quality.,B01G8JO5F2
"I’ve ordered this product twice. I ordered the first set two years ago. They lasted two years, and I have nothing bad to say about them. They had great sound and microphone, great battery, and fit well around the ears. I recently ordered a second set since the original set topped working, and the quality is terrible. The microphone is not effective, the ear pieces feel cheap (the original set were a nice gauge rubber that felt substantial), and the plastic used feels very cheap. Overall, a tremendous downgrade from past products and incredibly disappointing.",B01G8JO5F2
The quality is cheap<br />They dont turn up good like the other brand i love and tgis was more expenses,B01G8JO5F2
Versatile. Works with all products easily....,B01G8JO5F2
Running and for kids.,B01G8JO5F2
"I had purchased this product and it worked for 3 months. Then they randomly stopped working and would not turn on. They will charge and are fully charge, but when I go to turn them on it never says ""power on"". I am very disappointed that these did not last longer. There is no reason for them not to work as I only use them once a day to work out and they never got wet, were dropped, or stepped on. They simply stopped working.",B01G8JO5F2
"Even after re-charging, they aren't working. What should I do now?",B01G8JO5F2
It connects and disconnects all the time. I have tried resetting the Bluetooth and the headphones and still does the same. The first pair I had was the best ones. Never had a problem with them.,B01G8JO5F2
"Do not buy these headphones if you plan on using them to have phone conversations. They are somewhat comfortable when you have them both in, but they are awful when it's just 1 for talking to people on the phone or for use in your car.<br />They are heavy and will pull on the one in your ear. They also don't hang around your neck well. Almost lost them a couple times. The ""C"" that goes around your ear has a thin wire inside that let's you form it to your ears. It catches on everything. Can't put these anywhere without them catching on something and getting all bent up.<br />Save yourself the money and don't buy these unless you're just going to run with them and that's it.<br />On another note, these are Beats knockoffs in case you didn't know. Almost the same exact design and color.",B01G8JO5F2
They work great,B01G8JO5F2
"Headphones keep connecting and disconnecting on their own. Also, there is way too much interference with these headphones. My phone will be LITERALLY RIGHT NEXT TO ME and the headphones will be cutting in and out. Absolutely horrible connection. I've bought cheaper ones at Wal-Mart that worked better. Save your money and get something else. Only good thing is the battery life.",B01G8JO5F2
"I've had these headphones for about a month now and I absolutely love them. The sound quality is good for what it is, but the volume is impressive. I usually have headphones on max volume and I dont have to with these. I go to the gym and workout so they stay on great. The carrying case is an awesome addition so I can throw them in my bag on the go. There are multiple ear bud selections that are the regular plastic and foam. Battery life is pretty typical depending on how you use them.",B01G8JO5F2
"I have only used these headphones a few times and the piece inside the earpiece that connected to the charger is broken. The cord itself had a hard time fitting in and that's probably what did it. So they are useless now since they can't be charged.<br /><br />They were decent to use, but all the adjustable ear pieces it comes with, hurt quite a bit.<br /><br />Hate to say it but they were actually a waste of money. Did not last long at all and they weren't that comfortable.",B01G8JO5F2
I’m not a huge fan of these the sound is poor and crackling and the left ear doesn’t work well on the set I got.. I’m highly disappointed 😞 also they are not comfortable either,B01G8JO5F2
I love this product because it fits in my ear really well and doesnt fall out. I tell people about them all the time. It also holds a charge for a while.,B01G8JO5F2
ONLY LASTED ME 6 MONTHS,B01G8JO5F2
Despite being advertised as IPX7 or whatever they are not waterproof.,B01G8JO5F2
My ears are really sensitive so I wish they were softer but I made some adjustments to the size of the buds so that has helped a little. It covers all of my other needs however!!,B01G8JO5F2
Great headphones for the gym.,B01G8JO5F2
"Worth a lot more - not as good as $100 headphones, but close enough to the point that it does not seem worth it paying for $100 earbuds elsewhere",B01G8JO5F2
after two weeks using it broke!<br />No good!!,B01G8JO5F2
These are durable and provide great audio,B01G8JO5F2
"Bought these on budget to replace my preferred wired Sony headsets at 20bucks.<br />WILL NOT DISAPPOINT<br />They are a tad on the chinsy light-weight plastic side of things but that's not terrible.<br />Instant connection. I mean instant.<br />Lady's voice confirms connection.<br />Sound quality could be better but I equate that to the weight and lack of acoustics.<br />But again, these get loud enough and the sound quality is surprisingly good.<br />Would buy again.",B01G8JO5F2
Loving how easy it is to bluetooth. great sound and no cords to get in the way of bicycling. great fit to the ears with several sizes to choose from.,B01G8JO5F2
So far the best that I have gotten. Still adjusting for the size of the ear thing to get the best out of it.,B01G8JO5F2
"I like this product as the batteries last for a long period of time. Sound quality is good, probably not the best. But withing this price, it is a great deal I must say.",B01G8JO5F2
"I have small ears and these fall right off. They do work well in water, but they call right off.",B01G8JO5F2
"I can't believe there are this many favorable reviews for these headphones. The fact is, a lot of people are going to buy these for working out, and the main flaw is the over-the-ear piece, it is simply too flimsy to hold in your ear. They absolutely cannot withstand any pounding or impact whatsoever without falling out of your ear. Sound quality is ok, battery life is a few hours at most. Pretty lame that these garbage headphones are labeled ""Amazons Choice"".",B01G8JO5F2
I like these a lot my only concern is the part that goes around my ears are to big and it doesn't look like it can be adjusted. But other then that i really do like them as a whole,B01G8JO5F2
Very nice sound with this headphones but they do stick out on the side of your head if you are looking for the aesthetics as you are wearing them. I have had several issues with them losing signal with my phone in my back pocket and when I bend over. I had to do a factory reset but then it happened a second time as well. Definitely a great pair of headphones for the money.,B01G8JO5F2
"Great for running, stays in ears and also great for voice calls when working from home all day.",B01G8JO5F2
These are amazing for the price! They come with a lot of extras too. They sync with my phone and watch and the sound is great.,B01G8JO5F2
There are great for running!  Also are coming down in price since the last pair I ordered!,B01G8JO5F2
Previous version was louder?! But nonetheless this is FANTASTIC!!😍,B01G8JO5F2
Excellent product,B01G8JO5F2
These headphones have superior sound and they stay put while I am exercising.  I have had more expensive brands before and these are the best I have used.,B01G8JO5F2
Good Quality for price,B01G8JO5F2
"This is my second pair of this style (I'm a heavy user).  I was having some trouble getting the earbuds to charge, but I contacted Customer Service and got a quick response that walked me through the reset process.  They also followed up promptly.  I highly recommend this product.",B01G8JO5F2
"I wanted a bluetooth earphones set for sometime and I bought Senso because of the reviews and cost.<br />I was not disappointed. The earphones last for a while and I like how they block out the noise around me.<br />The only downside was that the earphones stopped connecting in Nov. 2018. I contacted the company<br />and they sent me a new one. I don't know why the old ones stopped, but I've very happy with the<br />product and service.",B01G8JO5F2
"Product did not work, I missed the returned date.",B01G8JO5F2
"Exactly what I needed for the Gym.  Good battery life, comfort, and waterproof.",B01G8JO5F2
Pairing was seamless and the audio quality is amazing.,B01G8JO5F2
The charge port broke the first time it was plugged in. Before it had ever been used. So can’t speak for sound quality,B01G8JO5F2
They sound horrible,B01G8JO5F2
product seems to works arbitrarily and intermittently whenever it so chooses to do so. Oh you want to turn your headphones off so your phone can actually understand using voice to text only for a brief moment and then switch back not on this little devices watch. It's off and wont come back on or charge till it pleases to do so or at least that's been my experience thus far but I know how it goes... quantity and speed over quality.,B01G8JO5F2
"These earbuds are great! I’ve tried a few and they have amazing sound quality, long battery life, and they fit and STAY put! If I ever lost them I would buy these again immediately!",B01G8JO5F2
""" The ear buds are much better than we expected! The sound is loud and clear and we are both pleasantly surprised at how well the mic works. I haven't yet used mine all day, but my boyfriend has and the battery lasted throughout his whole work day and was still going strong. We both keep our phones in our pockets while using, so I can't comment on the Bluetooth range. We love them!""",B01G8JO5F2
Waterproof. Fit a little weird on my ears.,B01G8JO5F2
I love everything about them.  Nothing bad to say.,B01G8JO5F2
I recommend these headphones for all. they are great.,B01G8JO5F2
Great product,B01G8JO5F2
After using these for 4 months they started to fall apart with the ear pieces especially. Reached out to customer service 4 weeks ago with a promise to next day a new set and they have yet to replace them as promised so I've ordered another brand to replace these. They were great for the time they worked,B01G8JO5F2
"It performed great. The sound qualit for the price was good enough. Just after a year of using, left side went. The problem was the flat cable connecting to it is damaged somehow. I dont see any visible bends or damage.",B01G8JO5F2
"I've been an avid exerciser my whole life, both as a runner and a gym rat.  Nothing irks me more than having to stop and fiddle/fix my earbuds, much less have a pair that keep falling out.  The SENSO Bluetooth headphones not only sound great, but are comfortable and stay in place quite well.  They also have remote controls for power and sound control on the earpiece itself.  Syncing it with my phone was a snap and the charging port couldn't be more simple.  It comes with adapters to get the perfect fit inside your ear, but I didn't need them. Adjusting the outer hook was also easy. I also really appreciate the small case it comes with to protect my headphones in my gym bag when I'm not using them. You would think a product with  all these features would be so much more expensive, but for the quality at this price, there is no reason to spend more!",B01G8JO5F2
You get what you paid for. Not so bad tho,B01G8JO5F2
"Not much different than the other BT Headphones in this category. Nothing stands out that an audiophile would care for at this price range bbuuutttt the most innovating thing I've seen is that the ear cradle part can be bent into any way to fit any ear! This is amazinggggggg!<br /><br />The last ones I bought were Mpow Flame & Merdumia BT Headphones & their ear pieces were just a flexible rubber pre-shaped. They would occasionally fall out of the ear when skating or running, but button design is exactly the same. I've now got about 3 sets of ear cover things.<br /><br />4 stars since it doesn't have aptX or LDAC abilities but at this price I don't expect it to.",B01G8JO5F2
Senso headphones work just fine! I like that it came with a case!,B01G8JO5F2
"I really like this Bluetooth, it came in a nice package with a cinch bag for your accessories,you have two batteries to fit either right or left ear It fits snugly into your ear and the sound is very vibrant!",B01G8JO5F2
Can't beat the quality for the price.,B01G8JO5F2
"They work but I'm not a big fan of the in-ear headset because after a while it bugs me personally. I can only wear them for a short time before I get irritated by them. Other than that they sound fair but they do not really block outside noise to good.  The low end lacks depth but overall, they are not a bad buy.",B01G8JO5F2
Good quality,B01G8JO5F2
A real nice set of ear buds. You know they are very good to second you take them out of the box!! You did not buy here? Well you may have paid to much!!!,B01G8JO5F2
These head phones sound good and they stayed in place during my workout.,B01G8JO5F2
Dislike how it fits around ears. Nice sound,B01G8JO5F2
Does not sit well on the ears. Feels wierd. Am not using this anymore.,B01G8JO5F2
silicon ear hook is not flexible but instead its bendable ( not holding good ),B01G8JO5F2
"I use wireless headphones ALOT.  I own several sets- this one is always the first one I put on charge.  Reliable, simple to use, and comfy!",B01G8JO5F2
"They had 5 stars from me, but now 1 because I reported an issue with one of the headphones I purchased and they said they'd handle it. The headphones were under warranty, but it's been like 2 months and they haven't honored my warranty.  In fact they haven't done anything!<br /><br />So don't buy!",B01G8JO5F2
Over the ear is the way to go for me. No chance of losing them,B01G8JO5F2
"Amazing sound!!! Super sturdy. Way better than my Beats. Comes with a little carrying case, vent mount, as well as your typical accessories (charging cable, different sized ear thingies.<br /><br />Only CON: these have a strong smell. It smells like hot melted rubber...or tar....either way it’s not pleasant. It’s not strong enough to prevent you from using them, but it’s definitely noticeable.",B01G8JO5F2
Sounds is great and stays put throughout my workouts,B01G8JO5F2
"These earbuds would not turn off at all, and they would interfere with everything else that would bluetooth to my phone, especially my car. Sound was sub par, not worth it.",B01G8JO5F2
The volume button was broken directly out of the box. Low quality device. Not recommended.,B01G8JO5F2
All good in left ear but no sound at all in right ear.,B01G8JO5F2
Bought for my wife she loves them thanks a million,B01G8JO5F2
"Headphones came as advertised. But if you're running or walking at a fast pace outside with your phone in your pocket the sound becomes distorted, with issues keeping a strong connection.",B01G8JO5F2
The life of the headphones lasted about 3 weeks. The battery life kept getting worse and now they are completely dead and won't take a charge.,B01G8JO5F2
The best workout headphones I’ve ever used.,B01G8JO5F2
"Very good sound, stay on good when I am jogging, very pleased with the purchase! Enjoyed the extras too, excellent value!",B01G8JO5F2
They worked great until they didn't. The button to turn them on got stuck and that was the end of it. I had bought the 2 year insurance and they haven't help.,B01G8JO5F2
"I was looking for wireless headphones that had a longer battery life, good sound quality, and didn’t cost a fortune. THESE WERE EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. I highly recommend these!",B01G8JO5F2
I use these headphones for my morning walks connected to my android phone.  The music sound is great for me.  It helps pass the time while walking.  I like how they fit on my ears.,B01G8JO5F2
Tried a couple of other expensive brands but they couldnt match the bass or the volume of these.,B01G8JO5F2
I was very pleased with the quality and sound from the earbuds considering the low price point. I was very pleased with the product.,B01G8JO5F2
"Purchased in March of 2018, and product randomly became defective in April 2019.  Used headphones for roughly 40 minutes a day for 4-5 days a week until they stopped working. Did a factory reset, but headphones were not able to enter pairing mode.  Called Senso technical support and they confirmed that the headphones were defective, but that they could not offer a replacement since it had been just over a year.  Product not designed to last.  Sound quality and fit were “eh” to begin with.  Strongly recommend you buy a different product.  These are cr@p.",B01G8JO5F2
3rd pair will buy again.  Sounds quality really good blocks noise around you to a degree.,B01G8JO5F2
"This is my second pair. I bought a pair for me a couple years ago and they still work great. The last pair was for my wife. She has only used them a couple times but so far so good. For the quality and the price point, you can't beat these headphones. Both of ours our the older model but I may buy the newer model just to try them out as well.",B01G8JO5F2
Overall I like the volume especially when you're on the road in your vehicle. Fantastic product for what they sell for!,B01G8JO5F2
"Doesn't sounds as well as some other earphones on the market, but for the money you couldn't ask for more",B01G8JO5F2
"I use them daily for working out at the gym, showering, grocery shopping, etc.  They fit my ears perfectly.  I sleep with them in for aid in falling asleep.  I honestly can't think of one thing I dislike about them or would change.",B01G8JO5F2
Perfect for working out with! Stay in ears well enough. Sound quality is surprising great.,B01G8JO5F2
Works as advertised. I like the old ear hook design better though because these fall out of place a lot. I also wish that there was a way to see the battery on your phone instead of just waiting until that it's less than 10% and tells you it's about to die.,B01G8JO5F2
"Working outside in 100+ temps, these ear buds stayed in place and never caused a single problem.",B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these twice, the first time I thought they sounded comparable to beats, however unfortunately they broke down on me after a couple months. I figured I'd give them another shot because they are cheap, and  recently bought them and wanted to return them the day I received them. They have CHANGED, the sound quality is horrible now.<br />Wont buy again",B01G8JO5F2
I lost my first pair.  Had to have these again!  Great fit.  Amazing sound.  Had to call the 24/7 support because my Android didnt pair up(phone issue NOT earbud).  The support person was fast and very knowledgable.,B01G8JO5F2
I have only had these a couple days but so far they work great. I am very pleased and would love to rate them again later because I have had several similar items(other brands) that didn't last very well. These seem very well made. Great for working out and will be great for mowing grass (and cancelling the noise!),B01G8JO5F2
"I loved these ear-buds. I bought a pair about a year ago and they still delivered good sound comfort and battery life (I could go my entire 2 hr work out without a hiccup). Recently, I lost them and came back to buy another pair, but I see there is a newer model. I'm really skeptical about getting into the newest model, since the old worked so good for me. Any one had try the old and new to compare?",B01G8JO5F2
"""A quality product at a great price. I would buy again.""",B01G8JO5F2
hard to set up still struggling,B01G8JO5F2
"Es un muy buen audífono: tiene muy buena calidad de sonido, cancela todo ruido alrededor. Lo uso para hacer ejercicio. El cable hace que sea práctico para el ejercicio porque lo puedo quitar fácilmente sin que se caiga y pierda. Muy recomendado",B01G8JO5F2
"I’ve had other senso headsets, these hurt my ears and had zero fidelity.  Don’t buy",B01G8JO5F2
Best 20$ headphones on the market hands down.,B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these headphones on OCT 7, 2017. All of a sudden, they stopped charging and working! The product is made to work only for 1 year.",B01G8JO5F2
"Not sure how to rate noise canceling, I can hear approaching cars when I walk the streets. That is good for my safety",B01G8JO5F2
Great,B01G8JO5F2
"Had a pair of earbuds that only stayed charged for 2 hours, these have lasted over 9, LOVE them!",B01G8JO5F2
Good product for the price! I would buy again.,B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these because I have 2 other blue tooth headsets that I am not happy with for a lot of reasons.  These are light weight the sound quality is excellent, no one could tell I was using them. It is easy to set them up and they are comfortable.  It is easy to answer a call.  Well worth the money.",B01G8JO5F2
For the money they are a very good product. They work in the gym.I use them while I  drive tractor trailer for phone calls so far so good. My wife wants a pair. I,B01G8JO5F2
I watched youtube reviews on this product and started to think maybe I made a mistake. However my laziness kicked in and I didn't want to go thru the process of returning them so I gave them a try. Well I was so pleasantly surprised how good they are. Sound is good and they stay pretty firm on my ears when I run. My only complaint is that they could fit more snug. I do have very tiny ears and this is always a problem for me with ear buds. Other than that I am very happy with them.,B01G8JO5F2
"As an incomplete quadriplegic, I spend quite a bit of time listening to music on an MP3 player and the Senso sports Bluetooth earbuds are wonderful to use.",B01G8JO5F2
I got these for Christmas and I've spent countless hours doing yard work and working out with them on. I have my phone in a waist pack and these are constantly dropping the sound. I've tried with content that is directly off the phone and it still cuts out. I don't have this problem with the Letscom headphones I purchased a few months ago.,B01G8JO5F2
"Awesome head phones, some songs bass is too heavy and distorts music a little bit. 98% of songs do sounds amazing though. Great alternative to beats which I’ve owned and lost numerous times. Bluetooth range is great as well.",B01G8JO5F2
"sound is great and you can wear them in your ears for hours and no irratation....by far the best headphones I’ve Owned and I even bought an extra pair in case I forget them at home, well worth the money",B01G8JO5F2
"These headphones fit well and stay on while being active.  However, they have terrible sound quality.  It is muddy, muffled, and awful.  Have to turn the high frequencies way up on the equilizer to compensate.  But then had to fiddle with the equilizer when other output devices are used that actually work right.  Not worth using these.",B01G8JO5F2
Ear buds did not fit well in my ears but it still provided decent sound. Battery life was good.,B01G8JO5F2
thats why i bought a second one  price and quality is ok,B01G8JO5F2
"don't buy, i thought buying a bluetooth with wired earbuds would circumvent the issue of one earbud going dead, but lo and behold still happens.  after a couple months the right earbud, the one with the charge port no less stopped working. on top of that amazon will only offer a 80% refund because it broke after 30 days.<br /><br />noise cancellation is weak too, does a poor job blocking ambient noise. sound quality was ok but tinny while it worked.",B01G8JO5F2
The sound for me is not as impressive as higher priced ear buds but definitely worth the money.,B01G8JO5F2
Arrived on time. Work as promised.,B01G8JO5F2
I really enjoy these wireless headset  Charge the battery & they are simple to use !!,B01G8JO5F2
I was very pleasantly surprised with the sound quality and noise cancellation but the earpiece is very big/loose and doesn't fit as well as I would like.,B01G8JO5F2
"Bought these for work, as a construction worker. I’ve tried a few types so far, and these seem to work the best.  The battery only lasts about 7 hours though for continuous playing of music. I’ve had other pairs last an entire work day, but these are comfortable and have good sound. So I just turn them off at lunch to give me a little extra time.",B01G8JO5F2
"Outstanding product for a great price,. Most wireless headphones come with a huge price tag but these were well worth the cost. Fit great and are comfortable to work out in. Don't have any issues running in them and they also come with a cool little carry case. Well worth the purchase.",B01G8JO5F2
Sound randomly cuts out.  Followed directions and reconnected pods.  Still occasionally cuts out.,B01G8JO5F2
They sound really good. Stays in well after I changed the ear pieces to the next size smaller. It was nice to have a small package of different size ones to choose from. I have used them for two weekend's bike rides.<br />I generally ride for two to two and a half hours and they have not ran out of power yet. If I was to have any complaint it would be that if you reach up to adjust the one on the right you have to be careful not to hit the buttons.,B01G8JO5F2
Everything from the gym to the car etc,B01G8JO5F2
Very easy to talk on and very clear for the other person!,B01G8JO5F2
"Was gifted these headphones Christmas 2018 loved them from the jump. I've used them every day the sound is perfect, sync quickly, comes with additional tips, a spiffy case, and to top it off a year warranty. All this for the low price of $20. Buy them you won't regret it!<br /><br />The year warranty comes in handy which I used today my replacement set will soon be on the way. Awesome company that stands by their word.",B01G8JO5F2
Works great!,B01G8JO5F2
Perfect item! Works fantastic,B01G8JO5F2
"Started off as a decent affordable pair of headphones. After a little more than a year, here are all the things broken:<br /><br />- Audio only out of right ear. Nothing in left.<br />- Bluetooth drops connections all the time. Sometimes mid song or video.<br />- Bluetooth sometimes says it’s connected, but it’s not. Have to power cycle it an try again. Occasionally takes many cycles to pair.",B01G8JO5F2
Only was working for 2 month is the second I bought,B01G8JO5F2
"I essentially have only one problem, paired this with my iPhone 6S as well as my iPad 3 and it’s been impossible to bring the volume down to an acceptable level to pleasantly listen to music. I’ve made every adjustment I can think to try, no luck!<br />I so wanted to love this, it looks great seems extremely durable!",B01G8JO5F2
Great headphones love them,B01G8JO5F2
I bought these to wear for my outdoor activities and while they are performing well enough for my needs they do tend to cut out quite often and not just in specific areas. I do find them very comfortable to wear for extended periods and the battery life is sufficient as these are not top of the line ear buds but very budget friendly. Worth their cost,B01G8JO5F2
"Incredibly affordable, durable and good quality. I keep buying $100+ buds and they break or they just don’t measure up to the price. This is a great, affordable option!",B01G8JO5F2
Endless power. Amazing sound quality and perfect fit. Perfect for my gym practice.,B01G8JO5F2
"These seemed pretty good for the price. Sound was ok (good enough for workouts) and battery life was decent, but they didn't stay in my ears very well. After one year they started having major connectivity issues, dropping signal, and within a year and a half the battery would only last about 20 mins on a full charge",B01G8JO5F2
"I've had these Senso headphones earbuds for almost two weeks. They are the greatest! Easy to charge and the battery lasts quite awhile. These are my first wireless headphones so I can't compare them with others. I decided to take a chance and I'm glad I did. They are comfortable and the ear buds fit my ears well. I have small ears so I was worried about the fit but they not only stay in but they're comfortable enough to wear for hours. Listening to music is a pleasure because I can hear all the instruments so the arrangements really come alive. The volume buttons are easy to learn to manipulate as is the fit of the earbuds in my ears. This weekend we drove round trip from New Jersey to Ohio, a 7 and 1/2 hour trip (actually a little longer with stops). With the earbuds I could listen to my music while my granddaughter who was driving could take phone calls on the car Bluetooth and talk to her 2 year old in the back. Best of all, when the 3 year old was cranky I could tune her out. Taking out the left ear bud to talk while listening was easy. Another thing I like is the cord is not long so it's not dangling all over the place. And the black color makes them blend in well with my clothes.<br /><br />The earbuds and extra buds come in a great zippered case that is very attractive, small and easily fits in most purses or pockets. I should mention that I'm a very active 78 year old great grandmother whose kids, grands and greats keep me up on the latest technology. I am very happy with these Senso headphones and I recommend them to anyone.",B01G8JO5F2
Don't fit my ears good.  Sounds great if you can get them to stay in your ears.,B01G8JO5F2
"Muy buen producto, bastante ligero y comodo, y con una buena autonomia de bateria, el sonido es bastante bueno, recomendado",B01G8JO5F2
These are great for working out. I’ve had mine for 3 years and they still work great.,B01G8JO5F2
"The rating of one star is based on the fact that the headphones kept unpairing with my iPhone.  Sometimes I couldn't get it to pair at all. Sometimes it would pair at home, but when I got to the gym it was unpaired. Wouldn't pair up again. Tried everything.  Never could tell when it was going to work. When it did,  the sound was great. Wish it was more dependable.",B01G8JO5F2
Sound good and great battery life but the pieces that go over your ear are floppy and don’t work well,B01G8JO5F2
"These headphones worked great while I had them. The audio was fine for the price and the battery life was great. Unfortunately a year and half after having them, and only a little after the warranty expired, a connection came loose and the headphones stopped working.",B01G8JO5F2
The quality wasn’t what I was excepting but not horrible,B01G8JO5F2
These Senso Headphones were delivered on time and have a wonderful clear sound.  I am very pleased that I selected them over the many other choices.,B01G8JO5F2
I really like these. They stay in place no matter what task I'm doing.,B01G8JO5F2
"I was very pleasantly surprised by these headphones. You can not beat the price and everything you get for it. They come with a great carrying case, multiple sized earbuds options, and a car hanger option. They were easy to sync with my iPhone, and are easy to use. The sound is great quality, and they do a great job canceling outside noise. My husband liked them so much that he wants me to buy him a pair. I highly recommend these headphones.",B01G8JO5F2
n/c,B01G8JO5F2
gret sound for small device,B01G8JO5F2
"While it took a minute to adjust to the earbuds (I was a Beats guy for year), the overall experience rocked.  Inexpensive, light, powerful and easy to pair.  However, I've only had them since September, 2018 and the left ear bud has stopped working.  Pity.",B01G8JO5F2
The sound was fine but got staticky and then totally cut out within 10 ft..  this will not work for me so I’m returning it,B01G8JO5F2
"These connected well and didn't cut out like other wireless headphones I have used.  They were also able to be turned up very loud.  For the price range, these are very good.",B01G8JO5F2
"Got these headphones through a Facebook promotion, at a a price too good to pass up. While the product themselves were decent enough, the customer service had been so lacking, I regret the purchase.<br /><br />Had an issue with the power button, and the headphones no longer charging, which both were well within the warranty period. I emailed customer service, only to get a reply about a week later, asking to send a photo of the broken headphones. Which I did.<br /><br />Then nothing. Crickets. And guess what? Now they are no longer under warranty. How convenient for them!<br /><br />The product itself is pretty good while it lasted. I used them every single day, even more than my wired Bose earbuds. But, I can't recommend them if they can't back up their product.<br /><br />If you like throwing your $ away, by all means, go ahead. But, I don't think I would buy these again. At any price.",B01G8JO5F2
Good product! Reasonable price,B01G8JO5F2
Not the best at noise cancelling but overall great for the price,B01G8JO5F2
"Failed.  Won't turn on, even following reset.  Blue light on when charging.  Switch cover appears to have separated from sweat/water exposure.  Blue light emitting around switch and cover edges.",B01G8JO5F2
"I've had these headphones for about 11 months now, and while for the most part they have been excellent (some connection issues, and some times where the audio cut out for a second or two), I began to have issues with the headphones turning themselves off after 20 seconds.  I reached out to customer service who instructed me to do their calibration reset, but that didn't fix the problem.  They then asked for my order number (I assume to replace them since they are still under warranty), and after that I haven't heard one word from them despite the fact that I followed up with them 3 times.  The headphones are fine for the price, but don't expect them to last and don't expect the company to stand by the 1 year warranty.  I just ordered from another company that I hope will have more reliable and honest customer service though I assume I'll hear back from Senso once my warranty expires.",B01G8JO5F2
"After using the headphones for 5 months, they broke. They repeatedly turn themselves off even when fully charged, only the right side works, and only sometimes connects to my phone. Even begore this, my headphones would need to be completely reset in the middle of listening. They would just shut off with no warning, even when fully or mostly charged. Honestly just spend the extra and get Beats or AirPods. These are great until their trash.",B01G8JO5F2
"amazing product, shipping and wonderful seller",B01G8JO5F2
"I bought 3 units for Christmas gifts, so I don't know first hand how they are.  BUT, my boss raves about them and has been using them for some time now.  I trust him and if he swears by them I know they are very very good.  He is quick to complain if something isn't right.",B01G8JO5F2
It’s ok,B01G8JO5F2
Excellent value for dollar. Very comfortable,B01G8JO5F2
"Awesome sounds, quick connectivity.  $80 off from Dr. Dre Beats with quality sounds.  My favorite for working out, running, walking and even quick privacy at work.  I have Bose, Dr Dre Beats and now Sensa.  110% support available, which i haven't had to use yet.  Dr Dre's Beats for $100 is much worst than Sensa.  I would buy again and or recommend.  I was missing out a long time not buying these.  There is a reason why so many customer like this headphones.  It's quality at terrific price.",B01G8JO5F2
"I have had these earbuds for about a year and a half, and am sad to have to throw them in the garbage today. They worked great at first. When they quit the first time, customer service was quick to reply with troubleshooting steps that fixed my problem. I had to go through the reset more and more frequently since. Now, they won't even power on so after trying for weeks with different power sources, I'm just giving up. I paid about $35 and hoped they would last longer than this, but maybe I'm old school.",B01G8JO5F2
Amazing headphones definitely a bargain. Great sound quality (comparable to air pods) and battery life is superb,B01G8JO5F2
Wouldn't stay in my ears.  Didn't test sound quality or anything else.  My spouse didn't like the feel of it either.  Too bulky.,B01G8JO5F2
"Los he comprado ya dos veces porque perdí los primeros. Definitivamente los amo, cancela el ruido pero no del todo, excelente para salir a correr, si tienes las orejas pequeñas no los recomiendo porque se pueden desajustar. Pero es excelente, para la música",B01G8JO5F2
"Great head phones for 6 months or less and dont get your Hope's up when they work well for a short time.<br /><br />This is my 2nd pair of the ear plugs breaking and senso wont issue me a replacement for either of them.<br /><br />They only give replacements for malfunctioning defects not any type of accidental damage.<br /><br />Even tho the ear piece is due to poor quality, just like their customer service.",B01G8JO5F2
"I love these headphones because I could use them when I go swimming. However, one time water got in they  didn't work for couple of hours.  they work fine again. I love them because I can use them at the pool.",B01G8JO5F2
"I've had these ear buds for 2.5 years and they hold a charge for 2-3 weeks. During that time I will do usually 8-12 hours of running per week.  They don't slip, and they come with different sizes of ear pieces.  They are easy to charge and I don't lose them because I tuck the wire into my hat or pony tail. Lately, I haven't even been tucking the wire in and they don't move. Missouri heat and humidity means LOTS of sweat. The waterproofing is the real deal. The sound quality is wonderful, too! No way would I switch to something else!",B01G8JO5F2
Great little headphones for the price!,B01G8JO5F2
"I was a bit surprised when I first used them. 20$ how good could they really be. Well the 30k ppl are right. They Rock!!! Great sound all around. The ONLY thing I didnt like was the case that it comes with. I can see how ppl break the buds. It's to tight in the case for the buds. I recommend using the box it comes in. The box is way better fit, harder, more room if you'd like to take a few extra items with them. All around I love these buds. I would 100% buy them again.",B01G8JO5F2
"Excellent device! Great price! Pairs nicely with apple devices.""",B01G8JO5F2
"I lost my original pair of these headphones. I LOVED them. I went ahead and just got another pair but for some reason, these just aren’t as good. They don’t loop around my ears as well for some reason. Otherwise, same good quality audio and I like that the battery lasts FOREVER.",B01G8JO5F2
"Very nice headphones and I love the packaging.  Was pleasantly surprised at the nice carrying case, extra ear buds, and bonus items for cell phone.  Earphones synced right away with my iPhone and the ear piece fits nicely with flexible ear loop. Been working in the barn all day away from phone and never disconnected. Work good with phone as well",B01G8JO5F2
Very good product! Functions as described! Overall functionality of this product performs well. I am greatly appreciative for this product to arrive on-time and without delay. Packaging & overall product presentation is clean and concise. Product arrived new and without any defects. Highly recommend seller!,B01G8JO5F2
much better than expected for the price,B01G8JO5F2
"This are high quality, not the internet junk I often accidentally order.  Quality packaging, comes with a case, a car mount, a cell phone mount, extra earpieces of different sizes.  They have a nice, high-quality feel, and most importantly, they work well.",B01G8JO5F2

Wish the sound was louder and had more base.,B01G8JO5F2
Great product and excellent customer service if you need it!,B01G8JO5F2
"I’ve had these for two years, and I still use them often. I use them mowing the lawn, at the gym, and around the house. They’re a very good inexpensive option that offers good quality for the price. They don’t have “noise cancel” but other noise is definitely reduced when these are in your ears somewhat like earplugs. They include different sizes for your ears. The charging cord included is very short and lost easily but a universal cord works just fine. You cannot charge them and use them at the same time but I’m sure that’s normal. Whenever I take calls with them on the audio doesn’t seem quite as clear as a music app. I’d buy them again.",B01G8JO5F2
"I've purchased these three times, the first two being satisfactory. This time, however, the fitted plastic around the ear has no wire in it, so it does not stay. At all. No one can hear me when I use them for phone calls, and they constantly disconnect when I am listening to Audible. Will not purchase again. Also, not for small ears.",B01G8JO5F2
"Sound quality is spotty. Even with the paired device right next to the headphones, the sound cuts in and out- similar to what happens when the paired device is almost out of range for the headphones. Other than that the fit and usability is ok for the price point.",B01G8JO5F2
I am very happy with these earbuds they work really really well so well I had to buy my wife a pair of so she would stop stealing mine. I have one of those very high dollar headphone ones Witcher falling apart three times now these things are amazing the sound quality is phenomenal in my opinion. They are also lightweight and not bulky taking up a lot of room and come with multiple different earbuds sizes I highly recommend them,B01G8JO5F2
Excellent all around. Fit very comfortably. Controls are easy to use. Love that I can walk all over the house without carrying my device with me.,B01G8JO5F2
It stop working after a month of me using it,B01G8JO5F2
"These earphones stick to your ears very well, they are very easy to pair and operate. I use them over my $150 Bose wireless earphones.",B01G8JO5F2
"I have tested the transmission and it does not support 30 feet, even inside my house if I move about 10 feet from my phone, it distorts hearing. I don't know why advertising says it supports 30 feet? That's a big negative point in this device.",B01G8JO5F2
Thank you very much 5*****,B01G8JO5F2
"Made very cheaply, broke after month of using.",B01G8JO5F2
I've bought multiple pairs and left earbud keeps breaking. Last pair I bought lasted 15 days.,B01G8JO5F2
"THESE HEADPHONES WORK VERY WELL.  MOST IMPORTANTLY, THEY FIT IN MY TINY EARS AND THE OVER EAR HOOK BENDS EASILY TO SECURE THEM AS I WEAR THEM FOR EXERCISE",B01G8JO5F2
"This is the second pair I've bought. The first pair I bought a year ago was pretty good, but the battery died recently and wouldn't charge. I liked it the first time...the quality was good for the price. But the second pair I bought, the power button broke after a couple days of gentle use and I could no longer turn it on. So I either acquired superhuman strength over the few days it worked, or the product is very cheap and low quality. Buyer be warned.",B01G8JO5F2
I didn’t like that we had to turn off Bluetooth on 5 other devices but oh well. I love the sound quality. I use them intermittently throughout the day so I never know how much battery life I have left. It usually quits when I’m taking the dog for a walk the next day after I charged them☹️  I’m fairly certain they hadn’t been used for a total of 8 hours but who knows?! I love the freedom they give me to do my activities around the house. I can still listen to my audio books but not be tethered to one spot.,B01G8JO5F2
"I have never left a review for anything that I can remember on Amazon.  I have had these headphones for three years and I use them almost everyday for listening to music, audiobooks, podcast, and talking on the phone.  I have gotten more use for the dollar out of this purchase than any other item I can remember.  They still work as good as new, have great sound quality, and the battery always lasts as long as I need them which is generally a few hours at a time.",B01G8JO5F2
Probably the best headphones you can get for the money. I have no complaints.  I bought a spare set just because.,B01G8JO5F2
best blue tooth head phones for the money... will definitely recommenced them & will buy them again.,B01G8JO5F2
"For the price these wireless headphones are fantastic. I've tried EVERY single brand under $30 and these are the best. You can tell just by feeling these ear buds the quality is much higher then other cheap brands. The sound quality and noise cancelation is also considerably better. I would buy these ear buds before any other brand under $50 no doubt about it. Also BONUS they include a magnetic car vent mounted cell phone holder in the box! Works great! Those sell for $15 alone! Buy these ear buds people, dont waste your money on other brands.",B01G8JO5F2
Sound quality,B01G8JO5F2
I read all the reviews to find some cheap headphones for my brother who is a marathon runner. He has used these for short runs so far but said he is very pleased with them!,B01G8JO5F2
Los auriculares son muy buenos tienen buen sonido la batería dura muchísimo me gusto,B01G8JO5F2
Horrible stopped working in less than a month.,B01G8JO5F2
Wow!! I've had these for a year or two now and I love them so much!! The battery life is outstanding!! I never have to charge them and I use them in the gym all the time! Very pleased with these!,B01G8JO5F2
"Bought these headphones in late November as a Christmas present for my husband. As of March they no longer will charge. I've tried the video tutorial to resolve the issue, multiple chargers and cables and nothing. Their website for product support won't even let me submit a request for repair, warranty, ect. They are cheap for a reason. Do not buy.",B01G8JO5F2
"When using them for phone calls, I frequently get told that I'm too quiet.",B01G8JO5F2
"Use these headphones for long conference calls.  Excellent sound, comfortable over the ear and inner ear earpieces. Just bought another set as a Christmas gift for someone who has trouble keeping earbuds in their ears while exercising. The over the ear earbuds will help.",B01G8JO5F2
"They sound really good but the quality control needs work. These came in with one side having all treble and the other all bass and broke completely within the first week, still needs some work.",B01G8JO5F2
"I still have these earphones after 2 years of use. SENSO brand was on Prime and sponsored/ choice, I paid a bit more for these than identical looking options, but I cannot complain. Some people buy $100 dollar earphones that don't last a year and others $10 ones that don't last a week.  So far, so good. I recommend these for everyday use and I usually charge them after 4-5 hours of continuous use. Great Value and experience with my pair.",B01G8JO5F2
Loved the sound quality.  First pair the charger stopped working after 3 uses.  Bought another pair and same thing happened again.  Very disappointed.,B01G8JO5F2
I was replacing  a pair of Beats that only lasted a few years. Wish I would’ve found these first. Great product and a great price!,B01G8JO5F2
Within the first couples hours of using these the sounds started cutting out and hasn't stopped! Clearly they sent me broken headphones. Really sucks because I was looking forward to these because of the reviews. But I can't even determine if they would have been good.,B01G8JO5F2
I workout in a loud machinery space. It’s loud and hot. Noise and sweat are no issue for these headphones. This is my second pair (first lasted over two years) and I can’t beat their durability for the price.,B01G8JO5F2
"Enjoyed the headphones while they lasted, died within 8 months of light use.",B01G8JO5F2
IT IS VERY GOOD FOR WALKING AT LISTENING TO MUSIC IN MY HOME. THE SOUND IS VERY G00D,B01G8JO5F2
"I had a pair of these that lasted 2 years, then they broke so I bought a pair of them again and I immediately noticed the quality went down and after one charge they wouldn't work at all.",B01G8JO5F2
"These are great for the average music listener or if you're looking for a set you don't mind getting beat up. For me, they're OK on a job site because I don't mind them getting dirty or scratched up. As a minor audiophile, the sound quality isn't there. But that's not why I bought these. Tinny bass, no noise cancellation (they don't claim to have this feature, though), and they like to not stay in place in the ear. But again, buy a high end set if you need better. These are great for what they are. But the battery life, goes a couple days without needing a recharge! These are perfect for my needs.",B01G8JO5F2
"Good sound,nice accessories.",B01G8JO5F2
"Headphones will not synch with several different types of iPhones. Extremely frustrating as this was the main issue. After reviewing with customer support and going back to factory settings, they simply just wouldn’t synch. Phone(s) on my end we’re all up to date. Asked customer service for replacement pair, they refused. Don’t back their product up so I lost $20. Live and learn with cheap pair. Moving on to another company that supports their product.",B01G8JO5F2
"There were some accessories that were supposed to come free with headphones.  One being the magnetic car vent clip that I did not get.  Otherwise, they seem to be working alright.  Haven't had them but a week.",B01G8JO5F2
They are the best,B01G8JO5F2
Great. Easily fits on my ears. Other similar ones didn’t fit well. Happy with it.,B01G8JO5F2
All I can say is wow! These are the best ear buds . Sound quality crisp and clear. And noise cancelling ability is great! I will buy more of these for my family so they can enjoy them.,B01G8JO5F2
🤜🤛,B01G8JO5F2
I know reviews for this product are great but I myself have had many connectivity issues with this product. It is very hard to connect it to multiple devices and there is interference when connected to multiple devices. I did not expect it to have same performance and stability as some of the high end headphones but I think connectivity issues I’m facing are basic Bluetooth 101.<br /><br />It could very well be that I received a defective unit,B01G8JO5F2
"They were very uncomfortable to wear, and I wore them for about 10 minutes. Returning them.",B01G8JO5F2
I've had many sports earphones but this is the best by far. They fit comfortably in my ears and the audio is very clear.,B01G8JO5F2
Great quality and durability. charges fast and stays on.,B01G8JO5F2
"Really dissapointed that these did not last that long. Really wanted to like them ,but now they are just completely dead and won't turn on. So conveniently out of the product support window too. What a shame. Spend your money on something that will actually last.",B01G8JO5F2
"Absolutely amazing for the price I paid.  I got great sound quality, amazing noise cancelation with the wide assortment of buds, and a super long battery life. Mine even came with extra goodies like a stick on credit card holder for a phone, a carrying case, and a magnetic mount for a phone and car. Overall an amazing product for a low price.",B01G8JO5F2
"These are exactly what I hoped they would be. High quality, good for jogging or long commutes. I am really pleased with this product.",B01G8JO5F2
"I have bought about 8 pairs of different t one this brand make all good, but I have baught them for others 3 for myself I work in an industrial  setting and these last about 8 months there, cant get better for the price.",B01G8JO5F2
These are great headphones they are replacement headphones because my dog chewed up my other pair of headphones,B01G8JO5F2
"The earbuds have a tendency of slipping off of my ears, other than that , they work fine.",B01G8JO5F2
I use these daily for walking and meetings at work.  The sound quality is great for music and movies.,B01G8JO5F2
"I got these headphones so that I could listen to zoom meetings while walking around the apt (quarantine reality), but the bluetooth connection is really poor. Walking within the same room it will disconnect and reconnect repeatedly, not to mention the multiple times it did this while I was sitting right in front of my computer! When they work they are good, but the hassle is not worth the money.",B01G8JO5F2
These are great! Not super noise cancelling but perfect for me- and the battery life is awesome,B01G8JO5F2
Great product. Very happy with them.,B01G8JO5F2
Very solid headphones with a comfortable fit.,B01G8JO5F2
"I got these in Feb 2018 and I am still using them almost daily at the gym. These are amazing quality headphones. Don't be fooled by the price I was surprised by the sound quality. I only used Bose products before I got these but these are better than Bose. They hold the charge for almost an entire week. I am surprised with the negative comments about these products. Pairing is easy and range is good. I am not paid to write these reviews these are honest and genuine review, I waited an entire year to write this, buy with full confidence, won't regret it.",B01G8JO5F2
"This was my favorite pair of headphones for a few months. The sound quality is great and so is the volume. The controls on the side are easy to use when exercising. However, one day I plugged them in to charge and they just wouldn't charge. Tried to leave them plugged in overnight and nothing happened. After a few days of trying I just threw them out.",B01G8JO5F2
Great product own 3 sets,B01G8JO5F2
Good product for the price,B01G8JO5F2
"I don't leave many reviews, but I feel compelled to comment on these headphone since I'm so pleasantly surprised at the quality on offer at this price point.  There are a number quite nice headphones at even $30-40, but closer to $20 you're more likely to find tinny, lackluster garbage, especially for wireless headphones.  Though these cannot compete with some of the more expensive wired Shure and Etymotics headphones I own for overall sound quality, they hold their own remarkably well at ~1/5 the price.  Bass is overrepresented, which is not my preference, but what's there is not muddy; rather, it's surprisingly full, and it gives a lot of full sized headphones a run for its money. Sound isolation is moderate; these aren't earplug style headphones and they let in some outside noise, but there is definitely a significant reduction.  I can't verify the advertised battery life, but I get through a full day of heavy use no problem, and the controls are all conveniently located.  I've been using them much more than I initially expected despite owning several more expensive sets of earbuds with objectively better audio quality, as these are good enough for a lot of listening and more convenient.  I'd be happy with them at twice the price; at around twenty bucks they're an absolute steal.",B01G8JO5F2
"These lasted for two years of very light use. The company offered me a 5 percent discount to repurchase them. Why would I want to do that?  They said, these things happen sometimes",B01G8JO5F2
"When these first arrived and I put them on I was disappointed that I was unable to find ANY way to wear them without causing pain inside my right ear. I couldn't understand but assumed that as the right side is the control side it must be slightly different. I understand that I'm incredibly sensitive, but unfortunately that means that a piece of hard plastic pushing into the cartilige inside of my ear ends up being incredibly painful. Still, I tried to ignore this.<br /><br />I was happy when I was able to quickly pair the earbuds with my Samsung Galaxy S7 (shows how cheap I am, but I'm happy for the upgrade from my S5.) I was also happy when I was able to actually answer a call. The sound coming through was unbearably loud, but that's no surprise for me, again Ms. overly sensitive. The frustrating thing was that although I was supposed to be able to adjust the sensitivity so that the next time I answer and make a call it would be quieter, I found that every single time I answered and made calls I had to adjust the volume down once the call was connected.  Not very fun since I pretty much have to have the earbuds in my ears to do this. If I don't, I end up disconnecting the call with the overly sensitive buttons. I was on my way to blowing out my eardrums.<br /><br />Along with my being overly sensitive I am unfortunately extremely quiet. Not so fun for anyone else whom I'm trying to talk to. No matter how high I turned up my phone AND the earbuds, and not to mention put all the energy I had into trying to use my diaphram to control my oxygen and voice level, the person on the other end was always telling me they couldn't hear me. What people WERE able to hear however were any sounds that were around me, such as birds chirping, a slight breeze blowing or water running.<br /><br />These Bluetooth headphones were supposed to allow me to use my phone since I'm unable to hold it up to my head for more than a minute or two due to chronic illness related disability. It's been so difficult searching for a replacement Bluetooth for my previous Plantronic that I got at Costco many years ago. I especially miss the ones which were able to properly do voice-to-text.<br /><br />People don't understand how hard it is for the disabled to be able to acquire products and technology necessary to assist them in their lives while meanwhile people who don't need such things are much more apt to come by these products and technologies. Sorry for the gripe, it was more a reflection that I used to have this on my $30 bluetooth for my Palm phone, but once that sort of thing became mainstream it's all of the sudden $300 and requires a $1,000 phone. Ridiculous what some people will pay money for instead of deciding that's ridiculous.<br /><br />Oh well. I almost forgot the about the case. This headset comes in a semi-hard rounded zippered case. And my dog thinks it's the perfect size to grab and try to get me to chase her around the house for. So at least she likes the case. :) That's all that really matters anyways.",B01G8JO5F2
"These earphones are amazing. Because these are over ear, they stay in when I am running. The sound quality is also very good. I get clear mids and highs and a very rich base. The lows disapper on some songs but that is expected in earphones in this price range. Even at max volumes, the speakers maintain the vocals and there is very less distortion.<br />As for wearing comfort, I love that I can wear them over extended periods without any ear pain and when I don't need, they just hang from my neck, ready to be used when I need it.",B01G8JO5F2
these headphones worked great for 1 month. I can’t get them to charge which will not allow me to pair them or reset them again. This is the second pair that I’ve had the same problem with. Senso replaced the first pair and I was very happy but the exact same thing happens. To bad because I really like everything else about them,B01G8JO5F2
"First pair I got as a gift where great, the second pair I purchased seemed to be built a little cheaper. The only reason I had to buy a replacement was because I lost the original pair. The new pair I bought broke only after a few months. Really disappointed.",B01G8JO5F2
Nice head phones,B01G8JO5F2
"Headphones won't charge after 3-4 months of use. You get what you pay for, I guess.",B01G8JO5F2
"These are horrible for running. No matter which earbud size I used, the right side (with all the controls) would fall out 10+ times on a 20 min run. The piece that goes over the ear is way too tall and not adjustable. It just bounced against my head constantly. And if you go to adjust the earbuds as they are constantly falling out, it was impossible to do so without pausing/adjusting the sound. Don’t buy this if you are looking for something for running.",B01G8JO5F2
"Husband loves these when he goes to the gym, but if it's busy he starts getting interference.",B01G8JO5F2
I am using it for over year now without any issue - worth for price. Charging retention is great for this product.,B01G8JO5F2
I'm very had happy with quality of the product and how it performs. Very clear.,B01G8JO5F2
"I use them to lift weights, they're great on the bench because they don't fall out. I also do running plyometric workouts and they stay in place. They're great!",B01G8JO5F2
This is the best pair of bluetooth I have had. It conforms to my ears making workouts wearing it less distracting (for always having to readjust). Very good sound quality and a southern accent for voice cues :),B01G8JO5F2
Good quality,B01G8JO5F2
I love the sound... they could stay in ears a little better though,B01G8JO5F2
"I got this for use during my gym workouts and outdoor runs. Worked good for about 2 months, then I noticed spotty connectivity issues when playing music. It would skip beats in even slow playing music quite frequently. Since then it has been consistently getting worse. Now even while walking normally with the phone in my pant's pocket, the connectivity is very poor. The sound would skip for about half a second every now and then. I have tested this with multiple devices and it is the same. Would not recommend this product to a friend. I guess that is why it was so cheap.",B01G8JO5F2
Keeps falling out. Wire at the back keeps sticking to the skin on the neck which pulls it out.,B01G8JO5F2
Excellent during my walks for weight loss and exercise. I can listen and keep my hands free.,B01G8JO5F2
"I like, but anatomically didn't get my expectation.",B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these for running and cycling. They worked great and endured 5 months of heavy use (i.e. sweat) without showing any signs of damage. I felt pretty confident in their durability, and since they're rated IPX7 waterproof, meaning they should withstand submersion in up to 1 meter of water for up to 30 minutes, I didn't think there would be any issue with me using them while I swam laps. I was wrong. I swam one lap with these in my ears, and they malfunctioned almost immediately. I couldn't get them to turn on after that, which was disappointing.<br /><br />Fortunately, the seller stands by the 1 year warranty. I contacted customer support and they were very kind and helpful and agreed to send me a replacement. They also told me that even though the headphones are IPX7 rated, they don't recommend using them while swimming or submerging them in water. Doesn't really make sense to me how these are certified as waterproof but can't be put in water, but I'm glad I learned that lesson before my warranty ran out.",B01G8JO5F2
"I've been using these for...almost a year now? Overall, I'm satisfied with these headphones, and they're good for the price. I usually prefer wired headphones, but I wanted wireless ones for the gym, and these do the trick. I'm not much of an audiophile, and am not too picky about the sound, so to me these sound fine. But, I don't think they sound as good as the headphones that come with your iPhone (my only point of reference--I don't invest in anything more expensive). Side note: the phone car mount that these come with is awesome. I didn't realize it would come in the package, so that was a nice surprise. It's magnetic, simple, low profile....I would give it 5 stars, but that's not what this review is for.<br /><br />There are 3 kind of annoying things about these, which aren't a huge deal considering the price....but they are worth mentioning:<br /><br />First, the charging port is super tricky to access. The little piece of rubber that covers it is really hard to get off, even with longer nails. It also can get in the way of charging if you aren't careful. I once left these plugged in for a few hours to charge, only to find out that the rubber cover was ever-so-slightly blocking the port, and they ended up not charging whatsoever. I ripped the cover off after that.<br /><br />Second, when they start to run low on battery, you only have a very short amount of warning time before they die. You'll hear them say ""battery low,"" and at that point you have maybe 20 minutes before they die. Before that point, it's pretty much impossible to know exactly how much juice they have left, so it's hard to prepare for unless you're really good about charging them frequently. Another warning sign that I've noticed is that they tend to get quieter when they get low on power. I find myself cranking up the volume just before they die, and then after they've had a chance to fully charge I'll notice that they sound much louder, and I have to turn it back down again. Maybe this is true for all bluetooth headphones, I'm not sure, but it is kind of annoying.<br /><br />Finally, they just don't fit my ears well, and I constantly have to readjust them. Yes, they come with different sized cushions, but it doesn't make a huge difference for me. I have always had a problem with this style of headphones (ones that go in your ear canal) not fitting properly, and these are no exception. It's kind of a personal problem, but if you're like me and struggle with this style, you will likely still struggle with this pair. But, I ordered these knowing that this would be a problem, so it's not really fair to judge them based on my ear anatomy.<br /><br />All in all, they get the job done, and are a good deal considering how insanely expensive wireless headphones are. Even though I spent a bunch of time talking about the flaws of these headphones, those really are just minor annoyances, and I plan to keep using these until they break or I lose them. As long as you aren't expecting perfection, you'll be happy with these.",B01G8JO5F2
"Worked great for 16 months, unable to stay connected for more than a minute before it turned itself off, without saying ""powering off"". One week later, unable to power on.",B01G8JO5F2
"This headphone set was easy to pair with the my phone and simple to operate. Handling the few buttons seemed confusing at first, but once long-press for on and off was established, taking calls, muting/pausing, and volume control was intuitive. The built-in voice that indicates on, off, etc., is appreciated. Seems to have a range of 15 to 20 from its source before losing contact.<br /><br />After switching the ear pieces to one of the supplied pair that fits me, the SENSO had no problem staying ""plugged into"" my head.<br /><br />Reviewing before a mirror, the SENSO looks chunky/blocky on my head. Most certainly not elegant compared to higher-end models. Nonetheless, works and performs well.",B01G8JO5F2
This was purchased as a gift the receiver says it works fine.  I would recommend someone trying it,B01G8JO5F2
"This is the FOURTH pair of these headphones I've had, and the company has changed things - not for the better. First, on a weird ""why did they do that?"" point, the feedback voice, which had a slightly British female voice, is now an Asian woman's voice. Have no idea why they changed it. Second, the Bluetooth range is less than before. With older pairs I could walk down the hall and still be connected. Here, if I go into the next room the headphones start cutting out. Third, audio feedback is gone. Previously you would get a tone when lowering the volume one click before the volume hit zero. Now there's no tone so when lowering volume you aren't sure if there's just been a pause/silence in your program or whether you lowered the volume all the way to zero. My last two pairs also had the left ear headphone stop working after awhile - obviously from wire connections from the right ear where the electronics mostly are. Overall I don't think I'll get another pair of these,<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW ON FIRST PAIR: I switched to these after the THIRD pair of Trelab headphones I had gave up the cost. While not as light, the battery life is better and they've worked perfectly . I use them for walking, working out, around the office and at home daily.  When I had a problem with the volume switch getting stuck (so that you couldn't increase the volume on the headsets without using the phone app) Senso support quickly replaced the headphone under warranty without issue.",B01G8JO5F2
"They are generally great, though they require more finesse with positioning than I imagined. The left bud falls off my ear more frequently than I would like.",B01G8JO5F2
So far I am pleasantly pleased with my purchase of the senso wireless headset.  The true test came when talking to my wife while I was driving in miata and she thought I was in my company car.,B01G8JO5F2
"I’ve had these for 2 years now purchased on nov 21,2016 and they still work amazing and battery life is around 7 hrs still even 2 years later of almost daily use. Including the gym and regular use for music and videos and tv shows. Most headphones battery life diminish to really low after a while. I highly recommend this headphones",B01G8JO5F2
Actually works well for its price point. Has more bass than balanced sound. I use it for outdoors and I sweat a lot and so far so good. One thing I found however being bluetooth is that it does have interference and cuts out when I'm using a weed whacker (weed trimmer).,B01G8JO5F2
Buenísimos,B01G8JO5F2
Me agrada la duración de batería y la calidad del equipo.,B01G8JO5F2
"Very good product for this price, sound is clear and loud, easy connectivity, battery life as described.",B01G8JO5F2
Every thing sounds very nice,B01G8JO5F2
"NOTE: I clicked on the old order and it linked me to this product. So I purchased presuming the products were the same.<br /><br />I bought these headphones in May 22 of this year. I chose to get these due to my VERY GOOD experience with these headphones back in 2017. These were purchased to replace the ones I had from 2017 since those were starting to wear out with exposed wire and etc. Where as the 2017 version would easily get 5 stars, this time these do not.<br /><br />Comparing the two, my main issue is that the ear hooks in the 2019 version that I received has a wire frame that you can use to adjust to your ear and etc. Like inside feels like you're bending a worn out paper clip that you've been bending back and forth or some wire frame. This sounds like a good idea, but it's one of those good thought but very bad execution. The problem is when you're moving or talking or doing anything, it moves the ear hooks and it cause the suction of the buds to come out. Making it feel like it's not fully in your ear or stays there uneven. For headphones that are designed for physical activity, it's perplexing why they would design the hooks to have that flimsy wire instead of plastic that's one size fit all like in the past.<br /><br />The price changed too, but I thought it was just due to the 2 year time between my last purchase and this current one.  At the time of purchase in 2017 it was about 10-12$ more to the current price (29.99 instead of 19.99 or so and factoring any tax and shipping).<br /><br />Overall the quality of this current product should be considered, and ultimately I do not recommend it. I hope they go back to how they manufactured these like in 2017. I'd pay more, for better quality.",B01G8JO5F2
"I have owned both the 250 and 255 models.  If your into more crisp mids and highs, go with the 255's.  If you like a little more richer bass, the 250's are you ticket.  They are both amazing pieces, would and will buy again.  A pair of mine got sent through the washer and have stopped working.  I work all day so having two pair, one on the charger is really nice.  Always switching between the two models I have developed an ear to see their difference.  If I had to choose I would find a 250 over the 255.  If you scroll down after all the pictures it will say whether you are looking at the 250 or 255.",B01G8JO5F2
I love the range they have when working around the house. Great clarity.,B01G8JO5F2
Bass,B01G8JO5F2
Terrible sound quality. Pure garbage.,B01G8JO5F2
"When I initially purchased the head phones I misread the description and assumed they where fully waterproof headphones that I can use for the pool. I figured because of the great value the quality of the sound would be decreased but I was shocked in how great they sounded. After taking them into the pool I realized they weren't meant for it and assumed I had damaged them. Fortunately, after they dried the sound quality stayed great.",B01G8JO5F2
These things are pretty amazing!!! And for the money you can’t beat them.. I bought 2 pairs just to have a spare that’s how much I like them.,B01G8JO5F2
The problem with these is not that I can’t hear with them but those I’m talking to said it’s too much noise in the background,B01G8JO5F2
"Great, inexpensive.  Gets the job done while I am running.",B01G8JO5F2
I love these headphones. Second one I've bought. This one was for my wife. My wife uses this on an exercise machine while watching a TV which is connected to a bluetooth transmitter. I don't have to listen to her listening to TV.,B01G8JO5F2
Very sturdy. A little clunky. But they work great.,B01G8JO5F2
"Sound is great and stays in place, also includes different size ear pieces. Really like it. Excellent for the gym.",B01G8JO5F2
Works great!!,B01G8JO5F2
These head phones pause when I'm walking let alone running. I have another set of Skull Candy wireless that rarely skips.<br /><br />It is a real problem. Buy better quality headphones.,B01G8JO5F2
Manufactured poorly,B01G8JO5F2
They are comfortable in my ear canal.  The cord does not bother me when I run.  They are very stylish and I get lots of comments from people especially hot girls.,B01G8JO5F2
"I've been using the headphones for a few days now, and I've really enjoyed them. They are easy to connect to your different devices (so far I'm at 3 different ones that I've connected to), and they are comfortable to wear. They also come with several accessories, including three different eartip sizes, two wire ties, a carry case, a charging cable, a cellphone card wallet, and a cellphone car mount. It's a lot of value at a very reasonable price!",B01G8JO5F2
These headphones are really nice. They have a good sound quality and are easy to recharge and sync with bluetooth. They work really well at the gym and stay in place during workouts.,B01G8JO5F2
Work great!,B01G8JO5F2
"Easy to set up with my IPhone 7. The comfortable, the around-the-ear holder easily re-shapes to fit your ear. The sound is very good. At a price of $19.95 these headphone are a steal. I am extremely happy with this purchase.",B01G8JO5F2
Good sound quality. Works with my iPhone. I like that there are different size of ear buds available.,B01G8JO5F2
"Bad aftermarket service. If you lost charging cable, you would not be able to buy or get a replacement from seller, which means you would not be able to use your earphones. It is a waste of money. And also, the quality is not good, because it sounds discontinuous. The battery is not good either and it can only be used less than 2 hours.",B01G8JO5F2
"They last 4 months on my 3rd pair, very very disappointed.",B01G8JO5F2
I love them..fast shipping.,B01G8JO5F2
I like my new Bluetooth earphones I just wish that they did my earlobes better.,B01G8JO5F2
Been a fantastic shower listening option. My first pair did stop working at about five months it daily usage but their customer support was the best I've ever worked with and they are sending a replacement set. Definitively recommend for the cost.,B01G8JO5F2
"CONTEXT<br />I think we all know how crappy corded earphones are! Especially for me, because I go running with my dog, they get in my way and sometimes even tangled! I ended up seeing these on a Buzzfeed article and thought why not purchase them? The price was right, after all.<br /><br />PROS<br />- These are very easy to use, just make sure you read the manual first, LOL.<br />- The sound quality on these is actually pretty amazing.<br />- Noise cancellation on these puppies is real! I can usually her cars approaching with different earbuds, but not these.<br />- Obviously, huge pro that they are cordless!<br />- They come with a handful of different ear bud thingies (LOL, not sure what it's called). This was a huge plus for me, because I could choose the ones that fit my ears best.<br />- The part that goes around the ear is adjustable!<br /><br />CONS<br />- While the part going around your ear being adjustable is a pro, it is also a con in that my ears are probably on the smaller side since I am petite. Because of this, I don't get a good fit and they often fall off my ear. :( This is a huge con for me, since I am having to adjust them on runs and sometimes, they even fall off! Super annoying.<br /><br />OVERALL<br />I do like these and think that they work great. However, for anyone who is petite and considering this, maybe look into a different set.",B01G8JO5F2
Excellent battery life,B01G8JO5F2
My wife has struggled with ear buds but these seem to be working great for her.  They were easy to set up.,B01G8JO5F2
"Decent sound quality, but they stay in.",B01G8JO5F2
Good,B01G8JO5F2
My daughter is happy with them,B01G8JO5F2
I needed earphones for daily use in the gym/running. I liked the price and i knew i wasn't going to get great sound quality. It was fine for my purposes while it lasted. About a year and half after i purchased it it started giving me problems. The left earbud started crackling and a few months later it completely died.,B01G8JO5F2
"This has a high quality sound, but doesn't seem to last very long.  This is my second pair,  this pair lasted from june till now.  Left side has totally gone out.  Previous pair the wire over the ear broke off.  Called customer service and they sent me a new pair.  Will follow up when they arrive.",B01G8JO5F2

Won't fit under my ski helmet (mine anyway),B01G8JO5F2
"I was really surprised by the quality of the sound and battery life.<br />this thing has amazing sound, better than a lot of leading brand products, would definitely recommend to anyone, don't waste your money on more expensive, less value earphones.",B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these a couple of years ago and they were decent headphones for a short jog or to listen to podcasts while working around the house. They stopped taking a charge so I bought new ones. New ones are much worse. Maybe they changed the manufacturer? Worse sound quality, terrible balance, shorter bluetooth range, and the plastic feels chintzier.",B01G8JO5F2
"Ordered wrong product and they worked with me to get the right one. Fast, friendly, and courteous! Thank you!<br />Product is great for the price!",B01G8JO5F2
"Amazing sound quality, amazing sound canceling, and comfortable. Huh? Sorry I couldn't hear you.",B01G8JO5F2
This is my second pair. Battery lasted through a marathon. I ran in all kinds of weather including rain with the first pair and they lasted for maybe 4 years before the one side shorted out.,B01G8JO5F2
"Used everyday at work,battery lasted almost 16 hours. Has fare sound. The main problem is it will start disconnecting from the phone even when it is just in my pocket.  That happens for about a week then it won't charge ( no light and no charge) basically just dead. Bought the first one  it lasted  11 months, second one  9 months.",B01G8JO5F2
I like them I would only say I’ve owned three sets and they only last around 6 months,B01G8JO5F2
great sound and Bluetooth connectivity,B01G8JO5F2
"The product works great until it stopped working less than a year later. I am not sure what happened and suspect the inside mechanical structures broke. Overall, it works well and stays on your ears when you run and gym!",B01G8JO5F2
"Bought a pair and liked them so much I got some for my 10 year old son.  Only pair he’s managed to keep and not lose/destroy.  And he likes them too, imagine that!  They also come with some cool accessories bundled in.",B01G8JO5F2
"I use them to listen to music at work. We also have a loud night bell going off anytime someone is in the call queue. The outside noise cancelling isn't the best i've used before, but's it's definitely solid performance. A full charge from dead takes maybe 90 minutes. A full charge on average for me last about 8-10 hours, assuming the range is just based on difference in volume and stuff. The sound quality is pretty good as well, definitely starts getting kind of muddy at really loud levels, but at the level it loses sound quality it's too loud for comfort so it's a non-issue. I'd say they are good not great, but for the price they are well worth the money. This is the first pair of wireless headphones i have used with my phone, so i don't have a good comparison for the range from the phone while staying connected. These did pass my expectations though.",B01G8JO5F2
"Sent back, too flexible ear hooks.",B01G8JO5F2
Seem to only get about 9-11 months of use before needing to replace (based on the two pairs I purchased on 6/2017 and 3/2018),B01G8JO5F2
Take a long time to recharge. Get tangled in hair.,B01G8JO5F2
For the price these are great quality. Bought them for my spouse in 2018 and they still work great! I ended up buying a second pare to give to a sibling.,B01G8JO5F2
I needed some Bluetooth earphones and these were a good choice. I have not had problems with them and I like the design and look of them. They connect fine with my laptop and phone.,B01G8JO5F2
"Fit is great, sound quality is so-so.",B01G8JO5F2
I had one before and lost it. I ordered this one but it does not function like the other one. It's the same unit and the right ear bud has very low volume. It announces the number that's calling but at a very slow pace making me feel like the call would have stopped by the time I hear the number. My other unit was immediate. I don't know if this is a defect or not but I have had my other one to compare this one to. I would appreciate any feed back and solution to correct the issues that I have.,B01G8JO5F2
Great product. Like these better than my AirPods and a fraction of the price. These are my 2nd pair (jumped into pool with first pair) and have also bought a set for my daughter. Highly recommend.,B01G8JO5F2
I use this earphone almost everyday and never gave me any issue,B01G8JO5F2
The ad said waterproof and not sweatproof. I bought so I can use in pool for surface swimming. First time using the headphones shut down and would not turn back on.,B01G8JO5F2
"Battery lasts a long time./Noise Cancelling is great. I've fallen asleep with them on using private listening w/ my Roku TV to block out my husbands snoring, which works great. I still have more than 50% battery life the next morning. This is my second pair only because I couldn't find my last pair. But now I have two, one for workouts and one for private listening. EarPods without a wire always fall out of my ears so these work great if you ever have that issue. Also, I love the cute carrying was which has enough space for the usb charger. Great buy",B01G8JO5F2
I got these headphones because of other reviews and they have lived up to the hype.,B01G8JO5F2
These head phones are comfortable and are easily workable for when I do my running routine in the mornings during the week. They have great volume and don't fall out of my ears.,B01G8JO5F2
"I got one and it was supposed to be IPX7 but it is NOT. You should be able to wear it while in the shower but you CAN'T. To make matters worse, water barely even got on it while in the shower and it still broke. So I got me a new one and I was supposed to send the broken one back, well when I got the new one IT WAS ALSO BROKEN. Just broke after a few weeks of use and I didnt even put water on it. This is the worse headphones I have ever bought. STAY AWAY. I was working a lot at the time and I didn't have time to return them so I was charged for 2 broken headphones.  The same might happen to you.",B01G8JO5F2
Didn't have these long before the inner ear bud completely came off and was hanging on by the wires. Actually would get stuck in my ear. Save your money and buy something else.,B01G8JO5F2
"I’m now on my third pair. - I use these all day long, from my long daily bike rides to my long walks to around the house when I don’t want to disturb my housemate.  They hold up to abuse — sweat, rain, whatever. And the controls are intuitive. I see people with expensive earbuds and such and I just don’t get it.  I find the wire is an advantage - it’s not in the way and it allows me to keep them together to prevent loss and to pull them off and keep them around my neck without fear of loss.  Still don’t get why people pay a fortune for those other silly things.",B01G8JO5F2
Very comfortable and great sound. Excellent for work outs.,B01G8JO5F2
Not good returned,B01G8JO5F2
Pleased with both seller and product.  Teen says they work great!,B01G8JO5F2
Bought these headphones is 2017 (looking for a beats dupe) and they're still in tip top shape today. The music sound quality is phenomenal for a $30 pair of headphones. I use them to workout/run with all the time. I own a pair of the bulky beats solo 3 and prefer the senso because it's much more lightweight. Highly recommend this product for any broke student in need of a pair of long lasting headphones.,B01G8JO5F2
Easy to pair with device.  Noise cancelling not as good as expected on airplane. Seems well made.,B01G8JO5F2
Great Product,B01G8JO5F2
Bought for my Girl Friend to wear while mowing grass etc... So far she is very happy with the fit and sound quality.,B01G8JO5F2
It is the second time that I order these headphones I use them for the gym and run and I am pleased with their quality and resistance.,B01G8JO5F2
"This is my third set.  They connect to Bluetooth easily, sound great & are not too expensive.  My only complaint with this set is that they’re not as comfortable as my other sets.",B01G8JO5F2
Wires started falling out of the ear piece after 2 uses.,B01G8JO5F2
Fit well and comfortable.  Easy to set up and use.  Very good sound.,B01G8JO5F2
Amazing sound.  We bought 3 for Christmas and everyone loves them.,B01G8JO5F2
For 30 bucks you cant beat this,B01G8JO5F2
Good quality for the price,B01G8JO5F2
Would want to buy this product over and over again,B01G8JO5F2
This headphone will keep the connection with your phone unless:<br />- You run too fast<br />- You run too slow<br />- You walk<br />- You walk between buildings<br />- A truck passes near you<br />- You put the cell phone in your short left pocket<br />- Also in your right pocket<br />- You breath,B01G8JO5F2
"Very good quality sound.  Very comfortable wear.  Stays on ears l!  Good bang for your buck, but be sure to purchase the warranty.  They normally wear out with the first year!",B01G8JO5F2
The sound is great but my problem is that I have small ears so the hook just sticks out over my ear more than it should.  I've tried to adjust it bu pulling and bending the hook in hopes it would fit my ear.  No luck. It's very inconvenient that the hook does not fit my ears and it's not adjustable.,B01G8JO5F2
"Love this product, this is my second set of these exact headphones!",B01G8JO5F2
Nice sound long lasting,B01G8JO5F2
good for the money,B01G8JO5F2
"I am writing this hoping that the Senso people read it and know how bad and shady their customer service is. The headphones themselves are actually great, they work very well for the price, fit in the ear well, come with bunch of extra stuff. I am a fan of the headphones themselves. However, being that they're 30 bucks, they're not invincible. Mine stopped working properly after about 11 months of use. I though ""oh great there is a 1 year warranty on them, I should be fine"" I filed a warranty claim with Senso and got an email response quickly asking for my amazon order number so they could verify the purchase, I responded and gave it to them as instructed. After that I heard NOTHING. After multiple follow up emails requesting help I still have not received a response telling me what I am supposed to do to finalize the claim. Because of their lack of response, I am now past the 1 year warranty and am stuck with broken headphones. Senso conveniently just stopped responding to me when they saw that my headphones were almost a year old. SHADY.... SHAAAAAAADY! Good headphones but bad support.",B01G8JO5F2
Have used for a year work great,B01G8JO5F2
"Great headphones! Just a word of advice though, they can cause ear problems (infections) if worn for longer periods of time.",B01G8JO5F2
I really like the SENSO Bluetooth headphones. I bought a pair on Amazon Prime Day two years ago and was very pleased with the quality an price. My family was so jealous of them that I decided to get them all a pair for Christmas. I bought four for Christmas two years ago and I just got my 11 years old grandson a pair for his Easter basket. Everyone is very happy with the headphones.,B01G8JO5F2
"Absolutely amazing product, great headset and comes with several other products too. I'm impressed, I will definitely be buying from them again. Thank you.",B01G8JO5F2
"Got more bang for the buck with these ear buds, can't say enough good about them",B01G8JO5F2
Still working per a year later,B01G8JO5F2
Well first to say why did u guys send me this small package in this big box. Now I like the product sound quality is excellent an it's an easy to use item,B01G8JO5F2
The hooks are way bigger tham my ears,B01G8JO5F2
I bought these after I lost my power beats . I've had 3 sets odd the powerbeats and loved them however they're 199.00. Didn't want to spend that again sip I tried these.  So far I live them ( only day 2) but sound and battery life do fast are great,B01G8JO5F2
These sound great even while I'm mowing my lawn.,B01G8JO5F2
These are amazing ear buds. The sound quality is amazing and they fit very comfortable. I had one pair that stopped working on the right side. The manufacturer sent me a replacement set with out any questions. They were great!!!,B01G8JO5F2
"I loved these wireless earbuds. Sound quality was good and the battery lasted a while, imo.  However, I've only had these 2 months and they have stopped charging?!?!?! Can anyone help with this??",B01G8JO5F2
Headphones worked one time for 30 mins. Will charge and light shows that it charges and receives full charge. However they will not turn on. Disappointing waste of money.,B01G8JO5F2
"I liked everything about these, with the exception of the part which fits over the ear. It's uncomfortable and doesn't stay hooked on the ear, allowing the buds to come out. Otherwise, the quality of them is very good.  I hated to give it a 3 rating, but if they don't stay in your ear. . .",B01G8JO5F2
"Love these! They work great, actually stay in my ears, and the sound quality is superb!",B01G8JO5F2
I bought them to do Jogging and works great.,B01G8JO5F2
Great sound and the battery lasts all day.  The only drawback is the earbuds slip out of my ears quite a bit.,B01G8JO5F2
"I really like these.  Easy to pair on bluetooth, very good sound quality.  A charge lasts several hours.",B01G8JO5F2
I love these headphones. They are very comfortable and the sound is perfect.,B01G8JO5F2
Stopped working after 4 months of infrequent use.,B01G8JO5F2
Works better than my Beats and allows me to fast-forward and rewind!,B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these in March and they will no longer recharge. Evidently the return window closed in 1 month, and the product support window closed in 3 months. So... after 5 months, I have to throw these away and purchase a new pair. I will no longer purchase Senso, however, so please LMK if there's a brand you would recommend.",B01G8JO5F2
"These earbuds are terrific! Comfortable and the sound quality is amazing. My ears are too small to accommodate regular hard earbuds and would not stay in short of using glue or tape- neither which would be recommended by any physician. I love them, thank you!",B01G8JO5F2
"Easy to set up, easy to use.  Adjustable hooks keep. buds comfortably in ears.  Handy tough carrying case.",B01G8JO5F2
I love the noise-canceling effect; they are way better than the headset that has been using. The earphones are also light for running and PERFECT for walking. The only downfall is that they look big on my ears,B01G8JO5F2
"I used them for a couple weeks okay, but then they just stopped holding a charge.<br /><br />And heck if I know what they are talking about when their directions say ""multi-function button"" in instructions, there are only two buttons I can find, up and down volume.",B01G8JO5F2
as advertised,B01G8JO5F2
I have used this product for almost two years. I'm really happy with the head phones.,B01G8JO5F2
I use them when I go walking and also while I am working around the house.  They sound great and stay in place! The on/off and volume keys are easy to use.  I absolutely LOVE them.  I will totally buy them again.,B01G8JO5F2
Overall a great cheap set of headphones. Only problem i have is they aren't super comfortable in your ears.,B01G8JO5F2
Died after 5 uses. I swear a lot.,B01G8JO5F2
Good for the price. Fit my ears nicely. Bass distortion at higher volume levels. No issues otherwise. Solid 5/7,B01G8JO5F2
I received Bluetooth as promised. I love the product. Only complaint is that it took a while to oairbti mt phone and I’m still working on fitting it to my ears. It’s a little big but I can work with it. Sound quality is great. I have not experienced the noise canceling or the gym as yet. So far I love it and all the little accessories that came with it.,B01G8JO5F2
Poor sound and connectivity. Sound tears.,B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these at the end of February 2019 and they worked great until now, 11 months later. I’ve noticed the Bluetooth range has become much shorter and it will start to cut out at about 15 ft away. The battery used to last a weeks worth of workouts or so and now it’s one workout. Twice this week I’ve gotten to the gym and they’ve been dead when usually I could charge them on Sunday and make it through at least four 1-1.5 hour workouts before it started saying battery low.  Now they just don’t turn on.",B01G8JO5F2
"These earphones rock! (literally) - water resistant, noise cancelling, and they stay in your ears during vigorous work-outs. GREAT PRICE! Already ordered another set for my wife A+++++++++",B01G8JO5F2
They worked fine until they didn’t. A few days ago they simply would not power on despite being charged. I have tried every sequence of button pushing and holding I’ve read to try and nothing. Way too much money to have them puke and die this soon.,B01G8JO5F2
I purchased these head phones in may and they just stopped working out of no where i  wouldn't recommend anyone to purchase these headphones,B01G8JO5F2
"These headphones WILL break. And when they do break, Senso will send you another broken pair.<br /><br />My initial headphones set lasted 8 months until the headset stopped charging. I called the office and received a new pair but this time the pair didn’t last longer than three months. It’s cheap so do not expect anything that’ll last long. My advice, keep your money for a nice pair or know you’ll only get a few months out of them.",B01G8JO5F2
Love these headphones when working out. The sound is amazing. They keep a charge. And they stay put during a workout.,B01G8JO5F2
great pair!,B01G8JO5F2
I noticed there was an issue when the music sounded distorted at a low volume. Who ever tuned these earbuds cranked the bass to 11 without regard to how distorted it would make the music. I picked these up hoping I could use them for working out but can’t hear the music through the distortion caused by the poor tuning. Even EQing my phone didn’t help with the distortion problem. This purchase was a waste of money.,B01G8JO5F2
Bought them as a gift for my Dad to wear in his shop.  He loves them!  I am going to buy a pair for myself now also.,B01G8JO5F2
"Outstanding Value!  Highly recommend!  Great Price and Sound Quality. Docked it a star because the previous version I had was ""beefier"" and better built. The current version is plastic""",B01G8JO5F2
stopped working but they send a replacement with no problem.,B01G8JO5F2
"Works like new after over a year of moderate usage! Battery life has held and water resistant features tested and passed many times over.<br />--Update--<br />After 2 years, they've finally died on me...battery no longer charges. I used to rotate them with another pair but for the the last 6 months or so they were used exclusively daily. Still very much impressed, just ordered a new pair!",B01G8JO5F2
"These headphones are a must-have in your arsenal of workout gear.  They stay on, the sound is crisp, and the battery power is long.",B01G8JO5F2
So far it works great.,B01G8JO5F2
"GREAT and AFFORDABLE  for working out<br /><br />Good in sound, needs more base. Also the ear bud could be more comfortable but maybe it's my ears so I dont know about that.<br /><br />Overall great product for the price",B01G8JO5F2
I enjoy mine. Wear them on the local bike trails. Work great and easy on the wallet,B01G8JO5F2
"Pro: The earbuds sounds good and has a pretty good battery life.<br />Con: bulky, ugly, tends to slip out of ear during intensive workout or run. No noise cancellation at all. &lt;==False claim there.",B01G8JO5F2
"A little difficult to figure out at first ""mostly my fault"", these work great. I really sweat when working out and I have blown out headphones constantly from sweat. No issue yet with these headphones, good sound, good range from BT. I highly recommend these!",B01G8JO5F2
This is a great product,B01G8JO5F2
"I was ruining my bluetooth Bose headphones at the gym.  The ear pads were getting funky from all the sweat.  I knew I had to find something to replace them and I wanted bluetooth earbuds; no more funky, sweaty ear pads.  I took a deep breath and ordered these.  I thought, ""Well, they're not terribly expensive, so what have I got to lose?""  What a great find!  I'm used to the sound quality of the Bose and I gotta tell you, the sound on these little babies is pretty darn good!!  Okay, so what about distance?  Can I put my phone in the cubby and still receive a signal on the other side of the gym?  Yep, Sure can!  What about the battery?  Honestly, I only use them at the gym .. max. time 90 minutes.  When I get home, I pop them on the charger for about 30 minutes or so and I've never had a problem.  What about the cord?  This is where I was concerned.  I have waist length hair and was afraid the cord would get tangled up in my hair.  Nope, not a problem.  I'm pleasantly surprised and happy with my purchase.",B01G8JO5F2
"The charger was broken after few weeks, sound started become lower and lower, now I am suffering and I can barely use it because of its sound quality, it's buds are easily taken of whenever you put it in your pocket or even if you keep it around your neck so I had to look for it three or four times a day. The customer service is horrible, when I complained about sound quality they sent me a message on how to reset the headphone, I tried resetting it and nothing changed, they stopped to response to me hoping after few days I will be passing one year of purchase date.",B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these hoping I could use them in the gym. I have small ears and even with the smallest ear caps, they do not stay in my ears securely. I'll be searching for another pair.",B01G8JO5F2
"Lost first two pairs, but happy with them, so replaced them with same. Unfortunately, both new pairs have bent wiring that never relaxes and is permanently kinked in a weird placement that pulls one side of the earphones away from the other ear. Also, neither pairs are as comfortable in the ear this go-round. It's not about the size of the bud, but more its shape, it seems, compared to the original pairs.",B01G8JO5F2
"I've had these headphones for more than a year now. I use them extensively because I spent $30 on them and I want my money's worth out of it. They're also my only wireless headphones. Anyways, on to the review.<br />Running with these headphones are uncomfortable because the buds slide out of the ear despite the device being wrapped around the outside of the ear. When running, wind noise is a HUGE problem and drowns out the music. I have not found a way to fix this -- different sized buds do not help. I did not expect it to be noise cancelling, but it is not noise reducing at all. As for the sound quality, it is garbage. It is muffled and the bass and treble I feel are what I expect $10 headphones would be. It connects to Bluetooth pretty easily, but sound cuts in and out at random times making me stop my workout to fix it. I personally do not think this device is worth the money, nor would I gift it to others. I'll be using this until it breaks or I can't bear the poor sound quality.",B01G8JO5F2
"well i had these for a few days and already only one ear bud works the left, the right i hear nothing",B01G8JO5F2
"The product works well for a little a few months, but eventually gives out. If you are having trouble with it not charging, plug it into a charger and hold the power button down for 5-7 seconds. That worked once to revive it, but not a second time. Know you are getting a product that will not last longer than a year.",B01G8JO5F2
"Nice sound.  I like the various sizes of buds included.  Wish the piece that goes around the outer ear was adjustable.  It’s only a piece of flexible rubber, so it doesn’t provide much security if the ear bud loosens from the canal.",B01G8JO5F2
"I purchased these off of the Amazon recommendation, and I should have read more reviews.  My ears are small and these are just too big.  Even after putting in the smallest ear bud, they don't fit well in my ear, the ear loops are way too big and therefore useless, and they are heavy and keep falling out of place.  As a female, with apparently small ears, I just cannot recommend these.",B01G8JO5F2
"Pretty good deal, value",B01G8JO5F2
"They do hurt my ear a bit, but they are well priced, super durable and bluetooth! Can't ask for more!",B01G8JO5F2
Not the best I’ve had but for the money it is I love them for what you pay,B01G8JO5F2
"Disappointed. Uncomfortable, tinny sound.",B01G8JO5F2
I bought these in 2017.<br />I used them in the gym all the time and im a gym rat. I go 5-6 days a week up to 2 hours at a time.<br />I can tell you right now these are better than your $200 fashion status Dre Beats or your Blows i mean Bose headphones.,B01G8JO5F2
"Good quality, comfortable and decent price.",B01G8JO5F2
"Here’s what I can tell you: I’m what my friends and family consider a gym rat, and I love to run. I’ve had multiple headphones, ear buds, Bluetooth things, etc, but this is the only brand I’ve ordered multiple of. The last pair I lost during a 12 hour commute home (they fell out of my bag somewhere) and I cried. Literally. I was exhausted and delirious, but I still cried.<br /><br />It comes with all the components to make Bluetooth earbuds worth it. Multiple types of squishy things? Got it. Charger? Got it! Container to keep them safe (which I clearly forgot to use)? Got it. It even comes with a sleeve you can adhesively add to the back of you phone case, and it works WONDERFULLY. I’ve always been in love with this brand and it comes so highly recommended. Will it stop when you take them out of your ears? No. But they will withstand all the sweat, the tears, the anxiety, anger, and everything else you throw at them that other brands can’t. You won’t be disappointed.<br /><br />Also, I have a long term dating relationship with an audio engineer who says that they’re not bad for their sound quality either. “Great for a bargain” were among the phrases used.",B01G8JO5F2
"I've had 2 pairs of these now for a couple of years and I recommend them to friends.  I wouldn't say they are great sound quality but they are certainly good enough for me.  Some people complain about the microphone but all in all I think it is more than adequate -- especially since the microphone is back by the earbud.  I get hours of battery life out of them although these days (2020) when we are in our homes, I am happy that I have 2 so I can charge one since I'm on them all day.<br /><br />I really hated the over the head phone which gave me a headache all of the time.  These are very comfortable for my ear shape and stay on.  I've also done limited running with these and they work really well.  They stay in place well and I immediately forget that I'm wearing them.  I bought a similar looking set from another manufacturer and the rubber around the earpiece is just too hard.",B01G8JO5F2
"Worth it for the price, but the sound quality isn't amazing when listening to hard/loud music.",B01G8JO5F2
"The pros are they sound good when they're connected. The cons are they lose bluetooth connectivity easily.  I bought them to use while I do work around the property.  Even with the phone in a shirt pocket why would have connection issues.  The main reason I didn't like them is that the cord which connects them, if placed behind my neck would stick to my skin and they'd pull out of my ears.  Cord in front of my neck and they would hang down when leaning over and again pull out.  I don't use them anymore.",B01G8JO5F2
Best headphones I ever owned.. my husband gave me his pair at first and just purchased another.. very good quality for the price and long lasting battery!!,B01G8JO5F2
Im a over the road trucker. I dont have the time to test products and return them because i travel all 48 states. These headphones worked great and was a great purchase.,B01G8JO5F2
For the price these are astounding. Needed a cheap quick replacement for my Beats. Sound quality just blew me away. Super comfortable fit. If anything they are more comfortable than my Beats. I wear them running.,B01G8JO5F2
"I have owned three of these earbuds. The first lasted for several months and then one side stopped working. I thought they were pretty good for the price, so I ordered them again, thinking maybe it was just something I did that caused one side to go out. The second pair would not charge or turn on when I received them, so I exchanged them with Amazon. The third pair worked fine for about four uses and then the ON/PLAY button got stuck and will not pop back out, rendering them useless (unfortunately just after the return window was up). THESE ARE LOW QUALITY earbuds with poor quality control. They would be worth the price if they were more reliable and lasted. I would suggest Anker earbuds in this price range instead (similar sound, much better range, longer battery life and have lasted me several months of daily use so far).",B01G8JO5F2
I wear them jogging. Comfortable.,B01G8JO5F2
working perfectly after years of extended use. Hands down best bang for the buck!,B01G8JO5F2
"Sound quality , battery life are really good.",B01G8JO5F2
"Wouldn't power on. Wouldn't charge. Nothing. Very disappointing. They sounded and worked great prior to that and I really enjoyed them, but they didn't last long. I would not recommend these earbuds.",B01G8JO5F2
"good sound, good battery life, great for hearing those hard to interpret callers. Worked great for 8 months then died.",B01G8JO5F2
Good,B01G8JO5F2
Sounds great as headphones. People cannot hear me when using bluetooth to talk on phone.,B01G8JO5F2
These are great! Comes in a great licase and works well!,B01G8JO5F2
i have owned 2 pair.<br />first pair (slightly older design) lasted over a year of good service until I stepped on them.<br /><br />immediately ordered another pair.<br />solid. decent battery for size. Fit in ears without discomfort. decent sound.<br /><br />MUCH better than some in terms of keeping connected to bluetooth.,B01G8JO5F2
Bought 3 for friends but one didn’t work and they won’t replace it!!! Not. Cool!!!,B01G8JO5F2
I love these headphones. Great quality sound. Easy tho operate. Fits great and has adjustable ear hooks to fit all sizes. For less than $50 these are the best Bluetooth headphones on the market. Extra bonus for the carrying case.,B01G8JO5F2
"Easy to connect with devices, clear sound.  I have very small ears so the ear loops are very helpful for me.",B01G8JO5F2
Hurt ur ears after a while,B01G8JO5F2
Good product !!!,B01G8JO5F2
Doesn't seem to link up well,B01G8JO5F2
Fell apart in less than 3 months😢😂 so now only one side works,B01G8JO5F2
"tl;dr: Great headset if you're never 10+ ft from your phone<br /><br />I bought this pair so I could listen to music while skating (headphones and earbuds were falling out due to the strong centripetal forces from spinning). Unfortunately, the Bluetooth connection craps out if you're more than 10 ft from your broadcasting device (my iPhone). It just gets poppier and poppier until it completely disconnects, which means it's pretty much useless for what I wanted.<br /><br />In it's defense, this headset is at an excellent price point for the great sound quality and the noise cancelling (muffling) it provides. It's also very comfortable to wear, and the over ear wire is adjustable to mold to your ear. Throughout 3 hrs of very active skating, it never fell off, although the earbud did pop out of my ear once or twice. I third the people saying the red foam earbuds are the best; the other ones felt very hard and uncomfortable.",B01G8JO5F2
Buenos . Un poco pegajosos,B01G8JO5F2
"Really love these earbuds!  Good sound quality.  I really like the earbuds are connected, less likely to lose them.  Really felt they are reasonably priced!",B01G8JO5F2
"So I love the fact that they are wireless, they fit well, and are a good value for the price, the bass appears to distort on certain songs at a low volume, but then works better at a higher volume, they are great for working out, or just relaxing, for the price I am very pleased with the product.",B01G8JO5F2
Sonido fantastico.  Super comodo.  Suenan mucho mejor y con mejor bateria y calidad que otros que é tenido en el pasado.  Compre dos mas para regalos.,B01G8JO5F2
Best headphones I have bought to date. Great sound quality and very durable. Also great price. I would rather these than there $100+ counterparts.,B01G8JO5F2
"Highly recommended!! I have a pair of Beats headphones and bought these as a second pair. They are pretty damn good. Sound and battery life are great. The quality of the product is about the same as Beats. They are little bigger on your ear though. Good thing about these headphones, they don’t have a controller on the wire so the wire doesn’t slide to the heavier/controller side like Beats -stretching your headphone in the ear.",B01G8JO5F2
I only have a positive things to say and that is that they work beautifully they wrap around my ears and allow me to not have to hold back while exercising.,B01G8JO5F2
"I sweat ridiculously when working out.  These ear buds have lasted over 14 months now.  Only issue I have is inconsistent pairing with iphone 7+.  Sometimes it is pairs fine, while other times I have to 'force' the pairing through iphone settings.  I'd likely buy again if the pairing issue is resolved in newer models.",B01G8JO5F2
"Sound quality is good, battery life is acceptable. However material is cheap, headphones are not durable, and are not suitable for wearing while running. Avoid.",B01G8JO5F2
"The one good thing I liked was the sound could be turned much louder than many others. This is the only ""noise cancelation"" it actually has.<br />And now for the bad.<br />Terrible longevity. My first one quit after a couple months. Left ear went out. Common for cheap headphones. My 2nd the ear hook broke at the base in 3 weeks.<br />Speaking of the ear hook, they're flexible which seems great, but the move too much. I wear glasses and the hook will bend out and does not hold the buds in my ear. In addition, ANY movement will cause the hooks to bend, allowing the buds to move out of the ear canal. I work out a lot, and this is obviously the reason for buying this type of headphone. Disappointed.",B01G8JO5F2
I personally have 3. Two at work one at home. I'm a mechanic andi can use them all day no problem. They hold up and hold on to your head with the adjustable ear grips. I even bought a pair for a coworker. Love and highly recommend these!!!!,B01G8JO5F2
I tried two additional headphones that were more expensive before purchasing these. The sound quality is amazing. The fit is very good. Excellent for running and lifting weights. Easy access of controls. Overall performance is awesome!,B01G8JO5F2
Awesome!,B01G8JO5F2
I was hesitant to buy this product because I wear glasses and any over the ear products does not fit correctly.  This is the exception.  You can form these to your ears (or glasses). The sound is amazing.  Great buy for a great price.  I would highly recommend these.,B01G8JO5F2
Clear sound and loud.,B01G8JO5F2
I love this product works great,B01G8JO5F2
Worst headphones ever they won't pair and when they did finally pay her after about two hours of trying to pay are it was so low I could barely hear anyone talking the music wouldn't go loud and then the ear part was so loose. Will also be returning,B01G8JO5F2
This is my 2nd pair 1st pair was perfect 2nd pair the way the wires are in the ears That will  Adjust around your ears keep straightening doesn't grip your ear and you always have to adjust it why did they bother it.,B01G8JO5F2
"the sound quality is ok, but this just does not fit in the ear and comes out during jogging.",B01G8JO5F2
I do need to return these because of the piece that goes around your ear.  They don't stay in very well when I'm exercising and my glasses knock them out of place constantly.  Do you have something that just goes in the ear and not around the outside?  Please let me know what I need to do.  Thanks,B01G8JO5F2
Great headphones. I like the moldable ear piece so the fit around your ears. I use them while working outside all day.,B01G8JO5F2
Great headphones until they broke after a week of use....!!!,B01G8JO5F2
Can’t beat the price for the quality.,B01G8JO5F2
"These will not stay in, disappointed",B01G8JO5F2
Entertainment,B01G8JO5F2
They are much more comfortable to wear than the earbuds that come with my iPhone.,B01G8JO5F2
"I could believe sweat-proof, but I was not ready to believe waterproof.  Well, my wife just retrieved my Senso IPX7s from the wash.  That's wash and dry.  And what do you know, they STILL WORK.<br />I have seen reviews slamming the quality of sound, but they are the best sounding buds I have heard.  They cost much more when I got them.  Now they sell for $20.  This is a great value.",B01G8JO5F2
Bought these headsets to listen to music and podcasts while in the jacuzzi. Great product! Sound is wonderful. The controls are easy and logically placed for smooth operation with wet hands. The ear piece that wraps around the back of ear is flexible for a custom fit. Highly recommend.,B01G8JO5F2
Guys these headphones are great worth the 30 buck or whatever u spent on these but my thing is the warranty I bought a 4 year warranty e these things and idk how to get a replacement for these can anyone help me out,B01G8JO5F2
Did not work as well while swimming but they work well for anything else,B01G8JO5F2
Great headphones.  Stay in place and provide great volume.,B01G8JO5F2
"I loved them!  The uses for the gym and the sound is great, they are super comfortable.",B01G8JO5F2
"I have a hard time getting buds to stay in. Maybe my ears are weird, but these work for me so I have purchased these as replacements. I like the brand. I like that they always include a little surprise extra thing in the package. . I’m am fine with the sound and the price is good.  I accidentally bought two and a good thing too because one set got tangled in my hair and the curved part got straightened out. And it would never hold a curve and fit over my ear again so the pair was useless. I’ve learned my lesson, and won’t do that again, but it is very irritating.",B01G8JO5F2
Great,B01G8JO5F2
Not the same model as I previously ordered. Cheap knock off. I'm pissed.,B01G8JO5F2
I used the Senso Headphones mostly for the gym and I never had an issue until recently. Over the last few weeks it seems that the headphones are starting to deteriorate. They will randomly disconnect from my phone via Bluetooth and also shut off quite frequently even though they are fully charged. Physically they are in great shape. I think it did it's job but I would have obviously wanted them to last a little longer.,B01G8JO5F2
Great for the price,B01G8JO5F2
"delivered as promised, I purchased this 5 years ago. when they finally broke just recently, I bought another pair.",B01G8JO5F2
Somewhat tinny sound,B01G8JO5F2
"If you're not rich, these are nice and give reasonable sound quality. If its between buying some Bose or other expensive ones off craigslist or offer up, I'd go with these and avoid the risk of getting a counterfeit.",B01G8JO5F2
"Not an 8 hr battery, usually last about 4-5 hrs., sound quality regular, bulky earpiece is uncomfortable after 20 minutes of use",B01G8JO5F2
"Thought these were great headphones for the first couple months until I found them melted in my truck. These actually had the best sound of any Bluetooth headphones I’ve owned, but that doesn’t matter if they’re melted. Luckily I didn’t have these plugged into an outlet that was always hot, so I was able to catch it before a massive disaster happened in my truck.",B01G8JO5F2
"This is good for the price, nothing better than that",B01G8JO5F2
Great product at awesome price. Fast and amazing customer service. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for headphones.,B01G8JO5F2
Great for running. Easy to use and they stay put well. Great noise and they get pretty loud!,B01G8JO5F2
"I first purchased the black headphones and they worked perfectly till my dog chewed them to pieces. I then purchased the red one's but they're not of the same quality. Firstly, it takes FOREVER to turn them on/off. Even the voice that says ""power on/off"" is different. I have to press down for over 10 seconds before they turn on/off (with my already paired devices) which was not the case with the blk headphones. The sound is more static than the black ones, and this is using the same devices and same music tracks. They do take over an hour to fully charge but do Not last 8 hours. I fully charge headphones and use them for about  3-4 hours but have a low battery at around 5 hours, and I Always turn them Off when not in use! They are comfortable and had no problems pairing with multiple devices, but I wish I bought the black ones again. For now, these will do until my dog chews them up again, lol!",B01G8JO5F2
"Love these. I've had them for over a year and they're still going strong. They put out pretty good sound quality for a low price. Perfect for using at the gym. Easily could get a 5+ hour battery life from one charge. Definitely hold on to the spare ear prices, they get kinda gross after awhile.",B01G8JO5F2
Great sound quality at a very affordable price,B01G8JO5F2
very convenient and great for noise blockage and working out,B01G8JO5F2
"Para mi teléfono, muy buen sonido,  lo único que no me convenció es el poco escuchar desde afuera me parece inseguro.",B01G8JO5F2
"I lost my headphones which was the previous version of this set, in my opinion the old version was better. the cover for the USB charger never closed all the way, which doesn't change performance but was rather annoying. Additionally, it seems that they tried to cut costs on the piece that goes around your ear, this is a much thinner, more flimsy, and cheaper piece which does not hold as well onto the ear or hold its shape very well. Sound quality was slightly better than previous version though. Flimsy earpiece was a deal breaker for me, it felt like it was just dangling off my ears while I was working out and bothered me to the point of returning it, on top of the faulty USB port cover.",B01G8JO5F2
"I had bought these March of 2018 in order to have BT headphones that had a battery life of more than 2 hrs (compared to little individual buds) and the price was decent. I've loved them every since and now over a year later, they are finally beginning to wear out after a ton of use including drops, being stepped on (repeatedly), tugged on by kids, tangled up, thrown around, drenched in sweat, ect. (and run over by a car once...)<br /><br />The casing around the main button popped off fairly early in, but a little tape and it holds just fine. The inner circuits and cord are tough as nails though which easily makes up for it. Sound quality is decent for the size, and it works well for taking phone calls in noisy environments or if you just need to be hands free. I use them for a few hours sporadically throughout the day so I can go a couple of days before I have to charge them again which is nice. Definitely buying from Senso again.",B01G8JO5F2
"I have been using these for a little over 2 years and I love these things. I'm a fan of bass in Bluetooth headsets and these definitely deliver that. Enough bass to make the two Bluetooth earbuds I've bought after these feel like they are just weak.<br /><br />Even with the two earbuds I bought after this I still come back to these. I use them for the gym and I prefer the convenience of wrapping these headphone around my neck vs needing to put them in my pocket with earbuds that are not connected.<br /><br />Great battery life, I believe I get around 6-9 hours on these things. Can't beat this for the price. Its not professional crisp sound quality, but has more than enough force to be used casually and focus in the gym.",B01G8JO5F2
The piece that goes around your ear got deform. It won’t go on my ear no more.,B01G8JO5F2
"Super good,love them",B01G8JO5F2
"nunca imagine que tuviera que se cortara la señal de mi celular al audífono por movimiento en un rango de no más de 1 metro de distancia de uno al otro.<br /><br />El peor articulo que he comprado en Amazon, realmente bote mi dinero.",B01G8JO5F2
"Decent for what they’re worth, I bought my pair 14months ago and stoped working two days ago. they started acting funny and stopped connecting and just shutting off  after you turn them on, even when fully charged. I wouldn’t call them noise canceling they cancel about as well as any other regular ear bud.",B01G8JO5F2
"These headphones are just what I need.  When I workout at the gym, what I need is a headphone that doesn't damage when I sweat.  I'm looking forward to experience this today.",B01G8JO5F2
"Great seller and fantastic product! Easy to pair, convenient carrying case and lots of extra goodies.",B01G8JO5F2
purchased to use while working out.  Did not disappoint.  Excellent quality & quick delivery,B01G8JO5F2
"Brand new these earbuds lasted about 3 hours on a full charge. A year and a half later of moderately heavy use, they last about 20-30 minutes on a full charge.",B01G8JO5F2
Love these headphones. If you leave them in for a long time they hurt your ear a bit.,B01G8JO5F2
They are great. I bought them for my husband's birthday. He loves them.,B01G8JO5F2
"Super easy to connect. Loved the ""freebies"" that were included. Happy to have music when working out. Makes a dull workout fun. Have used them in the pool and no issues. I do not swim with them, I use them for water aerobics only. No issues at this point.",B01G8JO5F2
"I have used these about three times a week or so at the gym, light use, but after having them only three weeks the sound went out on the right side. Not good quality",B01G8JO5F2
"The headset sounds good and all but the battery life sucks big time.  Bought this 8 months ago and the battery life degrade so much.  Went from full charge to the battery low voice prompt in less than 3 hours and it was advertised for 10+ hours.  Emailed Buyer several times, Buyer WAS responsive the first couple of times but stop responding afterward.",B01G8JO5F2
Very nice and convenient headset ! Easy to use and fast charging.,B01G8JO5F2
"I was looking for a good product to work with my iPad and my iPhone, this fits the ticket. Good buy",B01G8JO5F2
"The sound quality is good, that’s only if it connects to your phone! The first two times they connected fast, but after that it has taken me over 30-40 minutes to connect the Bluetooth to my IPhone. It’s really annoying going to the gym and having to wait for a Bluetooth connection! Sometimes I can’t get a connection at all!!",B01G8JO5F2
"The ear loops are too big and the pads for the earbuds are hard and very uncomfortable to wear. The sound quality is decent though, especially for budget headphones.",B01G8JO5F2
Love the fit and functionality; wish the ear retainers held the shape a bit more fairly.,B01G8JO5F2
It worked great for about 4 months and then one day it stopped holding a charge. I received excellent customer service from the company in resolving the issue.,B01G8JO5F2
I have had these for a few years now and they work just as good as the day I got them. Great value. Comfortable to wear and it comes with extra ear pieces.,B01G8JO5F2
Love it. My 1st pair had an American accent my new pair has a British accent,B01G8JO5F2
"Right out of the box, the bass on these headphones sounded like it was completely blown out. I can't turn up the volume barely more than a whisper without having the bass scratching and bleeding. Based on other 1-Star reviews, it appears that they are just super unreliable in terms of quality - any given pair might be better or worse than another. I'm going to try to trade these in for a new pair and see if that solves the problem.<br />Otherwise, range and connectivity seems fine, and I like the design and how the hooks can mold around your ear for a snug fit.",B01G8JO5F2
I only had to charge it once so far and I’ve had the headphones a couple weeks. Delivery was super fast which was nice and I really like the product. Definitely recommend them. And price was right.,B01G8JO5F2
Loved,B01G8JO5F2
Excelente quality excede my expectations.,B01G8JO5F2
"Got these after a lot of research, I was impressed with the online reviews, however I used them less than 4 days! The wire on the headphones twisted and broke ! Maybe I got a defected piece.. all in all such a disappointment!",B01G8JO5F2
"After using this product for 6 months, one day the battery overheated when charging and melted the plastic around the charging port. Now they don't work anymore. I cannot recommend buying headphones that only last 6 months.",B01G8JO5F2
"I put blue tooth transmitters on the TV downstairs and the TV upstairs.  I have a set of earphones for each of the TVs and for my MP3 player I listen to while jogging.  the earphones are great and lightweight.  One of them stopped pairing with the TV so I use that for my MP3 player.  As a curiosity, the newest pair of earphones will disconnect my wife's earphones when she's on her phone or Ipad and connect with them.  I had no idea that the earphones had noise cancellation.  I guess it works . . . when I first received the 3rd pair they were defective.  they replaced them right away",B01G8JO5F2
The on and off button did not work very well.,B01G8JO5F2
I ordered this and just received it today. It doesn't appear to be damaged at all. There is a major mix up in the charging cable connection. It doesn't come with the correct connection. I clicked on the seller information and it has a number. I dialed so called number and it notes this number is no longer in service. I know I didn't pay too much for these but seems wrong. They look as advertised and look good but I can't charge them.,B01G8JO5F2
I’m disappointed that the bonus items were NOT in the box.  I attached the picture from my order.,B01G8JO5F2
"Easy to use, lightweight and incredible sound.  For the price I highly recommend these headphones.",B01G8JO5F2
I like them if they were loud but they not thankyou,B01G8JO5F2
"Great headphones for on the go!! I use them for work and to workout, they sound amazing and connect so easily!",B01G8JO5F2
Did not open or make use of product and would really appreciate returning for refund or credit<br />Thank you<br />James Henry,B01G8JO5F2
"I use these while paddleboarding, swimming, and taking baths and showers.  They are fully waterproof and the battery lasts for several hours.  A good quality product.",B01G8JO5F2
"The only downside is the amount of wind noise you get while running outside. I bought these because I saw that in a review and most of my exercise is indoors, so not a problem. The behind-the-ear pieces are very flexible and easy to mold to the ear. Great quality for the price especially.",B01G8JO5F2
"Exceeded my expectations!!  Love it!  Easy to use, excellent sound quality, GREAT Value.  I have had other EarPods and these work the best.",B01G8JO5F2
"Great for workouts and sound was clear. The case is too narrow to fit them easily. So after so many times of trying to squeeze them perfectly up in the case, the part that goes in the ear broke. I glued it back with Gorilla glue, but it broke again. And of course it was after a year warranty plus not sure if it would have qualified. I liked them so much I brought 2 pair after I misplaced and then later found the first pair. The person I sold the 2nd pair to loved them as well. Bummer. So buy them but keep in the box not the case.",B01G8JO5F2
"Good sound quality, no connection issues. Overall solid product",B01G8JO5F2
I’ve had these for a few years now and they still work amazingly well. Such a great product!! And for a great price.,B01G8JO5F2
Like the sound,B01G8JO5F2
Good quality,B01G8JO5F2
They are working great. I have had a pair of these before and like them so I bought new ones.,B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these Senso earphones based on the reviews here to replace a<br />different brand (Letsfit) I had used.  There are several earphones of the same<br />design on Amazon.  I verified by phoning Senso that they all come from the same<br />factory in China.  However, there are some small differences.<br />I found the volume of the Senso to<br />be inadequate for me (poor hearing) to use them on a home treadmill; noise canellation was<br />not evident.  Also, the ear hooks are made from a fairly soft material so they are<br />too floppy and tend to come off easily.  Otherwise, the Senso worked fine: decent<br />sound quality, good battery life.",B01G8JO5F2
Bought these for my bro. He absolutely loves them. Compared them to high end headphones that people pay $100+  For. Would recommend,B01G8JO5F2
Once I got the headphones everything seemed great. They were already charged so I listened to my music right away. Once they died I put them on a the charger until the light changed from red to blue but once I started listening to my music they kept turning off on me. I kept trying to charge them only to get the same results.,B01G8JO5F2
The sound quality is far inferior than expected. It sounds like music is played through a metal tube. Also the speakers suffer at any loud or high parts of a song. The only positive is that the plastic is very soft on the ears.,B01G8JO5F2
"Love em, used them a lot. Also great customer service. The free accessories are also very nice especially the car magnet holder",B01G8JO5F2
"I was so excited when I ordered these because I had not trouble getting to connect to my phone or computer via bluetooth, and was impressed with the bluetooth range (I could walk around my apartment no problem without compromising sound. However, within weeks of using the headphones, one of the earbuds fell off. I was able to place it back together, but it was such a drag to have to do it over and over. Pretty soon after that, sound stopped playing from that ear bud, and then the front end of it fell off, so I was running around with just one work ear bud. I was excited because these ear buds were recommended for runner and did not break my budget, but I now realize it might be better to place down more money for a sturdier, albeit more expensive, product. Very frustrated!",B01G8JO5F2
"This is the second pair of earbuds I buy here. These were for my wife as she bought a cheap pair at Marshals and they gave out on her. These stay in your ear and have good sound quality. I use foam plugs I bought here on Amazon to use in the buds. They help with blocking out noise. You can’t go wrong with these earbuds . They stay in place,good battery life and the wire almost guarantees you won’t lose them.",B01G8JO5F2
Sound quality was fine then it stopped working all together. It's a shame for having to spend over $70 for this.,B01G8JO5F2
Great headphones for the price. Wireless makes them easy for running. Very lightweight and comfortable.,B01G8JO5F2
Love the freedom the headphones give me--in and outdoors.,B01G8JO5F2
Great sound quality not too much comfortable to wear,B01G8JO5F2
Very happy with these.  Work great. Great price. Come with a nice little case.,B01G8JO5F2
I have been using these headphones for a few months now and I must say they're great and long lasting too. The sound quality is good and the silicon material of the ear grips mold to your ear. I love them and would highly recommend.,B01G8JO5F2
They work nice. Good range. Sounds quality is ok.,B01G8JO5F2
Doesn’t catch all the treble in some of my music but great for the price. The ear coverings are bendable to the shape of your ear but I have to readjust it every time after I put my earbuds away,B01G8JO5F2
Great noise cancelling ability and sound quality. Easily connects to my phone and I prefer these over my Apple AirPods for working out. Highly recommend.,B01G8JO5F2
Sound is good but falls out randomly.,B01G8JO5F2
I love these headphones as they are the only ones I own that stay in my ears. The sound is really good as well.,B01G8JO5F2
"I use these nonstop, mostly listening to audiobooks. We have two or three pair around the house. They last all day and I have had no problems until they just shut down. I contacted customer service (a human answered (I know...!)), answered a few questions, and they shipped a new pair right away. Have bought again, will buy again if necessary.",B01G8JO5F2
"I use the headphones at work for conference calls, when I'm working out, and when I'm doing chores around the house. I'm impressed with the sound and how comfortable they are.",B01G8JO5F2
This purchase was made for my daughter and she is pleased with the product.,B01G8JO5F2
"I like the product, listening to audio books",B01G8JO5F2
There great and water proof,B01G8JO5F2
"The sound is good in my opinion, you can really feel the bass with these headphones while there's enough clarity with the mid-highs as well.",B01G8JO5F2
I love them. They fit perfectly and include several size ear pieces for that perfect fit. Syncing the Bluetooth is very simple.<br />They are great,B01G8JO5F2
"Although I always read a lot of reviews before purchasing a product, I don't typically write them. However, beyond frustrated with these things, I'm finally going to voice my opinion.<br /><br />First and foremost, the bluetooth connection is terrible especially outside. The sound cuts in & out every time there is a gust of wind. The same is true if I'm wearing my phone to the side or the back of my body, or if I bend at the waist. As my primary use for them is working in the yard, they're almost useless. Crouching over to garden... forget it!<br /><br />Secondly, every time I move my head the cord drags on my neck unseating the earbud a little at time so that every 5 minutes I'm readjusting them back in my ears.<br /><br />Basically the only time I have no issues with these earbuds is when I'm in the house doing very little and the phone is worn in front of my body. Then the sound is decent enough for the money. But this clearly isn't enough to recommend the product.",B01G8JO5F2
"I loved the quality of sound and the fact that you did not have to have the sound turned up much to hear it and you still did not hear outside noise. Wonderful! The packaging 📦 was really well. A nice hard box that held the headphones 🎧, case, and the other goodies. Very nice! 👍",B01G8JO5F2
Not charging and cant return it,B01G8JO5F2
Works great at a good price,B01G8JO5F2
I bought them for listening during showers.. seem to work great for that.,B01G8JO5F2
"I have purchased this before - over two years ago. My previous Active Buds worked great for me; worry free. I used them for yard work, late at night for audio/video so as not to disturb family members, riding my bike, Pickleball, and for golf. These are easy to operate and maintain. I like the part that goes over the ear - flexible and easy to adjust. Cost is very reasonable. I would recommend for anyone to purchase.",B01G8JO5F2
The battery life is 7 hours at best usually 6 1/2.,B01G8JO5F2
These work as described.  I haven't gotten to use them just tried them out.,B01G8JO5F2
"I like the fact that by just pushing a button on the head phones it turns on, connects, and one more push and I'm on whatever I am listening to.",B01G8JO5F2
Hear good,B01G8JO5F2
"Pretty good while they lasted. They look really big, maybe just on female heads, but they stick out pretty far. I didn’t care they worked at the gym or wherever for a solid 6 months. In the last month they’ve been less able to keep the Bluetooth connection, so I constantly get kicked off of my phone by anyone else’s Bluetooth in close proximity. Need stronger Bluetooth wiring.",B01G8JO5F2
Good bluetooth earphones.,B01G8JO5F2
""" I love this earbuds.""",B01G8JO5F2
"The most recent one I had when you turned it on it said ""power on"" at max volume. Haha yea that was annoying but I rate senso close to sennheiser and the battery life is awesome I've had close to 6 of them I think I'm bad about losing and accidentally braking headsets that's where their super low cost is awesome I typically spent 75$ or more on wired sennheiser and these bluetooth are 30$ I'm a happy customer just ordered the wireless ones because I accidentally broke my last corded bluetooth. Anyway figured I should leave a review yea got one messed up one out of many but still loyal",B01G8JO5F2
They came broken and would not power on.,B01G8JO5F2
Used these for running. They stopped taking a charge within the first month,B01G8JO5F2
After a year of using this product died. it’s not worth.,B01G8JO5F2
Use these for work all the time. They're perfect for jamming out to heavy metal. I'd recommend these to anyone!,B01G8JO5F2
This is the second pair I have owned. The first were great. This pair showed up with the right speaker not functioning. I did not return them. Too much of a pain. Disappointed to say the least.,B01G8JO5F2
"I don't know if I just got a faulty unit, but I'm not about to find out. The audio was muffled and sounded like it was underwater. Even the built-in ""Your headset is now connected"" recording sounded terrible. It sounded like someone had stuck cotton in the earbuds and I was hearing the audio through it. Complete waste of money.",B01G8JO5F2
Bueno,B01G8JO5F2
These are terrible. They didn’t even last a month.  Won’t hold a charge.  I’m so disappointed. Never buy these!!!,B01G8JO5F2
Charging port malfunctioned after about 10 charges.,B01G8JO5F2
I love the sound. Battery is great!,B01G8JO5F2
I am blown away by the quality.  For the price I cant believe how good they sound.,B01G8JO5F2
"I set it up to charge and over night still no blue light, after checking it out made no changes but in the next 8 hours it was charged now just getting familiar with it.",B01G8JO5F2
Doesn’t cancel noise that well but the sound quality and using for working out are awesome,B01G8JO5F2
"I’ve only had them for a couple of days so I can’t comment on battery life..otherwise there great headphones. One of the ear pieces is like a earplug, fits really snug..love it<br /><br />My 2nd pair because I broke the original ones when I stepped on them. Battery life was good..at least 6 hours of playback. 2nd pair didn’t come with the earplug type ear piece but I’m still happy with the fit",B01G8JO5F2
"After two and a half years of constant use in my jogging and exercise routines, the plastic has degraded and still works. It was my longest-lasting headset in terms of battery life, sound quality, and button conditions. Recommended.",B01G8JO5F2
The sound is very good.  Range is good also.  Going to buy one for my wife to use also.,B01G8JO5F2
These are exactly what you order. They're a good quality and sound. I use them in the gym and have no problems with them falling out. This is my third pair I have purchased. Highly recommend as something for the gym or any activity where they may get messed up. Plus there is a lifetime guarantee.,B01G8JO5F2
Grandpa lived them,B01G8JO5F2
"""I'm enjoying my purchase. Thank you""",B01G8JO5F2
Earphones stopped working after 5 months.  Would not pair and would not hold charge,B01G8JO5F2
"After about the third charge, the receptacle for charging cord dislocated, making it impossible to recharge. Totally useless after less than 10 hours of use.",B01G8JO5F2
This was a gift and the receiver is pleased and that is what was important.,B01G8JO5F2
The sound quality of the earphones is very good.,B01G8JO5F2
"There is more sound on the right side then on the left, it was not worth the money I spent.",B01G8JO5F2
They are very comfortable and provide good sound. I would recommend them to my family and friends.,B01G8JO5F2
"I bought my first pair and I loved them. The sound is good and they were comfortable. After about 6 months  someone at my gym apparently wanted them more and took them. So I bought another set. After 3 months they turned off randomly and I would have to power them back on. In a couple of weeks time they stopped working all together. So, I bought my 3rd pair thinking sometimes things happen and you just get a lame duck. I've had them about a month and they just quit working out of nowhere. It's too bad because they do sound good and they are comfortable, but I don't think that I will take a chance on these again.",B01G8JO5F2
"I use these to listen to podcasts or books on tape, so I can't weigh in on sound quality.  What I can say is that these pair quickly every time, the battery life is pretty good vs others that I've tried, and the ear pieces really go into your ear canal - I'm not sure the over ear thingies are even necessary.  I've had no issues with the waterproofness, but have only worn them around the house and in the hot tub (not underwater or in a rainstorm).  Price was right and I have no complaints.",B01G8JO5F2
"I really like the light weight, easy of Bluetooth connection, well balanced sound quality without any equalizer, with equalizer is even better. I really like the kit with various mounts; thank you SENSO team!<br /><br />I didn't like the design of the upper part that goes over your ear and not sure how it will hold up for runners",B01G8JO5F2
I bought those headphones a while ago but the mic quality wasn't so good since I bought I bought it.,B01G8JO5F2
These ear buds sound fine but I have been through 3 pairs that all failed due to sweat. Find a better brand.,B01G8JO5F2
I liked everything about the earphones!,B01G8JO5F2
"I've had these for about 4 years now and still going strong.  Battery life is still good, and the sound is very good for the price.",B01G8JO5F2
These are so comfortable I can listen to sleep music in bed without disturbing husband!,B01G8JO5F2
I like that I can answer phone calls while using and callers say it is a clear connection.  Comfortable in my ears. Listen to my music or my audible books while walking,B01G8JO5F2
"Right out of the box it synced to my iPhone for music. Every day I worked out for 1hr +. Hooked it up, would charge easily, ready to go for the day  YEAH!!.....  After 3 days they no longer worked. .....Blue light indicated charged, but did not work<br /><br />What I did NOT like from the beginning were the biggest of the ear hooks. They are soft and malleable, but did not keep their shape,  having to constantly readjusting while wearing<br /><br />If you have a really large skull these would likely be great.<br />  Sound was fine.<br />Their going back",B01G8JO5F2
I pair w Samsung Galaxy S9+. I need to have it ~1 ft away to avoid constant cutting out. Very annoying but otherwise works well,B01G8JO5F2
"I love the sound wow. The accessories are also amazing.  My friend had one of them and i said I had to try these. Love them. If you want to buy it, just do it.  Great sound",B01G8JO5F2
"It's ok. I thought about returning it but I need a set now and can't be bothered looking for another one.  So, I'll keep it.<br />The package didn't come with extra eartips or the wire tie like it says on the packaging. Not sure what the wire tie is for so I didn't worry about not getting that but extra eartips would have been nice to have. It came with a cute round zipped pouch tho.<br />It says wireless up to 30ft but I lose the sound few feet away when I go into another room. May be I have thick walls but my previous headset allowed me to walk around the house and even to the basement and back without sound interruption.<br />The cable that goes around the neck is too stiff...it digs into back of the neck when walking or jogging and pulls to one side with movement so I have to keep pulling it away to center it. The ear hooks pop off if the eartips aren't jammed into ears firmly. The battery life is crazy quick I didn't get 8 hours like it says. May be the one I received has some issues but it certainly doesn't hold up to the promise it says with its description.<br />I am not super happy with it. It just does the job for now, but I will not buy this again and I will not recommend it to a friend.",B01G8JO5F2
The ear loops too soft. Would not hold its shape,B01G8JO5F2
"I lose these often. Price is good for this unit which has good, not great sound. Thumbs up.",B01G8JO5F2
Came with everything except for the actual headphones...rip off,B01G8JO5F2
Purchased for one of my sons. He said quality is great and sound is clear. He uses them almost everyday.,B01G8JO5F2
"El articulo correspondía con la descripción, muy buen producto llego a tiempo.  Es eñ tercero que compro para regalo.",B01G8JO5F2
They work just fine.<br />Battery time is relatively long for wireless headsets.<br />The sound quality is not good but it is relative to price.<br />The cable connecting the right ear and left is uncomfortable during training.<br /><br />***Good for entry level,B01G8JO5F2
"These ""waterproof"" headphones quit working the very moment they touched the water.",B01G8JO5F2
"Overall the sound quality is good - however, they are a little uncomfortable on my ears. The blue tooth connection is solid however and the cord is just the right length so that its out of the way. The last two features outweigh the discomfort for me.",B01G8JO5F2
I liked them well enough to buy a second pair after I wore the first pair out.,B01G8JO5F2
Using them while doing yard work mowing building fences and listening to music,B01G8JO5F2
"It's currently September 2019, I bought these in November 2018. I bought these to use at the gym and running. They still work amazing after using it everyday and holds up to sweating. Haven't loss any quality in sound and hardware. The earphones stay in my ear without having to adjust. The battery works great. I work out for an hour and I can use these for 5-6 consecutive days in the gym. Since I use it only for this purpose, it's a great product for me and for the price. For relaxing, I prefer wired earphones because of the amazing quality that you just can't beat. Hope this helps someone.",B01G8JO5F2
Works great,B01G8JO5F2
"Really good  sound, 8 hrs of battery life, fits securely, built very well. Three earbuds sizes included",B01G8JO5F2
These no longer charge!  Not even a year old!,B01G8JO5F2
I bought these earbuds after doing careful product research. I use them at the gym and they are perfect. I also appreciate the little zip up carrying case for carrying the device and extra ear tips. When I did have an issue - customer service responded unbelievably fast and took care of the issue to my complete satisfaction.,B01G8JO5F2
Stopped working after a month,B01G8JO5F2
My grandson they were perfect for him,B01G8JO5F2
It was well received,B01G8JO5F2
Went through the washing machine on accident and they still work!,B01G8JO5F2
"I bought this for my two mile walks that I do 2 or 3 times a week. I was quite impressed with what came in the packaging, especially the compact and nice-looking hard leather case with net. That makes it a breeze to carry along. I can't talk of the battery life because my walks are about an hour and I recharge the headphones every week. No issues there at all. The phones fit snugly and the sound is great. I will admit that I am rather easy to please but this does exactly what I need it to do.",B01G8JO5F2
"Little sad that they keep disconnecting from blue tooth device, it’s also choppy with in and out sound 😞. Also you walk away from the source about 5 ft and it starts fading in and out. Wouldn’t buy again. But the price was right.",B01G8JO5F2
My son seemed to like these. The sound quality was decent for the price paid.,B01G8JO5F2
High quality for the price.  Comes with assortment of ear pieces ensuring a good fit.  Easy to setup and use.  Sound quality is good but I primarily listen to audio books.,B01G8JO5F2
"This bluetooth headset does not disappoint. The headset is easy to use, comfortable, and it comes with a nice box to keep it all together in.",B01G8JO5F2
"I have had these for over a year and they still work great! The battery lasts all day listening to music or podcast in the office and a workout afterward. I had no trouble getting them connected to any of my devices.  I bought them thinking that if they lasted me 6-12 months then I would have gotten my money's worth, 18 months in and they are still just as good as the bay I bought them. Simply a headphone that works well and lasts a long time.",B01G8JO5F2
"I received these as a gift last year. The sound, when it works is darned good for an inexpensive product. However, I have continuous problems with them cutting in and out. Right now I'm sitting stationary at my iMac, and they are cutting in and out. I've used them on bike rides, pairing them with my iPhone, and have the same problems. It's a shame, as they are comfortable. I would not recommend this product.",B01G8JO5F2
"I like the large power button - very easy to access. My previous earbuds had 3 tiny buttons along one edge; it was difficult to select the correct button. The Senso flexible ear hooks are “too” flexible - they don’t hold their shape and sometimes fall off my ear.""",B01G8JO5F2
Really appreciated the extras that came with the headphones!,B01G8JO5F2
"Don’t buy those if you care about the water resistant IPX rating.  Mine got wet and failed. Looking at them more closely it’s easy to see why, as a gap in the plastic headphone housing lets light and water through.  It easily pops off and you can see how all the electronics are right there exposed to water.  If you just want Bluetooth headphones under $20 that stay on snugly, with thin sound and no water proof expectations, these will be good for you.",B01G8JO5F2
"Purchased: Ordered on June 25, 2018<br />Date of defect: July 15, 2018<br />In less than a month, the right side wire has lost connection.  Very disappointed.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Long range (much longer than any other ones used in the past)<br />Battery charge last very long time.  LOVE IT.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Absolutely NOT for running.  You can hear wind noise HORRIBLY.<br />One of the wires lost connection in less than a month.",B01G8JO5F2
"They are working great. I love these headphones. When my original pair died, I did not hesitate to order another pair.",B01G8JO5F2
"Nice packaging.... has a nice carrying case. Product came defective,  the volume button is broken/ not working like it should.... sounds from it is not up to par with beats at all, the ear loop is way to soft and doesn't support as well as my beats.<br /> Need to keep it since 1) I lost my beats at a jobsite and I need ear protection, 2) I was not going to send back a $20 Item and waste resources and greenhouse gas all because the volume button didnt work( I can still use my phone to turn down the volume.",B01G8JO5F2
"I am prime user and it is already delivered late by 2 days, and now it is not working, FRUSTRATED...",B01G8JO5F2
The only issue I’ve had is that the connection can be spotty. I usually have to shut the WiFi of on my phone when I connect them otherwise it cuts in and out a lot. Other than that these have been great. I use them for 15-20 minutes a night and they lasted nearly a month of the initial charge. I charged them once since then and haven’t had to worry about it since.,B01G8JO5F2
"Battery life is LITERALLY the best thing ever, it lasts so long. The sound is 10/10.",B01G8JO5F2
Totally recommended this product. Sounds quality is really good and super like cause it's really handy. Love the case tooI I really like it because it comes with extra sizes for ear plugs whgich is one of my problem when it comes to using earphones like this. Super like the sound and it's really clear.,B01G8JO5F2
Good headphones,B01G8JO5F2
the sound is good but the connection is very bad.,B01G8JO5F2
The volume control doesn't seem to work on the right side earpiece.  The volume from that side is barely audible when the left earpiece is not in place.  I will contact Senso and hope for a resolution. Jury still out.,B01G8JO5F2
"Noise cancelation is great, quality, is great. The battery lasts ALL DAY. The only complaint is that the sound cuts out and I have to turn them off and on to reconnect. This is is a hassle especially when I am on important calls.",B01G8JO5F2
Uncomfortable after a few minutes. Not worth the money,B01G8JO5F2
it has a really good quality and battery. The only con is that hurts my ear..not so comfortable,B01G8JO5F2
"I'm on my second pair of these.  First ones lasted fairly well, second ones died today, one day after the 'warranty' ended... That's just wrong.  Looks like it is time to explore a different brand.  Update - I contacted Amazon who contacted SENSO support.  24 hours later there are a new pair being shipped to replace the faulty ones, that is all I can ask for!  These were my third pair of SENSO buds.  The first lasted two years being used for working out every day.  My wife has the second after about a year, and they are working just fine.  I'm very pleased with the support, no hassle, a response via email came about an hour after they were contacted.  Had me try a reset (which is good to know for future reference how to do), and when that didn't work they shipped me a new pair.  The sound is very good and they work well for my purposes.  Performance plus the support and I'm going with 5 stars.  and then 5 months later, same as the previous pair, dead.",B01G8JO5F2
"These are the best headphones and the customer service is outstanding. I have purchased them numerous times and have never had an issue. The last pair I ordered had a defect and the company responded immediately to my problem and replaced them even faster. I can't say enough goid things about this product and company. If you need headphones, don't buy from anyone else. You will not regret it.",B01G8JO5F2
"I like it,  very good quality, unique design.<br />Long battery life.<br />I recommend for others.",B01G8JO5F2
"I love these headphones. I have three pair of them. I ordered the third pair wanting one like the first pair (unbendable earpiece) but got the bending kind instead. I get that it is because they are the newer ones, but I liked the other ones better. Either way you cant go wrong with these. That is just my own personal preference. The sound is great and battery life is outstanding!! Great value for these earphones!",B01G8JO5F2
"I have this headphone and worked great for year but after that it do not stay turned on, but auto turned off even if i am actively listing to music. I will check with warranty department if there is anything they can do to resolve this issue.",B01G8JO5F2
Perfect,B01G8JO5F2
"I've had these headphones for a couple years now and the bluetooth radio has finally failed.  However, up until this point, these have been great headphones.  They sound really good, battery life is as-advertised however there is no noise cancellation that I can tell.<br /><br />If I could make one change, I would want to have a fabric-coated cable.  The current cable has a rubber-coated feel and when you get sweaty, it sticks to your neck, which is annoying.<br /><br />Other than that concern, I will likely order these again as you can't beat the price for what you get.",B01G8JO5F2
The last pair I bought stopped holding a charge after 2 weeks. I love the headphones so I ordered this pair in hopes it wouldn’t happen again.,B01G8JO5F2
"I use these for my long runs and whenever I'm working outside so I can hear my phone if/when it rings.  I have used these in the past and they have a long life.  I only replace them when one of the ear buds stop working but I probably get a full year out of them before that happens.  For the price, you can't beat that.",B01G8JO5F2
Purchased 3 pairs of these headphones. Used them a handful of times and no one pair will charge now. Waste of money.. Do not buy. I thought 1 may be bad but all 3?? So irritated.,B01G8JO5F2
"It's the second time those earphones stopped working, in less than two months",B01G8JO5F2
Very pleased with my headphones! Like the cute storage case and extras!,B01G8JO5F2
"I listen to audio books on my phone, in my car whenever or wherever. My nephew gave me and my husband these wireless buds. We both love them. No wires and quality is great. My husband just purchased another set as he very often forgets to charge his. Excellent quality I recommend mend to everyone.",B01G8JO5F2
I like these. They work great the only exception is walking on beach when its windy you can hear the wind when you turn your head.,B01G8JO5F2
Good product,B01G8JO5F2
Great sound quality and quality-produced headphones. Sound is the same quality as similar products from Beats or Bose and paying significantly less - additionally on prior reviews it sounds like those other headphones had issues with battery life. The cellphone card-carrying case and the car phone mount were nice touches too! Would recommend for anyone looking for a reliable headphone for the gym/running/etc.,B01G8JO5F2
Awesome headphones. Great sound and they don’t fall out,B01G8JO5F2
Very good value. Headphones connected easily and hold a charge much longer than I expected.,B01G8JO5F2
All of the controls are in the earpiece so you don't have the control box dangling from one of the wires which often times  makes them unbalanced and pull to one side or the other.  Durable cable and fits snug in the ear with great bass.  i bought another for backup which I haven't had to open yet!  Battery lasts quite long as It hasn't run out on me while using them.,B01G8JO5F2
"I was excited to receive these headphone, but they will not stay in my ears.  I put the smallest earbuds on, and they still won't stay in my ears.  I am a 64 year old female.",B01G8JO5F2
Love being able to skip tracks by long-pressing the volume buttons. Sound is decent given how inexpensive these are. Great for the gym where it's mostly to block out background noise and play music to help pass the time. Sweatproof thus far after using them almost every day for months. Works okay for online meetings and phone calls. Not ideal for true audiophile experiences.,B01G8JO5F2
"Great for walks, exercise and tuning out the kids....lol<br />Second pair.....dog ate the first.",B01G8JO5F2
This is my second pair.  They are great and the company is fantastic!!!,B01G8JO5F2
"I've been buying these same headphones for years. They used to last atleaet a year before the battery started failing. Now, I've went through 4 pair in 4 months. I'm a construction foreman and have them in most of the day so that I can hear someone calling me. The static and feedback in the calls is terrible. These used to be different. Best for the money. Now, not so much. Would not recommend at all, garbage.",B01G8JO5F2
Great product,B01G8JO5F2
They were good.,B01G8JO5F2
I ordered these hoping to use them at the gym or while cycling. Even when the volume is turned all the way up they don't seem to produce enough sound for me to be able to enjoy the music or podcast. They are constantly falling out of my ears even after changing the insert pads. sigh.,B01G8JO5F2
"I purchased this item for my son-in-law who is very discriminating about electronic gear. I had to wait a few days to get some feedback from him and I think he said it all with one sentence: ""These earphones have a much better sound than others I have tried that were much more expensive."" The message is clear: Your company sells great quality merchandise at competitive prices. Who would not want to recommend your business and great service to anyone looking for this type of merchandise?  I heartily recommend you as a source for well-made gear and courteous service.",B01G8JO5F2
"Work great with all phones, no need to pay $150 (or more) for BT headphones that are easily lost. Great product, good sound, connects reliably.",B01G8JO5F2
Terrible design for fitting and staying on your ears...in a crowd the Phone has to be within6” to a foot away to it will sputter and spurt,B01G8JO5F2
What a great product,B01G8JO5F2
Awesome,B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these years ago and I am just now needing new ones. I always use them instead of my airpods because the sound quality, noise cancellation & noise leaking are way better. The battery also lasts a very long time. Definitely recommend.",B01G8JO5F2
Great sound quality.,B01G8JO5F2
Hands down the best headphones I ever bought. The customer service was exceptional and honor their warranty claim. I highly recommend them.,B01G8JO5F2
"Good product.  I've tried multiple types of bluetooth headphones.  These are consistently reliable.  I use at work, and gym.  Sometimes readjustment required, but tolerable.",B01G8JO5F2
"The earbuds are great for general use, NOT good for sport.....<br /><br />I use these usually when I'm going around town shopping.  I also used them at the gym when I am lifting.  They are excellent for all of that.<br /><br />Any sort of obsctruction gives these problems though.  When I am riding around on my skateboard, with my phone in my pocket, I get bluetooth interference.  Music keeps cutting out for a second every 10 seconds.  After awhile it gets very annoying.  When I am working out outside doing pushups/pullups with the phone just about 10 feet away, same thing.  Even if I am just walking around.<br /><br />I don't know what it is about just still and inside that makes these work but not outside with minimal movement.  This has happened on 2 phones, so the only constant are the earbuds.  I don't know why walking around the grocery store is fine but walking in the park is not.  I have tried other earbuds and they do not have that problem.",B01G8JO5F2
"They are great sound quality the earpieces that he product comes with are great they fit any ear, the ear wrap pieces are flexible with a rigid core so they stay moulded, great headphones, but the warranty is baloney, I bought these circa 4 months ago and they just randomly stopped working and the microphone is not the best it started randomly going in and out then the headphones wouldn't take a charge.",B01G8JO5F2
Stopped working after 10 weeks - purchased as Christmas gift - Amazon return window closed Jan 31  Support window closed March 3  And now they stopped working -  Contacted manufacturer - they are taking care of issue.  Great customer service.,B01G8JO5F2
I have had several of these in the past.  The last pair came and the volume on one side was significantly louder than the other side.  No matter what I did I could not get it to work properly.  I had a lot of things going on at the time and I missed the deadline to return them.,B01G8JO5F2
"The biggest pro of using this product is that it's wireless. Also, it has buttons on it which I can press to pause videos/songs and so I can be handsfree and don't need to reach my phone to perform those actions. The only con I felt after using this for over 4 months is that the noise suppression is very bad. Whenever I am on a voice/video call, the recipient of the call is always disturbed by the noises around me which they can hear even clearly than my own voice.",B01G8JO5F2
"Work well.  Very secure.  Unsure of noise cancellation- can't really tell.  Others are right that there is little to no warning that the battery is low, so its on you to keep them charged!  These are my first wireless set, so difficult to compare.",B01G8JO5F2
"Had these headphones for a little over 2 years, awesome product. But today I swam with them on and now they won’t come back on",B01G8JO5F2
"The headphones worked beautifully at first, but then the power button got stuck inside and it was all over.",B01G8JO5F2
"Third try with Bluetooth head phones and these are the best ever, great sound, cancels out everything, I love them!",B01G8JO5F2
It’s very bad at pairing. It takes forever and I have to turn it on and off a bunch of times and reset my bluetooth a bunch,B01G8JO5F2
"I have had much more expensive head phones, and these preform just as good. Now I must admit that I am only listing to spoken word info (audio books and pod casts) so music lovers I Cannot comment.",B01G8JO5F2
"I love the sound quality, it's the ear piece that can't close down so it won't wiggle.",B01G8JO5F2
Works well for the price. Cann connect to both mac and iphone at the same time. decent sound quality and battery back up,B01G8JO5F2
"Got these for the wife for Christmas.  She loves the way they feel and sound.  She gets no distortion even when she turns them up high enough to block me and the kid out.  She's been picky about the way ear buds have felt before, but the size options that came included and general designed have worked perfectly for her.  I'd recommend for sure.",B01G8JO5F2
Like,B01G8JO5F2
"I really loved these headphones, but they have stopped working. They only worked for about 8 months before they gave out. For some reason they won't turn on...",B01G8JO5F2
"These are better than the $150 Google Pixel Buds I have. Perfect for working out, different size ear buds let you choose the size that fits best for your ears. Great value, can't stress that enough.<br /><br />Worked out with them 8 times in the last couple weeks and haven't had to charge them yet. Def recommend my friends,",B01G8JO5F2
I had a pair of these initially with the static ear pieces and bought a second pair for at work and home. The moldable ear pieces don't hold their shape and fall off my ears. Still haven't decided if I'm going to return them or not. Not super happy about ordering the same exact product 6-8 months later and getting completely different accessories and hardware. The headphones even sound different than my old ones.,B01G8JO5F2
""" I've used them three times at the gym for about 45 minutes each time and so far so good. They were easy to configure with my iPhone. Good product at this price point.""",B01G8JO5F2
"For the price this are pretty good headphones. I use them mainly at the gym, comes with various size cushions to adapt to your eat",B01G8JO5F2
Bought 2 pair and continually had issues with pairing and connectivity.  Poor phone sound quality.  I used these when biking and they would often disconnect from my phone calls.  They stopped pairing with my device within a year.  Reported the issue to customer service and they offered me a 5%discount on my next purchase.  That's a WHOLE DOLLAR OFF!  Big of them.  Don't waste your money.,B01G8JO5F2
I bought these for $27 I believe and they are the best I ever had I had your phone they cost me $166 are the best,B01G8JO5F2
Very difficult to get in your ears and kind of painful. Very annoying. Too much of a hassle to use.,B01G8JO5F2
"Definitely waterproof, mine went through a complete wash cycle and came out working great.",B01G8JO5F2
The sound quality is great! Battery life is so long. Use the headphone more than 6 hours everyday.  Bought 2nd pair.,B01G8JO5F2
I have tiny ear canals and these really work. They stay on my ears without discomfort.  My second pair of Senso headphones  because I always have a pair charging!,B01G8JO5F2
"This is my second one and the quality is very good, I recommend to buy this item",B01G8JO5F2
"I've had these earbuds for about 9 months, daily use, they are comfortable, easy to use, pairs reliably, buttons are easy to use, they have been very reliable.  However, at the 9 month mark, the charging light went out and after trying to charge it for a few hours to check if the light was just faulty or they are simply no longer charging, it was the latter.  I am leaving this as a 4-star review for now because they are a good earbud, and will see if the warranty (1 year is honored).",B01G8JO5F2
"Great product. Easy to set up and good battery life. The case makes it convenient to throw in a gym bag or work tote and includes a compartment for the charging cable. This is my third pair. Now I have one to keep at office, one for the gym, and one for my husband.",B01G8JO5F2
"Worked great, then stopped charging after 2 1/2 years",B01G8JO5F2
Very comfortable and fit very snuggly.,B01G8JO5F2
"Easy to charge and set up. While I did actually read the directions, it was not really necessary. I am thrilled with the sound and the entire purchase. I am a happy man who enjoys listening to great music while I am sweating like twelve rats wrestling in a wool sock. Hands free SENSO is awesome!",B01G8JO5F2
ARE YOU KIDDING ME!! For this price!! What a great set of ear buds that have Bluetooth capabilities. Excellent sound quality. You get these and it won’t disappoint.,B01G8JO5F2
I’m a runner and I thought the over the ear hook would keep them in my ear. They constantly work their way out.,B01G8JO5F2
These headphones are great! Especially for the price.. I workout everyday so I use them all the time!,B01G8JO5F2
I bought these headphones for exercising. They stopped working after a year.,B01G8JO5F2
"They're cheap, battery life is great, bluetooth connection is fine. Sound quality isn't something I care about much when I'm running/exercising, so it's not really relevant. It's fine.<br /><br />The reason I keep buying them is that they keep dying. These are not effectively waterproof and I believe sweat has ruined the charging on all three sets. They last a few months, then the charging connection gets sporadic and has to be in just the right position, and then they stop charging entirely. I tend to limp them along for about 12 months, but it's annoying and I'm not doing that with my 3rd pair. I'm ordering something else so I don't have to wonder if my headphones will be charged in the morning or not.<br /><br />When they work they're fine. They just need to seal the charging port better and they would stop dying. Then again, if they did that right they'd have only gotten 30$ off me for my first set instead of 70$ for buying 3.<br /><br />I know I'm basically buying the cheapest thing I can find, but the charging situation is obnoxious. There's no way these can be submerged for 10 seconds much less 30 minutes when I know my sweat is corroding the charging port after 3 months.",B01G8JO5F2
"The headphones are on par with some wireless headphones that cost much more. The quality, sound, battery life and ease of use is what stood out to me. I would definitely recommend to a friend. If I had a gripe, the right ear hook kept coming off even after I bent it to fit my ear. I’m come to the conclusion, it’s probably my ears, they stick out a little more than normal.",B01G8JO5F2
I bought this item twice. The first time it only lasted a week. I purchased another one as I like the sound quality but sadly it only lasted a little over a month.,B01G8JO5F2
the worst headphones I have ever bought. the sound is the worst and the audio quality of the calls is horrible.,B01G8JO5F2
"I've had these for almost 2 years now.  They honestly are worth every penny.  I use them mon-fri, 8hrs a day behind a grinder sharpening knives all day.  Even with the dirty atmosphere and metal shavings they work great.  Even if they only last 6 months I would buy them every 6 months.  Just reliable as heck.  Simple 3 buttons. on off.  volume up down. and change songs. If I had to complain it would be make the battery last a little bit longer. But like I said almost 2 years and they still last about 7hrs.  Can't beat the value. TRY THEM!",B01G8JO5F2
"While they were reliably good quality while I used them, they would not charge or turn on after a month of use. I'm disappointed, the only reason I'm rating two instead of one is that they worked for a bit before finally deciding to quit on me.",B01G8JO5F2
Works great.,B01G8JO5F2
Ze escuchan los ruidos externos. Las personas cuando me llamaron no me escuchan bien,B01G8JO5F2
Very good,B01G8JO5F2
Great product that comes with multiple accessories. The low price doesn't match the high value. More than 5 stars! Thank you,B01G8JO5F2
Lo uso para correr es muy bueno,B01G8JO5F2
"The Senso version seems as if it comes from the same basic design as others you can find but the sound quality has less bass (or more highs) depending on your perspective. The extra ""goodies"" are an added touch over the competition. The lady with the English accent tells me when it turns on and off and the battery level is low.",B01G8JO5F2
"I've had this almost two years now, and they still work really well. Good, affordable head phones. I highly recommend these!",B01G8JO5F2
I had a pair Of these for a couple of years that were great! But they wore out so ordered another. These don’t seem to have the same sound quality as the others I had. I’m hoping that after I change out the ear pieces and have a better fit in the ear that they’ll sound better. Crossing fingers..,B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these a couple of years ago and was seriously impressed with the value for money. Sadly I lost my pair and had to get some new ones. The updated version has inflexible rubber bands that are hard to wrap around your ears, they sit uncomfortably around the ear and don't feel secure. The sound quality is not as good and the on/off message isn't as clear. Very disappointed. The original headphones were superior.",B01G8JO5F2

I used these for workouts and I loved them!,B01G8JO5F2
"Loves first: sound quality and amount of bass is awesome, the multiple silicone sized earbuds, and the fast charge (usually in an hour).<br />What I like less: the hooks over the ears are a tad too flimsy (I’m pretty sure it’s a thicker wire than what it feels like but it feels flimsy to me) and you can’t walk more than 10 feet away before the signal starts breaking up.",B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these wireless headphones on September 27, 2018 for my iPad Pro, whose headphone jack had stopped functioning properly. When they came the packaging was nice, intact, and everything in it was undamaged. The instructions manual is very clear and pairing the headphones to my device was a breeze. They worked plenty better than the 20 dollar non-wireless headphones I had before.<br />They lasted until February 2019, when the headphones didn’t turn on after being reset and fully charged. Costumer service was very quick to respond. I received a free new replacement since there is a year warranty.<br />What you need to know:<br />-The quality of the wireless headphones and bonuses are great- much better than what you’d expect for the price.<br />-The connection didn’t cut for me unless the headphones ran out of battery or I completely covered the sides of my iPad. I can stand a good 20 feet from my device without any disconnecting or decrease in sound quality.<br />-I used these while running on my treadmill at my house without problem. They didn’t fall out and connection didn’t cut.<br />-They do a good job cancelling out unwanted ambient noise, although that ultimately varies depending on how noisy your surroundings are.<br />-I can put these on after just minutes of getting out of the rain/shower and the water seems to have no effect on them.<br />-Very good battery life and recharges quickly.<br />-Great price.<br />-Great warranty.<br />-Great customer service. Best I’ve seen so far.<br />I highly suggest you buy these. Very good product.",B01G8JO5F2
The product delivers on all key features.,B01G8JO5F2
"These broke after 3 weeks, they are not tested or properly refurbished. Do not buy this. Amazon and Senso will refuse to help you.",B01G8JO5F2
"I ordered these first as a gift, having reviewed them/many others extensively before buying. I was impressed by their reviews, especially for the price and bought a pair for myself. I am so glad I did. The bass, sound, and microphone quality are excellent!",B01G8JO5F2
""" These Bluetooth headsets arrived earlier than expected. I am super impressed with these, work great, when I have these on I don't hear the noise and yelling from my upstairs neighbors, I am super sensitive to noise so that alone has me very satisfied that I don't have to have the headset volume set high either. These are a must have.""",B01G8JO5F2
"Well I’m probably not the best critic for these ear buds since I have not ever had or used wireless ear phones, but I really like these earphones. They have as good sound quality as my apple XR ear phones. Best of all, they are wireless which makes it so much more enjoyable at the gym. I have to charge them every night though.",B01G8JO5F2
"Since there are a lot of brands that are priced much higher, I didn't want to write before I give myself enough time to experience the quality of the sound. To my good surprise I found that the SENSO Bluetooth Headphones provide a high quality stereo sound that is both deep and without any static. The battery life is as long as 8 hours or a little more. The material is good and the box contains various sizes of ear buds. I think it competes very well with other higher-priced Bluetooth Headphones.",B01G8JO5F2
"The headphones are a bit clunky to use.  The ear pieces are huge and have to be bent around your ear.  The sound quality is good but after a period of a few months, they did not take or hold a charge.  Since they are under warranty the company is sending new ones.  I must say that their customer service has been excellent and very responsive.",B01G8JO5F2
Good price for good product,B01G8JO5F2
Sufficiently loud in high-decible work environment,B01G8JO5F2
"Bought these for my husband for his birthday. They were amazing headphones. However, we’ve had them less than two years and they won’t charge anymore. Very bummed.",B01G8JO5F2
"The sound is horrible, and more like a bee hive. I don't feel like using it so bad. The bliethooth connection is good, but the sound that comes out of the box looks like those headphones from the 1980s.",B01G8JO5F2
These headphones are literally perfect for the price. My favorite set of headphones yet.,B01G8JO5F2
Good product for working out with.,B01G8JO5F2
"My daughter loves them.  Uses them schoolwork, soccer on bus etc..  Very happy with purchase and charge lasts a long time.  Delivered as expected.",B01G8JO5F2
"very well made nice packaged,  I like the carrying case and all the other little extras they give you.  there are one set of earbuds in there they are made of foam like earplug material, they make for an excellent fit",B01G8JO5F2
"The headphones have great premium sound alike other brands they are not expensive. I use it for gym as they are sweat proof. It's perfectly fit into my ear, and don't fall off while running or doing exercises.",B01G8JO5F2
"Worked for a little over a year and just stopped (they turn themselves off, even on a full charge). And there’s no way to contact the company after they stopped working. ‘Fanatical” customer support, indeed.",B01G8JO5F2
"They worked great for the first year.  After that they would go in and out when I ran when my hand would go down.  Assuming it was the Bluetooth connectivity.  When that started happening, I decided to test out the waterproof rating which it claims it has. IPX7 is for 3 meters or less for 30 minutes or less.  I swam for 10 minutes never going more than two feet deep and they busted on the first lap.  They were already busting so I am not too sad about it.  DO NOT BUY if you plan on swimming or need long term earbuds.",B01G8JO5F2
This is my second pair. Amazing quality and value. I can’t think of anything I would change about these.,B01G8JO5F2
"Great earplugs, but they aren't very waterproof due to me having them 6 days and one side is quieter than the other.",B01G8JO5F2
"For the gym/exercising they are fine. But if you’re like me, and use wireless headphones for multitasking (being hands-free) then they are terrible to talk on the phone. They pick-up so much background noise and are staticky.",B01G8JO5F2
I like the adjustable fitting and it actually has pretty good quality for its price,B01G8JO5F2
Use them all the time for the gym.<br />They hace great battery life.,B01G8JO5F2
Some of the cheapest best I’ve ever had. After 3 years it’s time to retire them.,B01G8JO5F2
"I needed Bluetooth headphones that were comfortable and ideal for working out in. The ones I have had in the past, although very good, were very uncomfortable behind my ears and I couldn't workout in them because they would fall off.  I had also changed jobs where I no longer had my own office but was now in a cubicle on an open floor.  So most importantly I needed noise reduction, not cancellation because I still need to hear if my phone rings or someone calls my name.  These so far have checked all of my boxes. The quality is really good! Not to mention the battery life. I rarely have to charge this. My only issue is that it can only pair with one device at a time.  My other Bluetooth headset can pair with two devices. I have two phones, one personal and one for work so it's a bit inconvenient sometimes that I have to switch it from device to device.  That's the only reason so far that I didn't given it all 5 stars. I have and would recommend it to others.<br /><br />Update: I am disappointed to report that these headphones just stopped charging one day. There is no explanation for it as I put it to charge the same way I always have. So I guess it's not a long term investment. But while it worked it worked very well so I would not change my rating.",B01G8JO5F2
Brilliant product all the way. I use it for motorcycling and it works perfectly. The sound quality is way better than expected with crisp clear music and bass. Bluetooth works perfectly and instant connection. Feels good to wear and holds tightly. 3 pairs of ear bud sizes to fit all,B01G8JO5F2
Love these,B01G8JO5F2
I bought these to work out in and I love them!  They have lived up to everything the description described.  I would definitely buy them again.,B01G8JO5F2
I use for walking and needed buds that would stay in my ears. Like the small cord to keep me from losing them.,B01G8JO5F2
good sound for the price,B01G8JO5F2
"Had these for just over a month (unfortunately) just longer than the return window.  You get what you pay for in terms of sound quality, tended to have some problems with getting a clear signal via Bluetooth.  Not the easiest to adjust to your ears and they never seemed to stay at the an adjustment that worked. Worst of all they will no longer charge.  I had a similar set (assuming same manufacturer) that had other charging issues.  I’d stay clear of these or any other similar set.",B01G8JO5F2
I bought these earbuds to be something cheap use while running and sweating. While they look in your ears and stay in place pretty well they sound pretty good and they've held up to sweat after about five months of using two or three times a week my battery no longer holds a charge when I turn them on they say they're at 80% 20 minutes later they're dead and won't stay paired to my phone not too bad for the price I guess but I'm going to keep looking for something better,B01G8JO5F2
"Used these for working out, conference calls  and just listening to music. The sound is great and the quality is tops.",B01G8JO5F2
Great sound quality. Stays put during workout. Definitely reccomend,B01G8JO5F2
"Love these headphones! Great sound, pair immediately with my phone with a clear voice that says ""connected"", charge seems to last a long time, and they work as a phone headset far better than my $200 Plantronics headset - for less than 20 bucks!",B01G8JO5F2
"Great Sound Quality, very comfortable, easy to use.",B01G8JO5F2
"I wear these headphones when running and am very pleased.  Sound quality is great, noise canceling is good, pleased with the battery life.  They stay in your ears when running, if you are on the treadmill you can hardly hear the belt.  I use them with a 7th gen iPod nano and they sync quickly.  Ive tried them with other devices and they have no problem syncing.  Had them on the other day and left our workout room in the basement and went upstairs and noticed they started to cut out when I was on the patio, then I realized I left the nano downstairs: These things are awesome for the price!  I can't understand why anyone would buy one of the high priced sets like beats, other then they want to show off.",B01G8JO5F2
Good,B01G8JO5F2
"Got my SENSO headphones late last year.  I was really impressed by the gorgeous design and superb stereo sound, plus it fits comfortably on your ears.  I literally use it everyday--when I watch a movie, listen to music, audiobook or podcast.<br /><br />Recently, I had a setback when one of the earbuds stopped functioning.  Then I remembered that this product has a 1-year warranty.<br /><br />I contacted the seller thru the Amazon website.  I did not expect much, but, to my surprise, Tekatron responded promptly and courteously.<br /><br />Tekatron gave me this assurance: ""Our products go through a strict quality check but there may be rare cases when a product turns out to be faulty.""<br /><br />Tekatron has promised to send me a replacement soon.  Problem solved.",B01G8JO5F2

"This is a great product and perfect for my workouts. However, more than that, Senso's costumer service has proven to be particularly exceptional and I would definitely recommend them to my friends and family.",B01G8JO5F2
I’ve had 2 pairs of these 3 years. Only reason I got a new pair was I stepped on my first pair or I’d probably still have the original. Great sound quality and noise canceling. Good price for the quality. They last all week on a charge listening to music while studying and going on 2-3 30+ minute runs.,B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these because so many people have had great luck with them. The packaging is awesome, they look and feel well made and they give you some great accessories, but the headphones sucked for me. The bluetooth connection is absolutely terrible. Some days they work better than others. Most days I have to keep my iPhone in my pocket for them to stay connected. If I left my phone by my workout bench they would start disconnecting and skipping if I walked a few feet away to grab a weight. If I leave my phone on the gym floor to do pull-ups, they will skip at the top of the pull-up..... These are seriously HORRIBLE and the sound quality is something that you would find in $5 gas station headphones.",B01G8JO5F2
"Great sound quality, very good instructions, comfortable to wear and love the carrying case!",B01G8JO5F2
I love the quality of the sound and the bass that the headphones have. Also how great the headphones are with cancelling out all distractions and outside noise.,B01G8JO5F2
They work and they don't fall off my ears when I climb or trail run,B01G8JO5F2
dasent water droop,B01G8JO5F2
These headphones are work well so far I have no issues.,B01G8JO5F2
I do hear wind in them and push on my tragis piercing. But they sound good.,B01G8JO5F2
The headphones are great! I use them for my morning workouts.,B01G8JO5F2
They came out of box with the charging port loose and wouldn't line up. I tried a few things and made it worse Also made requesting a refund a dishonest idea so I love the design but will eat the lose glad they weren't expensive.,B01G8JO5F2
"Good sound quality, but the bendable arms that hold the earbuds in place aren’t stuff enough to do the job. They bend too easily. Unfortunately I figured this out after the return window closed.",B01G8JO5F2
"I have run for years. These ear buds are so worth the bang for their buck. Good sound, stay charged for long periods of time, fit well... and so reasonable. My first pair finally petered out after 5 years of using them consistently. So happy to see they were still available! They lasted through 22 miles of my marathon... and that was my old pair. I have to think a fresh battery would last even longer!",B01G8JO5F2
"I wear these headphones for all kinds of weather conditions and so far they work no matter what. I can use them in the gym, and they are affordable when I misplace them.",B01G8JO5F2
The connection is intermittent and stopped working after a few months. The battery holds for 4-5hrs on a good day. The sound quality is fair.,B01G8JO5F2
I do not recommend you purchase this item! Not worth your money. It will not hold charge,B01G8JO5F2
"Have issues with the units staying in my ear ... shouldn't happen with the ear hooks.  Other than that,  they work and sound great.",B01G8JO5F2
You must be wearing both at the same time or else they fall off constantly.  If you don’t clip it to your clothes you can’t wear one side Easily,B01G8JO5F2
"These are amazing, and only had to be replaced after 3 years because TSA lost them at the airport!  Ours even worked after running in the pouring rain multiple times.",B01G8JO5F2
""" I love everything about this product! They say presentation is everything. The packaging and everything that went with it was top quality and sound produced was tremendous! So satisfied! Gave to my absolute non-techie husband and if he was impressed, you guys gotta be good. Gonna order another for myself.""",B01G8JO5F2
Absolutely the worst for phone calls. I cant hear the caller and I have to almost yell for them to hear me,B01G8JO5F2
Love them,B01G8JO5F2
I've used these many times over several years and they are still working great. I don't like the true wireless earbuds so these are a great alternative,B01G8JO5F2
"I needed these for voice calls not music and either way they are not as loud as you would want them to be. Trust me . You need complete silence to say they are not too bad .. The charger stopped charging on my 3rd attempt as well. Had to use a different one. Other than that I still use them and they are only ok. Oh , and battery life is not too bad either . Hope this helps",B01G8JO5F2
"These are really very good for the money.  I wear them in the gym and on the trail. They stay in, sweat and motion doesn't bother them. The instructions say not to charge them over night, but I do almost constantly and they still work. They're easy to turn on and off and they pair instantly with my Apple Watch 4. Its also easy answer phone calls.",B01G8JO5F2
"I bought two pair of these in September of 2017, one for me and one for my wife.  We both loved the sound quality but both of us had issues with the fit, for me, the left ear bud would always slip, the right was great.  Recently, however, the volume/skip buttons on my wife's set fell out.  They still work, she just can't change volume or song from the earbud.  Mine won't charge.  I have tried several different cords but nothing works.  The battery died and there is nothing I can do.  They were pretty reasonable but for $30ish I would like them to last a few years more.",B01G8JO5F2
Exercise,B01G8JO5F2
Very nice quality and sound for the price.. I use them at the gym everyday and they stay in my ears when I'm working out.,B01G8JO5F2
"I just received it. It did NOT come with a Short Charging cable! The wallet card is unnecessary, a cable would have been great! This was probably a previously returned item that I received. Cant charge them so I currently dont know how they work.",B01G8JO5F2
"These are great, i recently bought some ear buds that have a rechargable case as replacements, but they're trash compared to these.",B01G8JO5F2
"Because I'm contractor in carpentry it allows me to listen with cords getting way while working. Also it great for keeping my phone safe while working, can leave 25ft plus away .",B01G8JO5F2
Good,B01G8JO5F2
"Believe it or not, this head set is much better than a lot of other sets worth over 100 $, I bought 5 of those and i still couldnt find one that would be as loud as this one.",B01G8JO5F2
This is my first set of wireless earphones and they are much better than I thought was possible without wires. The only problem I noticed while out walking is that the music I was listening to would cut out intermittently. Not a major problem but noticeable. The noise cancellation is a lot better than on other wired earphones I own.,B01G8JO5F2
"I lost my first pair but loved it so much I had to get another. My second pair did not work, but I was able to replace it using their warranty.",B01G8JO5F2
Those headphones has not noise cancelling!!! I bought the same many months ago and after many time using it I broke it so I had to replace it buying for the same brand and model and everything is the same.<br /><br />Otherwise I bought it because I really like the sound of those not for noise cancelling,B01G8JO5F2
Work great sound great with a great price,B01G8JO5F2
I love these!!! I use them at the gym and so far sweat hasn’t damaged anything. I love the volume control on the headphones itself so handy!,B01G8JO5F2
"Great head phones, reasonable price and I love that there are multiple ear bud sizes. I hate having anything pushing into my ear canal but the small huds work great and are very comfortable!",B01G8JO5F2
Lasted a while and the left headphone went out. They were cheap so it didn’t matter all that much. Quality is decent but didn’t last,B01G8JO5F2
Usb port for charging broke off,B01G8JO5F2
me encantan tiene muy buen sonido,B01G8JO5F2
i liked the price and the product,B01G8JO5F2
It is great not to be tethered to a device.  I am amazed at how far away I can get from my tablet and still hear the sound perfectly.,B01G8JO5F2
"I've had these headphones for almost two years and they've finally died on me. For the first few months they were great, but gradually the bluetooth connection got weaker, battery life decreased where I had to charge it every day, and sound quality lagged. I held on trying to factory reset and save money for something better, but had to write this review because now it's completely not working.",B01G8JO5F2
I just had my third pair die on me. I take good care of them. They just don't last.,B01G8JO5F2
Great value,B01G8JO5F2
"Ok sound quality, but for some reason wnot stay firmly in place, I continuously keep reseat them.",B01G8JO5F2
"The sound quality is perfect as well as noise cancellation. Battery life is on average also. The only concern when using this product is depending on size of ears. Smaller ears have a hard time fixing it. Because of the design of the product itself, it makes it harder to enjoy the music since it usually falls off my ears.",B01G8JO5F2
Love them. They are great for running and you can’t beat the price.,B01G8JO5F2
"Still going strong, unfortunately they're uncomfortable!",B01G8JO5F2
"Have not opened this pair yet.  Bought them for my husband for his birthday. I’ve have mine for almost a year and have enjoyed them tremendously.  Easy to pair up, easy to use, great tone and charge lasts quite a long time.  Can’t wait to see how much he enjoys his!",B01G8JO5F2
Omg finally! I've been looking high and dry for loud headphones for my Peloton and these are great. So loud that I can't turn them up all the way! Can't wait to ride later!,B01G8JO5F2
love it works amazzing,B01G8JO5F2
Best wireless earphones I have purchased!,B01G8JO5F2
"Update from previous review: I had bought my 3rd pair of these headphones despite the issues I outlined below I still felt like for the price they were decent but now I’ve reduced rating from 3 to 1 star. Don’t buy these. From the moment I first turned this latest pair on I could tell the quality had declined even further from the previous 2 pairs (first pair was pretty great, 2nd just ok) They feel cheaper and you have to hold the button longer to turn on you can tell the company is cutting corners and reducing the quality. This pair broke after about 7 months. The charging port basically fell apart so I can’t charge them anymore. Done with this brand.<br /><br />These were really great while they lasted. They fit and stay better around my ears than any other cordless headset I’ve bought. I guess for most electronics these days you can’t expect them to last more than a year but I’m still kinda bummed they just stopped working almost exactly a year from when I purchased them. Now they will connect to my Bluetooth for a couple seconds but then turn off so basically they’re done. I’d rate them 4.5 stars for how well they functioned while working. My only complaint (besides the 1 year shelf life) is I  wish they gave you more of a warning when the battery was dying. They only tell you when you have maybe 3-6 minutes left.",B01G8JO5F2
Best value for money you can get. Works great. Very comfortable while running.,B01G8JO5F2
Can not walk away from my phone . It stactic,B01G8JO5F2
"I have had few wireless head phones; Bose, beats earbuds, beats headphones,  ect. These headphones ridiculously rival my Bose ($170) earbuds. When it comes to these and my beats, I wear these over my beats any day.  Other than run time they're better im every way; comfort,  loudness. Bass. Wind can be a factor with these but not to the point that they're rendered useless.  I've had them for a few years and i don't treat them well at all and they've held up fine.  I was gifted my beats after owning these...i don't use my beats",B01G8JO5F2
"I had these earphones for about three months when they suddenly kept disconnecting.  The slightest movement and it just cut off.  Resetting them did nothing to fix it.  Great when they lasted, but three months is way too short.",B01G8JO5F2
The ear part that goes around the ear is way to wide and big it doesn’t even hook around the ear and the headphones keep falling out of ear,B01G8JO5F2
"Not sure who’s reviewing these, but the sound from the kid driving down the road is clearer.",B01G8JO5F2
"I've been a fan of the older version of this product for a few years.  I think my first pair lasted more than 24 months of regular gym-going a few days a week.  They were an amazing fit, and once I found the right cushion for my ears, never fell out during vigorous use.  I did have issues keeping two devices paired.  The voice that came on for connected/disconnected can be problematic if you range out of the second device.  It was annoying.  But I also noticed intermittent, momentary sound interruption on my listening device when it was paired to both.  So I only use them on one device.<br />The left side of my old pair eventually failed (an honorable demise), so I replaced them with this new unit. In this version, I've had the same intermittent sound issues when pairing two devices.  The connected/disconnected voice is still present, but... okay.  I had some very big issues getting them to stay in my ears as well.  But I later discovered that the over-ear armatures have a wire in them, and between that adjustment and some wear I've made the fit tolerable.  There is a bigger issue though in this new pair I have.  These devices periodically loose Bluetooth connection to my tablet: usually at 5-10 minutes of listening, and then about every 20 minutes thereafter.  I do not have the same issue with my other Bluetooth headphones and the same listening device (an iPad).<br />The negatives now outweigh the advantages of this product, and I am likely to look for a different make in my next purchase.  I appreciate the price point of this device, and my experience with the older version was fairly good.  But I find this new version far more irritating.",B01G8JO5F2
After 2 weeks will not turn on.,B01G8JO5F2
"Very easy to pair with other devices, easy to use, great sound",B01G8JO5F2
Setup is quick and easy,B01G8JO5F2
I had a pair before that i loved. I broke them and felt i had to get a new pair. This paid people say they cant hear me.,B01G8JO5F2
"They are a Christmas gift,so their not open yet.",B01G8JO5F2
This an excellent product for the cost..,B01G8JO5F2
"thank you for your prompt replacement of my senso ear buds.. i love this style, but this pair wouldn't hold a charge",B01G8JO5F2
Good for the price keep that in mind,B01G8JO5F2
"For the price you can’t beat these.  I listen to news , podcasts and audio books for the most part, so they are awesome! Could stand to have longer battery life like all of these.",B01G8JO5F2
Great for the price only gripe is they can be a little cumbersome trying to get them seated in your ear with the little behind the ear plastic piece.,B01G8JO5F2
Exellent goods!,B01G8JO5F2
Comfortable fit,B01G8JO5F2
I thought this one would be better than the previous ones I purchased but it is basically the same. The quality is substandard and sound quality is nothing to write home about. I gave it to my daughter because I am fed up,B01G8JO5F2
"These were great and I used them in the gym, out on runs or sometimes while cleaning the house but one day while listening 3 months after I got them they just stopped playing. They will connect and at the end of saying my headset is connected it just cuts off and there is no sound. So for 3 months they were great and then they all of a sudden just won’t work. I mean I know they aren’t expensive and you expect them to work for a long time but I expected them to work longer than 3 months",B01G8JO5F2
"GREAT sound quality use for work and gym , cant beat the price .",B01G8JO5F2
"I am enjoying using these headphones while I work out, in the car, around the house.  I needed a lightweight set with a solid mic and good sound quality and these fit the bill.",B01G8JO5F2
Awesome product with many extras! Worth every penny! 👍,B01G8JO5F2
I needed some low profile headphones for when I run and these work fine.,B01G8JO5F2
Good product for the price. No noise cancellation at all.,B01G8JO5F2
The sound is great and they fit well. However after about 10-20 mins on my neck they radiate my neck and make this weird tingling burning sensation on my neck. I had to stop using them. Taking them back,B01G8JO5F2
"My fave pair of headphones! Sound is wonderful and bass is exploding! They don't stay in my ears as well as they should for a ""sport"" pair. The range is fantastic. I can go into other rooms and even outside and leave my device in another room.",B01G8JO5F2
"I'm really pleased with my purchase, thank you for the service and the concern.",B01G8JO5F2
"I've purchased two of these now over the last couple years, and they are excellent. The company ships fast, the product is solid and the price is very competitive. Strongly recommended if you're looking for a blue tooth headset that is functional, reliable and comfortable.",B01G8JO5F2
Great product for price.  Use at gym.,B01G8JO5F2
Way cheaper than Bose or ipods! And Sound as Good 👍,B01G8JO5F2
Hi all - I got these for my boyfriend who is training for a 10-mile run in the spring for xmas. They broke! He used them a lot and they were pretty solid for most of January but I guess they are meant for light use :(,B01G8JO5F2
"These sound so so much better than my Bose. I love them. If you like bass, get these.",B01G8JO5F2
"The first time I ordered these headphones. They worked fine, just got another pair. And it's worse, doesn't do anything that it did before. Like noise cancellation, etc. Now it's cutting on and off of the sound. Save your money.",B01G8JO5F2
"Have had for over a year now and have been excellent. Sound is great, for the price I paid feel like I got a steal of a deal!",B01G8JO5F2
"Use these for the gym, and I love them! Great for gifts too!",B01G8JO5F2
"The headphones worked fine for a while, however the skip track button no longer works, and I've been having some connectivity issues. I registered the product through the company's website, and I'm yet to receive a response on how to get them replaced. The actual product is pretty solid, however so far the customer service and ""one year warranty"" have not been.",B01G8JO5F2
Terrible...they kept cutting out after 2 weeks of use. I had to order a new set (different brand) because they were so bad.,B01G8JO5F2
The headphones paired very easily with my Pixel2.  It is so much easier than my wired earphones. The battery last forever.,B01G8JO5F2
muy poco volumen,B01G8JO5F2
"I bought a set of these 3 years ago and have loved them! They've managed to hold up great over that time even given my less than gentle nature and clumsiness. They've gone through the wash at least 4-5 times too lol. I came back looking to buy a fully wireless set of earphones as the battery life at all those washes and 3 years of daily use is down to a couple of hours. I tried the Pasonomi x9... What a dissappointment absolutely terrible sound tinny, no bass, none of the tips were comfortable or gave a good seal. I put the tips from these Senso's on and they were comfortable but still terrible sound and very noticeable lag, despite being bluetooth 5.0, while trying to watch video. So if they sound terrible then why listen to music, and if they lag you can't even use them for video. Which brings me back here to order another set of these for $30 less and with 3 year old tech that sound and work better! Anyone know if there's an updated version of these?",B01G8JO5F2
"Great buy!  Use them riding my motorcycle. Also, amazing battery life",B01G8JO5F2
"I just recieved  my new headphones, have not had a chance to use them yet, however, the set up was super easy and changing the ear piece to fit my small ears was a breeze.  I will comment more once I get to the gym tonight and actually have a real opportuntiy to use them for what I bought them for.",B01G8JO5F2
"I've had these for two months now, and since the beginning they've had Bluetooth connection issues with my devices. They randomly drop off often and I have to turn on/off, etc to be able to reconnect. Desperately seeking a reliable pair of earbuds without having to spend too much.",B01G8JO5F2
Unfortunately I have a hearing problem so this did not work.  It was not loud enough.  Sorry I can’t be of more help.,B01G8JO5F2
This is the second pair and both went bad within 6 months. The first pair the USB port fried somehow when plugged in overnight. The second pair started not holding a charge for more than 3 hours after 4 months of purchase. Within 6 months just turned off in middle of workout and then wouldn't charge anymore. I surmise that the rubber over the USB port isnt sufficient to protect from sweat. So don't buy these.,B01G8JO5F2
"With the Laws on cell phones while driving, can you make it to get into contacts so you can make a call from your contacts?",B01G8JO5F2
These are built to last just long enough for the warranty to expire.  My battery died in little over one year.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and get something with more longevity.,B01G8JO5F2
"Good sound quality, fit really well and are generally comfortable. Suffer from wind noise when wearing them outside. Neat packaging and accessories.",B01G8JO5F2
"Bought these about 6 months ago at first I thought were good but after running for a bit noticed they dont stick to your hears well while running, they slip, sound is good quality, but the worst part is they die when at 50%. I would get notification of ""low battery"" at 50% and within 2 miutes they turn off. I would turn them back on and 50% appears on my phone screen when paired with my phone but would turn back of because of a ""dead battery"" at 50% decent for the first 6 months, but long term at least for my experience,  no bueno.",B01G8JO5F2
"This product works for about 4-6 weeks, starts making a loud humming noise, then dies.<br />My first pair broke within 6 weeks of purchase. I asked for a replacement because the product was under warranty. The replacement headphones arrived, and broke within a few weeks. I wish I could just get a refund.<br />I have since bought other headphones - I recommend you do the same.",B01G8JO5F2
I got them for my son and he loves them. They hold around ears perfect. Very pleased with this product.,B01G8JO5F2
This headphones surpassed my expectations given what I paid for them. They fit well in my ear: works better with the connecting cable placed in front and under the chin instead of the back of the neck).<br /><br />It does cancel noise completely so that is something to keep in mind when buying this product. Sound is not top notch but it is definitely not bad at all. I like the design and look of it.<br /><br />It is also very practical with up and down volume setters and a function to click on the right side piece once to pause sound.<br /><br />Overall exceptional product for the price!!!,B01G8JO5F2
"I used these headpones to listen music for outdoor running, Amazing sound quality, very good noice cancellation and holds good",B01G8JO5F2
"at the same price point, you are better off getting another brand of headphones. these have WAY too much bass by default. I have to use the equalizer feature in Spotify to manually lower the bass and increase treble",B01G8JO5F2
"I use these headphones walking around the city to get to work. The sound quality is fabulous, but these headphones aren't the most secure. I would not use them while exercising.",B01G8JO5F2
"This product is fantastic in so many ways.  It's clear, it has intuitive control buttons, and it has a nice case as well.  My only complaint is that it does a poor job of picking up a signal from my phone while it's in my pocket.  It would work fine if you have an armband holder for your phone I think.  I love it for listening when my hands are free to hold my phone though.",B01G8JO5F2
"Dollar for dollar, I think that these headphones are the best value/quality out on the market!",B01G8JO5F2
These earbuds feel so cheap! I had senso before and they weren't plastic. These feel like I got them from the dollar store. Im disappointed in the quality.,B01G8JO5F2
These did not work.  They would not charge up.  No LED light.  Defective.  A great brick though!,B01G8JO5F2
"Don’t waste your money. The Bluetooth connection is super weak. As a cyclist I carry my phone in my rear jersey pocket. As soon as I place the phone in my pocket, the buds lose connection and starts to buffer sound. Save your money.",B01G8JO5F2
New ear holders make devices unusable. Loved these for years. Maybe new holders are cheaper but they ruin the headphones. No longer stay one.,B01G8JO5F2
The charging port collapsed inside the device,B01G8JO5F2
In the gym. A good product,B01G8JO5F2
A mi esposo le encanto,B01G8JO5F2
Very easy to set up.  Works great with my smartwatch.,B01G8JO5F2
Really like these! I never have to adjust them while running and they don’t hurt my ears.,B01G8JO5F2
"Works great, now I can listen to music and get phone calls I use to miss.",B01G8JO5F2
Unfortunately these headphones stopped charging after 6 months. I probably used them an average of once a week and now they're completely dead. Headed to the landfill.,B01G8JO5F2
Works like a charm for me.  I can hear my calls great.  I am almost deaf so these work for me.,B01G8JO5F2
"By the way this is the second time I bought this product, because is awesome in range and sound quality.",B01G8JO5F2
love love love them.,B01G8JO5F2
Have had these for a few months. They’re great. I accidentally washed one pair a few weeks after receiving them and I was given a new pair under warranty no problem!! I also like how I can charge them at home or in my car on the way to the gym. I would recommend these for anyone looking to get a decent pair of wireless headphones.,B01G8JO5F2
I like em. They're surprisingly comparable to the Beats I paid 150 for a few years back. So far so good!!,B01G8JO5F2
The second day of use the right eraphone stoped working,B01G8JO5F2
"I use these at the gym for about an hour at a time, about 5 days per week, mostly for running and weight-lifting. They work well.",B01G8JO5F2
"The headphones are good overall! The sound quality is great, although at times there is a static sound.",B01G8JO5F2
"Bought as a cheaper alternative to the Powerbeats. Was fooled by the reviews and price. The material was cheap, obviously they were only 27 bucks. The sound was good awful and I’m partially deaf so I like stuff to sound loud and good. These turned halfway up had distortion from the bass. Nope, Terrible even if they were 27 bucks. I’m deciding on wether or not I want to return them but it’ll cost me 8 dollars to return 27$ headphones. Might just give them away.",B01G8JO5F2
really great sounding ear buds with plenty of bass response.. comfortable with flexible ear grips and options for ear bud sizes...comes with bonus material including magnetic car vent mount and wallet card (not sure how that works tho?)<br />highly recommended esp at price,B01G8JO5F2
"While I was really high on these earbuds initially, now that the third pair has failed less than five months after they replaced them.  Even though the manufacturer replaced them each time, they've proven to be unreliable because each failure was a different problem.  Sadly, it's time to shop for another, more reliable brand.",B01G8JO5F2
Nothing,B01G8JO5F2
"Being a non digital person, I was very pleased at how easy these earbuds are to sync with my devices.  The sound is very good.  Very pleased with the product so far.",B01G8JO5F2
Very easy to sync good sound quality.  Fits well.,B01G8JO5F2
"The bass was unusually loud at first and seemed to smooth out with extended use. Battery was great, and lasted practically an entire work shift. However, just 1 month into daily use of these so-far-so-good headphones, they stopped charging and never turned on again. Ironically, I missed my return window with Amazon by 1 day =(",B01G8JO5F2
I like everything,B01G8JO5F2
"great product for working out and running""",B01G8JO5F2
The headphones worked really well. They connected to my phone every time I turned them on within a few seconds. They never fell off during my runs. They never ran out of battery during my runs and they lasted a lot longer than expected. The sound was really good for the price.,B01G8JO5F2
"Sound great , durable and priced right",B01G8JO5F2
They were very easy for this non techy grandma to pair with my iPad.  The sound is very clear and they will be very useful when going to the gym.,B01G8JO5F2
"They won't stay in your ear, the sound quality is just above bad, and the battery life wasn't great. Wish I had returned them. Invest into a more expensive pair.",B01G8JO5F2
They are very nice at noise canceling however even their lowest volume level is way too loud. I wish I could turn it down more. I have an iPhone. I’m not sure if it is a problem in other devices.,B01G8JO5F2
They worked great until I shut them in my car door. I ordered a new set,B01G8JO5F2
Stayed secure in my ear during my fast pace workouts where other headphones would always fall out,B01G8JO5F2
"I have very small ear canals-these came with multiple sized buds, fit perfectly and stay in during excercising!  Great sound, easy to use.",B01G8JO5F2
Blown left speaker after 4 months of normal use at the gym. We have older pairs that work well. Trying to deal with Senso to get replacement. Not the smoothest process.,B01G8JO5F2
I love these things.,B01G8JO5F2
I love them,B01G8JO5F2
"I like these, they are cheap but I have had them for 2 years now and not a single issue. I actually bought 2 times not sure if whit this same account",B01G8JO5F2
Earphones will not charge. Can you please assist?,B01G8JO5F2
"This is my 4th purchase of these headphones. Not because they broke, I lost one and purchased a replacement I listen to books on line and always have a charged set of headphones as a backup. They charge quickly, good price, sound is good!,",B01G8JO5F2
Muy buenos,B01G8JO5F2
They suck.  Constantly skipping and losing signal.  Junk.,B01G8JO5F2
the sound was not as good as I expected.,B01G8JO5F2
"used for 3 months now. sound quality good. operation is simple and reliable. conforms to any ear. MOST comfy, untiring, no sweating, no headaches. being 67 I have used a lot of headsets and these are the best. you can get louder, better range whatever but you will not get a more comfortable set for any price.",B01G8JO5F2
Husband loves these so much he bought two pair!,B01G8JO5F2
"I have small ear canals.  Finally a pair of headphones, bluetooth, that stay in my ears.<br />The fact that they are waterproof means I can use them while bike riding.  They don't completely block outside noise. Some would consider that a drawback, but it's not safe when biking.",B01G8JO5F2
I was looking for some cheap ear buds for work just incase I lose them it wouldn't be a big deal and these are just as good as my Beats.,B01G8JO5F2
Head phones broke the first time I used them. They advertise that they are waterproof but as soon as I got water on them they broke and won't work anymore.,B01G8JO5F2
"Amazing sound quality, great fit (I have fairly large ears), very durable. Have been using these for a year now and they're still just amazing. Do yourself a favor and buy these!",B01G8JO5F2
So far I love the product.,B01G8JO5F2
I purchased these about a year ago.  They worked great.  Now they will not stay paired to my phone.  Very disappointing.,B01G8JO5F2
I have been struggling to find earbuds that would fit in my very small ear canals did a search specifically for that and this was one that came and it was my last resort but I'm very happy with them they fit my ear just fine the earloop helps to hold the the tip in sound is good I'm very pleased overall with them,B01G8JO5F2
"Bought them for my husband for the gym, he loves them, been using  them for over a year. He’s very particular.",B01G8JO5F2
I’ve purchased 3 pairs of the Senso headphones. They are comparable to the more expensive brand headphones. They all seem to last for about 1 year (I use them 6 times a week at the gym and when mowing my grass so combined use of about 10 hours a week). If something happens within the first year you just have to call them and they will send you a new one (I have had that happen twice). Before the Senso headphones I had several pairs of Beats. While sound quality may be slightly better it’s not enough to for the price difference. The beats only lasted me 1 year as well and they died as well. I would recommend to everyone (and have) to get these headphones. So much cheaper and similar quality as the Beats.,B01G8JO5F2
It's not water proof I can't charge it anymore,B01G8JO5F2
"I have these for about two years now, and I must say that it's still holding up pretty well. These things are damn loud when you put them to the max so watch out for that. They are also pretty good at picking up muffled/lowered sounds when I use them to watch videos. They secure nicely to your ears, depending on what tip you put on (never changed mine and they fit well in other people's ears when they borrow them), and I have used them during exercise. The noise cancelling is passive, meaning that they act like ear plugs, and they do drown out background or environmental noises, not completely though but still pretty well that I find them good for calls. I love the added accessories too!<br /><br />My only gripe with the product is the Bluetooth connectivity. It used to be super easy and fast to connect to my Iphone 6+ when it was brand new, but then I have difficulty connecting it sometimes. It still works though, just annoying when it does not work on the get-go. Works well with a Samsung S8 too!<br /><br />Oh yeah, don't be stupid and assume that the battery life has a long duration like 8-240 hours. It might be like that when its new, but after a couple of months, you will see performance to drop as battery loses charge over time; it is also good to note that the duration of battery depends on usage.<br /><br />Overall, not bad!",B01G8JO5F2
"I was very excited about these headphones. I hate working out with headphones connected to my phone. I hit the wire when running on the treadmill and make my phone go flying all the time. First time I used these I was amazed. So happy to not have my headphones connected to my phone. But now I’ve realized I need AirPods. I bought these because the hype around AirPods seemed ridiculous. But after using these headphone through multiple workouts they don’t stay in my ears. The wire gets stuck to the back of my neck when I sweat and ends up pulling my headphone loose on one side, then the sound isn’t right because one side is in tight and the other is loose so it’s not noise cancelling anymore just on one side. I’ve tried tightening the wire in the back, I’ve tried all four earbud sizes and types it comes with but I still find myself pushing them back in my ears constantly. And the pause button is on the side so when I push it back in my ear I end up pausing my music. I tired putting the wire in the front and it doesn’t pull out of my ears as much but it’s annoying to run with the wire hitting my chin and my chest. I’m bummed. I’ll keep them for flying or listening to music on the train. But I’m gonna need AirPods for working out.",B01G8JO5F2
"So Geniales, lastima que no esten en Colombia los productos Senso.",B01G8JO5F2
Oh I really like these headphones. They pair really easily and the sound is quite good. Sometimes the wire sticks to the back of my neck and when I turn my head one way or another it kind of pulls the earpiece out a little. I feel like that maybe if the wire was round it might not do that.,B01G8JO5F2
I liked the set that I purchased earlier that I bought a second set. Sound quality is excellent.,B01G8JO5F2
"Overall Not happy about this product. I always read reviews about products before making a purchase, which is what I did before deciding on this headphone. I was impressed after reading and checking out a few videos on this model. Surprised to find that this headset failed in operation less than a year of use. Wont hold a charge. Connects to phone only to abruptly power off after a few minutes. Tried charging them again to find the blue light which indicates full charge, but again results in repeated abrupt shutdowns. Needless to say this was either a faulty item or this headset is not a viable option for someone who plans to use this headphones on a regular basis.",B01G8JO5F2
"I recently bought new Senso handsfree again. I used to have the same handsfree and it worked perfectly for more than 2 years.<br />I wanted to compare the new pair with old pair. Issue with new one is that the ear support is very poor it deforms very easily hence does not provide stability at all. While old pair was having firm ear support and it never bends. Please see the attached pics 1st pic is for new ones and later one is for old pair.<br />Since I use this in gym only so I need handsfree which does not fall off and provide stability while on treadmill.<br />Sound quality is good, battery life is also great no complaints in that area but it does not solve my purpose.<br />I am not sure why Senso has degrade the quality of ear support. Very disappointing.",B01G8JO5F2
"I LOVE these headphones !  I use them to watch TV late at night when the rest of the household is sleeping.  They pair quickly to our<br />Connect brand universal wireless audio transmitter. The battery life is AT LEAST 8 hours and they charge quickly !  The customer support for this product is excellent.  I haven't experienced any lag time what so ever with these and the quality of the sound is GREAT for such an inexpensive product. I agree with the other reviewers who've noted..... no need to JAM these into your ears. Just insert them, without screwing them into into your ears and they are so comfortable, you'll forget all about them.  They are perfect for us night owls who are sick of trying to watch TV on a low volume in order not to keep everyone else awake at night !",B01G8JO5F2
Stopped working two months after purchase. Not pleased.,B01G8JO5F2
Sound quality disappointing. They were cheap and they sound that way.,B01G8JO5F2
Hubby loves them!!!👌,B01G8JO5F2
"According to the IP standards of waterproof ratings, a rating of IPX7 means the device can be immersed in water of up to 1 meter (3 feet). This was not the case at all with these headphones. Do not buy if you are expecting them to be waterproof.",B01G8JO5F2
These were great until I bought some real headphones lol. Than I realized how bad the sound was. Cheap and better than wires.,B01G8JO5F2
Had them for a while now and they still work greatly.,B01G8JO5F2
"I have purchased two pairs of these ear buds.  The first set lasted about 8 months with everyday use.  For the price, I thought they were ok.  But They just stopped working..so I ordered the second set. The second set lasted less than one month.  The same thing happened..  they stopped working.  Also the over the ear wire is really thin and doesn’t work as well as the first set.  Won’t buy again",B01G8JO5F2
Works great.  Battery last a long time.,B01G8JO5F2
"Even just in the shower, the sound gets muffled.  Dry them out and after a few times, the charging port fails after a month or two.",B01G8JO5F2
"I love these headphones! They sound great and stay in my ears very well. My only complaint is that sometimes they have issues pairing with certain devices, but that might not be an issue of the headphones.",B01G8JO5F2
They fit. Really small ears and so many earbuds don’t stay in when exercising but these are great. Finally something that works for me!,B01G8JO5F2
Stopped working after a month of use.,B01G8JO5F2
"i am wearing glasses, so sometimes i feel uncomfortable wearing both of them. and it is too easy to take off so sometimes wear off unintentionally.",B01G8JO5F2
"I love my new earbuds. Could not rate for battery life, as I have only used them once.",B01G8JO5F2
"They lasted a month!  Won’t charge or turn on, waste of money!",B01G8JO5F2
"Small, great sound, no slippage from ears.",B01G8JO5F2
headphones work just fine they are for my daughter,B01G8JO5F2
"I got this pair of headphones on 02/19 of this year while training for a half marathon. This year I ran around 15 races, the last one on 10/05. I decided to use them again while running errands in early November & noticed they were totally dead. I didn’t think much of it since it had been about a month since last using them, so I plugged them in to charge. Within a few seconds of plugging them in, a lil red dot will light up, & once fully charged will change to blue. The red light never came on which I thought was odd so I waited for a few minutes but still nothing. I even changed up the outlets, allowing it to be there for at least 5 minutes at each one, but nothing. I found the 1-year warranty I purchased & reached out to company on their website on 11/05, explaining the issue & asking for a replacement but never heard back. I’m disappointed because I really enjoyed this pair of headphones; the sound was good & they fit very comfortably in/around my ears. Unfortunately I’m dissatisfied with customer service & with the battery quality as they only worked for 8ish months before dying.",B01G8JO5F2
Like earbuds slot difficult to pair with my Moto phone,B01G8JO5F2
"Great Sound, passive cancellation, stay in place even with jarring activity.",B01G8JO5F2
"These weren't EXACTLY what I was looking for, personally. I have a really hard time finding in-ear wireless headphones that don't hurt my ears. I was hoping these just kind of clipped on to my ear and didn't actually need to go in but that was my fault as a buyer. That being said, they are much more comfortable and work better than other more expensive earphones that I've purchased. Easy to connect to devices. The on/off/pause/play button is easy to accidentally press while adjusting them while on. I would have like to see them advertised as ear phones or in-ear headphones, though.",B01G8JO5F2
Really easy to use and pair with phone. Excellent value for money,B01G8JO5F2
They are ok just not as good as promised,B01G8JO5F2
"I have used these earphones in the past and they are great.  starting with the design and the sound. the design because all the controls are in the earpiece and that makes it more comfortable and not like the other brands that have a volume bar that is swinging all the time.  However, this time the earphones did not work well.  it was very hard for me to get them connected to the phone and the battery life was very short.  I was in the middle of my workout and the ear set just got disconnected without any reason.",B01G8JO5F2
"I've waited a year before posting a review. I've bought the same headphones 2 times and each time they stopped working before the year ended. The headphones pair easily and fit great but they just dont last. They work great at first but then the ears start to go out. I really liked them so I tried to buy the same ones a second time but ended up with the same issue 11 months later. For the money they are fine, just dont plan on them lasting a long time.",B01G8JO5F2
Charger does not match the earbuds. Earbuds were unusable as a result.,B01G8JO5F2
These are great wireless headphones for the price. The battery life hasn't been great but long enough.,B01G8JO5F2
Works great,B01G8JO5F2
Work super good. Couldn’t be happier,B01G8JO5F2
Great sound,B01G8JO5F2
"Just got these new headphones and like them alot!  They are very reasonably priced and have a good sound.  The carrying case is also very nice!  I love the fact that it comes with extra earbuds which I actually needed to use.  And the ""extra's"" they give you (magnetic phone mount and card holder) are a very nice bonus.  The only issue I had was trying to change the ear buds (hahaha) but I got it figured out.  :-)<br /><br />Nice job!!!",B01G8JO5F2
When phone was in the pocket sound constantly cut out. Was fully charged. Would not buy again.,B01G8JO5F2
Battery Life Last long. very comfortable. overall bang for its buck. would greatly recommend,B01G8JO5F2
"Sound quality is decent. Bluetooth connection can drop in and out, especially when first connected. Headphones don’t like moving from wifi, it makes an annoying beeping and requires restart. Battery gauge is not particularly accurate, when gauge shows about 20%, it’s about dead. When the verbal low battery warning, it actually only has about one minute left before it dies. Hour long charge time is not true, takes longer, maybe 2-3 hours. All that being said, I’ve had them for about a year, and they keep trucking along.<br /><br />Update: they have finally died. RIP. Nov 18 - August 19",B01G8JO5F2
"I love these headphones. I use them for running when it's cold outside, my wireless ones don't work under my beanies. Sound quality is perfect for what I need it for. The main thing I'm impressed with is that I washed these with a load of clothes and they work perfectly fine, still. WOOOT!<br /><br />UPDATE 2 DEC 2020<br />I used these while running an ultra marathon and they lasted connected by bluetooth to my phone for 7.5 hours.  WIN",B01G8JO5F2
Love this item,B01G8JO5F2
"ive called 3x to get replacement headphones for my broken pair still under warranty . they put you through alot of attempts to reset headphones, i mean alot, that didnt solve problem so they tell you they will send your info to warranty dept which obviously never happens. ive called 3 times over 2 months and went through their crazy process 3x and nothing was ever done . never heard from them again.  the headphones aren't bad just know that if they fail before your 1 yr warranty is up they arent going to honor that warranty.  buy from different company",B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these headphones to use on the treadmill and connect wirelessly to my TV.  The headphones were fine but I had a bluetooth issue when we got rid of Dish and switched to youtube tv, as we plugged bluetooth receiver into hopper.  4 months later we finally got the bluetooth figured out, but my headphones didn't have a charge.  I tried to plug them in, and the cord would not stay in to the headphones.  I tried to resolve with Senso because out of return window, but we could not get a response.  It clearly says there is a 1 year guarantee in the description.  These headphones were used less than 5 times and I cannot charge them nor get a response from the seller.",B01G8JO5F2
"Though the sound is good, It broke on one side within a week of normal use.",B01G8JO5F2
"I needed some Bluetooth headphones for the gym, as I kept getting all tangled with my wired headphones while exercising. I didn't want to spend a fortune on something that was going to be used during active activity, so I saw these on the top of the list and the price was definitely well within my budget. I received them and was surprised at the sound quality and especially the bass that came through in comparison to my iPhone headphones. The noise cancellation is great, as well, as I definitely have to pause my music if anyone is trying to speak to me. It's Bluetooth connection is strong, too - I can walk across the gym to pick up a weight and leave my phone at the equipment I'm using and there is no break in connection! The battery life is pretty decent, as well, but it doesn't give you much warning once they're running low. It's not joking around with you when it says ""Battery Low""! Regardless, I highly recommend this product if you need something that is inexpensive but of good quality.",B01G8JO5F2
Nothing to dislike,B01G8JO5F2
"I like the sound quality, the bass can only be improved by proper ear canal fitting.<br />The over the ear hooks are comfortable and functional. I am not a fan of rubber ear tips,<br />sweat from exercising can pop them out of place,  I prefer the foam. It comes with a set.<br />Blue tooth seems to work OK, Can't comment on battery life yet. The workmanship is good be careful there is<br />a weak point between the speaker and the body of the electronics. Handle with care.",B01G8JO5F2
Seems to do what stated. Not a real user of Bluetooth so guessing,B01G8JO5F2
"The earloop has been broken, but the headphone still works perfectly after 5 years!!!<br />I rarely write reviews, but I have to for this one.<br /><br />Strongly recommend.",B01G8JO5F2
"Ear hooks help the buds stay in place, which was the main thing I wanted. Sound quality is good. I sometimes have to power cycle a few times before music from my iPhone will actually play through the ear buds, which is a little annoying, but once they're properly synced, no problems. The mic is too far away to make phone calls, though; it’s hard for me to be heard unless I speak quite loudly. Battery life is good, although when you get the low battery warning, you’ve got at most 15 minutes of play time left.",B01G8JO5F2
"I had these previously and the sound, both treble and bass, were very good for something in this price range. The wire connector  was about to break, so I decided to reorder the same thing. I put them on and the sound quality was terrible. Since my original set was not completely broken, I was able to switch back and forth just to be sure I wasn’t being too critical.  Treble was very tinny sounding and bass was nonexistent. I returned them for a refund.",B01G8JO5F2
Good sound and loud enough for my Dad to hear without his hearing aids.,B01G8JO5F2
I really like them! They work perfectly for the gym and that is whey I needed them. Gods souls quality and stay in place,B01G8JO5F2
Just recieved these and tried them out.  First I found out the bluetooth will not link while they are charging.  Then when I tried them out the microphone was terrible.  People could not hear me as the sound was muffled even when in a quiet office with no other noises.  I will return them.,B01G8JO5F2
"Good sound,  great price.",B01G8JO5F2
The sound quality is great. They don't feel secure and stick out a bit further them I'd like.,B01G8JO5F2
"This product is of inferior quality. After a month and a half of daily use, the charging port broke off of the circuit board and sank inside the right ear earbud. RUN AWAY!!!<br />DO NOT PURCHASE!!!!<br />ALL OTHER EARBUDS ARE BETTER!!!",B01G8JO5F2
Good for walking and talking on the phone at the same time. It was a gift.,B01G8JO5F2
I bought these headphones after a more “prominent” brand just stopped working. I have used these a few times a week for gym use since November 2017. They worked great until...THEY JUST STOPPED. They have a full charge but simply will NOT turn on. Of course the warranty is expired and here I am AGAIN without wireless earbuds...,B01G8JO5F2
"The head phones worked great, very easy to pair with phone and had great sounds. Unfortunately the stopped working, but the manufacturer has been excellent with a replacement",B01G8JO5F2
sound quality as amazing and everything that came with the package was worth the money defintiely buy again,B01G8JO5F2
Got them for my wife to use for working out.  She had trouble with them fitting in her small ear canals.  They just never stayed in place.  I took them and they work well for me.,B01G8JO5F2
The Senso Headphones I received are great. They were easy to set up and pair with my Note 9. I used them mainly when I go jogging in the morning. The sound is good and it is easy to operate. I really like it that the controls are located on the actual earpiece itself. I definitely recommend these!,B01G8JO5F2
Does the job!,B01G8JO5F2
They work like a charm sound great I use them everyday while working thank u,B01G8JO5F2
"I actually love these and use them all the time as my Bluetooth for phonecalls and for listening to music.  However I have gone through 4 pairs now and eventually it just stops charging.  One lasted about a year before this happened, others a few months, and my most recent buy only lasted 1 month.  I like this product for the price but I can tell they are making them more and more inferior as their sales increase.  I am very annoyed with my last purchase as my ""1 month return window"" has expired which is a load of crap for a tech item.",B01G8JO5F2
Love them. Had them for a month and have found zero problems.,B01G8JO5F2
These headphones were great for the short time they actually worked. They stopped  taking charge so I they just became useless. I loved using them in the gym but that too was short lived.  I had high hopes for these.,B01G8JO5F2
Ive had many earbuds over the years including high dollar name brand buds as hard as it is to believe these are by far the best ! I just had to replace the fist pair i bought in 2018 one one the buds stopped working . I had got my moneys woth and then some as far as im concerned!  I weld for a living so the environment is not ideal and im pretty sweaty and dirty all day everyday. The battery life on these things is pretty darn good as well .. All and all just a good bang for your buck!,B01G8JO5F2
It works so well!,B01G8JO5F2
Like the fit,B01G8JO5F2
These are the best active earbuds I have found. They work for days before needing to recharge. And the sound is great!,B01G8JO5F2
These earbuds worked really well for 2 years.  Recently went to use and heard a zap and now they no longer charge.  We tried different chargers but seems like they are toast.,B01G8JO5F2
"I have used these for a few days now, great sounding ear buds,  can't really comment on the battery life , as I am still on the first charge!",B01G8JO5F2
"I love these headphones for running. They are lightweight, easy to turn on and off while running and mildly good at adapting to my sweat. I had a battery issue (they no longer took a charger after 5 - 6 months. But, after writing Senso directly for my registered product, they were quick to send out a replacement pair and offered suggestions to how I could fix issues with mine. The fast response and being taken seriously was important. Solid product, especially for the price. Recommended.",B01G8JO5F2
"I love these buds , A great price,great clarity,great volume,easy to use and comfortable . I use these in my van ,which has blue tooth in it but is too noisy<br />the seller was great ,and the product was great too",B01G8JO5F2
"great...i have bought 4 sets thus far, and turn about charging them for constant use",B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these based on the price point and reviews.  I used them during my runs, yard work and listening to my favorite music.  Sound quality is great.  I liked these so much I bought them as gifts too.",B01G8JO5F2
"Bought these for myself, then my son's earbuds broke (different brand) so I gave these to him. He loves them, especially the flexible ear pieces. I guess I have to order another pair for myself now!",B01G8JO5F2
I prefer this style to the buds that fall out when I jump on the trampoline.<br />They paired easily and the sound is great.,B01G8JO5F2
"Seem to wick moisture well if you're a heavy sweater, I use mostly for cardio at the gym",B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these for my dedicated running headphones, and they work well for that purpose.  Even to my uncritical ear, the sound range is a bit empty but they are powerful.  The lowest volume setting can be too loud under some circumstances.  They fit fairly well for my slightly small ears, feel lighter than they are, and stay put under moderate exercise.  Pairing etc. was no trouble with my Galaxy S10.<br /><br />Update:  Six months later headphones will inexplicably not turn on.  They show a blue charged light and beep in response to ""on"" button press when plugged in but do not make any noise/connect when not plugged in.  Happened day after run in the rain so water might have been an issue.  Honestly, par for the course for me.",B01G8JO5F2
I bought it for my daughter and she is loving everything about it.,B01G8JO5F2
"I had one pair last two years. I didn't like the ""upgraded"" version so I purchased another pair of the original model. They were constructed flimsier and cheaper like the ""upgraded"" ones. Yes they work, but aren't nearly the original quality.  I'd  look elsewhere for bluetooth headphones if I were you.",B01G8JO5F2
"The sound quality and comfort is good for the value. The problem I have is the quality of the product. I have purchased multiple of these of these of these over the past few years. They all seem to randomly stop working, won't charge, or won't turn on. Currently, I have 5 pairs in the drawer I throw them in when they stop working.",B01G8JO5F2
"I use them almost everyday, mostly while doing yard work or walking the dog. Even on a hot sweaty day, they stay in my ears and don't fall out. I never have any problems with having to re-pair them to my phone when I turn them on and off. The ear pieces really keep out the noise. They were a bargain as well.",B01G8JO5F2
Perfect choice,B01G8JO5F2
For the money these are great the last one I bought lasted four years it got it wet by mistake.,B01G8JO5F2
The Senso bluetooth head phones have an excellent quality sound and deep bass sound.  Sound clear. Im so glad with the purchase.,B01G8JO5F2
Good,B01G8JO5F2
"Sound was not as expected, muffled and can’t hear audio books on them",B01G8JO5F2
Great for gym!!<br />Not a long range but good quality sound.,B01G8JO5F2
"update: as of may 5th 2019<br />unit has started shorting, similar to a speaker going bad. overall the unit has worked very well. now i am just wondering whether one year is the life span of it.<br /><br />I love this bluetooth device.",B01G8JO5F2
Great sound,B01G8JO5F2
I am 3 years into Medicare and had no difficulty paring the headphones to my iPhone.  The headphones are comfortable and have performed very well on the road and on the treadmill.  I have been very please with them.,B01G8JO5F2
"They sound pretty good.  I bought these to wear to the gym, but I was not  crazy about the over-the-ear fit.  I passed them on to a friend who really likes them. The come with  a clever case, a charger, several bud covers and some other stuff.  Worth the price.",B01G8JO5F2
Running,B01G8JO5F2
"Well let me start out by saying that I have bought some very quality headphones over the past couple of years. These headphones are actually really good for the price, but the headphones that I purchased worked great for about a month. The button on the side of the headphones while listening to music one night stuck in the casing, it would not pop back out. I tried to use a very small sunglasses screw driver to pull it back out, but it was stuck in permanently. I called the insurance first as I paid the extra money for this plan, just in case I broke them as I do on most all of the stuff I buy. The insurance told me that this is a manufacture warranty and that I need to contact them, so I did. I first contacted them on Feb 21st by email. I received an email back on Feb 22nd saying:<br /><br />Senso Support 1 (sensohelp)<br />Feb 22, 5:18 AM PST<br />Hello Eric ,<br /><br />We are really sorry to hear about the issues with the headphones. We appreciate you reaching out to us and giving us this valuable feedback.  We take customer and product feedback very seriously and our goal is to ensure that each customer gets the highest level of quality products.<br /><br />Please send us your Amazon Order ID so we can look into this further.  Rest assured, we will take care of this issue for you to ensure you are fully satisfied.<br /><br />Thank you,<br /><br />Sebastian Lemond<br />Senso Support<br /><br />So, I thought, wow what great customer service. I responded back immediately with my order number and waited, and waited, and waited.  On March 16th, I sent another email stating that I have not heard anything back and can someone please reach out to me to let me know what I am suppose to do with the headphones.  March 19th, today I received an email stating:<br /><br />Hello Eric,<br /><br />We are sorry to hear that your headphones got damaged. Unfortunately, the Senso 1 Year Warranty covers functional defects and not accidental damage. We will not be able to offer you a free replacement but can offer you a 10% discount code that you can use to purchase a replacement.<br /><br />Really??<br />I never said that I damaged the headphones. They never even saw them or asked me what happen to them? I thought that they take customer service very seriously? This is not what I would consider customer service. I sent them a follow up email stating that I did not damage them, so we will see what happens. So, with all that said do not buy these headphones unless you are okay with them breaking after a month, just to go buy another pair.",B01G8JO5F2
"I have tried many brands of wireless earbuds.  Of the three or so brands I've tried, there is always one earbud that stops working no matter how you try to correct it.  What's impressive about these earbuds is that they are a fraction of the cost of wireless, both earbuds always work and it's easy to operate.  I can pause a podcast by touching the earbud on the right even through a heavy beanie.  The volume controls are also easy to operate.  I inherited these, but will definitely purchase a set when and if the current ones I have wear out.",B01G8JO5F2
It's a great buy for the price and sounds awesome with a good power life that lasts 8 hours of great listening and easy to use. It was such a great device my daughter wanted one so I got her one for her B Day,B01G8JO5F2
We have two sets of these but on one they are almost unbearably loud at the lowest volume setting. I’ve had my son stop using them to avoid hearing damage. Would love a solution because these are otherwise great headphones.,B01G8JO5F2
"I have always wanted to buy beats but never wanted to spend the $200. I read the reviews on these and purchased and absolutely love them! Great sound quality, battery life lasts forever and easy to use. I have little ears and they fit well. Definitely recommend!",B01G8JO5F2
"Received my order extremely fast. Love them they work great. These were for my husband, he's old pair was wearing out so I ordered him a new pair. These are even better than his old ones when they were new. This company and brand is improving from order to order.<br /><br />Having a reliable headset is a must for my husband. He works construction and needs both hands, but also needs to be able to talk to clients when they call.",B01G8JO5F2
Went through 3 pairs of these in 2 months.  I finally just gave up.,B01G8JO5F2
"I liked the ease of setting up, the quality and sound is great!",B01G8JO5F2
"I've purchased several of these in the past, because I have loved the product but somehow manage to break them (not the product's fault). But they seem to have changed the design on the latest model, which is larger and clunkier than its predecessors. It doesn't fit the ear as well and the over-ear hooks don't keep their shape from use to use.",B01G8JO5F2
Me encantaron,B01G8JO5F2
Using these paired with my fitbit. They are extremely easy to use and fit really well. I like how easy it goes around your ear and bends to keep them tight.  Havent had any issues other than occasional cutting in and out which doesnt usually happen unless they need charged. Like the case thats included to keep everything together.  Very good product for the price.  Couldn't be happier with my life purchase. Good job Senso!,B01G8JO5F2
"The likes: Wireless, stays in ears, nice case that I never used<br />The dislikes: Died abruptly after 15 months of purchases, and warranty was for a year, had connection trouble with phone when jogging (realized I had to have phone on right arm/side of body, where the main headphone component was, instead of left), had to recharge after 5-6 hours of use, great for realizing how loud wind is when the earbuds aren't aerodynamic",B01G8JO5F2
"sound quality is excellent, not sure if the bendable behind the ear attachments will last seem like they may bend too much and break . but only time will tell",B01G8JO5F2
Great buy!!! Wonderful,B01G8JO5F2
Bought these headphones because my more expensive pair stopped working and didn’t quite want to shell out the money again. The sound quality of the headphones is fantastic and the battery life can last me a couple days of workouts before needing recharged.<br /><br />My biggest complaint about the headphones is the part that hang over top of your ears. The plastic isn’t malleable like the part is with the more expensive headphones. So while I’m running or doing anything with a jumping motion they always fall off my ear. I contacted support and they suggested switching ear plug pieces which I had already done.<br /><br />Overall you pay what you get I guess.,B01G8JO5F2
Battery last a lot,B01G8JO5F2
Awesome headphones for the price,B01G8JO5F2
Just put them on!  They speak for themselves!!  The sound was spot on. I felt like I was there. And the adjustable ear piece fits perfect.  Im very small and these didnt fall off!!.  They are my favorite and I would recommend them to anyone that likes to have their tunes when on the go!!!,B01G8JO5F2
Love these headphone,B01G8JO5F2
These are for sure the worst headphones I’ve ever tried. I am a long distance runner and not only do the earbuds pop out every few minutes they are very heavy and bulky over the course of a long run. I tried some of the recommended things other reviewers have posted here to see if I could somehow get these to work for me but they are going back. There is no wind reduction with these. The overall sound is heavy muddy bass with a small trace of upper range. The only thing I liked about these was the easy and reliable Bluetooth paring with my I phone. I am going back to my trusted  Rovkings.,B01G8JO5F2
"Good charge, good sound quality and fit well on my ears",B01G8JO5F2
So I got this for my husband's birthday and within one week he said the sound went out in one ear. Soon after our twins were born and ended up in the NICU so it got too hectic to return them. Not sure if it's just a fluke or if the quality is really that bad. My husband hadn't gotten them wet or even sweated with them. He didn't even use them enough to know how the battery holds up for the long haul. Very disappointing.,B01G8JO5F2
The audio quality is muffled. The mic is also horrible. I owned a pair of these before for 10 years that were awesome. This new pair is horrible. Do not buy,B01G8JO5F2
Love them and they last a long time,B01G8JO5F2
For the price these are fantastic headphones! I am quite active and I find they stay put really well whatever I'm doing. They also can be adapted for a variety of ear sizes/shapes. The sound quality is good and the battery lasts a long time as well.<br />My only complaint is they don't have a fantastic range and can cut out if I'm more than 10 or 20 ft away from my phone.,B01G8JO5F2
"I purchased these headphones with the intention of using them while surfing. The description says they are IPX7 rated, but they stopped functioning after my first session on the water.",B01G8JO5F2
These wouldn't ever turn on. Wanted to return them but passed date to return.,B01G8JO5F2
Very good deal !,B01G8JO5F2
Has foam ear buds that are great for working out. They like form to your ears and stay in really good!,B01G8JO5F2
"The headphones were great, i only used it for when i went to the gym and honestly it was a great little product. But then after a few months it wouldn't charge at full capacity only up to 20% and even then it would die within 5 -10 minutes.<br /><br />The headphones are basically non-functioning now but i will give it 2 stars since they worked well when it did and maybe i just received a defective one.",B01G8JO5F2
Shortly after using these earbuds the right ear bud fell apart. I was able to put it back on and use them but after two months of this the right ear bud no longer transmits audio. Total Junk dont waste your time and money,B01G8JO5F2
"A very good item at a affordable price!""",B01G8JO5F2
"I loved these for a while, however with a full charge they shutdown after a few minutes.  Still shows full charge when I turn back on.  This would be 5 stars without this problem.",B01G8JO5F2
I dislike this product because it volume not working,B01G8JO5F2
not sure why but it beeps when you cut it on but doesn't play music,B01G8JO5F2
Very comfortable and great quality for the price. I use them for my morning walks and got them because my AirPods were constantly falling out of my ears.  Easy set-up and comfortable. We’ll worth the money!,B01G8JO5F2
"I loved these for a while, however with a full charge they shutdown after a few minutes.  Still shows full charge when I turn back on.  This would be 5 stars without this problem.",B01G8JO5F2
The earbuds are great!  The price is amazing.  I bought them to replace my beats that died.  I use them for running and lifting and haven’t had an issue.  Easy to connect and disconnect,B01G8JO5F2
"These are a really great answer to the need for wireless headphones that are not too bulky and are good for working out. I love how you can conform them to fit around your ears, as no ear is shaped the same and it guarantees a good fit. The sound is good, the earbuds fit well in my ears, and they are light and I know will be great for working out in the summer.",B01G8JO5F2
Stopped working under a year.,B01G8JO5F2
Headphones are great quality.Amazing,B01G8JO5F2
I've had them for a while now and they are fantastic.,B01G8JO5F2
"I've had these for almost 2 weeks now.  I have to say they are better than I thought they would be for the price.<br />Pros...<br />The piece over the ear is bendable.  Took a bit but now they are extremely comfortable.<br />I mainly use them to talk to family on the phone and audio books and the sound is very clear.  You can adjust volume by your phone or on the ear piece.<br />Now, I thought the mic would be a problem, just the opposite, I come thru crystal clear on the phone.  WoW.<br /><br />Cons<br />The battery doesn't seem to last long, for me anyway,  but 4 to 6 hours of constant use might be good for others.<br />But then again it takes about a hour to recharge and I'm back to using them again.<br /><br />I'll definitely be buying these again as gifts for my family.",B01G8JO5F2
"For the price, these headphones are really good. They obviously go around your ears so they don’t fall out unless you start violently shaking your head so they’re good for gym use. My one issue with them is that they keep saying “battery low” and turning down your volume when they start to get low. I understand if they do it once or twice but they interrupt each song like 4-5 times and that’s pretty annoying. Get rid of that feature or just always keep your battery high and you’ll be all set.",B01G8JO5F2
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,B01G8JO5F2
"This is a much better quality set of headphones than I expected for the price.  Even the packaging was good quality.  These charged quickly ,paired easily,and sound fantastic.  The little extras that came in the box was a magnetic dash mount to hang your headphones on. A nice little cellphone wallet.  Attaches to back of cell phone to keep an I’d or credit card and a very nice sturdy carrying case.  I now can only hope that the headphones are as durable as I think they will be",B01G8JO5F2
"The audio quality of the headset is awesome.  It does not have noise cancelation on it, but other than that , these are great headsets for the money you are spending.  I use these headsets for going to the gym, and taking calls on my iPhone.  Awesome product.",B01G8JO5F2
Good,B01G8JO5F2
Great product.,B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these about 16 months ago. I’ve  used them for everything from exercise to garden/yard work to computer work. They stay firm and comfortable for me.<br /><br />They have been very durable for the price. A little bulky looking at first, but they have great battery life. I still get over 8 hours from a full charge.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it’s time to replace them since the wires have developed a loose connection from wear and tear. No complains, they have been well worn.<br /><br />The only negative marks I could give these are there seem to be a few bugs in the firmware. This can cause disconnects and difficulty connecting. Nothing a headphone/Bluetooth reset can’t fix. This may be fixed in current versions.<br /><br />Also these a VERY loud. Even the quietest volume is too loud for casual listening. I fixed this by stuffing a tiny cotton ball in them. Though... at times the excessive volume is a great feature... like when drowning out loud kids :).<br /><br />Overall ... I’m very satisfied with price, performance and durability.",B01G8JO5F2
"I'm hearing impaired,they are good quality sound and loud enough for me to be able to hear well. Still getting used to them as far as fit goes. Best blue tooth ear buds that I have tried so far. Especially for the price. Now if I can just remember where I put them.",B01G8JO5F2
"I hate in ear headphones, so I went in knowing I wouldn't love these. I did not expect them to sound like such garbage. Can't listen to audiobooks or podcasts in the gym - they just aren't loud enough. No amount of tweaking the equalizer will make music sound decent, either. When these break - which may be never, the build quality is pretty good - I will be relieved to not use them ever again.",B01G8JO5F2
"I loved it. The best part is that you can bend the rubber hook thingies (idk what they are called) to fit your ear, I have used them while running 2 miles and they stay in place. It connects to my Bluetooth perfectly. It also tells me what battery percentage it is at and warns me when it has a low battery.",B01G8JO5F2
This was excellent piece for a reasonable price... I’m enjoying every moment,B01G8JO5F2
Senso Bluetooth headphones are amazing! I’ve had my first pair almost two years and using them a close to 2 hours a day. Have yet to have an issue and so great I bought a second pair to keep at work. The quality is unbelievable and price is amazing.,B01G8JO5F2
"Need to return iteam not working properly, people can't hear me very well when on the phone. Thanks please send me the return address.",B01G8JO5F2
"If you stay absolutely still the sound quality could be okay. I specifically bought these headphones for the gym. I can be doing deadlifts, barely moving and there will be annoyingly poor lapses in sound quality. That is when my phone is 5 feet away. If you are 10+ feet away from the device you are connecting to, the sound quality will be absolute trash. AVOID.",B01G8JO5F2
"Good stuff , good price !",B01G8JO5F2
"Too bad I lost the directions, am not tech savvy, so it took almost 1 day to figure out how to get them working right.  I like the fact that once they're in ears, they don't fall out while I'm on the elliptical.  Easy to change volume, but remember to adjust the volume on whatever you're watching (I watch Prime Videos and it was very loud from when I had no earphones).  I don't know how much the person who gave them to me paid.  So far, I've used them once, so I don't know how long the battery will stay charged.",B01G8JO5F2
"Their battery life sometimes tends to be a bit short, but in the overall these headphones are good.",B01G8JO5F2
"I ordered a pair of these and they would not turn on after charging. I returned them for another pair and had the same issue. They charge until the light is blue, then they simply won't turn on no matter how long you hold the button.  Not trying another pair.",B01G8JO5F2
"I use these for listening to music when I’m working out. So far the battery life and sound quality has been good. I like that the ear piece is moldable and that I can bend it around my ear. The earbuds stay in my ears pretty well when I’m lifting, but I have a little bit of trouble when I’m running. I may need to play around with the ear tips a bit more.",B01G8JO5F2
This headphone is just what I was looking for.,B01G8JO5F2
"Got these on a special deal for way less than what they are worth, and they are completely worth it. Not sure if they are worth full price though. Fit well, sound great, and are even a bit water resistant.",B01G8JO5F2
This is my second pair of Senso Headphones. The purchase was made because my daughter liberated the original ones from me. Really like these earbuds (maybe a  little more than the first par). The earhooks have been modified and they can now be molded around your ear for a much more secure fit when out on those runs. I never once had to readjust them because they were falling out. Hard to pass up for $23.,B01G8JO5F2
I've had a hard time finding a pair of headphones that don't fall out while I'm working.  These fit snugly (after putting a smaller earpiece) into my ear and the best part is the way you can mold the piece that goes over your ear to fit firmly.  They can be a little troublesome to get on but once they are on they work great! Getting a second pair for my husband who works in construction,B01G8JO5F2
These were awkward for me. Didn't hold much battery duration.  Not what I really wanted.,B01G8JO5F2
"Headphones are comfortable, the mic to make calls is very good and they don't fall thanks to the rubbery half loop but connectivity has always been bad. I've had this for a while and I've been patient wondering if the poor connectivity was due to interference or where I was, but after trying them in every possible location w my iPhone 7 I concluded I will get rid of them. The headphones beep constantly as the Bluetooth connection is lost and regained. I use other devices connected to my phone via Bluetooth and never have a problem...so this set of headphones are going to the garbage.",B01G8JO5F2
Amazing sound quality. Fast delivery exactly as described.,B01G8JO5F2
"I had the old version and it last me for about 5 months for the price sound quality and materials they were great after that one earbud stopped working so I bought another one but it was different from the previous one POS the charging button is not so har to open , the sound button is very responsive . Cons the thing that goes around your ear now is like a type of wire and is hard to ajuste, and the on off button doesn’t click no more like if it is stuck (but I still can use it , but one day all of the sudden they don’t turn on)",B01G8JO5F2
"Like: Easily connected and good sound. Long playtime<br />Dislike: Not fitting well , not secure well and not comfortable. Feeling heavy on my ears.",B01G8JO5F2
"old version is very suitable for running ,but this version it very bad it cant balance on your ear",B01G8JO5F2
I have enjoyed everything about the product but I'm not sure about the Bluetooth range.ive had some cutting out issues in I have my phone in my left pocket instead of my right.,B01G8JO5F2
"The first pair I bought fell apart, this pair is so bassy I can't listen to it.  In a drawer now.",B01G8JO5F2
When I received the headphones I noticed that the ear pieces were angled slightly different from each other. I didn’t seem like it would make a big difference but I was never able to get one of them in my ear fully no matter which size I used over it. I also found that the Bluetooth range was only about 10 feet.,B01G8JO5F2
I like that they are good with bluetooth.,B01G8JO5F2
This purchase was for my oldest son who graduated high school recently. He wanted ear buds that stayed in placed while running. Item also arrived quicker than expected.,B01G8JO5F2
"Fit very comfortably, easy to connect, stay in place when running, and have decent sound. I’m very impressed with these, especially for the price. I would buy again in a heartbeat.",B01G8JO5F2
"My recent pair (5th pair) is my least favorite pair because they changed the design on the part that wraps over your ear to flexible vs rigid, which always loses its shape after a short period so that you have to reshape it so it wont fall out, the wire grabs your neck or chin and tugs on the ear piece causing it to lose its shape around your ear which then causes you to pause and reshape it, major drag when your running or driving, major bummer in design change. probably wont re order them because of that simple but negative change. Otherwise its a great product for the money.",B01G8JO5F2
What can I say. I abused these earbuds for 5 years and I bought them on sale for 15 bucks. Tell me beats or Bose can give me that much bang for my buck,B01G8JO5F2
Great sound with a decent price,B01G8JO5F2
I like how well they fit. Good sound and easy to use.,B01G8JO5F2
"Sound is fine, but they are not super well made. The button for turning on off/pausing is poorly designed and doesn’t function half the time.",B01G8JO5F2
Excellent,B01G8JO5F2
Purchased for privacy. They work great. The price was also great .,B01G8JO5F2
"Bluetooth, sound quality and comfort are all good.  The on/off and volume controls are easily accessible.",B01G8JO5F2
"Sound great, even better than my first pair.  The ear piece is comfortable and stays in place.  Great product.",B01G8JO5F2
Love em,B01G8JO5F2
"Fantastic wireless ear buds. The sound quality is great, and I reccommend the red foam buds that come in the set. They last for hours, and have good range. I haven't actually worn them long enough in any one use to kill the battery, but I'd say they have at least 8 hours battery life, if not more. The adjustable ear cuff is also pretty great, but it is a bit fiddly especially if you have more hair, or put your hair up.<br /><br />They are super obvious, and may not be good for work if you need something more discreet.",B01G8JO5F2
Excelent!! Shipped on time!!! I LOVE IT!!!,B01G8JO5F2
What I like most is the fact these fit my ears and won't fall out like the Apple pods.  They also have the added security of the hook that goes over your ears.  Great product,B01G8JO5F2
"I do have to say that the product stood up to what it was described as, very happy with my decision battery life is phenomenal really easy setup! Along with Amazon the seller of this product was fantastic.",B01G8JO5F2
Good for the prize.,B01G8JO5F2
"I have been trying different headphones and got mostly disappointed, but these headphones are great! They are my favorite so far! Good sound quality and they stay in place even if I jump a lot during my workouts! Love them!",B01G8JO5F2
I used the headphones for 2 months after going trough 3 pairs of MPOW headphones and yet again I run into another brand that has a great price but if you use them daily don't last. At least these didn't melt.,B01G8JO5F2
Exceeded expectations,B01G8JO5F2
"I bought 2 pairs because I had one from a year ago that was stolen from my car. The part that goes over your ear is flexible and you can mold it so the headphones are pretty much guaranteed not to fall off. I work as a housekeeper so this is very important. The old ones ended up in a toilet maybe more than once. Im also very impressed with the battery life,mine usually lasts more like 9-10 hrs. One pair of my headphones didnt work right on arrival, but the replacement works great.",B01G8JO5F2
I have had this headset for a few months with light use (I haven't sweated in them) and it won't stay connected to my phone even though other devices do. I only needed a headset for hands-free driving. I could have gotten an $80-100 set for the price I will have spent after replacing these.,B01G8JO5F2
"I purchased these in 2018, used them at them gym 4 days per weeks, washed them 5 times by mistake, lost them and didn't charge them for a month and they still performed flawlessly.  The 6th wash in hot water with bleach finally killed them but got them for $15 in a flash sale so got more than my moneys worth and will buy these again",B01G8JO5F2
I bought these headphones because they were recommended for small ears. I really wanted them to work but sadly they kept falling out of my ears while running.,B01G8JO5F2
Calidad buena,B01G8JO5F2
Good device,B01G8JO5F2
"I tried many Bluetooth headphones before finding these. My biggest issue was having any fit in my ears without falling out. These not only fit my funny ears perfectly, but the sound quality is amazing. Very easy to use and highly recommend.",B01G8JO5F2
Worked amazing for the 4 months i have had them . However they wont charge now. I have tried different cords and let it sit as well as wiggle it and it just won't change. These have been my favorite purchase. Just sad they died so soon.,B01G8JO5F2
Worked fine for many months but has stopped charging now.,B01G8JO5F2
"has good sound and feel around the ear, just has shorter battery life the more used.",B01G8JO5F2
Just recently received today will see if they like them as a gift !,B01G8JO5F2
Good for working out,B01G8JO5F2
"It's critical to play around with the different sizes of the changeable ear cushions to get the right fit. Once you do, you will love these earphones. They give good sound and stay in place no matter how much you move around. I wear them for phone calls, conference calls, and listening to music/books/tv and they work beautifully. I've never had a problem with the mic during calls. When I have them both in my ears the noise cancellation is good. I like the fact that the phones are wired together, so if I only have one in my ear I can hook the other on my shirt or let it hang--so I don't have to worry about it getting lost. I would recommend these for someone listening while on the move.",B01G8JO5F2
"These earbuds work great! Until they don't.<br />Bought ActivBuds A-1 which worked until one ear suddenly stopped working about 3 months later. Then bought S250 which also worked great for ~6 months, and now just randomly turn off every few minutes (it's not a charging issue - earbuds show 70% charge and it also happens after 4 hours charging). I also didn't do anything with them except use for 1-2 hours a few times a week in a dry environment.<br />No help from customer support because it's right after warranty expired.<br /><br />May still be worth the price, but be aware that you are buying a product that will last only 3-6 months.",B01G8JO5F2
Description says bluetooth connects up to 30 ft but the literature that comes with the headphones says bluetooth only connects to 3ft.,B01G8JO5F2
"Too big to hit up under a helmet,  but awesome sound quality. Very lightweight ....but a cheap ear guard.",B01G8JO5F2
"Great . Pair with my iPhone have no problems . Charge super fast and battery life is long ! Would recommend""",B01G8JO5F2
Long battery life and great sound quality! Great purchase!,B01G8JO5F2
"I like my earbuds to be glued into my ear canal, I use the foam pieces and during a workout they do start to slip a little. But it’s such a great price that I don’t mind having to adjust them now and then.",B01G8JO5F2
"I agree with previous reviewers. I have bought these headphones numerous times since I have a tendency to lose. However, the pair I most recently received is NOT the same. The main headphone part is now hollow, cheap plastic as opposed to the more comfortable rubber from all previous pairs.<br /><br />Furthermore, when turning on/off, the voice in the headphones is extremely loud and that doesn’t seem to be able to be adjusted. Pretty disappointing in this pair and won’t be ordering again when I do eventually lose (which may happen sooner than later for a reason).",B01G8JO5F2
These are some great sounding headphones.  They're loud enough to hear while riding my bicycle,B01G8JO5F2
These do not fit around the ears. I am always adjusting them. When I run they fall out. Terrible product.,B01G8JO5F2
Love the sound and time on . Great while mowing the lawn.,B01G8JO5F2
Great product for the value.,B01G8JO5F2
Easy to connect to phones i have.,B01G8JO5F2
"Works great, fits nice and great battery!",B01G8JO5F2
Excellent headphones with great battery life and quick charging time. Great with most all activities.,B01G8JO5F2
Love them but they stopped working just past the 1 yr warranty,B01G8JO5F2
So good so far,B01G8JO5F2
"For the price the performance of these earbuds is great. There is no really discernable noise cancellation, but work a properly fitting ear top (I use memory foam) most outside noise is eliminated. I've had no moisture issues, but the fit of the loop is easily bent if your cram them in you pocket.",B01G8JO5F2
"These are enormous! I don't know what size ear these are made for, but they hit so far above my ear that it totally defeats the purpose. I can't speak to the quality otherwise, as I did not try them out.",B01G8JO5F2
Not sure why people would pay for those expensive headphones. These are worth the price.,B01G8JO5F2
Just got these today but I’m am super impressed. Great quality. Connected right up. Love the foam tips! They fit super secure. Also comes with 3 different sized regular tips. My only issue is the unadjusted eq. It’s totally lacking highs and some mids so if your planning on using these for a music app like amazon music or pandora which don’t have an equalizer function these aren’t for you. I ended up downloading Spotify and with a few adjustments to the built in equalizer these things are perfect. I haven’t tested the waterproof side of things but I don’t plan on ever needing it.,B01G8JO5F2
"Just tried them out last night, awesome sound quality for my music. I don’t know yet how long the battery lasts. And as I use them more I’m sure I’ll be able to get the kinks out of the cord. Love the little carrying case for them.",B01G8JO5F2
I am using these headphones in the gym for my treadmill workout listening to books.,B01G8JO5F2
Signal breaks up when more than 1.5 feet away.,B01G8JO5F2
"Great sound,  good battery life.  Very good set of ear buds for the price.  Replacement buds are hard to find.",B01G8JO5F2
These headphones do not reliably connect to bluetooth.  They cannot be found on most of my devices.,B01G8JO5F2
"UPDATE: They have finally reached their limit. After about a year and a half they have broken, they will not stay connected to my phone or even stay on. I guess you get what you pay for with these.<br /><br />I used to bye $10 earbuds from amazon but I kept losing my iPhone dongle (which is also $10) so I decide to get wireless headphones. I also needed something better for an active life (not always worrying about a wire when working out).<br />I've had these headphones for about a year and I've used them at the gym, on the plane, in my room, etc. The sound quality isn't anything terrible, I don't find my music to be dull or empty but not 100% like Bose headphone quality (expected). I'm able to run/lift/bike and have no problems with them staying in. Sometimes when I leave my phone to grab more weights the sound starts to break up but the range isn't terrible, almost helps me remember to take my phone with me when I leave an area.<br />Battery life is good and charging is really easy. May look a little bulky in the ear for some people but for me I like that it lets people know that I'm clearly listening to music and not just ignoring them. Good product for the price, already recommended it to friends:)",B01G8JO5F2
They are amazing,B01G8JO5F2
"I had Bluetooth Beats before this.. and JBL before that. These are easily comparable in sound. Definitely just as loud I live in Houston and my gym is in a warehouse so I’m sweating constantly. I mean I’m realllly sweating and these things have lasted a couple of months now and show no signs of failure like my others have. They stay charged longer than my beats did. I’ve charged mine not even 10 times now and I’m working out every day. No one told me to write this review. I knew if they were doing great I would write a review after a few weeks.<br /><br />Cons - the ear piece can bend around your ear, so for ME* when I’m running I have to have the chord around the front in order to stay on when it’s windy or I’m running fast. They don’t fall out if I wear them this way so that’s not too bad. Secondly, when the battery is low, it will warn you and they did quickly after within minutes. * just be sure to charge them once a week or so and you won’t have this problem.",B01G8JO5F2
There is only two cons to these headphones. One is that they aren't super easy to put on. I never really had wrap around head phones like these so I'm sure I'll get better at putting them on. Secondly I found it weird that you can't really see the battery percentage but once your headphones are low on battery it makes an annoying beeping noise.<br /><br />But other than that I really am enjoying these headphones a lot! Sound quality is great and I can walk away from my phone a good distance before it starts cutting out.,B01G8JO5F2
I really appreciate the reliability of this product..<br />I have purchased this product multiple times because I have them in when I sleep.<br />I easily and quickly switch them out without hiccups.<br />The only reason I didn't give them a 5 star rating is that if I have them synched to more than one device I have to go into blue tooth settings to select them...<br />When they are synched up to only one device the automatic connection is very quick.,B01G8JO5F2
"Earbuds kept turning on while inside case. Returned after a week. Seemed to work ok when on, but large case that did not protect the buds properly.",B01G8JO5F2
As described,B01G8JO5F2
"Light weight, long lasting battery life, could get better range but for the money these are definitely a great value.",B01G8JO5F2
I really have no complaints visit been perfect for me I have now purchased three pairs one for myself and one for each of my teenage boys. They’re comfortable and they sound good and they have different fittings for Different ear Comfortability,B01G8JO5F2
I would not recommend this product. I used it not more than 10 times and it stopped working.,B01G8JO5F2
"I like that these buds were reasonably priced, were easy to pair with my devices and have good sound quality",B01G8JO5F2
"Sound is very tinny, difficult to hear. I am returning them.",B01G8JO5F2
I use these a lot at work. So much so I have several pair so I always have a set charged up.  Between home and work I’ve owned quite a few of these over the last 4-5 years.  When I first started buying they were great. But in the last 6 months to a year the earbud quality has really gone downhill. I have a lot of problems with connectivity and with earbuds lasting. T he last set I got lasted 6 weeks. Now they won’t charge. Time to look for another brand.,B01G8JO5F2
"I use them for the gym, I love how they stay in place and are not bulky.",B01G8JO5F2
"This is my second pair of Senso headphones. And after two years of almost daily use at the gym, the left side is going out. Not sure if others have the same experience, but I loved these and didn't find anything negative about them. I guess a $20 investment for two years is not bad.",B01G8JO5F2
"I use these while traveling, working out, and doing yard work.  They work great.  The only con I have is that it seems like when it's connected to my phone it always reads 90% (sometimes it shows 70% but rare) then out of nowhere seems to beep and indicate it needs to be charged.  Don't get me wrong, the battery life is great and gives you hours of life but it's hard to gauge how much life is left.  Would recommend!",B01G8JO5F2
"Good wireless function but the cord gets pulled to one side when working out, they really aren’t good for working out which is why I bought them, disappointed",B01G8JO5F2
They stay on my ears without pain.  I sew for hours and listen to audiobooks.  These keep me listening in comfort.,B01G8JO5F2
VERY HAPPY WITH PRODUCT,B01G8JO5F2
"For this price i expected some cheap headphones that i was just gonna use for running. Turns out the quality is amazing, sound quality is really good, strong bass, battery lasts longer than most wireless headphones ive owned",B01G8JO5F2
"Like many low cost blue tooth ear buds, these did not last more than 2 months. I don't know if it was sweat getting inside them during workouts, manufacturing defects, or a bad battery, but after taking great care to charge them every six or so hours of use, they will no longer charge or power on. Your money will be better spent on a higher quality item.",B01G8JO5F2
This is one of my favorite products purchased through Amazon. I use these headphones every single day. They have great battery life and they have lasted numerous gym and hiking sessions. I still use them all the time! Highly recommend for the price,B01G8JO5F2
Although they were great at the beginning anfter a few months sound started to get destorted and out of the blue I would drop calls all the time.  Always kept them in the protective pouch and out of the blue the charge does not work and they don’t charge even with a different cable. I guess you get what you pay for,B01G8JO5F2
"Horribly uncomfortable design, buttons are unsecured and rattle while you run",B01G8JO5F2
Exactly what I was hoping for.  Great sounding blue tooth headphones at an affordable price.,B01G8JO5F2
"These headphones are fantastic. They cancel out the work office noise (phones), when music is on. Nothing play, the noice is muffled and not as loud.",B01G8JO5F2
Was fine for about 18 months. Then just stopped working for no reason at all.,B01G8JO5F2
The sound is good quality and the battery holds a charge well.  Better than expected quality for the price paid.,B01G8JO5F2
"The sound quality is good.  The fit is okay as well.  Not great.  But they do stay on.<br /><br />The controls are the exact opposite of every other Bluetooth headset I've owned.  When listening to music, the front button is the ""back"" button to repeat the track.  The back button is the ""skip"" button to go to the next track.<br /><br />The sound up/down and skip/repeat functions are also the opposite.  I'm used to tapping the forward button once to skip a song.  But with this headset, you have to hold it down and wait.  So if you're trying to skip multiple songs at the same time, it takes FOREVER.<br /><br />The quick tap function is to raise and lower the volume, which is something I rarely feel the need to do.  Certainly far less than skipping/repeating songs.  So like I said, the functions are opposite from what they should be.",B01G8JO5F2
Looks good. Nice product.,B01G8JO5F2
Great sound quality & superb noise cancellation.,B01G8JO5F2
If they are not seated properly they can be somewhat uncomfortable but otherwise are great,B01G8JO5F2
Unknown at this time.  My wife is happy to recieve,B01G8JO5F2
"I end up needing a new set of wireless headphones every 6-8 months (in most cases it's from heavy/rough use rather than the headphones itself) so I get try a lot of different brands.<br /><br />This pair works perfectly well as a cheap Bluetooth headset and I use it regularly around the house. The sound quality and battery life are both standard and I haven't noticed any actual defects in the manufacturing.<br /><br />There are two things I'll single them out for.<br />First, the ear hooks are extra long and flexible. This may be a plus for you, if you find that other hooks are too short. I don't have that issue, so this ends up actually being a little bit of an annoyance, because every once in a while they'll get stretched and then I have to reshape them around my ears.<br />The second thing- and this is pretty minor- is that unlike other brands the power jack's cover doesn't pivot: it's simply a flap that lifts up. This just means that it takes a little bit of extra effort to keep the flap out of the way when you're plugging it in. I haven't had an issue with the flap wearing out or falling out of the charger, which is good.<br /><br />Bottom line: these are very good headphones for $20 with no significant flaws.",B01G8JO5F2
Buena compra,B01G8JO5F2
"The se are the Best ones I've ever had. They work perfect and have a great audio quality. It was a recommendation from a friend, and I'm still thanking her for it.",B01G8JO5F2
"Excellent buy! You will not be disappointed. These are top quality, excellent sound and battery life. Can't beat it. No problems and so happy with my purchase!",B01G8JO5F2
"Bought these because the headphones I ordered were not good at all, I returned them immediately. I ordered  Senso, As soon as I<br />Started playing music the sound was terrific I especially liked the deep bass. Priced right good product.",B01G8JO5F2
"This is my 2nd pair of Senso headphones.  My first pair finally fell apart at the charging port. I use them daily in construction and have passed the word to some of my co workers of how good these headphones are for the money. They are durable, sound very good, fit well and the battery life blows away wireless headphones that cost much more. Try these out. You will not be disappointed.",B01G8JO5F2
Great product for the price,B01G8JO5F2
"I've had these for three months and they die at 30% battery, so the battery life is lacking. They also hurt my ears if I wear for more than 30 mins at a time. I wouldn't get these again, a complete waste of money.",B01G8JO5F2
"Great headphones for general purpose news, but if you are an avid runner that does track work or any type of speed interval running ... or if you just go running on a windy day, I would not recommend these have a lot of wind noise. Anything faster than a 6:30 pace for me and I have too much wind noise on even a calm day for it to be enjoyable. Fine for slow runs, otherwise...",B01G8JO5F2
Very good bloodroots headphones the price. They connect easily to my iPad Pro 11 and iPhone XR.,B01G8JO5F2
"The earpiece is a bit large to really secure to your ear, but works well enough. Sound quality is decent for a budget headphone.",B01G8JO5F2
Fit well and excellent sound.,B01G8JO5F2
"Sound and battery is amazing!! The fit is good, the adjustable hook thing gets kinda loose so I have to adjust each time which is not a big deal. Main thing is battery is great and sound is also which are most important!! Quality build.",B01G8JO5F2
Great sound. Best in bluetooth headphone connect and battery life,B01G8JO5F2
I use them for running and cutting wood and they work great.,B01G8JO5F2
The charging port broke inside the headphones the first time I went to plug in the charger. I got one use out of them.,B01G8JO5F2
"I love these headphones. I used to have a pair of the much more expensive brands. With the 1000s of positive reviews, I decided to try them. They sound as good as the others. I did have an issue with my headphone not recharging. I emailed Senso, got a response immediately and they worked with me to replace my defective unit. Outstanding service.",B01G8JO5F2
"+ Audio is very good quality for the cost of the headphones.  Bass is impressive, although a bit much at times.<br />+ CVC noise cancellation is effective.<br />- Slight discomfort inside the ears after 5-10 min.",B01G8JO5F2
"The sound quality of these headphones is great. Using with the Fire phone @ gym. Comfortable, secure fit. Also a great experience with the seller, Senso.",B01G8JO5F2
Stopped working after using them twice. Poor poor quality.,B01G8JO5F2
"I purchased these in February of 2017 and I have been amazed by the sound quality since day 1. Amazing clarity, good bass, and high quality sound. The battery life is also worth bragging about. Each of my gym sesseion lasts about 2 hours, and sometimes I go 3 or 4 sessions without charging it and they have only died on me once (my own damn fault). Just this month, a year and 10 months later, one of the earpieces started going in and out. I have put these things through the ringer and they have taken liters of my sweat and worked great for almost 2 years. I am writing this review now since I was so pleased that I am purchasing another pair. At this price point, there is no comparison. These things are AMAZING!!!",B01G8JO5F2
Great sound and so light.  LOVE these!,B01G8JO5F2
I sweat really a LOT while working out. This headset is really IPX7 level sweat/water proof. It easily lasts for ~7-8 workouts on a single charge. My last pair lasted me for about 2 years. This headset performs really good.,B01G8JO5F2
I really like the ear phones. The unit stays in place while running. The battery capacity is great. The unit still has a charge after two days of workouts.,B01G8JO5F2
Just what I was looking for.  Great sound and easy set up.,B01G8JO5F2
Ok so my job allows us  to listen to music on the weekends but I also have to use my hands so I've been looking for and reading reviews on wireless headsets with good sound quality but the issue is my ears are pretty small so I knew going into it the thought of just wasting my money just to fall out of my ear when I looked at this one and read the  reviews all the reviews on here was great  so I decides to trust and try  it . when I received them I was extremely happy the earpiece itself is flexable so even with my small ears I can move it around to adjust to my needs.  I am also happy with ordering through Amazon because when it was delivered it was raining so I was afraid when I got home that it would have been destroyed but Amazon itself put it in a nice plastic bag to keep it safe. This particular purchase came with a nice case charging cable to charge it and I also like the additional information that I gave that you can't use a cheap charger otherwise it'll somehow destroy the earbuds so that's a nice little tidbit of information that was useful to me. This particular purchase also came with a card holder that I can put on the back of my phone and also a phone holder a magnetic one that I could hook to my car which is pretty nice I got rid of my big bulky one  and just clicked it on to my vent and put the little magnet on back of my phone and Bam there you go. back to the earphones  itself. it was really nice to be able to work hands-free take a phone call listen to my music and  call with just a single touch even though I still have to learn the buttons on where they are as I hung up on the person I was talking to a couple times but other than that I was extremely happy with this purchase and I will purchase again. The customer service has been great letting me know that there is a warranty and that if I need anything to let them know through single email and they'll be in contact within 24 hours I hope to never have to use them but it's nice to know that they're there if I need them.,B01G8JO5F2
The work great until the get a random short in the cord which cause them headphones to cut off. This is my second pair that this has happened on.,B01G8JO5F2
I've been using them since November 2018. I'm amazed that it has lasted so long. The battery life is still pretty good. The sound has a good bass.<br /><br />They are great for working out and since last year I've been using them daily;  because of COVID19 I have been using them always for phone calls because I work supporting health care workers and sometimes its safer to use a headphone for attending phone calls rather than using your cell phone directly.,B01G8JO5F2
Excellent value overall for what you get.,B01G8JO5F2
"This product stopped working less than one year. It won't become blue tooth discoverable, just toggles on and off. also, the light is lit both blue and red. I would spent a little more for better quality.",B01G8JO5F2
DO NOT BUY. The left earbud went out in less than 3 months.,B01G8JO5F2
Best value for product,B01G8JO5F2
I use these everyday when I run. they are working great. Super fast shipping too. Recommend!,B01G8JO5F2
I love everything about these ear buds! The sound is just as amazing as the fit!!,B01G8JO5F2
My son loves them,B01G8JO5F2
Good quality,B01G8JO5F2
I love everything about them,B01G8JO5F2
"GREAT! I use them everyday, and they are the most comfortable headset I have used for exercising.",B01G8JO5F2
"I like these headphones , great quality , great fit and price",B01G8JO5F2
Best buy I ever made! Bought it for my husband so I don't have to listen to him watching youtube videos. It is great! He loves it and so do I!,B01G8JO5F2
"I used my headphones for about six months, on and off, until out of the blue they stopped working. They were kept in their zip container away from everything between gym visits. I would save your money and buy something more reputable.",B01G8JO5F2
Put haded for my husband. He’s usually really bad with head phones but this one is still around he loves it sounds good,B01G8JO5F2
Works get when exercising,B01G8JO5F2
Absolutely love them the sound is perfect love the colors so far they are water resistant Best buy I've ever made on earbuds,B01G8JO5F2
"I used these headphones for 3 years and bought them for tons of friends and family as a gift. Durability, sound quality, customer service, all first rate. Note that I used one set for three years.<br /><br />However, recently they made the ear hooks ""adjustable,"" meaning they changed them from a stiff, springy rubber to a flexible rubber. Since the new earhooks do not retain a shape, they are ineffective at holding them onto your ear during vigorous activity like punching a heavy bag or turning your head quickly while wearing a jacket. Senso, can you please correct this product deficiency? When you do, I will change my review back to the 5 stars you deserve.",B01G8JO5F2
These we're supposed to be my swimming headphones. They didn't last a lap. They are nit waterproof or good for swimming.,B01G8JO5F2
Would Buy Again!,B01G8JO5F2
"The headphones stopped working about 45 days prior to the warranty expiring. I called tech support and they determined the headphones were not working properly and indicated I would be sent a replacement. I received an email from the warranty department saying they would replace my headphones in a few days. 30 days later I have not received my replacement headphones. I called the support line, the support representative said my case was still open and he could not tell me when it would be closed, when I would receive replacement headphone, or provide a way to escalate or call the warranty department. A very disappointing experience.",B01G8JO5F2
I workout out with these headphones and my 7 years old son use it also and it’s been a month now and I find sometimes under the couch or on his neck while his asleep and still works and sound like brand new. Who need the apple AirPods when you have this one 🤷‍♀️😍👌,B01G8JO5F2
Good product,B01G8JO5F2
Sound quality is not great but that's not what I was looking for in these anyway. The around the ear piece is flexible rubber so you can mold it your ear and they don't fall off! Would buy again for $20,B01G8JO5F2
"Started off great hardly used them. I opened the case, unfold them, and the cord between the earbuds tore apart.",B01G8JO5F2
"These headphones are value priced, were easy to pair with my devices, and provide very good sound. Exceeded my expectations.",B01G8JO5F2
This is the second pair I purchased in 2 years they hold up well.,B01G8JO5F2
Nice,B01G8JO5F2
I love my senso headphones.  They wrap fit my ear perfectly.  They cancel background noise. I highly recommend them.,B01G8JO5F2
As described.  Wonderful sound. Arrived BEFORE expected delivery date!!!,B01G8JO5F2
Product is as described and shipping was fast.,B01G8JO5F2
"I first purchased over a year ago. I wore them every where so when I broke them I couldn't be mad, I had gotten more than what I paid. My new pair is here and I still love them. #greatinvestment",B01G8JO5F2
"Now that I've used the SENSO Bluetooth Wireless Headphones for awhile, I can attest to the fact that they provide excellent sound quality! Battery life is really good. Overall, I definitely recommend these wireless headphones to my friends.",B01G8JO5F2
"These headset are awesome, sounds great and it exactly as it's advertised. However the only issues for  me us that it fall if my ear while working other most times. Other that it's a really good product.",B01G8JO5F2
Flimsy material. Ear pieces doesn’t stay shaped to your ear. The package came with a million accessories that you don’t need. If your like me i just want headphones i can run with that won’t fall off.I guess i got what i paid for.,B01G8JO5F2
They fit well and it’s easy to use on my run!,B01G8JO5F2
"Surprised about the sound on these, need a longer running battery, last about 6 hours, worth buying if you’re looking for a good not expensive headphones, worth the price",B01G8JO5F2
Bass distorts a little when on high volume but this is typical.  I did not like the kink the twist tie on the cord creates when packaged.  I assume this will work out over time but a different way of coiling the cord would eliminate this.,B01G8JO5F2
Great product for the price.,B01G8JO5F2
Great quality sounds so good,B01G8JO5F2
"I purchased these headphones to replace a pair that had stopped working (would no longer synch up).  The previous set was probably over a year old, but honestly I really don't remember exactly when I got them.  In any case, I liked them enough that I got another set even though the first set eventually failed.  I enjoyed them enough, and the price was reasonable enough that I felt that I had gotten my money's worth.  I'm hopeful that this pair will last longer.",B01G8JO5F2
great Christmas gift,B01G8JO5F2
My husband and I both bought these headphones when the wireless pods my husband had fell off into a puddle of water.  These were recommended to us by our son and we are in love.  Great product!,B01G8JO5F2
These suddenly stopped working on August 23.  I take perfect care of them and they barely lasted two months.  I am extremely disappointed.,B01G8JO5F2
Tried these to use for video meetings on a laptop.  I had continued issues with these with the mic dropping out and the audio quality was not good. I verified it wasn't the built in Bluetooth on the laptop. The battery life was about 7 hours with just having the earbuds on. I returned these as I was not happy with the quality.,B01G8JO5F2
"Got these for working out at the gym, my corded earbuds keep getting caught on stuff... These sound great, and are much safer to boot.",B01G8JO5F2
I use the daily at work and to work out and they stay on very well are comfortable and last awhile before needing a charge. I would definitely recommend these earbuds.,B01G8JO5F2
Second pair that I have purchased.  These headphones hold up well during workouts and working around the yard.  Very easy to pair and very easy to operate.  This is a very well designed product and the battery life remains constant.,B01G8JO5F2
I use them everyday and I’m still satisfied with them,B01G8JO5F2
"These met all my needs in terms sound quality for playing music and functionality for exercising. Battery was okay, it would last a few hours if I played music nonstop. I bought these at the end of 2017, it's been 4 years of usage here and there, and these are starting to fail now. Last week suddenly, I started having connectivity issues where the earbuds refused to connect to my phone and kept disconnecting. I am still unable to properly connect to bluetooth and use these at all. I would rate these 5 stars overall, but knocked down a star because they are no longer usable.",B01G8JO5F2
bought specifically to wear at football games,B01G8JO5F2
great,B01G8JO5F2
"I’ve found these to be the best headphones for the price. Not only do they stay in your ear well, but the sound quality Is insanely good. I’ve owned beats that’s didn’t have nearly as much bass or had the clarity these do. And most headphones I’ve brought that were “workout proof” were so quiet and uncomfortable. But these won’t dissapoint. The only reason I’ve had to buy 4 pairs for these were because I broke them. Other than that, absolute best headphones I’ve bought.",B01G8JO5F2
They work great and comfortable,B01G8JO5F2
I love my Bluetooth it’s my second pair in seven years,B01G8JO5F2
Like that they came with a nice case for storage,B01G8JO5F2
"Dang, these headphones are pretty decent!",B01G8JO5F2
"I have used similar earphones from mpow for workouts. Got this since the old one stopped working after a year and some months. Just by looking at this product, I can say the build quality is poor compared to my old ones. Gave it a shot since I didn't want to step out to do the return. With 4-5 light workout sessions, it is dead now. It was decent sound quality when it was working.",B01G8JO5F2
"Actually decent earphones HOWEVER they are supposed to be ""waterproof"" and to come with 1yr warranty. I purchased them 2.5 months ago, dropped them in the pool literally for a few seconds and they stopped working. I called manufacturer Tekatron customer service 3x and each time I was told I would hear back from their warranty dept. 9 days after my first call I'm still waiting.",B01G8JO5F2
Very uncomfortable after 30 mins of use. Other then that they sound better then my air pods.,B01G8JO5F2
I love these have bought several pair and seem to last longer than any I've bought before.,B01G8JO5F2
horrible don’t stay on your ears the plastic too light,B01G8JO5F2
like them!,B01G8JO5F2
"I got a pair of these a couple years ago and they were awesome. So awesome that when they finally crapped out, I didn't mind buying another pair. However, I found out with this new pair that the ear hooks are now totally different; they're huge and made with moldable rubber (probably to accomdate more ear sizes). The last pair fit perfect, but these are extremely difficult to get to fit right each and every time I wear them. Guess I'll just chalk them up as the millionth pair of headphones I've had that won't stay in my ears and restart a new search for the mythical pair that does...",B01G8JO5F2
"I really love these headphones but, have not had the chance to figure out to link them to the new mp3 player i received  In the meantime my computer automatically linked them  Great quality sound they have",B01G8JO5F2
Back ground noise,B01G8JO5F2
Do not waste your money. The sound quality is horrible and the earloops are made of spaghetti.,B01G8JO5F2
The only reason that this didn't get 5 stars is because the ear loops don't fit me (and the package didn't come with any adjustable sizes) BUT the earbuds themselves actually fit pretty snug in my ears and they have managed to stay put without the loops. The sound cancelling quality is more than enough for my day to day and working out as well.,B01G8JO5F2
"Great product, delivered fast, just as advertised.",B01G8JO5F2
Quality sound with bold bass. Blutooth works great. The overall presentation with all the little accessories included is unbeatable for the price. 10/10,B01G8JO5F2
"I ordered these several years ago and unfortunately my puppy ate the the first set. She's okay. And the quality was great! Then the second set and accidentally closed them n the car door. I reorderd my third set because the battery life and quality was great for the value.<br /><br />But the set that came the charger cable did not fit the the device and I returned it for replacement. The replacement set did not fit either. I found the cable from the first and second set and it fit.<br /><br />When you turn on the headset you hear an Asian accent voice say ""Power on"". The first two sets did not have an accent. Truly a sign that this is made in China. Because the set does not hold a charge like the original one purchased, I'm ditching these and looking for something more reliable.",B01G8JO5F2
ok,B01G8JO5F2
"I haven’t used the headphones yet, because they don’t fit on my ear. For a person with larger ears they’re probably great, but for me they are definitely difficult to use.",B01G8JO5F2
Good Bluetooth,B01G8JO5F2
This would be great buy they don’t last long,B01G8JO5F2
Quit working after having around 6-7 months!,B01G8JO5F2
"This is my first pair of bluetooth headphones and so far they work really well. I use them while running at working out. They stay in place unlike earbuds and not having the cord is super convenient. The range for the bluetooth connection isn't great but its enough to put the phone down while working out, just don't go to far from it. Overall I would recommend especially for the price.",B01G8JO5F2
Wow. These are great. Wonderful sound quality and comfortable.  I use them at the gym. Great value. Highly recommend these.,B01G8JO5F2
"For fellow runners, only got these yesterday. I'd say amazing value for the price. Quite comfortable, doesn't fall off while running and doesn't cause pain in the ward with prolonged wearing. A bit heavy in the ears but the cord is not as annoying as I'd expected. Bass is very good. Will have to see how the battery life holds up.",B01G8JO5F2
I've had this pair since March 2018 and never a problem. I like the product and use it all the time. Just recently I had a problem with the headphones connecting to my phone. I noticed i was still under warranty and contacted costumer service via email. They replied right a way with instructions to trouble shoot. Unfortunately that did not do the trick and I let them know. They apologized and let me know that a new pair would be shipped right away since i was indeed under warranty.<br /><br />Great costumer service!,B01G8JO5F2
"I got these for my husband because he likes to walk at lunch and they said they were water resistant or water proof (we live in Seattle), they've been great for him! He uses they ALL the time, they have great sound quality and he's had no complaints.",B01G8JO5F2
"A lot of extra goodies that come with the earbuds.  My first set didn't work, and after emailing them, they did a great job resolving my issue.  Thank you, Senso.  They work great.  I recommend.",B01G8JO5F2
"working great!  connectivity was simple, battery life is good, audio quality is good..",B01G8JO5F2
"love the earphones good quality, nice fit, bought my second one because the first one broke. totally worth the money.<br />great for exercise too.",B01G8JO5F2
This reviewer' first stab at using bluetooth--and this product is great.  Am listening to a podcast (just discovered that bluetooth goes in and out when the microwave is on; interesting); excellent range of distance from audio source; they feel quite comfortable; easy to use.  Just walked dog while listening..hey! there's the phone ringing--just did call by bluetooth.  Definitely works for me!,B01G8JO5F2
Great sound and very durable👌,B01G8JO5F2
Really cheap and durable. The battery life is no joke and the sounds is good.,B01G8JO5F2
These headphones are excellent quality and at a great price. The support is also very helpful .,B01G8JO5F2
Had the older model and liked them but the ear plug tip broke.<br />So ordered another pair but when i received them noticed the ear hooks were different.<br />To bend them just right it is annoying and will not hold its shape.<br />Very disappointed.,B01G8JO5F2
I’m still getting used to them but I love the fit and the sound quality is really nice,B01G8JO5F2
Love everything except for over the ear part would be better if adjustable.,B01G8JO5F2
"Awesome. I use them few months and am happy with that purchase. Headphones are great for joggers. They fit my ears. I don't have to worry they fall. No cord - this is the best thing, especially for runners. The sound is good. Battery life is OK. Sometimes a few minutes of charging before the running is enough to have music with me during my runnings. Recommend the seller and these headphones.",B01G8JO5F2
Great sound quality and comfortable  to wear.  Easy to pair.,B01G8JO5F2
nothing,B01G8JO5F2
"connect easily, volume true and sound good.  use for running",B01G8JO5F2
"Comes with different sizes of ear pieces, which is great for small ears like mine.",B01G8JO5F2
"I love these earphones and highly recommend them for anyone -- I use them while working out, cleaning the house, and walking around town.<br /><br />PROS: Great fit (comes with multiple different ear pieces so you can pick whichever suits you); surprisingly great noise cancelling; fits securely; appears to be waterproof? (I don't soak it in water or run in the rain, but it works despite my sweat?); great battery life; good Bluetooth connectivity<br /><br />CONS: The cover for the USB charger can sometimes be a pain to pull off",B01G8JO5F2
Excellent sound quality.  Easy to set up and use.,B01G8JO5F2
"Great sound quality for the price, and good battery life.",B01G8JO5F2
These have solid sound quality and noise level at an affordable price!,B01G8JO5F2
Good sound quality. Snug fit during workouts. Good value,B01G8JO5F2
"Product stopped working after 1.5 years. Just died, wont charge or eigher turn on. Very disappointed.",B01G8JO5F2
Ive purchased a few pair of these ear buds. Not because they failed but because i was careless and lost or dropped them. They are very comfortable to wear and have great volume and clear sound. Only set I ever buy,B01G8JO5F2
They worked well especially for the price.<br />They do just kind of die over time but everything does. We probably got about 8mo worth of average use from them.<br />We bought 3 pairs for our sons and they worked as I would expect for the price I paid.,B01G8JO5F2
"After a couple of months of using it,  It disconnects on and off, frustrating.",B01G8JO5F2
I love this headphone so much using for my running.,B01G8JO5F2
Nice package. Good quality,B01G8JO5F2
"Overall a good bluetooth headset, with easy controls, good battery life, and a snug fit. Definitely sensitive to wind when you run outside, unfortunately.",B01G8JO5F2
I use these for running.  They are great because they don’t fall out of my ears the sound is good and the price was better.,B01G8JO5F2
Excellent price for sound quality of much more expensive brands!,B01G8JO5F2
I found a pair of these in the smoke pit area in Qatar and when I tried them on they were so much better that BOSE or the BEATS.  In my opinion they do the same thing and snug on your ears.  They have adjustable ear pieces which is perfect for personnel that are active.  I love these headphones.  The only thing I wish is it had a longer time span instead of 8hrs.  but they still good,B01G8JO5F2
"Everything worked great as described for about a month. Then shuts off without warning. Difficult to pair with Bluetooth, after multiple attempts/factory reset. Don’t waste your time. You pay for what you get.",B01G8JO5F2
These are the best earbuds I have ever had. I am hard of hearing and have tested a lot of brands and models that can play loud and clear enough for me. These are the best by far! I highly recommend them even over the expensive brands such as Beats which are far to heavy on the bass and not loud enough for me.,B01G8JO5F2
These headphones did not work for me. They are hard to keep on and the sound is not that great.,B01G8JO5F2
Worth the price. Does not fall off while exercising.,B01G8JO5F2
Everything you want in headphones and then some.,B01G8JO5F2
"I used it during my meetings but all of sudden mic stop working, contacted customer service they asked me to reset. But did not helpful. Thenafter they are not replying.",B01G8JO5F2
Didn’t last! They broke after a few months! Not worth it!,B01G8JO5F2
Comfortable and great sound quality. Also stays in place while on treadmill,B01G8JO5F2
Great buy for the money. Sound is good but could probably be a little better however they are excellent for the price. I wear them mostly for running and I’m very pleased.,B01G8JO5F2
Great for the price. I really just don’t like how they fit my ears. They fall out sometimes when I run.,B01G8JO5F2
"This earbud will not hold in ear, despite changing earbud cover to small, it still won't stay. I suspect there is faulty design that prevents it from having a tight fit in external ear.",B01G8JO5F2
Awesome for workouts!,B01G8JO5F2
"Cost and simplicity.  These headphones are a great value!For the $20.00 price point, I dont know if you will do much better.  Fit, sound, battery life.  I was thinking of going for a $150 pair,  Glad I went this route instead.  Only minimal complaint is they stick out wide from your ears.  So you dont look incredibly sharp in them",B01G8JO5F2
The product is ok. It is too big for my ears. Maybe it was designed for old men. Comfortable and reasonable sound quality. I use it on my bike for podcasts and audiobooks and it isn’t loud enough for all.,B01G8JO5F2
One of the best headphones I have used.<br />With this price you will get great sound and durable headphones.,B01G8JO5F2
Nice price,B01G8JO5F2
First pair I bought lasted 3 years.  This pair- just over a month.  Won't charge.,B01G8JO5F2
The only thing i find is they seem a bit bulky. it would be nice if they were a bit smaller in size.,B01G8JO5F2
"I really like the sound quality of the wireless earbuds, however for people with small ears they do not fit very secure. They kept falling off, which was irritating. The over the ear piece is not adjustable or bendable to wrap around. But again, they sound super good! Noise cancellation FIVE stars! I don’t hear NOTHING! That was the one thing kept me giving it 5 stars. Your ears may be bigger than mines and fit perfectly, mines not so much. I have to find another pair now, I need something more snug. I wish they came with changeable over the ear pieces they would get 10 stars from me!",B01G8JO5F2
"Comfortable fit, Great Sound. Comparable to similar headphones that are a lot more expensive, these are perfect for what I need.",B01G8JO5F2
"Excellent headphones, I was expecting less, but I really crush on it. Excellent quality. Perfect fit over the ears, non slippery even when sweating.""",B01G8JO5F2
Sound cancellation not an issue… use for talk radio mostly….entertainment while exercising,B01G8JO5F2
Great product for the price you pay. Fits in just perfect and the sound quality is good. I love the pouch to store my ear pods!!,B01G8JO5F2
Bought these so I can follow Google Maps direction when riding my Harley. Will let youknow how they work when the weather warms up...,B01G8JO5F2
"I don't spend time on writing reviews for headphones, but after buying multiple cheap sets. It's time to tell you to save your money and just go for the set that is over $50. You pay for what you get. I initially bought this to train with during my runs, they won't stay in your ear. I bought Beats Pro and will never go back.<br /><br />Save your money.",B01G8JO5F2
I like the soundmi like the price.<br />It could be a little stronger.,B01G8JO5F2
"I enjoy wearing these earphones around the house for my phone calls and also when I am listening to audiobooks while I take walks in the park. Comfortable and easy. Love the round box that they come in, as I also store a few other tech items in there as well. Bluetooth makes it a dream, rather than plugging in traditional earphones to my cell phone.",B01G8JO5F2
"I bought this product on mid October, 2018 and on January 8, 2019 (less than 3 months) isn't working anymore. It bothers me that I bought this to be broke so soon. It<br />sound pretty good but it didn't last more than 3 hrs. At the beginning one ear bud stop working and in less than a week it became unresponsive completely. I'm a mail carrier (hard job under the weather and around the holidays, 10-12 hrs per day 6 days a week) and listening to music while working makes my days more bearable. I would appreciate if someone contact me cause I miss the window to return it and because is not fair either.",B01G8JO5F2
cool,B01G8JO5F2
Senso bluetooth headphones are easy to install (the instruction book is easy to follow). The sound offers good quality for the cost. The small case makes it safe to transport the headphones. I would buy them again without hesitation.,B01G8JO5F2
The price and quality of these headphones are great. Long battery life. Great sound. Easy to use,B01G8JO5F2
They work as intended. Haven't had any issues. I enjoy them so much i bougt a back up pair and my wife a pair.,B01G8JO5F2
Listening to audio books.,B01G8JO5F2
Absolutely fantastic sound quality but the Bluetooth is pitifully weak.  Would be a five star product if the Bluetooth worked well,B01G8JO5F2
These buds stated running out of juice quickly at 11 months. Then would not take a charge. I would not recommend this product.,B01G8JO5F2
"Bought this pair of headphones to use while running.  First set came in an had some issues with calibration but customer service was excellent and they sent a replacement set within a week.  The replacement works great, stays connected and has great sound for my use.  I have used Sennheiser and Beats units and these are definitely comparable and a great value at the price point.",B01G8JO5F2
They broke in like 2 months.,B01G8JO5F2
I've tried a bunch of similar bluetooth earbuds in this price range. These are the only ones worth buying.,B01G8JO5F2
We are yet to try and test the headphones. However the bonus items mentioned in the product description are missing.,B01G8JO5F2
Only had them for a month and it’s already having trouble with staying connected to my phone. Maybe I got a bad pair?,B01G8JO5F2
"Had them about 4 months, had an issue with them. Up until then the headphones are amazing, can handle getting wet from sweat, and give a crisp sound. I work out 7 days a week in them for about an hour to 1.5 hours daily. I only charge about 1-2 times per week. They hold their charge. The issue of them not powering on was resolved by customer service on 12 hours, and I was emailed and kept in the loop about the replacement. They honored the 1 year warranty and within 12 hours of my complaint and provided prompt and courteous service. The replacement was in the mailbox within a day. The best customer service I have received in a long while compared to my other experiences. Their customer service and quality product, I would buy another pair.  They are awesome at Senso,and put the customer first.",B01G8JO5F2
These earbuds stay in place and the sound is great,B01G8JO5F2
"Sounds quality is great, comfortable, nice, solid case. Microphone is crap though. Tried using for phone calls but the other person only heard my garbled voice. Does NOT pair with a PS4, not compatible, which is why it was purchased :(",B01G8JO5F2
Liked them,B01G8JO5F2
It works only for 3 month,B01G8JO5F2
I liked how the wireless fit and the sound.,B01G8JO5F2
Only lasted 5 months. You get what you pay for I guess.,B01G8JO5F2
"Due to an unfortunate situation with these headphones and my washer/dryer I actually picked up a second pair. I really like these headphones since I travel a lot and on a plane they rock. The bass could be a little better but the noise cancelling, even without the foam ear bud pads, make up for it.",B01G8JO5F2
I enjoy the headphones sound is good and easy to sync.  For the money it is a good choice.,B01G8JO5F2
Like ease of use and sound quality.,B01G8JO5F2
"I bought several pairs of these, and on each pair, the charging port broke free from the body and is rattling around inside of the headphones. This makes the headphones, not rechargeable. I bought 2 pairs in May and both have broken. Will not re-purchase.",B01G8JO5F2
I love these headphones! They work great super comfortable and don’t fall out even while doing CrossFit style work outs from burpees to handstand holds and walks. The sound is awesome and you get so much more than what you pay for the price I will prob buy a few more pairs just to keep on hand! I found that if you like something and use it a lot get a couple while you can!,B01G8JO5F2
Have to turn the volume way up to hear the highs. Cutting out after 2 days of use. After speaking with tech support and resetting headphones the sound issue has stopped. But the volume has to be turned up way too loud to get fool range of highs and lows.,B01G8JO5F2
Battery life,B01G8JO5F2
"I love these headphones for working out or walking around the house.  This are so useful especially with an iphone so I can charge my phone and enjoy music/podcasting.  I can't wait to use these for traveling.  Some reviewers mentioned the headphones are too large;  I have a smaller head and these are perfect.  The part that wraps around the ears is totally customization, so these are perfect for any ears!  The sound quality is great, the extra accessories are great.  I would definitely recommend purchasing these.",B01G8JO5F2
dope product,B01G8JO5F2
"Great quality, nicely packaged, and exactly what you expect.",B01G8JO5F2
"Works great, I think it is water proof as well. No need for extra wires. Great sound quality. But the mic is very sensitive and has background noise/static. It picks up even my breathing sounds.",B01G8JO5F2
"Great product, easy to use and stays charged for hours!",B01G8JO5F2
I dislike the battery life,B01G8JO5F2
"Great ear buds, use them for running and reading",B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these headphones in May 2017 and they lasted till February 2019  - until one side stopped working<br />as a person who would buy new headphones every couple of months, it was wonderful<br />and as a first time user of wireless headphones, it was great!!<br />i did a lot of sweating and they stayed on very well<br />You do have to treat them with a little TLC, but its worth it.<br />One of my best buys on amazon",B01G8JO5F2
Like,B01G8JO5F2
"The plastic that goes behind the ear bends way too easily and won't stay curled up for even 1 minute. Very cheap material, not even worth $1. I don't know how this would stay in your ear while working out if it doesn't even stay on while sitting. Really heavy too. If the plastic would stay on, it would be too heavy to wear for even 5 minutes. Worst design and material I have ever seen on earbuds.",B01G8JO5F2
Not a good purchase for an adult. Maybe for a child that doesn’t care for quality.,B01G8JO5F2
I'm not the most technically intuitive person but I could not get my headphones to pair with my Mac-book air.  They paired easily with my I-Phone and the sound is great.  I'll just need two sets of earphones for my devices.  That's a little disappointing but I'm not sorry I bought these.,B01G8JO5F2
"PRO - You get some free completely unrelated crap with these headphones: card wallet (w/ adhesive to attach to phone case), extra ear plugs of various sizes and materials, and some car vent mounting accessories but none of that matters because that's not what you're looking for are you? You're looking for headphones, but whatever. Everyone loves free crap even if you probably would never want to be seen with said crap.<br />CON - The ear loops are made of play dough or something as you'll be constantly fixing them as you move around. Same with the cable management ""buttons"" that are just a little softer than the ear buds themselves. It takes very little effort for the everything to become loose and useless. What good are headphones if you can't keep them on?<br /><br />TL;DR - The loops are made of cooked spaghetti and the cable management is held together by hopes and dreams. Buy these if you don't plan on actually wearing them.",B01G8JO5F2
Pros<br />1. Good soud quality and noise cancellation<br />2. Made of good materials<br />Cons<br />1. The fit is poor and constantly need to adjust during jogging,B01G8JO5F2
"Muy útil para mí diario de trabajo se escucha bien claro me dura 11 horas y todavía con un 60% de batería, muy bueno muchas gracias complacido hasta el momento.",B01G8JO5F2
We really enjoy these earbuds. A lot cheaper than beats but I would rank it just as good in quality!,B01G8JO5F2
"Loved these for almost 2 years until they fell apart.  Not bad for a $20 item, but trying a different brand for my next ones.",B01G8JO5F2
Really liked these but stopped taking a charge after less than 6 months.,B01G8JO5F2
I bought the product about 2 months ago and all of a sudden it stopped linking to my phone. I have tried all the troubleshooting tips they mentioned in the guide but nothing seems to work.,B01G8JO5F2
Good sound Quality! Second set,B01G8JO5F2
"Great sound , super light and really cheap!",B01G8JO5F2
"Great product but no matter how I adjust them, they don't sit well in my ears. They tend to fall out a lot.",B01G8JO5F2
I bought these specifically for swimming but they do not work in the pool.  The are labeled as waterproof for up to 3 feet but this is not accurate as the sound cut off after only a few inches.,B01G8JO5F2
"These headphones are unusable. Trying to use them with amazon music on an iphone, the minimum volume setting is deafening. No way to turn volume down enough to use them. Contacted Senso and they were no help. Said to do a reset, which I did, but it makes no change.<br /><br />Trying to research this problem, it seems to be common with lower priced headphones. I will be looking for headphones that specifically say they can be adjusted to a reasonable volume when used with iphone. Buyer beware.",B01G8JO5F2
Easy to operate and sound is fine for gym and pool,B01G8JO5F2
They worked for 1 day after that they stopped working completely,B01G8JO5F2
It falls off my ears sometimes and sometimes difficult to pair with my iPhone device but either ways I like it.,B01G8JO5F2
"I needed to record audio to a slide deck course I am selling, and these headphones worked very nicely. I had to drop the blinds in my windows to lessen the reverberation of my voice, buy after doing so, the recording was great.<br />As such, not only are the ear buds good for listening, but the mic is first rate too!!!",B01G8JO5F2
Very easy to sync & the sound quality it’s very good,B01G8JO5F2
"I really loved this product until the charging light would not illuminate upon plugging it in to charge.  Of course, if the product doesn't charge, it doesn't matter how good of a sound or length of battery life the product has.",B01G8JO5F2
Lasted a week. This is my second pair first pair would not pair with my phone and now the second pair of just lasted a whole week so I've ordered I'm a different company will see how that one goes not pleased with this product at all,B01G8JO5F2
"I had bought a pair of these about 4 years ago and I loved them. I recently had to replace them, and the quality of these headphones has gone to trash. Cheap plastic, loose buttons, flimsy wire. Save your money and find another brand.",B01G8JO5F2
Using just for noise cancellation at this point and it does the job!,B01G8JO5F2
It is great for all kinds of activities in the gym and at home.  I love them.,B01G8JO5F2
Got these headphones for my wife for Christmas.  She started using them in early January and only got 4-5 uses out of them.  Was able to recharge them once and now they will not hold a charge.  Now trying to figure out if I can return them  but can't find any information on the listed 1 year warranty.  Definitely wouldn't buy them again.,B01G8JO5F2
"Great product with a low price, sound quality is good and battery is solid my only complain is the ear holder , is the rubber piece that keeps your buds in place , like every molded part  where the two molds meet during production a residue line is created and is usually never cut off properly so it a bit sharp on the ear it wont cut u but is annoying i fixed myself but still highly recommend the product very happy with it",B01G8JO5F2
Very satisfied with these,B01G8JO5F2
We were hopin it would fit into my 13 year old daughters ear. Unfortunately it did not.,B01G8JO5F2
Sounds great. Easy to get working. Finally got rid of cord tangles!,B01G8JO5F2
"I bought my first pair in summer 2017 and used them mostly for running and workouts. I bought my second pair in fall of 2017 so that I would have a set at the camper. These have held up through workouts, running, lawnmowing, etc. I really like the over the ear style, as most ear buds fall out of my ears. I just put in an order for my third pair, as I somehow cracked the plastic on one set. Pretty good for headphones that cost less than $30, as they lasted 3 1/2 years!",B01G8JO5F2
"I have tried several different brands of wireless earbuds and these are the best. They stay on your ears, are rather durable, the sound is great and the microphone is pretty good for phone calls. The customer service was great, they sent me a new pair immediately when my first pair stopped working. I would highly recommend these!",B01G8JO5F2
"Wow, greaT sound quality, has a high volume capacity, great fit and really love all the extras! Case, extra ear buds for sizing, and even cellphone car accesories. Such a great BUY!!! Most definitely understand why it was in the top 10 wireless headphones. I HAD powerbeats 3 wireless for 3 years until they died, and this would definitely compete with those ! Crazy thing is the prices is NO WHERE NEAR COMPARISON! If you are considering this purchase, search NO MORE. Awesome, super ecstatic with them, had to write review.***",B01G8JO5F2
It does not feel confortable in my ears. They don`t stay in my ear while I try to run.,B01G8JO5F2
"So at first I loved these but once I got to running and sweating the ear buds fall out my left one more than the right. Sound is great and I can Pretty far from my phone and the sound still works good. They are a little big though and fit funny on my ears, maybe I just have small ears.",B01G8JO5F2
Intend to return the earbuds-could not charge it after many attempts,B01G8JO5F2
Sound quality is good. The ear piece is a little too big so after prolonged use they start getting uncomfortable.,B01G8JO5F2
How to charge,B01G8JO5F2
I had ordered these headphone in the past - and they lasted forever.  Ordered them again.,B01G8JO5F2
"if you're working out and getting sweaty, these are not the earbuds for you",B01G8JO5F2
Have been using them at work and while working out. Great set of headphones.  Music sounds great!,B01G8JO5F2
"Since 2017, I have purchased nine of these Senso headphones. (Yes, I can back that up with my purchase history.)  I purchased so many because they've been durable and at a really great price so I recommended them to family members.  Something has changed in the manufacturing and these went from treasure to trash.  As soon as I opened my most recent order, I noticed that these headphones were ""lighter"" and not as solid as the ones I've gotten earlier.  I use the headphones often for running.  These headphones seem to ""skip"" the music every 20 seconds or so.  Really annoying. Based on moderate testing, it's because I'm swinging my arms when I run.  If I stay still or bring my iwatch closer to my head, it helps.  It's a real shame and I'm going to have to look for something else from now on.",B01G8JO5F2
"I bought them 4 months ago and loved them, they fit well in my ears and the charge lasted 2-3 workouts for me. 4 months later they stopped working completely..won't charge, won't turn on, nothing. But then again what could expect from for the price, my own fault.",B01G8JO5F2
Very Good,B01G8JO5F2
I really like these. I just bought a brand new pair after i accidentally broke my first pair. I did like the ear piece of the original pair though. The part that wraps around your ear on the new ones is moldable with wire inside which makes it harder for me to just quick slide them on. I prefer  the older ear piece.,B01G8JO5F2
"I have needed these and just didn't realize it.  It is SO great to be connected to my music and not get tangled up in a cord.  Good, clear sound and easy to use.",B01G8JO5F2
This is my second set of these headphones. I had the first set for six months and they held up well to daily use. Unfortunately they disappeared when I left them overnight at work. They do everything advertised. The only slight fault I found with the first set was the wire for the ear hook seemed a little soft. This newer set seems better in that regard.<br />Really good value for the price.,B01G8JO5F2
It works fine for three years and now it cannot be charged.,B01G8JO5F2
Nice,B01G8JO5F2
My ears are small and this was a bit uncomfortable at first but it’s ok now,B01G8JO5F2
Product just started being used but charging is taking effect.,B01G8JO5F2
"Easy to wear...wonderful sound, comfortable!",B01G8JO5F2
"The headphones sound fantastic, have great range and battery life.",B01G8JO5F2
Paired immediately and I was enjoying 5 minutes after opening box without a charge!,B01G8JO5F2
"The product is awesome!  I have hearing issues but due to the range of volume, I have no problem with hearing all the dialogue on Netflix.  FYI, I tried two other brands and they don’t come close to these.",B01G8JO5F2
I love using these headphones to jog and garden. I happen to be a person who sweats alot and these earplugs stay put! The music quality is very nice and they are easy to operate.,B01G8JO5F2
"Awesome headphones!! Stay in while I'm running, and link to Iphone easily.",B01G8JO5F2
I received these before delivery date which was nice . They came in great shap. My problem is that I can not get my Kindle Fire to link with them .  It was in the description that they were compatible with kindle Fire 7 but as yet it does. Not find the head phones.  Guess I will have to call somewhere for help,B01G8JO5F2
I enjoy running and needed a pair of headphones that would stay in/on while running around. I really like this set! I can change the ear bud to fit looser or tighter in my ear. It is flexible around the ear so I can make sure if the bud pops out the whole piece stays on my ear. The buttons are easy to use and the quality of the sound is great. No issues since I purchased a month ago.,B01G8JO5F2
"We liked it so much we bought a second pair. Great sound, easy to connect. Works great for walking or at the gym.",B01G8JO5F2
work great  sound is excellent,B01G8JO5F2
Second pair I've bought and the plastic outside pieces have fallen off both pair I own. Will not be purchasing a third or recommending this brand to anyone,B01G8JO5F2
I've had these headphones for literally 5 years and they are STILL my go to pair! They have never broken and still look and work great.  At such a low price I just bought another one to have as a travel pair! Love them.,B01G8JO5F2
Bought a pair about 3 years ago and loved them. Purchased a 2nd pair last fall and the ear loop is  NOT FORMED!!  One bends them around the are but about 3 minutes into run the  ear loop loosens and they pull off the ear.<br /><br />Total waste for running...wish I had returned them. Just them them away,B01G8JO5F2
"Very clear and noise protracted,<br />its very clear,  would recommend for ppl that like to have no other noises around,",B01G8JO5F2
Unbeatable product for the price!!!$$$,B01G8JO5F2
"Does the job! Nothing crazy nice, but they do it. C'mon, it was $30 or so",B01G8JO5F2
Great headphones this is the second pair I bought to give to a friend,B01G8JO5F2
"This Bluetooth headset is a joke. I bought it cause of the positive reviews but it’s a piece of plastic junk. There was a steady hiss coming from both ear pieces as I listened to music. The build quality seems very cheap. After 2 days normal and gentle use, the left ear piece split open as if they were put together with a very cheap glue or adhesive. I regret spending my money on these and was so angry and disappointed I just threw them in the garbage. I recommend you spend a little more money for a better quality Bluetooth headset.",B01G8JO5F2
"What I like about this headset:<br /><br />- The price is outrageously good for a pair of functional wireless earbuds.<br />- Even the low volume setting is quite loud, which is ideal if you’re running or working out in these.<br />- The sound actually improves when you figure out the right earbud fit and are able to twist/lock them in right. I’m impressed by the sound for the price.<br />- They really stay in place when you have them on; ideal for running!<br />- It comes with a keychain and a hard case, both of which are a nice quality. I love the case, it’s solid and the zipper is surprisingly well made.<br />- The wire in the back is probably not as annoying as you think. I tie it up into my ponytail when I run and it’s not noticeable in the least. Also, I can just pull them out on the go and have them hang around my neck— they’re not gonna get lost like AirPods.<br />- It connects quickly and charges quickly.<br />- Waterproof is correct because I got caught in a thunderstorm the other day and they were unaffected.<br />- People have mentioned that the connection flickers sometimes, but I’ve found the Bluetooth connectivity to be very stable.<br /><br />Some downsides:<br /><br />- The bass, if too heavy at times, muddles the sound. It is definitely not crystal clear HD sound.<br />- There’s a background fuzzy static noise when they’re on. Not noticeable when music is playing but it’s a little irritating.<br />- The battery life seems to be less than 8 hours.<br />- It’s not entirely noise cancelling. Wind especially gets really loud when running.<br />- Getting them on your ears is a tiny bit tedious, and they tend to hurt my ears after a while, so I wouldn’t recommend them for day-long use. For a workout session, or bus/bike commute perhaps.<br />- The little flap for the charger is really flimsy. I thought it was going to snap off the first time I charged it, but it hasn’t.. yet.<br /><br />They’re about as good as it’s going to get for ~$22, if you’re trying to budget. Just remember these aren’t at all high end, and for their price point, I would definitely recommend them if you want a working exercise/commuting headset. I quite like these Senso earbuds and I’m happy with my purchase. They get 5 stars because they’re overall well worth the price. But if you’ve got the money and are ok with spending more, buy more expensive ones.",B01G8JO5F2
Works better than expected. This has been my 3rd. Pair over the years. Awesome noise cancellation for loud construction environment.... they can almost double as safety plugs,B01G8JO5F2
These headphones are great! The sound quality is amazing and I like that they actually stay on your ears while running.,B01G8JO5F2
"Good value, use them daily",B01G8JO5F2
I love almost everything about these headphones. The only thing that isn’t working for me is the hooks that go over my ears. They do not stay on very well as they are too tall. Maybe this can be fixed? I’m not aware of what I can do to help that.,B01G8JO5F2
"OK, I bought two of this. The first one was two years ago. Until now that one still works find. I used it literally for every activities, particular gym and exercising. It worked so well that I decided to buy a 2nd one even though the 1st was still working. This is because I don't want to wait for charging (having two to rotate).<br />The 2nd one was bough two months ago. Within one month (under the same usage conditions), its connectivity deteriorated. Its reception is terrible within my house, particular at the spots where the first one still has perfect reception. Its audio completely lost the bass (low frequencies). Not only that, the remaining high pitch sound regularly get distorted (kind of like when you play a cassette tape in fast forward mode). I don't like chances. The first one gets 5 stars. The second one get 1 star. Average 3 stars.",B01G8JO5F2
Light weight and comfortable on your ears,B01G8JO5F2
Love the way they fit and mold to my ear. Great sounds while still letting me hear what's going on around me. Great for the gym!,B01G8JO5F2
So far so good. Had to send my first pair back. I think sweat got to them or either I got a refurbished pair. They made it right and the second pair hasn't skipped a beat. Sound is good and I can only wear them in one ear when riding my bicycle due to cancelling too much road noise. Good product for price.,B01G8JO5F2
This is my second time purchasing a pair of these headphones and live them! Great sound for the price.,B01G8JO5F2
"These headphones are great! They are of excellent quality and the sound is amazing. The battery life is great and I highly recommend them. They come with several accessories, a case, extra ear pieces and they adjust to your ears to be comfortable. Like I said, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM!",B01G8JO5F2
na,B01G8JO5F2
Love the long-lasting charge and clear sound.,B01G8JO5F2
"I like everything about these ear buds comfort,sound and the battery life is the longest I’ve ever had. They last 10 hrs or more. I listen to books on my kindle. I would recommend this item to anyone. This is my 2nd pair they have a great warranty so if something happens they replace them.",B01G8JO5F2
"I had to return, they did not fit my ears and they fell off easily.",B01G8JO5F2
I here wind noise,B01G8JO5F2
Very good product and a good price.,B01G8JO5F2
Adequate for audio books and use with your cell phone.  Easy to pair and simple to use.,B01G8JO5F2
These horrible earbuds stopped working within several days of delivery. Literally just went dead. I spent 30 mins on the phone w tech support and didn’t find a solution.<br />Strong recommendation to avoid purchasing this product.,B01G8JO5F2
perfect!!,B01G8JO5F2
"I bought these to connect to my laptop because it's SO aggravating to deal with my corded ear buds while moving around. They are very well made, the sound quality was excellent BUT they keep disconnecting from my laptop. I tried connecting them to my phone to use while I work out and I'm having the same issue. No matter how good the sound quality, if they won't stay connected, they are useless to me. I will probably give these away as I ended up buying a pair of wireless earbuds from",B01G8JO5F2
I use mine while working out everyday. They fit well. They don't move or come out or off the ear easily.<br />I really enjoy them.,B01G8JO5F2
"The headphones have been working wonderfully for the last 2 years, but they just would not turn on now.",B01G8JO5F2
I have to agree with sooo many of the other reviewers here. I couldn't go outside with these headphones and you would continuously lose the connection with any movement. I wanted to use these as my workout headphones as I already have a pair of over the ear Sony headphones for everything else I do and I absolutely love those so I know it's not my phone or any other problem. But these Sensos !!?? I guess you get what you pay for but they are absolutely awful...,B01G8JO5F2
"+ Easy to turn on. Easy to pair to IPhone.<br /><br />- For some reason, I do not seem to get them to stay all the way inside the ear. As the headphone moves out the quality of the base suffers. You end up with a lot of treble, little base. I'll give them more time to get use to them.",B01G8JO5F2
"Price, sound",B01G8JO5F2
Great price for a great product. Super fast shipping! I was leery of ordering these. I ordered different ones from a different company and was completely disappointed. But these were a pleasant surprise. They charged quickly and held the charge! The sound quality was excellent too. I highly recommend.,B01G8JO5F2
"I like these headphones, they sound good, battery life is good, I would buy again, but the manufacturer needs to change to a more resilient wire between the two ear pieces. I have had the outer layer of insulation break open and expose the inner wires, now in four paces. I'm able electro-mechanically, so have installed heatshrink tubing over the cracked part, all was fine until a year or 18 months later the insulation cracked again at new positions. So I fixed that again. Good headphones but expect the outer insulation to go bad.",B01G8JO5F2
The charging port fell out of the unit just after the return window.,B01G8JO5F2
Easy set up and great sound. Good battery life.,B01G8JO5F2
These are excellent earbuds and a fantastic price.  I appreciate the super quick delivery; these are excellent!,B01G8JO5F2
I've purchased a few pairs of the sesno ear buds throughout the years. The quality has taken a major hit. Nowhere near as loud and the sound quality is way down.,B01G8JO5F2
These are great. Love the extra ear buds. Easy to adjust volume and Comfortable.,B01G8JO5F2
Can mold to fit my ears and stays in when buds would fall out,B01G8JO5F2
"These headphones are perfect for the gym and my daily life. They stay on perfectly during my workouts and I love that they are waterproof. Can't beat it for the price point either.<br /><br />I did have one issue with them, but their customer service was quick to make it right.",B01G8JO5F2
I really like these headphones. Super easy to control.  I find them pretty comfortable as well,B01G8JO5F2
I use them for bicycling and weight training and the sound is excellent. Also they work great for weight training as the last pair I had kept falling off and it hasn't happened at all with these. Definitely would recommend them.,B01G8JO5F2
"Used these for about six months, running every other day.  Stayed in, sounded fine, didn't get disconnected, but they just died.  I expected more!",B01G8JO5F2
My son loves them! he said they were comfortable and sounded great! Thanks so much for the quick delivery!,B01G8JO5F2
"Bought 2 the s250's in Feb of 2018. Here we are in August of 2019 and both pair still perform flawlessly! My husband listens to audio books all day at work, 5 days a week. About 4 months ago, his battery began only holding 6 hours of charge instead of 8... but hell, they were over a year old at that point. My pair are used for a couple hours at a time for Pandora mostly, while I tend to my yard. I drip sweat like crazy while mowing, weed eating, washing the cars, pulling weeds, etc. They never slip and never fail me. Can't hear anything but the music, either. I prefer the foam ear covers because I have really small ear canals, and even the smallest set of silicone ones would make my ear ache after an hour. My husband prefers the medium silicone ones. I also us the buds as my hamds-free for the car a couple times a week. Sound is crisp, clear, and loud. I recommend only putting in 1 while in the car so you can still listen for emergency vehicles. All in all, these ear buds are still in excellent condition after a year and a half. However, I will be upgrading because they didn't have blue yet when we bought ours. If you need a great, durable set(I have 4 kids) for a great price, definitely get these.<br /><br />My only con is that the metal plate for your phone to magnetized to the dashboard has some real weak and crappy adhesive. Get you some gorilla glue!",B01G8JO5F2
"These headphones have been great to me. I have worked in harsh outdoor conditions daily in them for months at a time. I have used these to workout and run over the 18 months or so I have had them. They sound great in my opinion. I have dropped them scratched them up and abused them. I used them throughout school heading back and forth from campus whether biking, boarding, walking or running. If I were to lose these or they broke I would absolutely buy them again. Cannot beat them for the price. I have gotten more than my moneys worth on these. The battery seems to last a long time too and hasn't been getting shorter from what I can tell.",B01G8JO5F2
"for what i need them for ,i have no complains...",B01G8JO5F2
"Son loved them, had them for almost 3 yrs. Until he ripped on off the wire. But get the warranty they replaced, credited us with out questionm",B01G8JO5F2
"This was my second set. The first set died unexpectedly and I figured it was something I did, so my husband got me a pair for Christmas. Here we are in June and those died also.<br />This set suddenly wouldn’t hold a charge. They will charge and work for one workout, but the next time I use them, they are dead. Total crap. Disappointed because I liked being cordless. I’m looking for suggestions for brands that last longer than 5 months.",B01G8JO5F2
‘Twas a good pick. Using them daily and will continue to for all gym workouts.,B01G8JO5F2
They won't turn on.  I've done all the trouble shooting with no luck.,B01G8JO5F2
"I have bought two pairs of these headphones. Not because the first one failed, but because I love them so much that I want to have a safety pair! Great sound, great quality. The stability of the ear hooks is a little loose but still good",B01G8JO5F2
I got these for my girlfriend so she can use these to make calls while driving and they are perfect. Great sound quality for her and great microphone quality as well.,B01G8JO5F2
For the price these headphones are great. The sound quality is good & the features are the same as any other  high end wireless headphones. Battery life is long. Comes in a cute zip pouch. The only CONS: don’t like the flexible ear part.,B01G8JO5F2
Super pleased with the quality of these headphones. The battery seems to last forever. Easy to use and nice sound!,B01G8JO5F2
"100% satisfied and happy with this purchase, everything is great..... I liked the feeling on my ears and the quality of the sound and the charging time and the batteries life and the Bluetooth coverage area as well.",B01G8JO5F2
The sound from the Bluetooth is top notch and still working,B01G8JO5F2
"Great sound, battery life & price.",B01G8JO5F2
"best headphones I've ever had, sound quality is awesome, very comfortable in the ear and love the feature when a call comes in tells u the number, highly recommend this product!",B01G8JO5F2
"Didn’t work while swimming, then stopped working altogether.",B01G8JO5F2
"I love these earbuds! The volume control is easy, the volume is amazing, the bass is awesome! Unfortunately, I only gave it four stars because I purchased them in February and as of October, the left ear went out ☹️... BUT I'm going to purchase a new pair because I really love the comfort of the ear hooks on my little bitty ears- not to mention the quality of the bass and volume. I highly recommend these. Hopefully, I don't have the same problem with the new pair. 🤞",B01G8JO5F2
I give it 4 stars because one of the covers came off after a few uses and continues to pop off,B01G8JO5F2
I bought this product before and was very happy with it. I use it daily while driving and job sites. After a year the battery started failing so ordered again. 1 month into use the answer button broke. I have to use the phone to make call then can use device. Also I did not notice this was the older model from the one I had. I will pay more attention on next order.,B01G8JO5F2
My headline says it all. I've been using them for more than 4 months with any problem.,B01G8JO5F2
"What piece of junk! It's good when it works - sounds great during my workouts and long runs. BUT the headphones completely died after only like 10 uses. They no longer power on. Even tried charging them thinking they ran out of battery but nope... DEAD. If you want cheap short lived headphones that only last after a few uses, then these are for you. You really do get what you pay for with these.",B01G8JO5F2
"Definitely the provides the most (in this case) ""boom for your buck"". The sound quality is amazing for how inexpensive these headphones are. No problem with battery life. Gets plenty loud enough. If I lost or broke these today, I'd buy another pair, no questions asked!",B01G8JO5F2
"Look I know I can be hard on my headphones it's why I went with bluetooth headphones in the first place wires are my nemesis. When my first pair broke I knew it was my fault. Then I lost the second pair, I still have the third pair and they work, gifted the fourth, however the last two who boy. The fifth and sixth pairs both broke in the exact same way. They just stopped charging. I have told so many people about these headphones. I can't believe I did. The fact that the warranty is a joke and they keep telling me I need to reset them. Sorry that doesn't work they won't turn on or charge anymore. I won't be rebuying or telling people about them again. At least not until they can figure out how to actually make their warranty worth it. Ordered May 2018, broken by September 2018; ordered October 2018 broken by January 2019 lasted less than 6 months for each pair.",B01G8JO5F2
They really reduce the nois,B01G8JO5F2
I liked the way it sounded and easy to operate. Also very reasonable in price. I use them at work and home.,B01G8JO5F2
"Latest Update: I sent the company a note via their website's ""support"" tab. They replied quickly with a procedure to reset the product. It did not work. I emailed them to let them know. They sent me another pair in about 5 days. That's great customer service in my estimation. I hope this pair performs for a longer period of time.<br />______________<br /><br />First Update: After a good experience (see original review below) for 6 months, the right side has now failed. The controls still work but the volume is about 5% of the left one. Being vigilant about taking care of them is not enough; I did that and still they need to be trashed in 6 months. No longer recommended. Very disappointing.<br />______________<br /><br />Original review: I've purchased expensive (>$100) wired earphones for years, being overly concerned about sound quality. This is my first pair of Bluetooth earphones and I'm almost shocked not only at the sound quality at this price level, but how well they fit. I've gone running with them and used them at the gym for several days and find them to be excellent. On the gym floor, I'll get occasional, momentary dropouts since there are often another 30 people running Bluetooth signals all around. Except for that, these are highly recommended. Note: it too me several days to get the cord between them just right (cable management clips are included). Battery life is also impressive. So far, it's been about 7-8 hours for me. Highly recommended.",B01G8JO5F2
"Pros:<br />-Good volume<br />-Adjustable earhooks, three different size eartips<br />-Easy setup<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Clarity leaves something to be desired<br />-Buttons are pretty loud when they're next to your ears.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting a whole lot from these headphones; they're $30 after all.<br /><br />The sound quality is... acceptable. Nothing more, nothing less. The clarity leaves something to be desired, but it's good enough for the gym. The volume is much louder than you'd think, so unless you're already hard of hearing, I'd recommend keeping it pretty low to start out with. I'm pretty sure they don't have an active noise cancelling function, but the volume takes care of that on its own.<br /><br />They stay in my ears well enough, and the earhooks are adjustable, which is a nice feature. They also come with three different size eartips, so they should fit most people without an issue. I will say that the buttons are extremely loud/clicky when they're in your ears, so beware of that.<br /><br />Overall, for $30 headphones, the sound quality is about what you'd expect, maybe a little better. The fit and adjustability is clearly better, though.",B01G8JO5F2
Durable good quality,B01G8JO5F2
"I've had these for nearly 3 years,  the sound quality is about what you'd expect for such a cheap product: bassy but muddy. Passable. But the battery life,  wow. 3 years on using them almost every day at work and i still get a full 8 hour day on a single charge.  Don't know if i just got lucky or what,  but for under $25 that's an incredible value.",B01G8JO5F2
Raving reviews for earbuds/headphones on Amazon have no been very accurate for me. I think most of the people posting reviews about sound quality haven't had nice ear buds!,B01G8JO5F2
Great sound and cheap price...,B01G8JO5F2
My wife has bought two of these headphones for me.  The first one a few years ago and used them religiously mowing grass and while working at my full time job.  The amount of battery life was good wished it was longer but they were good.  However the second set she bought me were horrible quality.  I think dollar tree has better wireless headphones.  First thing that happened when trying to switch the different ear bud size I popped the speaker off the headphone figured it was designed to do this to clean it better.  Should of been my first warning.  So I grab the included charger wire and plug it in no issue the light turns red.  However I noticed the light went out completely.  Checked the charger and it had completely broke inside the headphones making it now useless as it wouldn't even charge.  And to finish the icing the other ear piece came out completely to the point the wire stripped lose.  Absolutely garbage quality control.  She is sending it back for full refund and I supplied the 1 star review.  Guess it's time to find a better product.,B01G8JO5F2
"Product worked fine for 3 months.  They are not great headphones but they worked for what I needed.  After 3 months they stopped taking a full charge.  They will charge just enough to use and then within minutes I receive a repeated ""battery low"" message.",B01G8JO5F2
"Mine broke after about six months, so I emailed Senso directly and at 10:30pm on a Friday night, they spent no more than 15 minutes responding to every email I sent and their customer service was the best I’ve ever seen. They’re sending me new ones because I have a one year warranty, but I was expecting this to take at least a week to get a response. It was incredible and I would recommend these earbuds and this service to everyone.",B01G8JO5F2
Stopped working after 3 weeks power button stuck,B01G8JO5F2
Awsome wireless earbuds! Amazing sound quality! love it!,B01G8JO5F2
"I had a pair of these for years and I am returning to buy them again after my dog chewed up my previous pair. Great sound quality, comfortable and pliable material to fit your ear, acceptable battery life and bluetooth range. Definitely recommend.",B01G8JO5F2
Enjoyed them very much on my runs.,B01G8JO5F2
It’s been 2 years and they are still going. What more can I say. They have a great sound. The ear puffs get hard after a while but you can always buy new ones.,B01G8JO5F2
I am using the headphones while I am walking on my treadclimber. I watch my ipad to help keep me motivated while I am working out. I like the fact that  there is no loose wire to get caught up. The sound quality is  good too.  I would recommend them to others for the quality and price.,B01G8JO5F2
Bought these for my husband to take to the gym.  He loves them and thinks they sound great!,B01G8JO5F2
"One of the best-sounding headsets I've ever owned.  Lightweight and durable, and every bit the quality and sound of some of the more expensive brands.  Very happy I made the choice to go with these Senso Headphones.  They're PERFECT at the gym, too!",B01G8JO5F2
"Sound great, fit great and they stay on/in my ears.  Really appreciate the soft &#34;ear holders.&#34;  Would recommend them for anyone.",B01G8JO5F2
"So these don't always stay as tight in my ears as I would like, but they hold better than most earbuds and the sound is fantastic.",B01G8JO5F2
Comfortable to wear and the battery can generally make it through my work day.,B01G8JO5F2
"I love these headphones, they have great sound for the money, a definite WOW!!!",B01G8JO5F2
"I love these things, all wireless/Bluetooth audio devices have their short comings but I find these to be the most reliable I have ever crossed paths with. The Customer service with one small delivery problem that was not their fault was so far above and beyond, it defies description. Honesty and integrity like we all dream of getting! When they wear out or break, I will definitely buy another pair if available still, if not I will purchase whatever they have developed to replace them with. Highly recommend and will by more for myself if I ever need to!<br />I was not compensated in any way to review these, I payed full price, regular Joe customer!<br />Cheers, Motorhead!",B01G8JO5F2
"I would definitely recommend this product and I would buy them again. I’ve had them for a few months and I am impressed with how long the charge stays on. I also enjoy the feature that if you don’t have any sound coming through the headphones they will automatically turn off to reserve your battery after a period of time.  I was mainly looking for headphones that I could use when I do water  aerobics , light swimming, or just walking the pool they have gotten wet and they have held up just fine.  I have not fully submerged these underwater but they serve the purpose that I bought them for",B01G8JO5F2
nice product... good sound and battery,B01G8JO5F2
"I have had mine for about a month now and enjoy them while listening to music but while on calls, for some reason the calls drop back to the iPhone?? Other than that issue good Bluetooth. And a lot cheaper than the Beats",B01G8JO5F2
Great sound and easy to connect.,B01G8JO5F2
"Girlfriend bought these for me back in May. I use these when I go to the gym and right when I first turned them on I wasn’t impressed with the sound quality. I’ve had cheaper bluetooth headphones that sound way better. But, I kept using them since I didn’t have another pair. I noticed that the range was poor. I couldn’t go past 6 feet without it cutting out. Then during my workout the music would cut out during my workout after awhile. I think it has something todo with the wiring or when I’m drenched in sweat. Not very waterproof I guess. Overall I’d recommend saving your money and buying a cheaper version.",B01G8JO5F2
So far so good! I gave these a shot after all the glowin reviews and the exceptional customer service. The box has all kinds of extra goodies. Even a magnet for the phone to attach to a car vent clip. I’ll be putting these through the ringer as I work in landscaping. I’ll post an update soon to tell how they hold up.,B01G8JO5F2
"These are my first wireless earphones.  Love the convenience.  For the price, I can't imagine the sound any better than with these.  Not a big fan of the design, though.<br />On and off switch convenient.  I can hear on the phone just fine.  They do cancel out outside noise pretty well.",B01G8JO5F2
"I was looking forward to using those, based on reviews. The sound is truly amazing, better than my Beats 3. Sadly I encountered a few problems in the first 5 min. 1- The bluetooth connectivity disconnected & the music blared from my iPhone 7. 2- The main part of the ear piece (black/red) is so heavy it kept falling out. 3- The over-the-ear part is super soft & as light as a rubber band, therefore not helping with the second issue :(",B01G8JO5F2
the amount of sound i get out of these is crazy. i use the foam ear ends- and it blocks out a lot.,B01G8JO5F2
"Awesome sound, no wires, easy pairing,  What more could you ask? Oh, and the price is phenomenal.",B01G8JO5F2
"These headphones sound really good. The bass is just right, I can hear instruments I never noticed in songs. I wear them at night to listen to rainstorms to help me sleep and in the evenings to dance around (my new form of exercise). I highly recommend these to those who do not have hundred to spend on quality wireless headphones. I am still experimenting with the extra ear sizes but that does not detract from the sound from this set of headphones. You should not be disappointed.",B01G8JO5F2
"I  ordered 2 pair for a mc ride to Memphis on my Harley. My son is very happy, but I could not hear.  Not loud enough.  Otherwise worked well.",B01G8JO5F2
I do enjoy this product. I purchased one for me and one for the wife.  I gave this product a try and the sound is perfect and awesome and a perfect match for my cell phone.  The issue that I do not like is when I try and do my Bench press workout it falls out of my ears and while I’m focus and enjoying my heavy lifting with some awesome sounds they just fall out and this is very distracting and do not like.  I’ve tried the other eartips and nothing seems to keep them from falling out with I lie down and do Bench press.  Help with this issue are suggestions would be needed.  Thanks.,B01G8JO5F2
"These are the best Bluetooth earset I have ever used. They sound great, have very good battery life 8+ hours of continuous use listening to audio books, they pair up instantly with my iPhone, and my Apple TV. The people I talk to on the iPhone tell me I sound great. The fact they are very comfortable for long period of wear is frosting on the cake.",B01G8JO5F2
These are the 3rd style of 'budget' earphones I've tried.  These I'm keeping!!  They are very comfortable. The sound is really great with strong bass and clear midrange and highs.  They feel and sound like a much more expensive pair of earphones.,B01G8JO5F2
Great sound!!!!!!,B01G8JO5F2
"I was about to spend $150 for a pair of name brand wireless headphones when I found these listed on Amazon.  They had great reviews and were much less expensive.  I got them to use during gym workouts and they perform fantastically.  They stay in my ears, handle the sweat and workout vibrations, provide sound that seems perfect to me.  I can hardly believe I was about to spend so much more on another brand when these work perfect.",B01G8JO5F2
These are awesome... i love them.,B01G8JO5F2
"So far, these are great! Sound quality is good, and the controls are easy to understand. Love that they came with a case and multi port charger- way to think ahead!<br /><br />They stay on my ears even when I'm upside down, so definitely worth the purchase.",B01G8JO5F2
"These were just what I was looking for.  They stay put, have great sound quality and a nice case to keep them in when they're not in use.",B01G8JO5F2
"These are very comfortable but, they lose the connection very quickly on any devices I have paired.",B01G8JO5F2
"I am not an audiophile. These sound really good. My only qualm is that the part that goes in your ear that it came with, while pretty comfy, reminded me of earplugs. They had visible ear wax on them after about a week of use. I make a normal amount of ear wax, in case you're curious :) The ones I replaced them with really are not as comfortable. After about an hour my ears a sore.",B01G8JO5F2
"I'm someone who usually just uses whatever headphones come with my phone but I finally decided it was time to get a higher quality set, and I'm glad I chose these! The sound quality is amazing, I was able to hear parts of songs I didn't even know were there before. They're a little bulky but still really comfortable (I have several ear peircing like my tragus and cartilage and these don't bother them at all). My only complaint is that it took a while for them to pair with my phone and I had to do a bit of finagling, but I finally got them working. Great purchase overall!",B01G8JO5F2
"Awesome wireless earbuds for the price. They feel uncomfortable after about 1 1/2 hours but other than that, they're great!",B01G8JO5F2
"Work as explained, great sound and noise cancelling",B01G8JO5F2
"I regret this purchase. The sound of these earphones is a mess. It sounds like listening to music underwater. I was excited because of the features, but it was a huge let down once I got them and listened to my music. These might be great for a kid who just wants something that looks cool. They’d probably think they sound great also. But you can’t trick my ears. What a mess.",B01G8JO5F2
"These are a good value and sound great for the price, however they began to constantly drop the Bluetooth, and it tells you &#34; disconnected&#34; and then &#34;connected&#34;. It is getting annoying. It had been to months and I have an iPhone 7+., to clarify - it disconnects when my phone is in my hand or in my pocket and the headphones are on my ears.",B01G8JO5F2
Comfortable and great sound.,B01G8JO5F2
Great sound great fit and great price.  Very easy to pair. Highly recommend and seller was very helpful.,B01G8JO5F2
"Nice headgear.  Comes with a lot of extras.  Sound is way above average and basses are clear.  Well priced for this quality Bluetooth headset.  I agree with the other reviewers.  These are  not a $200 headphones,  but for the price, a solid buy.  5 stars at this price point.",B01G8JO5F2
Love these headphones.  Sound is great and the price is very reasonable.,B01G8JO5F2
"Fast delivery.  Quick and easy pairing.<br /><br />Comfort: flexible rings that sit outside the ear.  The inserts inside the ear are not flexible and are a bit uncomfortable.<br /><br />Sound: listening to podcasts, music, or audiobooks have clear and decent sound levels.  Phone calls are also clear talking or listening.<br /><br />Volume control: seems hit or miss.  It’s worked once.  And not since then.  Will recheck instructions but don’t see how up or down can be this complicated.  I can turn up or down volume on phone for volume preferences but without ability to control via earpiece is frustrating.<br /><br />Battery life: I’ll include recharge cords.  Two are included plus adapter for car. With all the options have yet to run out of battery power.  Longest continuous use 4.5 hours.  And while I can’t see a level of power it was still playin fine.<br /><br />Compact carrier: I bought this version instead of the newer one because of the carrier.  And I do like it.  A firm carrier with space for cords and the earbuds.  Zippers close.  Safely tumbles in my purse or backpack with no problems.<br /><br />Overall- this is a great value for the price.  I’ve had it less than 2 weeks and it does what I need for the most part and it was a great price.  A friend had this version and recommended.  I’ve since recommended it to others.",B01G8JO5F2
They are very nice. I can't keep them in my ears but I haven't found a pair yet that I can.<br />But the design is very nice.,B01G8JO5F2
Big and bulky. Look ridiculous. No noise cancellation. No volume controls. The Anker Sound Buds Slim are a whole lot better.,B01G8JO5F2
some connectivity issues with drops could be a faulty pair but sound great for the money,B01G8JO5F2
"I purchased these to replace a near identical set that had a different name, but they are all China made so no big surprise. Tried them for the first time yesterday and they worked the same as well. They shipped fast in a fancy box with a few extra free items I don't know if I will use. The last ones lasted almost 2 years, hopefully these will do at least that well. They sound good and are comfortable to wear. I will report back if any issues develop.",B01G8JO5F2
"Just what I was looking for. Secure on the ear, comfortable and long battery life. All my other Bluetooth headphones only last 4 hours before need to recharge. This one is good for 8 hours. Recommend this product!<br /><br />Knocked off one star for the inability to connect the 3 feet charging cable (tips anyone?). And the headphones don't fit well in the carrying case.",B01G8JO5F2
AMAZING customer service! Great product!!,B01G8JO5F2
I would give it a five star if it had extra features like voice notification when the battery is low vs looking for the ligh. The other feature missing is the reverse or fast forward unless I don't know about it yet. The sound is great and the bass is good. I use this for my gym and walking/hiking activities. So far it fits well and barely notice its on my ears. For the price I would recommend.,B01G8JO5F2
"Had high hopes for these, but they are really lacking. It loses connection..<br /><br />The wrap aspect is just &#34;decoration&#34; as they are basically held in wit the cushion in the ear.<br /><br />If you move, you lose the sound, or the stereo effect.<br /><br />Definitely would not buy again.<br /><br />I waited to post this review, hoping I could get the right fit, but didnt happen.",B01G8JO5F2
Absolutely love them. Stay in my ears at the gym. Long battery life,B01G8JO5F2
Love these! Great sound for phone and music plus they’re easy to set up and easy to use.,B01G8JO5F2
"These headphones would have gotten 5 stars, however from time to time they do cut in & out without disconnecting. Other than that issue, they are comfortable, easy to use, light & the noise cancellation does work with our high NM winds. Great value for the money.",B01G8JO5F2
They are great nice and clear,B01G8JO5F2
Absolutely love it!,B01G8JO5F2
I like them a lot. No issues so far. Great fit with small buds. I like that it comes with 3 sizes of ear buds. Easy to use. Great sound. Great price. I'm all for small businesses so  I wish you great success. I will s probably get another set down the road for a gift. Thanks,B01G8JO5F2
These are great!!!,B01G8JO5F2
"These are very high quality earbuds, well worth the money. Remember to charge the fully before using so you can get the optimal playback time. High Fidelity sound and Excellent Workmanship. Has a nice embossed hard-shell type zipper case with 1 flat wire USB charger cord and 1 shorter USB charger cord. Includes different sized buds to adapt to your ears. No problem pairing them with my new phone either. Buy these before you go and spend a lot of money on something more expensive.",B01G8JO5F2
"Great sound! Comfortable! Easy to use! I liked the first pair so well I bought a second.<br /><br />I am adding to my review to say superb customer support as well. The on/off button stopped working on one set, and I contacted Senso. Within hours (at night) they responded and immediately said they would send a replacement pair. Amazon just notified me that they have been shipped and will arrive in two days. Thank you, Senso!",B01G8JO5F2
"Very pleased with this product.  If you are expecting audiophile sound do not look to find it with these. If you want great quality and an excellent price with adequate music reproduction.......ear buds for doing yard work, running or working out at the gym you can not go wrong.",B01G8JO5F2
"Sorry I am returning this product. I can't keep them on my ears. They fall off. I haven't even got to connect to music , what's the use when I can't wear them.",B01G8JO5F2
"These headphones are great! I use them every single day. Good sound, GREAT bass tones. I listen to a lot of EDM so the bass is an important feature. They pair easily, I've never had a problem with them. The earpieces are good quality. I use the squishy ones and wash them weekly and they are still holding up really well.",B01G8JO5F2
Nope. Don’t don’t do it. Decently made but sounds like garbage. Buy the Anker brand.,B01G8JO5F2

"GREAT Wireless Earphones. Got them on Saturday, they synced to my iPhone within seconds, put on my Apple Watch listened to music while doing yard work. Good sound long lasting charge and a very good price. Love these earphones",B01G8JO5F2
"These are great. Only 4 starts because once in a while mine drop out (lose connection) and you have to do a hard reset, which is easy and only takes a minute. I like them for the price. Bought my wife a pair. She loves them. They don’t compare to high end headphones, but at this price, that’s not a surprise. Have had them for about 4 months. Wear mine to the gym 3-5 times a week. I also like functionality, when you turn on, the audio cue in headphones tells you they are on, then connected or disconnected.",B01G8JO5F2

I am not sure if this is due to the fact that I also have the Fitbit charge using the Bluetooth. I will disconnect it on my next run and see if the situation improves and let you guys know.",B01G8JO5F2
If you are looking for a low priced semi-decent sound quality BT earbuds then give them a try.  After years of running with wires I decided to give wireless a try.  Set up was easy and I had no problems with connectivity.  The problem soles im with the sound. They have WAY too much bass for me and not nearly enough trebile. Unfortunately there isn't a way to adjust this. For some it might be ok but for me I'm going to have to spend the extra $$ on a better pair. Hope this helps steer some of you in the right direction!,B01G8JO5F2
These headphones are great.  Came with lots of accessories and a nice case.  Sound is good.  Pairing with my phone was a breeze.,B01G8JO5F2
The music sounds perfect thru these headphones. The bass is rich and the higher tones meld well and do not sound tinny. They fit securely in the ear and the soft earbuds make for a comfortable fit. I would highly recommend these headphones .,B01G8JO5F2
"This is my first Bluetooth headset.  They are easy to pair with Droid Turbo 2.  The music sound is great quality.  I had a problem getting the phone audio to work, but after rebooting phone it works great. They are very light, and feel comfortable on the ears, even with reading glasses on.  The accessories are great, especially for car charging.  The case is great quality.  There is no wall plug for charging, so have to use a device with USB port.  My laptop charged them within 30 minutes. I haven't had a chance to evaluate the sound during a long run in wet and windy conditions, yet.  Overall, I am very happy with the (indoor) sound quality and value for money.",B01G8JO5F2
"I was very skeptical about the quality of sound the Bluetooth earbuds would have. I was totally amazed how clean and clear the sound is. As a musician, I am very impressed of the sound.<br />Thank you",B01G8JO5F2
Good sound. Flimsy ear grips and bad mic. Mic picks up too much background noise.,B01G8JO5F2
They are well put together and easy to connect to your phone. They have great sound and are comfortable. I would buy them again for sure ... great for running and road marching.,B01G8JO5F2
"""Sounds great. Nice case and supplied car holder and a cc wallet""",B01G8JO5F2
lets just say we liked them enuf to order another set for another vehicle!,B01G8JO5F2
Sound is great!! Easy to setup and use..<br />Charge is fast and last long!!,B01G8JO5F2
Headphones come with a lot of extras. They work and sound great. Noise cancellation technology is amazing.  The sound is equivalent if not better to my wife's JBL headphones.,B01G8JO5F2
"No bad quality. Most of the price must have to do with all the extras you get. Cigarette lighter dual outlet with next gen iPhone charger and Android adapter, a few sizes in buds, mini usb charge cord, and anti tangle contraption.",B01G8JO5F2
I am pleasantly surprised with the quality of my new headphones. they were easy to sync and the sound is great. I recommend them to anyone.,B01G8JO5F2
"Dollar for dollar a true bargain! The search has not been easy to find great headphones, from the over priced beats version of wireless to jaybirds. I have been amazed. I enjoy the fit the sound, even the carrying case. This will become my go to birthday gift!",B01G8JO5F2
"These Bluetooth headphones were great when I got them in Feb. But two months later (today) and using them the same way I always use them (for running) they just died. I thought first they were just out of charge, but I had just taken them off the charger this morning. I put them on the charger when I got home and no light came on and I tried switching the outlet and nothing worked. I'm outside the return window, but I'm not recommending these headphones because two months lifespan isn't worth the purchase price!",B01G8JO5F2
Bought As a gift.... love it,B01G8JO5F2
"Love these! Sound quality is great, and material is lightweight. Cannot beat this quality for the price point they're offered at. Added benefit is that they can connect to multiple devices at the same time, perfect for smart watches.",B01G8JO5F2
I got this for my daughter she likes them but wish you could adjust then size of the ear piece.  She stated it seems a little big for her ears but she does like the quality of sound and that it comes with a case.,B01G8JO5F2
Everything ok!,B01G8JO5F2
Great headphones for a great price. I use them 4-5 times a week for the past several months without issue.,B01G8JO5F2
"They seemed great, connected easily but sadly the one I got does not work properly. The - button does not function correctly, I can't turn the volume down or go the previous track. The + does work so it's definitely a factory problem.",B01G8JO5F2
"Overall good value. Stay connected, , clear calls, good sound  and are reasonably priced. My only minor issue in the first week was when they let you know the battery was low, you have about 1min. I would have like them to have finished my workout. Not a big deal  moving forward, I'll just charge them sooner.",B01G8JO5F2
"The sound is great for these, but the part that goes in your ear is a little bulky. I don't know if I have smaller ears than most, but I usually have to readjust a few times when I run to keep them in place. Otherwise the sound and voice are great.",B01G8JO5F2
The sound is 8/10 but it works very good.,B01G8JO5F2
Always fall out of my ears. Useless!,B01G8JO5F2
Great option for the price. They connection well to blue tooth. Good quality sound. Fit comfortably for biking. I have not used them running yet.,B01G8JO5F2
The battery life is terrible. It has to be charged every 2 hours. If I ever buy any wireless again it won’t be Senso brand wireless.,B01G8JO5F2
"Bought these as a gift for my husband and he loves them! Great, quick service. Thank you!",B01G8JO5F2
great deal,B01G8JO5F2
"They stay in the ear, that was a problem with others. The sound is unbelievable great, if you turned them up to full volume it would blow your head off. I use them with my Galaxy s7 and they work great.  Don't buy a cheap pair you will retreat it.",B01G8JO5F2
Good for the price. Easy to use and fine battery life.,B01G8JO5F2
great headphones comes with lots extras for the money,B01G8JO5F2
"Loved the look and fit of these, but when I tried listening to hip-hop...the bass was by far the worst I've ever experienced in earbuds.  I tried multiple artists, multiple albums, played around with the volume control and equalizer within my iPhone, couldn't get anything but fuzzy, blown out bass sounds but without the low end.  I then played it through my sound bar and was like, oh yeah that's what bass is supposed to sound like.  Then tried through my laptop speakers and it was significantly better than these too.  These are just awful for bass tones, unlistenable.  I'll keep searching for a good pair of bluetooth buds.",B01G8JO5F2
Great sound and for a guy that sweats they stay in place and the sounds doesn't distort. A fraction of the cost of VERY expensive branded headphones and work equally as good.,B01G8JO5F2
After almost 3 months of use I felt I had enough time with the product to write a thorough review. It's OK. Slowly starts to feel like the ear buds are falling apart. There is interrupted blue tooth connectivity. The bass isn't as great as other reviews seemed to suggest.<br /><br />One side has completely stopped working as well.<br /><br />The control side earbud is much heavier than the other side causing there to be unbalanced fit. Can fall out when jogging.<br /><br />I think there are equivalent or better wireless headphones for a lower price.,B01G8JO5F2
Really fast delivery! Really good fit. Very good sound. Great for activities(mowing the lawn......)!,B01G8JO5F2
Just received my headphones and used them this morning  working out and loved them.  Sound was clear and comfortable in my ears.  Great product.  Thank you!!,B01G8JO5F2
Quite surprised and happy with this little but powerful headphone set. Light and comfortable and the sound quality is great! Keep up the good work!,B01G8JO5F2
Like to the point I'm leaning toward a return. So spoiled by the battery duration of my Monster Hesh 2 Over-The-Ears but super weak batteries on these... I tested. Wanted to see what I was working with so gave them a full charge and popped them on for a full day at the computer. 7hours before the annoying voice other reviewers mentioned started. And would not stop. 12 completely unenjoyable minutes later they were done. Brand new and 7 hours 12 minutes of life? That will only get shorter with time. 2 stars because honestly sound quality is acceptable for working out. I wish the pieces that hook round your earlobes were adjustable as they stick out slightly. Come w/a  lot of nice little gadget accessories (kinda useless to me)  I got them for working out and now I'm bummed.,B01G8JO5F2
good sound quality.good packaging...seems made to last...<br />had some question but excellent support and personal touch provided by the company on resolving the issues/concerns of mine.<br /><br />so far happy to use these...,B01G8JO5F2
Very good sound at a reasonable price.,B01G8JO5F2
Good bluetooth headphones. Good for exercising. Decent sound.,B01G8JO5F2
Love these headphones and the price is fabulous!,B01G8JO5F2
Excellent for the $,B01G8JO5F2
